###Chapter 1

The neon lights of The Royal Club flickered at midnight as Emily Smith dragged her exhausted body through the grand entrance.

The night breeze carried a chill. She pulled out her phone to call a ride.

A black Range Rover glided silently toward her. The window rolled down.

"Get in." William Johnson's voice was colder than the night air.

Emily tightened her grip on her phone. Just an hour ago, in the VIP lounge, she had watched this man wrap his arm around her cousin's waist.

"No, thanks..." she instinctively refused.

Yet, against her better judgment, she opened the back door.

The scent of cedar filled the car. William's long fingers rested on the steering wheel.

"Address."

"Xiawei Village," she answered, naming the rundown rental complex in the city's slums.

The car merged into the night. His sharp profile reflected in the rearview mirror.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the shabby apartment building.

Emily thanked him and stepped out, but the Range Rover's taillights remained on.

When she turned, she met William's unfathomable gaze.

"Would you like to come up for tea?" The words escaped before she could stop them.

William chuckled, retrieving something from the glove compartment and slipping it into his suit pocket.

In the elevator, his body heat radiated through his shirt. The moment her key turned in the lock, he pinned her against the entryway wall.

The door slammed shut. A searing kiss followed.

Emily remembered the nude sculpture at the gallery yesterday—modeled after her, credited as her boyfriend's latest masterpiece.

The irony? When she stormed in to confront him, she found him entangled with the model in the flesh.

"Focus," William murmured against her ear.

The night stretched endlessly. At dawn, Emily staggered out of bed, legs trembling.

The bathroom mirror revealed red marks scattered across her skin. When she emerged, William stood impeccably dressed in the morning light.

"First time?" He exhaled a smoke ring.

Emily turned away. She would never forget the way William had looked during his speech as the student representative years ago—back when she was a freshman and he a senior.

"You can leave now."

He stubbed out his cigarette in a disposable cup. At the door, he paused. "Take the pill."

The moment the door clicked shut, Emily slid to the floor. On the nightstand, the opened condom box was missing two.
###Chapter 2

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains as Emily Smith finished packing her bag, ready to leave.

The moment she stepped out of the apartment building, a familiar black car blocked her path.

David Brown rushed out and grabbed her wrist. "Emily, I was wrong. Give me another chance, please."

She yanked her hand away, her gaze icy. "Don't touch me. Disgusting."

She had blocked him on every platform last night, yet he still managed to track her down.

"Who are you pretending to be?" His expression darkened instantly. "If you hadn’t kept refusing me, I wouldn’t have had to look elsewhere."

Emily scoffed and turned away without another word.

The bus rattled toward the hospital. Her sister lay motionless in bed, fragile as a porcelain doll.

She hadn’t opened her eyes since the accident a year ago. The driver had been penniless, unable to even cover the medical bills.

"I won’t give up on you," Emily whispered, gently wiping her sister’s pale cheek.

The nurse entered. "Miss Smith, the hospital fees are due again."

Emily nodded, pulling out the eight thousand she’d earned the night before. It would last another two weeks.

On her way out, she stopped at a pharmacy for emergency contraception. The bitter pill dissolved on her tongue, making her grimace.

At the bus stop, a black Range Rover pulled up. The girl in the passenger seat leaned over and kissed the driver.

Emily recognized that profile—William Johnson.

She gulped down a mouthful of water, forcing the pill down.

That afternoon, sunlight spilled across her desk as she polished her resume. Her phone buzzed.

"Miss Smith, congratulations on securing an interview with BestTech Group."

BestTech. The name made her fingers tremble.

Seven years ago, her father had been framed there, made the scapegoat in an economic scandal. She would get in and uncover the truth.

After hanging up, she texted her nightclub manager to cancel her shift. She needed to prepare.

At 10 p.m., her phone vibrated. A friend request popped up: William Johnson.

She hesitated, then accepted.

Two words appeared instantly:
[Wanna meet?]

The cold glow of the screen reflected on her pale face.
###Chapter 3

William Johnson's fingers tapped lazily against the steering wheel. The dim interior light outlined his sharp profile as his intense gaze followed the girl outside.

"Can't you stay with me?" Emily Smith clutched her bag strap, her voice barely above a whisper.

William chuckled lowly before abruptly killing the engine and stepping out.

"Come on." He strode toward the apartment building without looking back.

Emily hurried after him, her heart pounding. The moment the door closed, she found herself pinned against the wall.

"I haven't showered yet..." She turned her face away from his kiss.

William gripped her chin. "Perfect. We'll do it together."

Steam filled the bathroom. The cold tiles pressed against Emily's back as she shivered. Water from the showerhead cascaded over their entangled figures, muffled whimpers lost in the humid air.

Two hours later, William carried her out. Her body was limp, eyelids too heavy to lift.

"Don't sleep." He pinched her cheek. "Your hair's still wet."

The hum of the hairdryer became a lullaby. Emily slumped against the armrest, dead to the world.

A sudden sharp pain on her lips made her swat blindly. A crisp smack echoed.

The air froze.

William's eyes darkened. He yanked the towel off her. Emily jolted awake, tearfully pleading until a choked "William" finally made him relent.

Late at night, William sat at the desk, flipping through her densely packed notes. The computer screen lit up, displaying the BestTech Group homepage. He glanced at the sleeping girl and smirked.

The next morning, Emily arrived at BestTech Tower just in time. Sunlight refracted off the glass facade, making the skyscraper resemble a floating crystal palace.

The lounge buzzed with well-dressed candidates. Clutching her resume, Emily waited quietly. The first interview went surprisingly well—until the HR manager stopped her.

"What's your relationship with Vice President Johnson?" The woman's gaze was piercing.

Emily shook her head in confusion. The manager sneered. "Follow me."

The sharp click of heels echoed unnaturally down the empty hallway.

###Chapter 4

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime.

The female manager was about to step inside when she froze mid-stride. Her face instantly lit up with an ingratiating smile. "Vice President Johnson. Miss Davis."

William Johnson remained impassive. His gaze swept past Emily Smith standing behind the manager before settling on the woman's face with a slight nod.

"Vice President Johnson, this is Emily Smith—the student you specifically asked us to look after." The manager's smile deepened her wrinkles as she shot Emily a meaningful glance. "Aren't you going to greet them?"

Emily stood rooted to the spot, staring blankly at William inside the elevator.

"William, who's she?" Olivia Davis clung to William's arm like a limpet, scrutinizing Emily with disdain. "She looks dazed. Is she even legal?"

William chuckled lowly, ruffling Olivia's hair. "A friend's younger sister. Asked me to keep an eye on her."

"BestTech isn't a charity," Olivia pouted. "Since when did you become so accommodating?"

"What?" William leaned close to her ear. "Afraid I might be interested in her?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Olivia thrust out her chest. "You'd never go for someone so... scrawny."

Emily finally snapped out of her daze, forcing a bitter smile.

Olivia Davis—the heiress of the Davis family. Everyone in Jinzhou knew her name. Yet the woman in William's car yesterday had definitely not been her.

"She's academically gifted," William remarked suddenly. "Top of her class every year."

"Just a bookworm," Olivia scoffed.

"Emily Smith!" The manager yanked her arm sharply.

Emily lifted her head with a practiced smile. "Good afternoon, Vice President Johnson. Miss Davis."

"Get in," William said coolly.

As the doors closed, Olivia remained plastered to William, chattering and laughing. Emily stood silently in the corner like a ghost.

The elevator reached the 67th floor.

William and Olivia strode straight to his office while Emily waited outside. Half an hour later, Olivia emerged with her nose in the air.

"Remember this," she hissed in Emily's ear, her voice venomous. "If you dare lay a finger on my man, I'll make your life a living hell."

Emily kept her head bowed without responding.

"Miss Smith," a secretary approached. "Vice President Johnson will see you now."

Inside the office, William was reviewing documents. A bright red lipstick stain now marked his collar.

"Vice President Johnson." Emily stood before his desk.

"Sit." He didn't look up.

Emily remained standing.

William finally raised his eyes, pinning her with an intense stare. "Legs not hurting anymore?"

Emily clenched and unclenched her fists before meeting his gaze directly. "What do I get if I stay with you?"

"What do you want?" He arched an eyebrow.

"Money."

"Ten thousand per night?"

"One thousand is enough."

William smirked. "You'll need to work hard then—to cover your sister's medical bills."
###Chapter 5

The day her father was imprisoned, her mother packed her bags and left in the middle of the night. Not even a note remained.

Her younger sister was hit by a car on her way home from school. She still lay in the ICU, fighting for her life.

Their grandmother couldn’t bear the shock. A sudden heart attack took her.

Emily Smith stood in the hospital corridor, staring at her sister’s frail body tangled in tubes. The doctor said she could stop breathing at any moment.

William Johnson’s investigation files chilled her to the bone. But did he know the real reason her father was behind bars?

"Secretary or Business Department?" William’s voice cut through her thoughts.

Emily clenched her fists. She chose the Business Department.

She was afraid. Afraid that seeing him every day would make him tire of her quickly. Afraid that in the end, she’d gain nothing.

Business Assistant in the Overseas Division—her new title.

The manager, Michael Thompson, was in his early thirties. When William’s secretary personally escorted her in, his enthusiasm was excessive.

Emily knew where that warmth came from. She had to tread carefully, leaving no room for gossip.

By the time her onboarding was complete, the setting sun cast long shadows through BestTech Group’s glass skyscraper.

The sixty-eight-story tower glittered in the twilight. Emily tilted her head back, her chest tightening.

This was a place many dreamed of entering. And the only reason she stood here was William Johnson.

The subway roared into the station. The final stop: The Royal Club.

Emily leaned into the corner, closing her eyes. She needed this brief respite.

Dinner hour at The Royal Club. Susan Miller pulled her into the staff meal. The hot food eased some of the exhaustion.

At exactly ten, her phone buzzed violently in her locker.

But Emily was already balancing a tray, weaving through the dimly lit private rooms.

"Room 3808 ordered two bottles of Louis XIII," Susan’s voice crackled over the walkie-talkie.

Emily lowered her head as she entered the room. Raucous laughter from men and women pierced the hazy air.

"Enjoy," she murmured, kneeling to place the bottles on the table.

As she rose, a furious shout exploded beside her.

"Emily Smith!"

Her blood turned to ice. David Brown.

Running was impossible. A searing pain tore through her scalp as he slammed her against the wall.

"Who do you think you are?" David’s face twisted with drunken rage. "How many men have had you already?"

Emily clawed at his grip on her hair. Breathing became a struggle.

"We broke up!" she choked out.

"Broke up?" His hand reared back. "You’re nothing!"

The slap echoed through the room. Emily’s right ear rang, the world spinning.

She remembered the gentle boy who once held an umbrella for her.

Who was this monster now?

David’s palm lifted again.
###Chapter 6

"Getting this worked up over a woman? Is she really worth it?"

David Brown turned to glare at the man stopping him, ready to unleash a torrent of curses. But the moment he recognized the face, his bravado deflated. "Cousin, you have no idea how disgusting this bitch is. I spent a whole year sweet-talking her, didn't even get a kiss, and now she's here serving other men."

James Wilson scoffed. "Sounds like a you problem."

"You're right. That's why I'm going to make her pay today."

David yanked Emily Smith's hair, dragging her toward the exit.

Pain exploded behind Emily's eyes as she stumbled forward, forced to keep up.

In that moment, she finally understood—the gentle, caring David she'd known was nothing but an act.

The real him was a monster through and through.

At least she'd never let him cross the line.

"Take it easy. Don't kill her," James called after them.

"Don't worry, cousin!"

As David hauled Emily out, they collided with Susan Miller emerging from a private room.

"Sir, if our Emily has offended you in any way—"

"Get lost!"

David shoved Susan aside.

Her high heels twisted, sending her crashing to the floor.

Emily seized David's arm and sank her teeth into his flesh.

"Ah—!"

David howled, face contorted in agony.

"You bitch!" He released her hair and drove his foot into her abdomen.

The brutal kick sent Emily reeling backward until her spine slammed against the wall with a sickening thud.

White-hot pain forced her to crumple to the floor, face drained of color.

Seeing the blood gushing from his arm, David snapped completely.

"I'm ending you today!"

He lunged forward, raising his foot again—

"Thud!"

A long leg shot out, sending him flying.

David hit the ground hard, struggling to get up.

William Johnson took one look at Emily curled in pain and scooped her into his arms without a word.

"Motherfucker! Put her down!"

David scrambled up and grabbed William's leg. "She's mine—"

"Get lost."

William kicked him into the private room door.

Security guards arriving on the scene exchanged uneasy glances, hesitant to intervene.

The commotion finally drew the attention of the private room's occupants, who stepped out to investigate.

David crawled toward James, whimpering, "Cousin... that bastard stole my girl... help me..."

James followed his pointing finger and paled instantly.

He hurried forward with an ingratiating smile. "Uncle William, we didn't know you were coming..."

The crowd gaped.

Uncle William?

William's icy gaze swept over them. "Control your dog. If he bites someone again, I'll put him down myself."
###Chapter 7

William Johnson didn't say a word. He simply started the car and drove straight toward the hospital.

Emily Smith clutched the seatbelt so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"I'm not going," she said, her voice trembling.

William glanced at her sideways. "Reason?"

"No money," Emily whispered, biting her lower lip.

He scoffed and pressed the accelerator harder.

The car screeched to a halt in front of the emergency room.

Emily shrank into her seat like a frightened rabbit, refusing to move.

"Get out," William ordered.

She shook her head, her fingers twisting tighter.

William narrowed his eyes. "Don't want the BestTech offer anymore?"

Emily's head snapped up, her eyes reddening.

The next second, William leaned over, roughly unbuckled her seatbelt, and scooped her into his arms.

"Put me down!" Emily struggled.

Ignoring her, he kicked the car door shut with one long leg.

"It really doesn't hurt anymore..." Her voice grew smaller.

"Shut up," William said coldly.

After examining the report, the doctor adjusted his glasses. "Minor soft tissue bruising. Just apply heat when you get home."

Emily exhaled in relief and started to stand—

"Doctor!" Her face suddenly flushed crimson.

William turned to leave, but a small, cold hand tugged at his sleeve.

"I..." Her voice was barely audible. "I think it's... my period."

The examination room fell silent.

The doctor nodded in understanding. "No wonder you're in so much pain! Young lady, you need to keep warm next time."

Emily curled into a ball, sweat beading on her forehead from the pain.

William's expression darkened, but he still went to get the medication.

When he returned, he carried a cup of hot water.

Emily took it with trembling hands, flinching slightly when her fingertips accidentally brushed his.

"Thank you," she murmured, taking small sips.

William wordlessly handed her the painkillers.

After taking the medicine, Emily still didn't move.

"Something else?" William asked impatiently.

Her ears burned red. "Can you... buy me... sanitary napkins?"

William froze.

After a long pause, he turned and walked away.

Emily watched his retreating figure with a bitter smile.

Ten minutes later, just as she was about to leave on her own, a familiar silhouette appeared at the end of the corridor.

William strode toward her, a bulging black plastic bag in hand—his tailored suit a stark contrast to the cheap bag.

"Here." He averted his gaze, the tips of his ears faintly pink.

Emily took the bag, their fingers brushing for a fleeting moment. Both of them stiffened.

Inside were not just sanitary napkins, but also heating pads and brown sugar.
###Chapter 8

William Johnson didn't just buy sanitary napkins. He also returned with a floral-print pajama set and brand-new underwear.

The pajamas were hideously outdated, like something a middle-aged woman would wear to the grocery store.

But they were still better than a bloodstained dress.

Emily Smith passed out the moment she got into the car.

In her drowsy state, she felt something warm pressed against her abdomen. The cramping gradually eased, and the tension in her brow finally relaxed.

When she opened her eyes again, it was dawn.

The first thing she saw was a minimalist bedroom—gray tones with recessed lighting.

Sunlight filtered through sheer white curtains, casting dappled shadows on the sophisticated gray walls.

Beneath her was a luxurious imported leather bed, two meters wide.

"Buzz—"

A phone vibrated from the left side.

It wasn't hers.

The black-and-gold casing was unmistakably William's custom model.

She suddenly realized—this was William's bedroom.

The bathroom door swung open.

William stepped out, a towel wrapped around his waist, water still dripping from his hair.

Their eyes met. He paused mid-step, then turned wordlessly toward the walk-in closet.

Emily scrambled to get up.

The moment she moved, she felt a rush of warmth between her legs.

She looked down—

A dark red stain had seeped into the bedsheet.

"Ah!"

She tried to jump off the bed but twisted her ankle, crashing heavily onto the floor.

The closet door flew open.

William strode out, his shirt still half-buttoned, the defined lines of his chest visible with each step.

He stopped in front of Emily, his gaze flickering to the bloodstain on the bed.

"I'm sorry..." Emily's ears burned red. "I'll wash the sheets."

William slowly fastened another button. "That's all?"

"And the medical expenses from last night... plus..." Her voice grew smaller. "The cost of the supplies."

William suddenly smirked, tossing a robe at her. "Clean yourself up first."

Once the bathroom door closed, he frowned at the stain and began efficiently stripping the bed.

When the water shut off, Emily hesitated, unsure how to exit.

The bathroom door abruptly opened.

William walked in wearing only his shirt and boxers, leaning lazily against the sink.

"You wanted to pay me back?" He arched a brow.

Emily hastily wrapped the towel tighter around herself. "How much?"

William crooked a finger. "Come here."

She forced herself to step closer.

"As promised," he murmured, fingers brushing her damp hair. "A thousand per time."

His touch burned like fire.
###Chapter 9

Emily Smith leaned over the bathroom sink, gagging violently as her stomach churned.

Her eyes reddened from retching. She splashed cold water on her face, staring at her pale reflection in the mirror—her lips unnaturally flushed.

When she stepped out of the bathroom, she froze.

Neatly folded on the sofa were the clothes and purse she’d left behind at The Royal Club last night. Her phone rested on top, silent.

Unlocking the screen, seven missed calls and over a dozen unread messages flooded in.

Her fingertip hovered over the display. Three missed calls from William Johnson glared back at her—timestamped at 10 PM the previous night.

Two unread messages sat in their chat:
[Pack your things.]
[I’ll pick you up at 10.]

Emily clenched her phone. So he had gone to her apartment last night. No wonder he’d shown up at The Royal Club.

Buzz—
An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"You bitch!" David Brown’s enraged voice exploded through the speaker. "Think you can dump me just because you’ve latched onto William Johnson? You’ve been cheating on me all along, haven’t you?"

Her fingers trembled.

"Emily Smith, who the hell do you think you are? Once William gets tired of you, he’ll toss you aside like trash. And when that happens, I’ll—"

"David." Her voice cut through his tirade, icy. "Lay a single finger on me, and I’ll have William end you."

She hung up and blocked the number in one swift motion.

Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the bedroom door. The rich scent of ginger and brown sugar filled the air.

In the open kitchen, William stood with his shirt sleeves rolled up, watching a clay pot simmer on the stove. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, outlining his sharp profile.

"Come here," he said without turning.

When she took the wooden spoon, her fingertip accidentally brushed his hand. She flinched as if shocked.

"You’re moving into the guest room today," he said, drying his hands.

"I’m not." She stared at the boiling ginger slices.

William turned and stepped closer, his faint cedarwood scent enveloping her. "Not enough money?"

"My job at The Royal Club—"

"Quit." His voice brooked no argument. "That place isn’t for you."

Emily jerked her head up. "You don’t get to—"

"I’m your boss." He leaned down, his breath warm against her ear. "Full-time."

She bit her lip. "Then raise my rate."

"How much?"

"A thousand an hour."

William chuckled and pulled out his phone. Seconds later, Emily’s pocket buzzed incessantly.

Ten transfers of $50,000 each lined up neatly in their chat.

"Fifty thousand upfront." He ruffled her hair. "Better earn it."

The pot suddenly boiled over, splashing hot syrup onto her hand. William swiftly turned off the stove, grabbed her wrist, and held it under running water.

"Clumsy," he muttered, his thumb stroking the reddened skin.

Emily stared at their intertwined hands. Her heartbeat stuttered.
###Chapter 10 

Emily Smith stared at her phone screen, silently repeating the string of numbers several times. 941122—the passcode to William Johnson's apartment. She quickly opened her notes app and tapped the digits into her phone, saving them for later.

Stepping out of the apartment building, the harsh sunlight made her squint. Before her stretched Jinzhou's most bustling financial district, Qianhai CBD, where skyscrapers towered. Among them, one landmark building stood out—Bay One, a luxury residence starting at thirty million per unit.

She glanced back at the towering glass facade behind her before squeezing onto the bus headed for the hospital.

In the VIP ward, the sterile scent of disinfectant had been replaced by the faint fragrance of flowers. Emily adjusted the blanket over her younger sister and gave the caregiver a few reminders. By the time everything was settled, the clock on the wall showed noon.

The stir-fried noodles from a street vendor were still steaming as she wolfed down a few bites before rushing back to her rented apartment to pack. Her diploma hadn’t even arrived yet, but her life had already been turned upside down. Her wardrobe was sparse, the most expensive item being a down jacket bought on sale last year.

As her suitcase clicked shut, her phone buzzed in her bag. The name "Daniel Chen" on the screen made her pause.

"Daniel?"

"How did your thesis defense go?" A warm male voice came through the phone.

Emily leaned against her suitcase, her lips curling into an unconscious smile. "It went well."

"Good." Daniel hesitated. "Are you free this afternoon? There’s something I’d like to tell you in person."

"What’s so mysterious?"

"You’ll find out when you get here." He kept it vague. "Let’s meet at the restaurant next to the Broadcasting Center at five?"

After hanging up, her navigation app showed the subway would take an hour and a half. Dragging her suitcase behind her, she hurried out the door, the wheels rattling over the uneven pavement.

When she arrived, Daniel was already waiting by the window. Seeing her luggage, he quickly stood to take it from her. "Moving?"

"Yeah, just passing through," she replied vaguely, her eyes drifting to the menu on the table.

After ordering, Daniel pulled a contract from his briefcase and slid it toward her. "Remember that audiobook we recorded, Path of the Immortal?"

Emily nodded. That had been six months ago—she’d only done it on a whim.

"It’s hit two hundred million plays." Daniel’s eyes sparkled. "The platform wants to sign us. I’ve already negotiated the revenue split."

Emily clapped a hand over her mouth, her fingers trembling slightly. She flipped open the contract, where the words "60-40 split" stood out in black and white. Sunlight streamed through the window, gilding the numbers on the page.

"Can we really make money from this?" She looked up, her eyes shining.

Daniel smiled and handed her a pen. Just as she bent to sign, a black Bentley rolled to a stop on the street outside the restaurant.

The rear window lowered halfway as Olivia Davis tugged at the sleeve of the man beside her. "William, isn’t that your classmate’s sister?"

William’s gaze cut through the two panes of glass, landing on the smiling profile of the girl inside. His expression remained impassive as he withdrew his attention, fingers tapping lightly on his knee.

"Is that her boyfriend across from her?" Olivia tilted her head curiously.

The Bentley pulled back into traffic. William ran his thumb along the edge of his phone but didn’t answer.
###Chapter 11

"Miss Smith, your audiobook has surpassed a million listens." The platform editor's voice brimmed with excitement. "Once it switches to paid content next month, your estimated monthly earnings will start at least at one hundred fifty thousand."

My hand trembled slightly as I gripped the phone.

One hundred fifty thousand. With the revenue split, I’d take home forty-five thousand a month. Combined with my other side jobs, my sister’s medical bills would finally be covered.

"Mr. Chen wants to collaborate with you on a new book," the editor continued. "The platform has already selected several high-quality IPs for you."

After hanging up, I stood on the bustling street, suddenly feeling the sunlight warmer than usual. Passing a bubble tea shop, I indulged in a rare treat—a fully sweetened pearl milk tea.

The sugary sweetness bloomed on my tongue. It was the first time I’d bought bubble tea with my own money.

By the time I returned to Sky City One, night had fallen. As I wheeled my suitcase toward the entrance, a security guard stopped me.

"Only residents can use facial recognition access," he said, eyeing me skeptically. "Which unit do you live in?"

"Unit 6701, 67th floor," I answered calmly. "I'm the new live-in housekeeper."

The guard hesitated. "Then please contact the owner for verification."

I pulled out my phone and sent William Johnson a WeChat message. After ten minutes with no reply, I tried a voice call.

No answer.

The early autumn night breeze carried a chill. I sat by the fountain, flipping through the new book materials Daniel Chen had sent me. One contemporary romance novel stood out—the female lead’s struggles bore an uncanny resemblance to mine.

"Miss, it’s past midnight," the security guard approached, concerned. "Maybe you should find somewhere else to stay for now?"

I glanced at the still-empty chat window, a pang of bitterness tightening in my chest.

What was I, really? Just a passing whim for William Johnson.

I stood, pulling my suitcase behind me. The moment I turned to leave, a familiar voice cut through the night—

"Emily Smith."

That voice was like a blade, slicing effortlessly through the walls I’d built around my heart.
###Chapter 12

Emily Smith clenched the handle of her suitcase, her nails digging deep into her palms. She tilted her head back, forcing the tears threatening to spill to retreat.

William Johnson leaned against the marble pillar in the foyer, his long fingers toying with a car key. His sharp eyes narrowed, locking onto her stubborn silhouette like a hawk.

"Come here," his thin lips parted.

The tone was one reserved for a disobedient pet.

"Mr. Johnson, I didn't realize this young lady was part of your household staff. My apologies," the security guard stammered, recognizing William and immediately bowing his head.

Household staff?

William's gaze turned icy, the intensity making the guard shudder.

"Miss, Mr. Johnson is calling you," the guard hastily turned to Emily. "You should go."

Emily took a deep breath, her chest rising and falling rapidly. She remained rooted in place, her nails scraping faintly against the suitcase handle.

William wasn't in a hurry. He waited, perfectly composed.

In the end, Emily was the one who took the first step. She dragged her suitcase behind her, each movement feeling like walking on knives.

Seeing her relent, William turned and walked away without another word. They entered the elevator one after the other.

"Did you see my message?" Emily asked softly, staring at the changing floor numbers.

"Hmm." William suddenly turned, his gaze landing on the redness at the corners of her eyes.

He cursed under his breath before slamming her against the cold elevator wall. His long fingers gripped her chin, and his punishing kiss crashed down.

"Mmph—"

Emily struggled to push him away, but he easily pinned her wrists above her head with one hand. The elevator dinged as it reached the 67th floor. Without hesitation, William scooped her up and kicked the obstructing suitcase aside.

"William! Put me down!"

He ignored her, unlocking the apartment with his fingerprint before pressing her against the entryway cabinet, his lips claiming hers again. Only when Emily grabbed his wandering hand did he pause.

"No... I'm on my period."

William froze. He released her and strode into the master bedroom without a backward glance, slamming the door shut behind him.

Emily slid down to the floor, her fingers still trembling.

She dragged her suitcase into the guest room. The silver-gray silk bedding gleamed coldly under the moonlight, and a few brand-new sleepwear sets hung in the walk-in closet.

That night, she slept fitfully.

The next morning, when Emily opened her bedroom door, William was already at the dining table. A butler with a golden name tag stood beside him.

"And this is...?" the woman couldn't hide her surprise.

"Distant cousin," William replied without looking up. "Get her registered for building access."

The word "cousin" made Emily's fingers twitch.

The woman immediately smiled warmly. "Miss Smith, hello. I'm the residence manager, Song Yan."

"Thank you for your help," Emily murmured.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the dining table. In the reflection on the glass, Emily caught sight of herself—pale as a ghost.
###Chapter 13

Emily Smith finished registering her access card for Jinzhou Bay One and walked toward the subway station under the morning light.

The rush-hour subway was packed. She shielded her bag as she squeezed through the crowd. It was only three stops from Jinzhou Bay to BestTech Group. Fifteen minutes later, she stood beneath the glass facade of the BestTech Tower.

Michael Thompson, the Business Department manager, personally showed her around. After touring the entire department, he pointed to a workstation. "Lily White will train you. Come to me if you have any questions."

"Thank you, Manager Thompson." Emily hugged her notebook and sat beside Lily.

"What's your relationship with Vice President Johnson?" Lily got straight to the point.

Emily shook her head. "None."

Lily smirked knowingly. "Alright. I'll make sure to teach you well."

The morning training session was packed with useful information. Emily filled seven pages with notes. At noon, Michael treated the team to lunch at a Sichuan restaurant near the office.

The spicy boiled fish in chili oil whetted Emily's appetite. Her nose beaded with sweat from the heat, but she couldn't stop eating.

"Didn't expect you to handle spice so well." On their way back, Michael suddenly realized they were the only two left.

Emily wiped her lips. "Hometown taste. Thanks, Manager Thompson."

Dappled sunlight filtered through the trees, casting patterns on her face. When she smiled, her eyes curved into crescents, and faint dimples appeared. Her lips, flushed from the spice, looked glossy and plump, while her fair cheeks glowed like ripe peaches.

Michael's Adam's apple bobbed. The loose shirt hid her figure, but now, under the sunlight, her curves were unmistakable. Her waist was slender enough to encircle with one hand, and her innocent smile carried an unconscious allure.

"Just call me boss from now on," he said, his voice slightly hoarse.

"Okay, boss." Emily replied sweetly.

As they stepped into the company lobby, a shrill voice cut through the air. "Emily Smith!"

Emma Clark rushed over from the lounge, her nails nearly grazing Emily's face. "What are you doing here?"

"Cousin." Emily took half a step back.

Michael shielded her. "She's a BestTech employee. Any problem?"

"Employee?" Emma's eyes widened. "Did you seduce Will—"

"Good afternoon, Vice President Johnson!"

A chorus of greetings interrupted her. William Johnson walked in surrounded by executives, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.

Emma instantly changed her demeanor, smiling coyly as she approached him. "William~"

William's gaze swept past Emily and settled on Emma. "Waiting long?"

"Just got here." Emma tried to link arms with him, but he subtly avoided her touch.

"Let's talk upstairs." William strode forward.

As they passed Emily, Emma shot her a venomous glare. Emily stared at her shoes as if they held some priceless treasure.

Once the elevator doors closed, Emma ventured, "That girl just now... she looked like my cousin..."

"Your cousin?" William raised an eyebrow. "Do I know her?"

"Oh, no!" Emma waved her hands hastily. "I must've mistaken her for someone else."

The elevator mirror reflected William's faintly amused smile.
###Chapter 14

Emily Smith had just settled into her workstation when her phone buzzed abruptly.

The screen flashed with the name "Emma Clark."

She stood up and walked toward the restroom before answering the call.

"Emily Smith, did you join BestTech just to seduce William Johnson?" Emma's shrill voice lashed out like a whip. "Let me warn you—William already has someone in his heart. He's loved that girl for over a decade!"

Emily tightened her grip on the phone, her knuckles turning white.

"Are you this worked up because you're afraid he might take a liking to me?" Her tone was calm, yet every word carried a sharp edge.

A cold laugh came through the phone. "You? The daughter of a murderer? You're not even fit to polish his shoes!"

Emily stared at her reflection in the restroom mirror, her lips curling into a faint, icy smile.

"Then you have nothing to worry about," she said softly. "I have zero interest in your man."

After hanging up, Emily returned to her desk as if nothing had happened and resumed her work.

Once her shift ended, she headed straight to the hospital.

In the VIP ward, her younger sister lay quietly in bed. Emily took her sister's hand and began reading a novel aloud in a gentle voice.

"The doctor said talking helps you recover." She brushed a strand of hair from her sister's forehead. "I'll always be here with you."

By nine in the evening, she was back at her apartment. The interior was pitch black.

She opened the fridge—it was empty.

Just as she finished showering, the doorbell rang.

The video intercom showed Song Yan standing outside with a food cart.

"Mr. Johnson ordered dinner for you," Song Yan said with a sweet smile, though her eyes kept darting curiously into the apartment.

Emily stepped aside to let them in.

"Mr. Johnson isn't back yet?" Song Yan asked casually.

"No," Emily replied, pretending not to notice the disappointment in her eyes.

After seeing Song Yan out, Emily stared at the lavish spread on the table and swallowed hard.

She sent William a WeChat message: The food's getting cold. Should I start eating?

He replied instantly: Go ahead.

Emily immediately picked up a piece of sweet and sour pork ribs and took a bite, her eyes closing in bliss.

Meanwhile, a blue light flickered in the eyes of the Optimus Prime robot in the living room.

At the Shen Mansion, William stared at his phone screen, the corner of his lips lifting slightly.

On the screen, the girl was stuffing her cheeks with food, looking like a squirrel that had just stolen a nut.

"What are you looking at?" His elder brother's voice suddenly cut in.

William quickly switched the screen. "Nothing. Just a greedy little animal."

He put away his phone, but the amusement in his eyes remained.
###Chapter 15 

For two consecutive days, Emily Smith hadn't seen William Johnson.

She went to work alone as usual.
She visited the hospital alone to care for her sister.
She ate alone.
She lived alone.
This kind of life had long become her normal.

On the other hand, Song Yan was unusually attentive.
She delivered breakfast and dinner punctually every day, timing it perfectly.
Emily even wondered if this so-called "golden housekeeper" had installed a tracker on her.

On Saturday morning, just as Emily finished changing and was about to leave, the doorbell rang right on schedule.

"Miss Smith, hasn't Mr. Johnson returned yet?" Song Yan asked casually while setting up breakfast.

Emily shook her head.

"When will he be back?" Song Yan pressed.

"I don't know," Emily replied flatly.

A flicker of displeasure crossed Song Yan's face. "Isn't he your cousin? Why don't you ask him anything?"

Emily looked up at her. "Would you like me to call him right now and ask for you?"

"No, no!" Song Yan waved her hands hastily, forcing a professional smile. "Enjoy your meal, Miss Smith."

After breakfast, Emily followed her routine—first visiting her sister at the hospital, then heading to her tutoring session.

Her English tutoring classes were in high demand.
Since taking on this student, the child had gone from being at the bottom of the class to consistently scoring above 95.
The parents had voluntarily doubled her hourly rate from $50 to $100.

That day, as the session ended, the father suddenly stopped her and shoved a stack of cash into her hand.

"Mr. Yang, I only accept my agreed-upon fee," Emily said, trying to pull her hand back, but he held on tightly.

"Emily, as long as you keep teaching well, any bonus you want—"

"Lao Yang! Look who's here!" The wife's voice suddenly called from the foyer.

They both looked up to see William Johnson entering with Olivia Davis on his arm.
Emily's breath caught.
The cash slipped from her fingers and scattered across the floor.

She knelt to gather the bills, her peripheral vision catching the familiar dress shoes walking past without so much as a glance in her direction.

Laughter soon filled the living room.
Emily separated the money into two stacks and approached the group.

"Isn't this your classmate's cousin?" Olivia asked with feigned surprise.

William gave Emily a dismissive glance. "I'm also curious why she's here."

"Mrs. Yang," Emily handed over the money, "here's $800 returned to you. The remaining $400 is my fee. Starting today, I will no longer be tutoring your child."

Her voice was soft, but it cut through the artificial cheer in the room like a blade.
###Chapter 16

Emily stepped out of the gated community as dusk settled. Her high heels clicked against the pavement for nearly half an hour before she reached the bus stop.

The night breeze carried a chill. She tugged at her thin collar.

A black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided silently to the curb. The rear window lowered with smooth precision.

William's sharp profile flickered in the dim light, his eyes shut.

"Get in." His voice was low, commanding.

Emily hesitated before pulling the door open and sliding inside.

The scent of sandalwood filled the car. Before she could settle, the partition rose between them.

"Sanitize." His order was clipped.

She spotted the disinfectant wipes in the console but didn’t move.

William’s eyes snapped open. He seized her wrist, his grip brutal as he dragged the wipe across her skin, leaving angry red marks.

"It hurts—" she gasped.

A cold smirk curled his lips. Suddenly, he yanked her hand toward him.

Emily recoiled like she’d been burned, her face flushing crimson.

"Did last time teach you nothing?" William’s gaze narrowed. "Tutoring costs four thousand. Here, it’s five."

Her lips pressed tight. The memory of searing pain still lingered in her throat.

"Unwilling?" His voice roughened.

She lifted her eyes to meet his smoldering stare.

"Two more days… please?" Her voice trembled.

William scoffed, forcing her palm onto his thigh. "Think I can wait?"

Her fingertips burned. She jerked her hand back.

"Do it yourself." She turned away, offering her sanitized hand.

His expression darkened.

Thirty minutes later, Emily was dumped at the mall entrance.

She watched the taillights vanish, then unclenched her fists. Her left hand held a black card. Her right was swollen and hot.

William had shoved the card at her, demanding she replace her worn-out clothes—faded jeans and a tight blouse, a gift from her best friend four years ago.

The mall blazed with light. After two hours, she picked two discounted outfits. At checkout, she quietly pocketed the black card.

The aroma of Japanese food from the seventh floor made her stomach growl. As she approached the restaurant, Emma and her friends blocked her path.

"Look who’s slumming it here," Emma sneered, eyeing the shopping bag.

Emily tried to sidestep them, but Emma grabbed her arm.

"That’s William’s cologne on you." Emma’s face twisted.

Before Emily could react, she was shoved to the ground. The black card slipped from her pocket. Emma snatched it up.

"1002… This is William’s card!" She screeched, slapping Emily hard. "You thief!"

Emily yanked the card back and shoved Emma away.

"Call him if you dare." Her laugh was icy.

Emma dialed instantly, her voice sugary. "William, someone stole your card—"

Hanging up, she smirked. "He says you stole it!"

While Emily was stunned, Emma snatched the card again and barked at her friends, "Hold her!"

They pinned Emily against the glass railing.

"Search her!" Emma ripped open her bag, scattering her belongings across the floor.
###Chapter 17

Pinned against the cold floor, Emily Smith could still smell the pungent perfume clinging to Emma Clark. When the officers pulled them apart, her hair tie had snapped at some point, leaving her long hair disheveled over her shoulders.

The police station's lights were blindingly harsh.

"Name?" The officer taking notes didn't even glance up.

"Emily Smith."

From the neighboring interrogation room, she could hear Emma's exaggerated sobs about how badly she'd been wronged. Emily stared at the bruises on her wrist and suddenly found it all absurd.

The surveillance footage should have cleared her.

But the moment the woman in the tailored suit strode into the station on stilettos, Emily knew things wouldn't be that simple. The familiar scent of the woman's perfume twisted her stomach—it was the same fragrance her late mother had loved.

"Emily," the woman's voice dripped with honeyed venom, "just apologize, and we can—"

"My mother died eight years ago." Emily cut her off, her voice feather-light. "Who are you again?"

The old officer's offered cup of water had gone cold.

Emily studied her reflection in the cup. The bruise at her temple looked grotesque under the harsh light. She suddenly remembered she had a recording session tomorrow. Would Daniel Chen be waiting for her?

"Should we contact your family?" The officer asked for the third time.

She shook her head. Her father was in prison. Her sister was in the hospital. She hadn't had a home in years.

In the end, she gave them Daniel's number. When the call connected, she bit her lip hard to keep the tears at bay.

Twenty minutes later, the handcuffs clicked open.

The night wind hit her face, and Emily shivered. Squinting, she saw Daniel sprinting toward her from his car.

"Does it hurt?" His fingers brushed lightly over the bruise on her temple.

Emily shook her head, but the moment he pulled her into his arms, her eyes burned. His suit jacket carried a faint woody scent, warm enough to make her want to cry.

She didn't notice the black sedan parked under the distant trees.

William Johnson's hand hovered over the door handle for three seconds before withdrawing. In the rearview mirror, the taillights of the white Audi gradually vanished into the night.

"Take me back to Jinzhou Bay." He closed his eyes, his Adam's apple bobbing.

The driver stole a glance at his employer's stormy expression in the mirror and wisely stayed silent. Outside, the police station's neon lights cast fractured reflections on the rain-slicked pavement.
###Chapter 18

Emily Smith's scratches looked alarming, but fortunately, they were only superficial.

Daniel Chen took her to the nearest hospital. After careful disinfection, the doctor applied a layer of ointment.

"Avoid getting these wet for the next few days," the doctor instructed. "Wait until the wounds scab over."

Though it was midsummer, Emily would rather endure a few days without showering than risk scarring on her face.

After leaving the hospital, Daniel took her out for a late-night meal.

"Aren’t you curious why I got into a fight?" Emily blinked her bright eyes at him.

Daniel’s heart ached as he noticed the faint dimples at the corners of her lips. He had already heard about her family situation.

He gently smoothed her disheveled hair and said firmly, "They must have provoked you first."

Emily shook her head. "Actually... I was the one who lost my temper."

If Daniel hadn’t bailed her out, she might still be in custody. The thought sent a chill down her spine.

She silently reminded herself: I have to learn to be more patient from now on.

Daniel noticed the bitterness hidden in her eyes and felt a pang of helpless sorrow.

Just then, the owner brought over a steaming pot of congee. Emily’s eyes lit up—she hadn’t eaten all day.

"Take it slow," Daniel said, quickly serving her a bowl.

Emily eagerly scooped up a large spoonful, only to burn her tongue. Tears welled up, but she forced herself to swallow it anyway.

Daniel chuckled and blew on another bowl to cool it for her.

By the end, Emily had nearly finished the entire pot. After the satisfying meal, the unpleasantness of the afternoon seemed to melt away.

Daniel insisted on seeing her home.

"Really, it’s not necessary..." Emily protested.

"It’s late. I’m taking you back," he said firmly.

Emily reluctantly got into his car. She was relieved she still had the key to her rented apartment—she hadn’t moved all her things to William Johnson’s place yet.

On the way, they discussed their plans for recording the new book. Their previous collaboration on a fantasy novel was gaining popularity, and they would receive their share of the profits next month.

"I’ll pick you up at nine tomorrow," Daniel said when they arrived at her building. "Get some rest tonight."

Emily nodded in thanks and watched his car drive off before heading upstairs.

She washed up quickly and collapsed into bed, falling asleep almost instantly.

The next day, she recorded the new book with Daniel. Her equipment wasn’t professional, and her computer was still at William’s place, so she had to work in Daniel’s studio.

They worked seamlessly together, finishing ahead of schedule. At six in the evening, Daniel left for a radio show, while Emily went to the hospital to visit her sister.

That night, back in her apartment, she meticulously reviewed the day’s recordings before finally allowing herself to sleep.

On Monday morning, she dressed in her new discount outfit and headed to BestTech Group. On the subway, she focused on analyzing the emotional arcs of the novel’s characters.

Suddenly, William’s striking face flashed through her mind. The description of the male lead bore an uncanny resemblance to him.

It dawned on her—she hadn’t contacted him in two days. Did he know about the fight? Did he know she hadn’t returned to his apartment?

The thought twisted her heart. After all, he was her first...

"Emily!" A voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

She turned to see Michael Thompson approaching.

"Boss!" she greeted cheerfully.

Michael frowned at the marks on her face. "What’s a girl like you doing getting into fights?" He reached out to touch her cheek.

Just then, a black Rolls-Royce glided past. Emily’s attention was diverted until Michael’s fingers brushed her skin, startling her.

"It was... just a little accident," she said, stepping back with a strained smile.

Michael laughed. "You? Fighting? With that tiny frame?"

Emily pouted indignantly. "I’m tougher than I look!"

"Alright, alright, I stand corrected," Michael chuckled, slinging an arm around her shoulders. "Let’s go."

As Emily moved to follow, a sudden chill ran down her spine. A chorus of greetings erupted behind her:

"Good morning, Vice President Johnson!"

Michael quickly pulled her aside. "Good morning, Vice President Johnson."

William stepped out of the car, his handsome face icy. As he passed Emily, his sharp gaze cut through her like a blade.

Michael shivered and glanced at Emily, only to find her staring at the ground like a scolded child.

"Did you do something to upset Vice President Johnson?" he whispered once the crowd dispersed.

"Huh? No," Emily replied, bewildered.

Michael: "......"
###Chapter 19

The moment William Johnson stepped into his office, the air pressure on the entire floor plummeted.

Secretaries trembled as they handed him documents, barely daring to breathe.

The newly appointed vice president had only returned to the country a little over a month ago, known for his gentle demeanor. This icy expression was a first.

Knock knock—

A secretary who had just escaped mustered the courage to knock again, her back already damp with cold sweat.

"Speak." William's voice was sharp as frost.

"Miss Clark is waiting for you downstairs."

A glint of steel flashed in William's eyes. "Send her up."

Five minutes later, Emma Clark pushed open the door, her face still bearing fading bruises.

"William..." she whimpered pitifully.

William's gaze swept over her injuries—more severe than Emily Smith's—and the tension that had weighed on him for days eased slightly. He leaned back lazily into his leather chair. "What is it?"

Emma immediately launched into tearful accusations, finally producing the black card. "This is the one Emily stole!"

"Stole?" William suddenly chuckled lowly, twirling the card between his fingers. "Who told you it was missing?"

"Your secretary did," Emma said, confused.

William's eyes turned frigid as he pressed the intercom. When the secretary entered, she was met with his mocking gaze.

"You're fired," he said casually. "Be gone in half an hour."

The secretary froze as if struck by lightning, but under his stare, she swallowed her protests and fled.

"William, you—"

"Want to be my secretary?" he interrupted. "Go complete the onboarding now."

Emma was overjoyed, but as she stood, his icy warning cut through the air: "Remember your place."

After finishing the paperwork, she immediately called her best friend.

"That bitch must have seduced William!" she hissed through gritted teeth.

A light laugh came from the other end. "Keep a close eye on things for me, and you won’t be disappointed."

50th Floor, Business Department

Emily Smith had just finished accompanying Michael Thompson to meet a client and was about to head to a lunch invitation.

When the elevator doors opened, she unexpectedly locked eyes with William. Standing beside him was Emma, looking smug.

"Good afternoon, Vice President Johnson," the group greeted in unison.

As Emily bowed her head in greeting, Emma leaned in and whispered, "I'm his chief secretary now. Just wait till I destroy you."

In the private dining room, Michael teased, "That new secretary seems quite familiar with you?"

"She said she’ll 'take good care' of me," Emily replied with a strained smile.

Her phone suddenly vibrated. Two words flashed on the screen: [Come out]

At the end of the hallway, William stood silhouetted against the light, a cigarette burning between his fingers.

"Vice President Johnson," she called softly.

He turned, smoke blurring his features. "Healed?" he asked.

"The doctor said it’ll scar," she murmured, lowering her gaze.

William suddenly gripped her chin, his thumb brushing over the mark. "Did it hurt?"

"Not anymore."

He chuckled darkly before biting her earlobe. "Want revenge?"

"Yes," she answered without hesitation.

"Then show me what you’ve got." His scorching breath against her neck sent a shiver down her spine.
###Chapter 20

William Johnson yanked Emily Smith into an empty private room next door, the force sending her stumbling several steps.

The door slammed shut behind them. Emily's back pressed against the cold surface.

She braced her hands against his chest, voice trembling. "Not here..."

William caged her in with one arm, his other hand gripping her chin. His hot breath fanned across her face. "Two days apart, and you've grown bold?"

"I didn't..." Her lashes fluttered, voice barely audible. "I thought you didn't want me anymore."

He stilled.

His eyes narrowed as his thumb brushed the reddened corner of her eye. "Flirting with another man, then playing the victim?"

Emily bit her lip. "You called me a thief."

A low chuckle escaped him before he suddenly nipped at her earlobe. "A heart thief."

She shuddered, fingers clutching his wrinkled shirt. "Your clothes... they'll crease..."

William's gaze darkened. He hoisted her up by the waist. "What's more important? The clothes or me?"

Her eyes glistened as she whispered, "Let me do it myself."

He stepped back with an amused scoff. "Fine. I'll watch."

......

The fallen shirt revealed brutal bruises across her back.

William's expression turned glacial. "Who did this?"

Emily shook her head, wrapping her arms around his neck. "It doesn't hurt."

The gesture shattered his restraint.

A ringing phone sliced through the tension.

When she reached for it, he pinned her in place. "Keep going."

"Hello, Michael..." Her voice quivered. "I ran into... my cousin..."

"Cousin?" William's eyes flashed dangerously as his movements turned punishing.

By the call's end, only whimpers escaped her lips.

Afterward, he fastened her buttons with deliberate slowness before gripping her chin. "Mislabel me again, and you'll regret it."

She turned away, tear-damp lashes refusing to meet his gaze.

"Tonight," William flicked cigarette ash, "remember where you belong."

Emily glared.

"Relax," his smirk turned predatory. "I'll spare you tonight."

......

Back in the dining room, everyone awaited her return.

Emily kept her head down, ears burning crimson as she picked at her food.

Upon leaving, she spotted William's group exiting.

Emma Clark froze mid-step toward a car. The door slammed shut, leaving her standing in mud-splattered skirts.

"Should we offer her a ride?" Michael asked.

Emily nodded. "You're too kind, Michael."

The descending window revealed the car's occupant. Emma's face paled. "Get lost!"

Michael floored the accelerator, spraying her with gutter water.
###Chapter 21

After work, Emily Smith went straight to the hospital to visit her sister.

By the time she left, night had fallen. She returned alone to her apartment at Jinzhou Bay No.1, greeted by complete silence.

William Johnson wasn’t home yet.

She exhaled in relief and turned on the floor lamp in the living room. The warm golden light filled the space, and she savored the quiet solitude.

Her recent audiobook recordings had been well-received, becoming a significant source of income. She couldn’t keep borrowing Daniel Chen’s studio forever, so she decided to buy her own equipment.

After extensive online research, she consulted Daniel and finally ordered an entry-level recording setup.

The payment confirmation chimed, and she stretched lazily. She hadn’t showered in two days, and though the scratches on her skin had scabbed over, the sweat from the afternoon left her feeling sticky.

She headed straight for the bathroom.

The hot water cascaded over her body as she rinsed the shampoo from her hair. Then, she heard a soft click.

The bathroom door swung open.

She spun around, water droplets flying. The tension in her shoulders eased when she recognized the intruder.

"Don’t get dressed after this," William leaned against the doorframe, his gaze roaming over her. "I’ll apply your medicine."

Then he closed the door and left.

Emily stood under the steam, her cheeks burning.

After drying her hair, she wrapped herself in a towel and stepped out. William sat at the foot of the bed, idly twisting a tube of ointment between his fingers.

"I can do it myself," she murmured.

He glanced up and patted the mattress. "Lie down."

She obeyed.

"The towel," he added.

Emily bit her lip and let it fall.

William’s breath hitched. Her delicate frame glowed like pearl under the soft light.

The medicinal oil warmed in his palm before his large hand pressed against her waist.

At first, it was just a normal massage. Then, the pressure shifted into something else entirely.

"You promised..." she protested, turning her flushed face toward him.

William cupped the back of her head and captured her lips. "So don’t take me too seriously."

......

In the early hours of the morning, he carried her to the bathroom to clean up. This time, he dutifully applied the ointment before pulling her into his arms to sleep.

A sudden vibration from her phone jolted her awake.

Half-asleep, Emily fumbled for it. The words "Sweetheart" glared brightly on the screen.

Her fingers slipped, accidentally answering the call.

"Johnson, if Emma Clark likes you so much, why do you keep her around?" A woman’s voice dripped with jealousy.

Emily froze, wide awake now.

William took the phone, his voice lazy. "Hmm. Jealous?"

"Of course!" the woman snapped. "She’s supposed to be my best friend, but she’s always eyeing my man."

"Your man?" He chuckled. "Are you sure?"

Emily held her breath. So Emma had been telling the truth—he really did have a woman he’d loved for years.

Silence stretched on the other end before the voice returned, uncertain. "You wouldn’t betray me, right?"

"Hard to say." He ended the call.

Emily tried to inch away, but he yanked her back against him.

"Awake now?" His voice was rough with sleep.

She shook her head. "No..."

"Then why answer my phone?" William rolled over, pinning her beneath him. "Looking for trouble?"

She pressed a hand to his chest. "Was that... your girlfriend?"

His eyes narrowed. "Trying to manage me now?"

She shook her head quickly.

"Good." He kissed her eyelids. "Right now, I’m yours."
###Chapter 22

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the bedroom. When Emily Smith opened her eyes, the space beside her was already empty.

Her fingers brushed against the cool sheets, still carrying a faint trace of cedarwood scent.

After freshening up, she went downstairs to find William Johnson already dressed and reading the newspaper at the dining table. Without looking up, he muttered, "Morning."

"Morning," Emily replied softly.

They finished breakfast in silence. When stepping out of Sky City apartment building, they instinctively kept their distance.

As if last night's passionate entanglement had been between two strangers.

On the subway, Emily stared blankly at the scenery flashing by outside. Her phone vibrated with a message from Lily White: [Lunch together?]

Just as she replied, the elevator arrived at her office floor.

The morning workload kept her busy. Nearing noon, she carried a stack of files to another department.

When the elevator doors opened, she saw Emma Clark leaning in the corner with an armful of documents, her face dark as thunder.

Emily immediately withdrew her foot.

"Emily Smith!" Emma shrieked. "Are you blind? Come help me!"

She quickly pressed the close button.

"Bitch!" Emma's curse was cut off by the closing doors.

During lunch break, as Emily prepared to join colleagues at the cafeteria, her phone rang.

"Come to the 67th floor immediately," Emma's haughty voice demanded.

At the executive floor, Emma shoved a pile of English documents into her arms.

"Aren't you an English major? Finish translating these by end of day."

"Quite the authority you wield, Secretary Clark."

William's voice came from behind them. Emma jumped, nearly dropping the files.

"Vice President Johnson..."

Emily kept her head down as a tall figure brushed past her.

"These are confidential documents." William tapped the files with slender fingers. "Secretary Clark, as my most trusted staff, this task falls solely to you."

He patted Emma's shoulder. "I expect the translation by tomorrow morning."

Turning away, he added without looking back, "Emily Smith, still here? Planning corporate espionage?"

In the elevator, William pressed the B1 button. "What would you like for lunch?"

"I have plans with colleagues." She hurriedly pressed the 50th floor button.

The next second, she was pulled back and pinned against the elevator wall.

"Being disobedient?" His breath warmed her ear.

"I'm... still sore there." She shrank back.

"Is that so?" He released her. "Then I'll apply medicine after lunch."

Emily: "......"

In the private room of a Michelin three-star Japanese restaurant, William leisurely wiped his hands.

"Where does it hurt? Let me see."

"It's fine now!" She shook her head hastily.

"Then come here." He undid two shirt buttons. "Feed me."

Emily fled in panic.

Back at the office building, she texted William: [It won't hurt when we're home tonight]

In his executive office, William looked at his phone, lips curling slightly.
###Chapter 23

At exactly nine o'clock in the evening, William Johnson closed the last file and stood up from his desk.

Emma Clark was still hunched over her desk, surrounded by piles of English documents. She bit the cap of her pen, her brows furrowed tightly.

William walked past without even glancing at her.

"Vice President Johnson!" Emma suddenly stood up, her voice trembling with tears.

William paused mid-step and turned to look at her. Tears streaked Emma's face, her eyes swollen like peaches.

"Speak," he said coldly.

"These documents are too difficult, I..." Fresh tears welled up in Emma's eyes.

William checked his watch. "I want the full translation by tomorrow morning." With that, he strode straight to the elevator.

As the elevator doors closed, the sound of heart-wrenching sobs echoed behind him.

The fiftieth-floor Business Department was brightly lit. Emily Smith was reviewing the final data of a contract.

"Done!" Michael Thompson slapped the table and stood up. "I'm treating everyone to late-night snacks."

The group took the elevator down to the parking garage. Lily White suddenly pointed outside the window. "Look! It's Vice President Johnson!"

Through the glass doors, William was seen helping a stunningly attractive woman into his sports car.

"Tsk tsk, that figure," Lily clicked her tongue. "If I had her looks, I'd have pounced on him ages ago."

Emily quietly averted her gaze. The sports car roared away, its taillights leaving a crimson trail in the darkness.

Her phone suddenly vibrated. The caller ID read "Emma Clark."

"Emily Smith! Get your ass to the 67th floor right now and help me translate!" A hysterical shriek came through the phone.

Emily hung up without hesitation.

By the time she returned to her apartment, it was late at night. Several delivery boxes were piled at her doorstep—new recording equipment she had ordered.

The apartment was dark and silent. Emily assembled the equipment with practiced ease, a faint smile tugging at her lips as she tested the sound.

"Daniel, the equipment is set up," she texted Daniel Chen.

They recorded until the early hours of the morning. Only when Emily's voice grew hoarse did Daniel finally urge her to sleep.

The next morning, Song Yan brought breakfast.

"Mr. Johnson didn't come home last night?" Song Yan asked casually.

Emily stirred her porridge, offering no reply. Just how many hidden mistresses did he keep in places like this?

The sound of an ambulance siren pierced the air on the walk from the subway station to the office.

Paramedics rushed out with a stretcher. Beneath the oxygen mask, Emma's face was deathly pale.

"I heard she collapsed from pulling an all-nighter translating documents..."

"Didn't Vice President Johnson take special care of her?"

The whispers reached Emily's ears, but her steps never faltered. Served her right.

For the next few days, William was nowhere to be found. Emily threw herself into her work, occasionally staying up late to record audiobooks with Daniel.

On Friday night, they worked until three in the morning. When Emily woke up the next day, her throat burned with pain.

She walked out of the bedroom barefoot, her nightgown askew, revealing one side of her collarbone.

William was sitting on the living room sofa, reviewing documents. Emma stood beside him, her head bowed.

At the sound of movement, both looked up.

Emma's pupils constricted sharply. Emily froze, the burning in her throat instantly replaced by a suffocating sensation of another kind.

###Chapter 24

Emily Smith froze the moment she pushed open the door.

William Johnson lounged lazily on the living room sofa, a cigarette dangling between his slender fingers. Beside him stood Emma Clark, her cheeks still streaked with fresh tears.

"Emily Smith?!"

Emma's shrill voice sliced through the air. Emily instinctively turned to flee.

"Stop."

William's deep voice was like an invisible shackle, rooting her feet to the spot. She slowly turned back, meeting Emma's blazing glare.

"You bitch!" Emma lunged forward, hand raised to strike.

Emily squeezed her eyes shut.

The expected slap never came. Instead, Emma's scream pierced her ears. Emily opened her eyes to see Emma sprawled on the floor, while William now stood protectively in front of her, radiating icy menace.

"William!" Emma sobbed. "Why is she here? What right does this trash have to be in your home?"

William narrowed his eyes, his voice glacial. "Emma Clark, what gives you the right to question me?"

Emma's face paled. Suddenly hysterical, she shrieked, "Does Amanda know? Does she know you're cheating on her?"

Amanda?

Emily's heart lurched. So that was the name of the "baby" in William's phone.

William chuckled darkly, stepping closer until Emma shrank back. "Of course she doesn't know. But if she finds out..." He paused. "It'll be because of you."

Emma trembled violently. "I'm Amanda's best friend! How could you do this to me?"

"Best friend?" William laughed as if it were the most ridiculous joke. "You're not worthy."

Emma's face twisted with fury and humiliation.

"Get out." William's patience snapped. "You're fired."

The door slammed shut with a deafening crash, making Emily flinch. She edged backward, but William seized her wrist.

"Running away?" His voice was low and commanding as he dragged her to the sofa and shoved her down.

Emily stared up at him in terror, her throat too dry to speak.

"Water..." she managed to croak.

William frowned, got up, and returned with a glass. Emily gulped it down, then gazed pleadingly at the empty cup.

"More?"

She nodded desperately.

This time, William didn't move. He took a slow sip himself, then patted his thigh.

Emily bit her lip and inched forward. Just as she was about to reach him, William suddenly flipped her onto her back, pinning her beneath him.

"Now," his voice rumbled in her ear. "Let's settle our accounts."
###Chapter 25

Emily Smith's voice was completely gone, every breath burning like fire.

At lunch, she stared longingly at the steaming bowl of spicy beef in front of William Johnson. Just as her chopsticks reached for it, he blocked her without hesitation.

Her eyes glistened as she held up one finger.

When he remained unmoved, she quickly raised two.

William chewed slowly, his gaze lingering on the faint redness at the corners of her eyes. The memory of her hoarse pleas in the bathroom made his throat tighten.

"Call me 'William,'" he said, setting down his chopsticks, voice low.

Emily opened her mouth, but only a whisper escaped.

"Louder," he teased.

She took a deep breath, mustering all her strength. "Will...iam..."

Satisfied, he picked up a slice of beef, rinsed it in his water glass, and held it to her lips.

Emily glared at the now-flavorless meat, cheeks puffing in frustration. She shoved rice into her mouth, clattering her bowl loudly.

He chuckled and piled bland vegetables into her bowl.

After lunch, Emily prepared to visit her sister at the hospital. The doorbell rang.

The family doctor stood at the entrance, greeting William respectfully.

"Come here," he ordered without looking up.

The moment Emily approached, he pulled her onto his lap. "Open."

After the examination, the doctor prescribed medication. The soothing lozenge eased the pain in her throat.

At the hospital, her sister's brainwaves remained flat—except for the faintest flicker when Emily spoke.

"It's just a normal response to external stimuli," the doctor said, each word like a dull knife twisting in her chest.

Around five, Daniel Chen called. "I've arranged dinner with two experienced anchors tonight. A great chance to learn."

Emily's eyes lit up. She checked the time and texted William: Something came up. I'll be back late.

At that moment, William's car idled outside the hospital. He stared at his phone, jaw tight.

When she answered his call, her voice was apologetic. "I might not be back until eight or nine."

He watched her walk past his car toward the main entrance. Hanging up, he pressed the accelerator, the black sedan following silently behind.
###Chapter 26

Outside the hospital, traffic streamed by endlessly. Emily Smith stood across the street, fiddling with her phone. She had just saved William Johnson's number when she heard a familiar voice call her name.

"Emily."

Daniel Chen's car pulled up slowly in front of her. The window rolled down, revealing his warm smile.

Emily's eyes brightened. "Daniel!"

"Get in." He tilted his head toward the passenger seat.

She opened the door and slid inside, completely unaware of the dark gaze following them from a black Range Rover parked near the hospital entrance.

The restaurant was tucked inside an elegant old mansion. Two seasoned anchors were already waiting when Daniel escorted Emily inside. They greeted her warmly and gestured for her to join them.

"So this is the talented junior you mentioned?" one of the female anchors asked, studying Emily with a smile.

Emily nodded shyly. For the next three hours, she listened intently as the veterans shared their experiences, occasionally jotting down key points in her phone's notes app.

"That's enough for today," Daniel said, checking the time. "Let me drive you back."

"No need, we'll take a cab," the two anchors declined politely.

After seeing them off, Daniel turned to Emily. "I'll take you home."

"It's fine, I can take the subway," Emily insisted, waving her hands.

Daniel had already opened the passenger door. "It's late. I wouldn't feel right letting you go alone."

When she hesitated, he teased lightly, "What, afraid I'll bite?"

Reluctantly, Emily got in. But she couldn't let Daniel know she lived in Jinzhou Bay, so she gave him the address for Xiawei Village instead.

The car stopped in front of a rundown apartment building. Emily thanked him and was about to leave when Daniel suddenly called out, "Let me know when your voice recovers."

"Okay. Drive safe," she said with a wave, watching his car disappear before hurrying toward the subway station.

It was nearly midnight by the time she returned to Jinzhou Bay. She paused at the door to steady her breathing before pushing it open quietly.

The apartment was brightly lit but eerily silent. A untouched dinner sat on the dining table, long gone cold.

Snap.

The sound of a laptop closing made her jump. William lounged on the sofa, his gaze icy. "Ten-thirty. How early."

Emily swallowed hard and headed for the kitchen. "I'll heat up the food for you."

She could feel his scorching stare burning into her back. A few minutes later, she brought the reheated dishes to the table. "It's ready."

"Come here." His voice was sharp as frost.

Emily shuffled over slowly, like a guilty child.

"Where were you?" He narrowed his eyes.

"Dinner with friends." She kept her head down, fingers twisting together.

William scoffed. "I waited for you. Didn't even eat."

"Then... do you want me to eat with you now?" she asked cautiously.

"Too late." He yanked her into his arms, his warm breath brushing her ear. "You'll have to make it up to me another way."
###Chapter 27

Emily felt like she was falling apart.

Three exhausting hours had passed. She'd given it her all, her voice now hoarse, yet William's handsome face remained icy. Collapsed on the bed, she couldn't even lift a finger.

"Continue." William loomed over her, his tone brooking no argument.

Eyes closed, Emily shook her head weakly, like a drenched kitten.

William suddenly gripped her chin, his thumb brushing her swollen lips. "Giving up already?"

She opened her eyes, tears glistening in their depths. William's gaze darkened as he leaned in, whispering by her ear, "Think about your sister."

The words stabbed Emily's heart like needles.

She jerked up, clumsily pressing her lips to his. William's eyes flashed before flipping her beneath him.

A sob finally escaped Emily. Tears rolled down her cheeks, soaking the pillow.

"Why the tears?" William paused, gently kissing them away.

"You're horrible!" Emily grabbed the pillow to hit him. "Always bullying me!"

William suddenly laughed. He snatched the pillow, pecking her nose. "Who promised to cheer me up?"

"You did this on purpose!" Emily swung her tiny fists. "I just had dinner with a friend! You can't control me!"

William caught her wrist. "You said you'd be back by nine. What happened?"

"I lost track of time!" She struggled. "I'm not your slave!"

"Lost track?" William's eyes turned glacial. "Too busy chatting with that senior, Daniel?"

Emily's crying stopped abruptly.

"You followed me?" Her eyes widened in disbelief.

William smirked. "I'm not that idle." Releasing her, he scooped her up. "Remember—when you're with me, stay away from other men."

Emily bit her lip. "What about you?"

"What?" William arched a brow. "Expecting me to stay faithful?"

She stared stubbornly, silent.

William's lips curled. "Ask me again when you've earned the right."

The bathroom door slammed shut. As water began running, Emily watched his blurred silhouette through the frosted glass, fresh tears spilling.
###Chapter 28

The night was ink-black. Emily Smith curled up alone on the small guest bed.

The vibration of her phone shattered the silence.

Fumbling, she pressed the answer button. A nurse's urgent voice came through: "Family of Emily Smith? The patient has gone into cardiac arrest—"

The phone slipped from her fingers.

Barefoot, she rushed into the walk-in closet, hastily pulling on clothes. As she stumbled toward the foyer, William Johnson's deep voice called from behind: "What's wrong?"

She whirled around, tears spilling. "My sister—"

The words caught in her throat.

Emily yanked open the door and plunged into the night. The predawn streets were empty. Trembling, she pulled out her phone to call a ride. The old device suddenly went black. Desperate, she crouched by the roadside.

A screech of brakes pierced the air.

A black Range Rover jerked to a stop in front of her. The window rolled down, revealing William's sharp profile. "Get in."

She scrambled into the back seat, voice shaking. "The doctor said... she's fading..."

William dialed a number with one hand. "Contact Professor Johnson immediately. Have him meet us at City Central Hospital."

The car tore through the empty streets.

Fifteen minutes later, Emily sprinted down the hospital corridor. The OR light still glowed. A nurse approached. "They're still working on her."

A doctor emerged, removing his mask. "Miss Smith, the patient's condition—"

The elevator dinged open.

A white-haired man strode forward, flanked by staff. Someone gasped: "It's Professor Johnson!"
###Chapter 29

The sound of steady, powerful footsteps echoed from the end of the hallway.

Emily Smith looked up to see William Johnson striding toward her with a silver-haired elder. Behind the elder trailed a group of white-coated doctors, their presence so commanding it stole the breath from the air.

She recognized the elder instantly—Professor Johnson, the foremost authority in neurosurgery.

As Professor Johnson approached, the previously noisy corridor fell silent. Doctors and nurses gathered around him, respectfully reporting the patient's condition.

"What's the blood pressure?"
"How are the pupillary responses?"

After a few brief questions, Professor Johnson led his team into the emergency room.

Only then did Emily notice William standing nearby. His suit was immaculate, exhaustion shadowing his brow, yet he remained tall and unyielding like a pine tree.

He stepped toward her and gently wiped the tear tracks from her cheeks.

"Don't be afraid."

Two simple words, yet they sent a tremor through Emily's heart.

He took her hand and guided her to a bench. The warmth of his palm inexplicably soothed her.

"Rest for a while." He patted his shoulder.

As if under a spell, Emily leaned against him. William wrapped an arm around her, his long fingers lightly stroking her hair.

The faint scent of cedarwood clung to him, and her tense nerves gradually relaxed.

Before she knew it, she had fallen into a deep sleep.

When she woke, she found herself on the sofa in the hospital room. Dawn light filtered through the window, and her sister lay quietly in bed, the monitor displaying steady vital signs.

For a moment, she thought it had all been a dream.

Then she heard low voices outside the door.

"...The blood clot is compressing the brainstem. Cardiac arrest could happen at any moment."

"Success rate of the surgery?"

That was William's voice.

"Craniotomy carries extreme risks. Even if successful, the patient may be permanently disabled."

"What do you advise?"

"Terminate treatment."

Emily shoved the door open.

"I won't give up!" Her voice rang through the hallway. "As long as my sister is still breathing, I won't give up!"

Every head turned toward her.

Surprise flickered in William's eyes before softening into a gentle smile. He stepped to her side and spoke with quiet conviction.

"If you don't give up, then neither will we."

Those words were like a beam of light piercing the darkness of Emily's world.

She gazed up at him, her eyes burning.

"And this is...?" Professor Johnson asked curiously.

"Someone very important," William answered.

Professor Johnson nodded in understanding. "I'll do my best."

"Thank you," Emily whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

William gently squeezed her trembling hand.
###Chapter 30

After her sister's condition stabilized, Emily Smith returned to Jinzhou Bay No.1 with William Johnson.

The sound of running water in the bathroom stopped. William stepped out, drying his hair, and found Emily sitting quietly at the dining table, waiting for him.

Her lashes were lowered, lost in thought. She only snapped back to reality when he approached.

"Eat," William said, pulling out a chair and sitting down.

Emily looked up at him, sincerity in her eyes. "Thank you."

William picked up his chopsticks and smirked. "Just words?"

After a brief hesitation, she stood and walked over to him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and straddled his lap.

But William turned his face away.

He gripped the nape of her neck, his voice rough. "Not sore anymore?"

Emily bit her lip, her cheeks flushing. "I can..."

William scoffed and pinched the back of her neck. "Rest today."

His apparent lack of interest made her uneasy.

Ignoring his words, she leaned in, mimicking his actions—lightly tracing his lips, his chin, then lingering at his throat.

When she tried to go lower, she felt his body react.

In the next second, William abruptly lifted her onto the dining table, caging her between his arms. "You sure?"

His voice was barely recognizable.

Emily's ears burned as she gave a soft "Mm," pressing her lips to his.

This time, William didn't hold back. He cupped the back of her head and deepened the kiss.

......

In the heat of the moment, breakfast was knocked to the floor. William carried her straight to the couch.

Afterward, he called the internal line and asked Song Yan to bring up a fresh meal.

Song Yan's heart skipped a beat at the hoarseness in his voice.

When she arrived with the food cart, freshly touched up, William answered the door. Emily was still soaking in the bath.

The apartment was thick with tension. As Song Yan cleared the dishes, she stole glances at William, who was reviewing documents on the couch.

Summoning courage, she approached. "Mr. Johnson..."

William didn't look up. "What?"

She brushed her knee against his leg. "I'd like to stay with you a little longer..."

Just then, Emily emerged from the bedroom and saw everything.

William gave Song Yan's leg a cold glance, then crooked a finger.

Song Yan eagerly leaned in, but her face paled at his whispered words. She fled in a panic.

"Come eat," William said, rising and heading to the dining area.

Emily hesitated, then simply said, "I need to go out today. I might be back late."

It was visiting day. She was going to see her father.

"Mm," William nodded. "Take the car."

Emily blinked in surprise. "How did you know where I'm going?"

"Two subway transfers, four hours one way, one hour for the visit." He checked his watch. "Be back by six."

Her eyes widened. "How—"

"Face the consequences if you're late," he cut her off.

As she was leaving, William stopped her and pointed to a new phone on the coffee table. "Take it."

"For me?" She couldn't believe it.

"Don't like it?"

Emily dashed over, kissed him, and grabbed the phone. "I'll be back by six!"

Watching her skip away, William's lips curved unconsciously.

The elevator doors opened, and Emily nearly collided with Olivia Davis.

"What are you doing here?" Olivia demanded sharply.

Before Emily could react, the apartment door opened behind her.

William stepped out and glanced at her. "She delivered documents."

"Still here?"

"Leaving now! Goodbye, Vice President Johnson, Miss Davis!" Emily quickly slipped into the elevator.
###Chapter 31

Emily Smith transferred buses three times with her arms full of shopping bags. By the time she arrived at the prison, it was already afternoon. The slanting sunlight spilled across the visitation room's glass, reflecting her slightly exhausted face.

"Dad," she called softly.

On the other side of the glass, Henry Johnson's eyes lit up as he studied his daughter. Three years apart had only made her more elegant, her features faintly reminiscent of his late wife.

"You've grown up," Henry said, his voice thick with emotion. "Did you find a job?"

Emily's fingers tightened slightly. She lowered her lashes and named a company comparable in scale to BestTech Group.

"Good, that's good." Henry nodded repeatedly before suddenly asking, "Why didn’t your grandmother and Xiaoyi come?"

"Grandma’s legs have been hurting badly." Emily’s voice was almost inaudible. "Xiaoyi... stayed home with her."

Henry didn’t question it. His younger daughter’s autism had always been the family’s heartache. Thinking of the timid child, a flicker of pain crossed his eyes.

"Your mother... still no news?"

Emily shook her head. The woman who had abandoned her family had long since started a new life in another city. She still remembered the sharpness of her mother’s voice on the phone: "Don’t drag me down!"

"I failed you all." Henry’s eyes reddened suddenly.

"We’ll wait for you." Emily pressed her hand against the glass, her fingertips turning pale.

By the time she left the prison, dusk had fallen. Returning to Sky City Apartment No. 1, the place was silent—no sign of him.

She exhaled in relief, yet an inexplicable emptiness lingered.

Late at night, her new phone screen lit up. The top trending hashtag on Weibo read: #WilliamJohnsonSeenWithRisingStar#. Clicking in, a nine-grid photo set showed the man bending to adjust the hem of a female celebrity’s dress, his gentleness painfully vivid.

Emily locked the screen abruptly.

What right did she have to care? It was just a transaction.

The next day, during the Business Department’s routine meeting, the director unexpectedly praised the contract she had drafted. Colleagues cast her looks of envy or curiosity, but Emily only smiled politely.

"Come with me to W City tomorrow," Michael Thompson stopped her after lunch. "We have an important client to meet."

Emily was about to agree when she remembered the location from the trending topic. Her fingers trembled slightly, but she nodded. "Understood."

At the hospital, caregiver Amy Green was brushing Xiaoyi’s hair. The younger sister sat motionless as a doll, showing no reaction to Emily’s arrival.

"I’ll be away on a business trip for two days," Emily murmured. "Please take good care of her."

Back in the empty apartment, she hesitated for a long time before finally sending William a WeChat message. It sank like a stone—no reply came, even late into the night.

Her voice-over work ended close to midnight. Daniel Chen complimented her rapid improvement, but Emily’s smile was strained. She opened Weibo again, and the latest trending topic stole her breath—

#WilliamJohnsonAccompaniesMengliToWCity#

In the photos, the man’s gaze at the female celebrity onstage was so tender it could melt ice. Suddenly, tomorrow’s business trip felt like a ridiculous joke.

She turned off her phone. In the darkness, her lips curled into a self-mocking smile. Jinzhou and W City were miles apart—what were the odds she’d run into them?
###Chapter 32

The flight to W City was scheduled for 8:35 AM.

At the first light of dawn, Emily Smith quietly got up and packed. Her backpack held only a change of clothes, toiletries, and her laptop—traveling light.

The subway station at 6:30 AM was empty. She arrived just in time for the first train. The forty-minute ride from Jinzhou Bay to the airport passed as she gazed absently at the brightening sky outside the window.

Michael Thompson had been waiting at the airport entrance for some time. Spotting her minimal luggage, he teased, "Little girl, is this a business trip or a spring outing?"

Emily smiled faintly and pulled out a tube of lipstick from her small bag, waving it playfully. "Here, my entire fortune."

After printing their boarding passes at the self-service kiosk, they headed straight for security. Michael shook his head at the sparse contents of her bag. "My cousin packs a whole suitcase just for makeup. And here you are."

"Efficiency," Emily said, placing her backpack in the security bin before flashing him a quick wink.

At the gate, Michael bought coffee and pastries. When she hesitated, he feigned sternness. "If you don’t eat it, I’m throwing it in the trash." Only then did Emily accept, nibbling at the bread in small bites.

The two-and-a-half-hour flight passed in a blink. A private car from their business partner took them directly to a five-star hotel. As she pushed open the door to her room, Emily was momentarily transported back seven years to a family vacation—back when her father was still alive.

After a brief rest, they headed straight to the partner company’s office. Throughout the meeting, Emily took meticulous notes, her eyes occasionally lighting up with focus. Michael noticed and nodded approvingly to himself.

By evening, the meeting concluded. Michael politely declined the partner’s dinner invitation. "Come on," he said, patting Emily’s shoulder. "Let me take you for authentic W City cuisine. Consider it a celebration of your first business trip."

The dishes at the century-old restaurant made Emily’s mouth water. During their post-dinner stroll, she caught an unexpected glimpse through the window of a Hermès flagship store—William Johnson lounging lazily with a magazine, opposite him a sunglasses-clad Mia Harris.

"Isn’t that—" Michael began, but Emily had already frozen in place. Instinct screamed at her to flee, but an enthusiastic Michael pulled her into the store before she could react.

"Close the store," Mia’s displeased voice rang out.

Michael stepped forward with practiced ease to exchange pleasantries. Emily lingered near the entrance, her blood turning to ice. When William’s gaze lifted and met hers, her breath hitched.

"Subordinate," William introduced curtly, his eyes lingering on Emily for a beat too long.

Mia studied Emily with amused interest. "Help me pick a bag," she commanded, gesturing to over twenty displayed handbags. "Tell me which ones are ugly."

Emily randomly pointed at three. Without hesitation, Mia waved a hand. "Except these three, I’ll take them all." She turned to William with a coy smile. "You’re paying, darling."

The moment the black-gold card was handed over, Emily averted her eyes. Suddenly, Mia grabbed a Constance bag and shoved it toward her. "Here, take it."

"No, thank you," Emily said, taking a half-step back.

Mia laughed. "William, your subordinate is quite the character." Her gaze slid meaningfully toward him. "Even Hermès isn’t good enough for her."

William merely smiled without comment. Sensing the tension, Michael quickly made their excuses. Emily didn’t look back as she bolted from the store, the night air cooling her flushed cheeks.

By the time Michael caught up, she was already hailing a taxi. The moment the door closed behind her, she finally exhaled—long and slow.
###Chapter 33

"Emily."

Michael Thompson quickened his pace to catch up outside the store, grasping her slender wrist. She had been walking so fast she nearly collided with his chest.

"Are you angry?" He tilted his head to study her face.

Emily Smith shook her head, her hair swaying lightly. "No."

Michael smiled and ruffled her hair. "Good." He paused. "But... did you know Vice President Johnson before?"

"Yes," she replied softly. "He was my cousin's classmate. We met before I joined the company."

"I see." Understanding dawned on his face as he took her hand. "Still want to keep shopping?"

Emily hesitated briefly. "Let's walk a little more."

Inside the Hermès boutique, William Johnson snapped his lighter shut with a sharp click. Through the glass window, the sight of the two figures standing so close made his jaw tighten.

He had arranged this business trip specifically for her, and this was how she repaid him—

His tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, his gaze darkening.

By the time they returned to the hotel, it was late at night. As Emily and Michael waited for the elevator in the lobby, a sudden commotion broke out.

At the center of the crowd, William had his arm wrapped around the slender waist of Mia Harris, guiding her toward the private elevator reserved for the presidential suite.

"What a coincidence. Vice President Johnson is staying here too," Michael remarked casually as the elevator doors closed.

Emily pressed her lips together, silent.

When they reached their floor, Michael reminded her, "Seven-thirty tomorrow morning. Meet me at the restaurant."

"Okay. Goodnight," she nodded.

The moment her door shut, Emily leaned against it and exhaled heavily. The image of William with his arm around Mia flashed through her mind, and she gave a bitter, self-deprecating smile.

Fifty thousand dollars—worth less than a Hermès bag.

His pity meant nothing.

The sound of running water filled the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, Emily had just stepped out when the door beeped—

William strode in.

"Ah!" She gasped, then immediately clapped a hand over her mouth.

The man leaned lazily against the wall, his tie hanging loosely around his neck. He crooked a finger. "Come here."

Emily shook her head, backing away until her legs hit the edge of the bed, sending her tumbling onto it.

William chuckled, slowly undoing the buttons of his shirt as he advanced. She scrambled backward, but he pinned her down effortlessly.

His tie wound around her delicate wrists, binding them to the headboard in seconds.

"William, you—"

Before she could finish, his lips crashed down on hers.

"What else would I want from you?" he murmured against her ear, his scorching breath making her shiver.

Emily struggled desperately, but his grip was unyielding.

"I'll scream!" she threatened, her voice trembling.

"Go ahead," he taunted, nipping at her earlobe.

The doorbell rang.

"Ding-dong—"

"Emily?" Michael's voice came through the door. "Are you okay?"

She froze. "I—I'm fine! Room service just dropped something off... I'm about to shower!"

"Call me if you need anything." His footsteps faded away.

William smirked, tracing a finger over her quivering lips. "Shall we continue?"
###Chapter 34

Emily initially resisted, but soon became active under William's guidance.

The bathroom lights shimmered through the steam. As William carried her into the bathtub, his fingers lingered at her waist. Her skin felt like the finest silk beneath his touch.

"Don't..." Emily shrank back when she sensed his intention. "We have to get up early tomorrow."

William chuckled darkly, pulling her back with one long arm. He tilted her chin with slender fingers, brushing his lips against hers. "You started this fire. Shouldn't you put it out?"

Emily closed her eyes, pretending to sleep. "Can't be put out," she murmured.

"Ten minutes," he whispered against her earlobe.

She shook her head, but he pressed her against the edge of the bathtub. As warm water rippled around them, she finally surrendered to his advances.

Afterward, William kissed her with satisfaction. "Who said it couldn't be put out?"

Too exhausted to speak, Emily curled against him like a contented kitten, water droplets still clinging to her lashes.

Back in bed, William toyed with her hair. "Stay away from Michael Thompson."

Half-asleep, Emily mumbled an acknowledgment.

"Like Hermès?" he asked.

She gave another drowsy "Mmm," not really hearing him.

When the morning alarm sounded, William was already gone. Only the lingering scent of fir on the pillow and the evidence in the trash bin remained from last night's passion.

Emily smiled wryly at herself—until she spotted the black card on the nightstand.

Her phone buzzed with William's message: [Buy whatever you want]

She set the phone down and headed straight for the bathroom.

While packing, Michael suddenly stared blankly at the hotel entrance.

"What's wrong?" Emily asked.

"Thought I saw the eldest Johnson heir," Michael frowned, then laughed. "Probably mistaken."

After a full day of factory inspections and meetings, they went straight to the airport. While waiting, Emily quietly paid the bill, making Michael shake his head. "The company can afford this."

They landed late at night. Emily declined Michael's offer to drive her home, only to see William's missed calls and texts when she turned on her phone.

[Call me after landing]

After hesitating, she dialed the number.

"Come out. License plate 88188," William said before hanging up.

A black Rolls-Royce waited silently by the curb. Emily opened the door to find William resting against the seat with closed eyes.

As the partition lowered, he patted his thigh. "Get on."

Emily obeyed, settling onto his lap. He gripped her chin. "Know how long I've waited?"

"I didn't ask you to wait," she whispered.

William's eyes narrowed dangerously as his hand tightened around her waist. "Your move or mine?"
###Chapter 35

Emily Smith jolted awake from her sleep.

William Johnson's hand had already slipped beneath her nightgown, his fingertips burning with heat.

"What are you doing?" Her eyes flew open.

William wore an innocent expression. "You were the one who moved closer first."

Emily wanted to argue, but he flipped her over, pinning her beneath him.

Morning light filtered through the curtains, illuminating the darkness in his eyes.

Afterward, Emily fled to the guest bathroom like a startled deer.

The water rushed over her skin as she tried to wash away the lingering scent of sandalwood.

When she pushed open the closet door, she froze.

The once-empty wardrobe was now neatly lined with Hermès bags.

Every style and color matched the ones Mia Harris had purchased that night.

She took two steps back to check the door number.

Yes, this was definitely her closet.

"Could it be...?" She recalled the entertainment news she'd seen last night.

Mia Harris had been attacked and hospitalized late at night, yet William this morning...

Grace Lee's gaze while delivering breakfast made her skin crawl.

Those eyes were like knives, yet also like honey—complex and impossible to decipher.

On the subway, her phone buzzed with a sudden notification.

[Famous Actress Mia Harris Hospitalized After Attack—Rumored Heartbreak]

The accompanying photo showed Mia being helped into the hospital, her face hidden behind sunglasses and a mask.

Emily's finger hovered over the screen.

The next headline was even more explosive:

[Exclusive: Mia Harris and BestTech's Second Young Master Rumored to Have Split—Insider Reveals...]

Just as she was about to read further, her phone vibrated again.

A bank deposit alert:

[Amount Received: $168,312.38]

Emily's eyes widened. She counted the digits three times.

One hundred sixty-eight thousand!

This was her audiobook earnings from last month.

With trembling fingers, she opened her editor's message:

[You're amazing, sweetheart! Next month will be even better~]

Tears blurred her vision.

She immediately shared the news with Daniel Chen.

[Congratulations. This is just the beginning.] His reply came swiftly.

Emily wiped her tears and dashed off the subway as it reached her stop.

The sunlight warmed her skin.

......

67th floor, BestTech Tower.

The office door was flung open.

Alexander Johnson stormed in, his face dark with fury.

"Olivia Davis attacked Mia. Are you going to do anything about it?"

William didn't look up. "I know."

"And you're just sitting here?" Alexander slammed his palm on the desk. "Make her apologize!"

William finally lifted his gaze.

"Brother," he said with a faint smile, "wasn't it you who told me to 'take care' of Miss Harris?"

Alexander's expression stiffened.

"Now the whole city knows she's mine," William closed the file in front of him. "Don't pretend you don't know why Olivia did this."

The air turned to ice.
###Chapter 36

Olivia Davis's obsession with William Johnson had long been an open secret in their social circle. The Davis heiress never concealed her feelings. Every time she saw William, the fire in her eyes could scorch anyone who dared meet her gaze.

"I asked you to take care of Mengli, not to parade your affection with her all over the headlines." Alexander Johnson pushed open the office door, his expression dark with displeasure.

William's slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk, a playful smirk curling his lips. "Brother, if I hadn't made such a spectacle, how would your fiancée believe it was me—not you—who was involved with Miss Shi?"

"You—" Alexander choked on his words, veins bulging at his temples.

"So, brother, have you figured out how to handle this?" William rose leisurely, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

Alexander shot him a furious glare before slamming the door behind him.

......

Emily Smith was in an exceptionally good mood. She clutched her phone, repeatedly checking the bank transfer notification, unable to suppress the smile tugging at her lips. In the office, her radiant grin was like a ray of sunshine, lifting the spirits of everyone around her.

On the subway, she wore headphones, carefully dissecting the tone of a novel character, occasionally murmuring lines under her breath. Passersby couldn’t help but glance at her, drawn in by her focused demeanor.

"Aunt Amy, this is for you." In the hospital room, Emily handed a carefully chosen gift to the caregiver. Warmth flooded her heart at the woman's delighted expression.

Sitting by her sister's bed, she massaged her limbs while softly sharing recent good news. The success of her voice-over work gave her hope—perhaps her sister's medical expenses would soon be covered.

On the subway ride home, an entertainment news alert caught her attention. The screen displayed a striking photo of William holding flowers at the hospital. She stared at it for a long moment before quietly closing the tab.

The apartment was eerily silent. Emily turned on her recording equipment, pouring all her energy into work. It wasn’t until the early hours that she finally rubbed her sore neck and crawled into bed.

During Friday’s morning meeting, Michael Thompson sent a group chat notification about a team dinner. Colleagues flooded the chat with birthday wishes, and only then did Emily realize it was their supervisor’s birthday.

At lunch, she made a special trip to the mall. After careful consideration, she settled on a sleek, minimalist lighter. Though pricey, she felt it was worth it to show her gratitude for Michael’s guidance.

"Boss, this is..." When delivering documents that afternoon, Emily placed the elegantly wrapped box on Michael’s desk.

He arched a brow, surprise flickering in his eyes.

"I just wanted to thank you for your guidance these past few months." Emily smiled, her dimples faintly visible. "Happy birthday."

Michael picked up the lighter, turning it over in his palm. The metallic finish gleamed coldly under the light. His gaze lingered on the bright-eyed girl before him, his Adam’s apple bobbing slightly.

"I love it," he said, his voice tight.

The evening dinner was lively. At the karaoke bar, laughter and clinking glasses filled the air. Though Michael drank plenty, his eyes remained sharp.

"Emily." He called out to her as the group dispersed. In the night breeze, a cigarette dangled between his fingers while his other hand toyed with the lighter.

She turned, moonlight casting a soft silver glow over her.

"Do you know what it means when a woman gives a man a lighter?" Michael’s voice was low, almost intimate in the quiet dark.
###Chapter 37

"What?" Emily froze. "Michael, I—"

"Damn it! Emily, it's really you, you bitch!"

Before Emily could finish, a furious roar erupted.

Her entire body trembled as she whirled around.

David's twisted face came into view.

He charged toward them with several friends, his eyes burning with rage.

Emily's face turned deathly pale.

She grabbed Michael's arm. "Run, Michael!"

"Emily, what's going on?" Michael stood firm, gripping her instead.

"Michael—"

"Got dumped by William already, slut?" David was already in front of them.

"Watch your mouth!" Michael, fueled by alcohol, shielded Emily behind him and pointed his cigarette at David.

David sneered. "Emily, you're desperate enough for this trash now? Did he—"

"Bam!"

Michael's fist connected with David's face.

David staggered back, then roared, "Get him!"

The group of young men swarmed forward.

Michael, in his thirties, was no match for them.

Within moments, he was pinned to the ground.

Emily's hands shook as she dialed emergency services.

Hanging up, she screamed and lunged forward, shoving David away. "Take it out on me!"

Caught off guard, David fell hard.

He scrambled up and grabbed Emily's chin.

"Breaking up with me?" His face contorted. "You cheat on me and think you can walk away?"

"You betrayed me first!" Emily struggled.

"Betrayed?" David laughed cruelly. "Who do you think you are? I was doing you a favor by touching you!"

"I called the police!" Tears welled in Emily's eyes from the pain.

"The police?" David raised his hand. "I'll kill you first!"

"Aah—"

The expected slap never came.

A black Rolls-Royce screeched to a halt nearby.

The door flew open as a figure dashed out, kicking David away.

Everyone froze.

William stood under the streetlight like an avenging angel.

Without glancing at the others, he pulled Emily into his arms.

Bodyguards swiftly restrained the rest.

William lifted Emily's chin. "Where are you hurt?"

She shook her head, trying to break free.

"Stay still," he commanded coldly, his gaze shifting to David.

David tried to run.

A bodyguard's flying kick sent him crashing down again with a howl.

The others stood paralyzed with fear.
###Chapter 38
The piercing wail of police sirens split the night air as two patrol cars screeched to a halt, their flashing red and blue lights glaring against the darkness.

Officers emerged swiftly from the vehicles. The lead officer immediately snapped to attention upon seeing William Johnson. "Vice President Johnson, are you unharmed?"

William kept one arm firmly around Emily Smith's waist while gesturing toward David Brown's group with his chin. "I'm fine. They're the troublemakers here."

He turned to Sam Wilson with a curt order. "Take Michael Thompson to the hospital for a full examination."

"Understood." Sam immediately steadied the swaying Michael.

The officers moved with practiced efficiency, restraining David and his companions. Emily struggled to check Michael's injuries but found herself trapped in William's unyielding embrace.

"Michael, how bad is it?" she called out anxiously instead.

Michael blinked drunkenly, his bleary gaze shifting between Emily and William. He shook his head as if to clear it. "Emily... you and Mr. Johnson—"

William cut him off with an icy glare before dragging Emily toward his car. He wrenched the passenger door open and shoved her inside.

The door slammed shut with a deafening crash.

Emily pressed against the window, locking eyes with Michael. Before she could speak, the car shot forward like an arrow released from its bow.

The sudden acceleration threw her forward. William's arm shot out just in time to prevent her head from hitting the dashboard.

"Seatbelt," he commanded coldly.

Emily silently complied, staring down at her lap.

The air inside the car turned glacial. William glanced at her through the rearview mirror before abruptly braking and pulling over.

"What exactly did I warn you about?" His fingers tapped impatiently against the steering wheel as he turned to pin her with his gaze.

Emily looked up blankly. "What?"

William let out a humorless laugh, tongue pressing against his cheek. "I told you to stay away from Michael. Did my words mean nothing to you?"

She bit her lip before suddenly changing the subject. "Can you do me a favor?"

William's eyes narrowed. "Speak."

"David's completely unhinged," she said, voice trembling. "Can you... make sure he stays behind bars longer?"

One eyebrow arched. "Now you're scared? What possessed you to date that trash in the first place?"

Emily clenched her fists in her lap, silent.

"Why should I help you?" He leaned in suddenly, his breath hot against her ear.

"Name your price." She closed her eyes.

A low chuckle escaped him as he restarted the engine. Over the roar of the motor, he tossed out one final remark. "Remember those words."

The black sports car vanished down the street like a phantom swallowed by the night.
###Chapter 39

Emily's fingertips still trembled slightly as the car entered the underground garage of Jinzhou Bay No.1.

In the elevator, William stood beside her with one hand in his pocket, his tie already loosened. His gaze drifted to her flushed earlobe, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

The moment they entered the apartment, he pinned her against the foyer wall. His palm pressed beside her head as his warm breath brushed her neck.

"Missed me?" His deep voice held a teasing note.

Emily tilted her face up and kissed his Adam's apple. Her fingers deftly unbuttoned his shirt, accidentally grazing his toned abs.

William suddenly gripped the nape of her neck, pulling her back slightly. He narrowed his eyes. "You've been drinking?"

"Just a little." She rose on tiptoes, mimicking him by lightly biting his chin.

With a low chuckle, he suddenly swept her off her feet. Emily gasped, instinctively wrapping her legs around his waist.

At the bar, William opened a bottle of red wine with one hand. He took a swig before tilting her chin, slowly transferring the wine into her mouth.

The dark liquid trickled down her pale neck, disappearing beneath her collar. His lips followed, lingering at her collarbone.

"Wait..." She panted, pushing weakly against him. "I haven't showered yet..."

He captured her hand and pressed it against his chest. "Perfect timing. We'll do it together."

...

The next morning, Emily was jolted awake by a shrill phone ring.

Still half-asleep, she heard William answer.

"William, we agreed you'd accompany me for my wedding dress fitting today."

The woman's voice came through the receiver crystal clear. Emily instantly woke up but kept her eyes closed, pretending to sleep.

"Be there in thirty." William hung up decisively and got dressed.

The moment the door closed, Emily opened her eyes. She stared blankly at the ceiling before reaching for her phone to call Michael.

"Boss, how are you?"

Michael's cheerful laughter came through. "Just a minor injury. Are you okay?"

Emily clenched the bedsheet. "I'm coming to see you."

After hanging up, she quickly freshened up and changed. At the door, she bumped into Song Yan pushing a breakfast cart.

"Breakfast specially ordered by Mr. Johnson." Song Yan smiled meaningfully.

Emily glanced at the exquisite spread and suddenly changed her mind, sitting down to eat. She took her time, ignoring Song Yan's probing stare.

"You and Mr. Johnson... aren't just acquaintances, are you?" Song Yan finally blurted.

Emily looked up with a faint smile. "He pays, I sleep with him. Fair trade."

Song Yan stiffened, clearly unprepared for such bluntness.

"Women should have some self-respect," Song Yan muttered.

The elevator dinged perfectly timed. Emily dabbed her lips elegantly and stood, tossing over her shoulder, "Thanks for your concern."

Her back remained ramrod straight until the elevator doors fully closed, only then allowing a trace of exhaustion to show.
###Chapter 40

Emily Smith walked into the hospital elevator, clutching a fruit basket. Her fingers absently traced the handle as the numbers climbed toward the seventh floor—Michael Thompson's ward.

The elevator dinged open.

Michael was propped against his bed, scrolling through his phone. When he saw her, he set it aside with a grin. "You didn't have to bring anything."

"It's the least I could do." She placed the basket on the nightstand, her gaze lingering on the bruises on his face. "What did the doctor say?"

"Just superficial wounds. I'll be discharged by Monday." He waved it off. "The police said David Brown is covering all expenses—plus a hefty compensation."

Her eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Would I lie?" He gave her a knowing look. "I suspect Vice President Johnson pulled some strings."

At the mention of William Johnson, her fingers twitched. She lowered her lashes. "What do you want for lunch? I'll grab something."

"Not yet." He gestured for her to sit. After a pause, he ventured, "Emily, about you and Vice President Johnson..."

She met his gaze evenly. "It's strictly professional. I do what he asks." A beat. "Including sleeping with him."

Michael fell silent. The memory of spotting William with Olivia Davis at the Hermès boutique suddenly made sense.

"Were you that desperate for money?" he blurted.

"Past tense." She smiled faintly. "Not anymore."

He chuckled dryly. "Right. Being with Vice President Johnson—"

"We both get what we need." She cut him off, dimples appearing. "Can you keep this between us, Michael?"

"Of course." He agreed readily, then joked, "Might need you to put in a good word for me someday."

After leaving his room, Emily headed to her sister's VIP ward. The girl was asleep. She set down the fruit quietly and watched her for a while.

By noon, she exited the hospital and grabbed a quick noodle lunch nearby. As she paid, she remembered she was running low on sanitary napkins.

A department store stood a block away, its supermarket in the basement. Riding the escalator down, her gaze drifted to the glass elevator at the center of the atrium.

Inside, William stood impeccably dressed in his suit, Olivia clinging to his arm. The girl rose on her toes and planted a kiss on his cheek.

Emily jerked her eyes away. The escalator reached the basement, and she mechanically stepped into the supermarket.

She only picked up one pack of sanitary napkins before checking out. At the register, her phone rang.

"Daniel?" she answered.

"Want to come over and record today? I'm free," came Daniel Chen's warm voice.

"No need," she declined flatly. "I'm heading home. We'll connect online later."

Hanging up, she walked out of the mall, the midday sun stinging her eyes.
###Chapter 41

William Johnson hadn't returned to No.1 Jinzhou Bay for two days. Emily Smith stayed in the apartment, quietly recording audiobooks for two days straight.

After straining her voice during the last recording session, she'd learned her lesson. Now she always kept a cup of warm honey water nearby, taking occasional sips to soothe her throat.

The Sunday night recording session lasted until past eleven. The moment she slipped under the covers, a familiar cramping pain twisted through her lower abdomen.

Her period was coming.

She got up to put on a sanitary napkin before lying back down. But the pain only intensified, like someone wringing a towel inside her belly.

Half an hour later, she had no choice but to take the painkillers prescribed by her doctor. The bitter taste lingered as the pill slid down her throat.

As the medication took effect, she finally drifted into a groggy sleep.

In her half-conscious state, she suddenly felt a warm body press against her back. A man's large hands turned her over and slipped under her pajamas with practiced ease.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the slap cut through the darkness. Emily jolted awake, her fingertips still tingling from the contact with his cheek.

The air froze.

She could feel his breathing grow heavier, the warmth of his exhales burning against her neck. Her eyelashes fluttered as she squeezed her eyes shut.

The next instant, his previously gentle touch turned rough.

"William!" She curled into a defensive ball. "I'm on my period. It hurts."

His hand had already reached lower, brushing against the edge of the sanitary napkin. His movements halted abruptly.

Only their ragged breaths filled the darkness.

With a soft click, the bedside lamp flickered on. Emily immediately buried her face in the pillow like a startled ostrich.

"Hit me and then play dead?" William's voice carried a dangerous edge. "You're the first person who's ever dared to slap me."

A muffled reply came from the pillow. "I was half-asleep..."

"Awake now?" He leaned down, his hot breath grazing the back of her ear. "Tell me, how are you going to make it up to me?"

Emily stayed silent, pretending to be dead.

Her ankle received a light but firm kick. "Talk."

"Do whatever you want." She gave up resisting.

William chuckled darkly, his lips nearly touching her earlobe. "How about a bloody battle?"

Emily's hand shot up again, but this time he caught her wrist effortlessly.

"Getting addicted to hitting me?" His voice had dropped to a rough whisper.

She continued playing dead, fingers unconsciously clutching the sheets.

Noticing how she kept one hand pressed to her stomach, William suddenly released her and got out of bed. His footsteps faded as he walked away, disappearing into the living room.

Emily slowly lifted her head from the pillow. The chandelier on the ceiling made her eyes sting.

Was he really letting her off that easily?

The pain in her abdomen grew more pronounced in the silence. Tossing and turning, she couldn't fall asleep, so she quietly slipped out of bed.

The motion-activated hallway lights flickered on with each step she took. The sound of running water came from the kitchen.
###Chapter 42

The moment Emily pushed open the door, the rich aroma of ginger and brown sugar tea enveloped her.

She froze mid-step, wondering if she was hallucinating.

Taking a deep breath, she confirmed the familiar scent was real.

A faint sound came from the kitchen.

Tiptoeing closer, she saw William's tall figure standing by the stove.

His slender fingers gripped a spoon as he stirred the boiling ginger slices in the pot.

"Awake?"

William didn't turn around, his voice deep.

Emily stood rooted to the spot, watching him expertly strain the tea into a porcelain bowl.

"Come here."

He leaned against the counter, his gaze intense.

She shuffled forward, her fingers trembling slightly as she accepted the bowl.

"When did you buy all this?"

Her voice was soft, the steam obscuring his expression.

William chuckled, pulling her into his arms with one swift motion.

"Does it matter?"

The rim touched her lips, and she instinctively flinched.

"It's hot..."

Before she could finish, a light flick landed on her forehead.

"Clumsy."

His tone was dismissive, but he took the bowl and blew on it gently.

Emily stole a glance at his tense profile, her heart skipping a beat.

As she finished the last sip, warmth suddenly pressed against her lips.

William's kiss caught her off guard.

"Too sweet."

He murmured against her mouth, his breath scorching.

Her fingers clutched his collar as his grip around her waist tightened abruptly.

Just when she thought something more would happen, he suddenly released her.

"Sleep."

He turned and walked away, his back rigid.

Emily stared at the tips of his reddened ears and burst into laughter.

The next morning, the door swung open violently.

William barged in, damp from his shower, water still dripping from his hair.

"Feeling better?"

He knelt on the mattress, his towel barely hanging on.

Emily pulled the covers tighter and shrank back.

"S-still hurts..."

Her voice faltered as her gaze darted around.

William narrowed his eyes dangerously.

"Liar."

In one swift motion, he yanked the covers away and scooped her up.

"Bathroom or here?"

Emily kicked her legs in protest.

"I choose option three!"

William nipped at her earlobe.

"Denied."

Three hours later.

Emily collapsed onto the bed, tears welling as she weakly kicked him.

"Bastard!"

William caught her ankle, grinning wickedly.

"Needs more practice."

Furious, she swung her hand and slapped him.

The sharp sound left them both stunned.

William's expression darkened, but her eyes reddened first.

"Even now..."

She burrowed under the covers, her voice muffled.

William stared at the lump in the sheets before sighing in defeat.
###Chapter 43

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, startling Emily Smith awake. She glanced at the alarm clock and panicked.

"Oh no!"

She sprang out of bed like a fish leaping from water. Skipping breakfast, she rushed through her morning routine and dashed out the door. William Johnson's calls faded behind her as she ignored them completely.

A black Rolls-Royce pulled up smoothly before the company building. Out of breath, Emily arrived just in time to see William stepping out alongside an elegant, poised woman.

"Good morning, Mr. Johnson!"
"Morning."

Colleagues paused to greet them. William nodded slightly while the woman offered a polished smile. They walked side by side toward the private elevator, their retreating figures forming a perfect match.

"Emily?"

A gentle tap on her shoulder snapped her from her thoughts. Michael Thompson stood behind her, his complexion restored to healthy color.

"Boss! You're discharged already?" She examined him in surprise.

Michael spun playfully. "Do I look like a patient to you?"

"Let me treat you to lunch," Emily suggested. "To celebrate your recovery."

"Sure. What are we having?"

"How about Cantonese? Light and nourishing."

Michael had hoped for a private meal, but Emily invited the entire team. These colleagues had supported her rapid growth over the past month.

All nine team members adored the newcomer. Sweet-faced yet humble and eager to learn, the recent graduate naturally won hearts with her measured approach.

Michael had already entrusted her with independent small projects. Now Emily meticulously reviewed her first solo contract.

"Boss, is there an issue with my contract?" she asked nervously when summoned to his office.

Michael turned his computer screen toward her with a smile. "Solid overall, but some details could be refined." He pointed at the display. "Adding a clause here would improve it."

Emily leaned in attentively. Michael genuinely wanted to mentor her, sharing knowledge unreservedly. Engrossed in professional discussion, neither noticed the workday had ended.

On the desk, Emily's phone vibrated repeatedly. The caller ID flashed "Big Boss" before going dark again.

In the underground garage, William stared at his unresponsive screen, his frown deepening. He pushed the car door open and headed straight for the Business Department on the 50th floor.

Scattered overtime workers gaped at the CEO's unexpected appearance, forgetting their greetings. William's sharp ears caught that familiar voice—usually soft and melodious, but capable of melting bones in intimate moments.

Following the sound, he saw two heads bent close together through the glass door. Strands of Emily's hair even brushed against Michael's shoulder.

William's expression darkened instantly. He turned on his heel and left.

"What's wrong?" Emily sensed something amiss, but saw only an empty hallway when she looked back.

Michael withdrew his gaze. "Nothing. Let's continue."
###Chapter 44

Emily Smith spent nearly forty minutes in Michael Thompson's office before emerging.

She had just sat down to revise the contract when her phone screen lit up.

Picking it up, she saw William Johnson's missed call and two WeChat messages.

[Meet me in the basement parking after work.]
[Where are you?]

Eight minutes separated the two messages. The missed call had come half an hour earlier.

She immediately called him back.

The phone rang endlessly with no answer.

She sent a message: [I'm sorry, I didn't see your messages earlier.]

No response.

After finishing the contract revisions, she tried calling William again. Still no answer.

Emily sighed and went straight to the hospital after work.

In the ward, Amy Green delivered bad news: the surgery scheduled for tomorrow had been abruptly canceled.

"Professor Johnson said it's postponed. No new date yet."

Emily's chest tightened. She immediately called William again.

Still no answer.

Biting her lip, she sent another message: [Can my sister's surgery still be arranged?]

Ten minutes passed. Her phone screen remained dark.

What was this man's problem?

Just because she hadn't replied fast enough?

Rubbing her temples, Emily decided to return to Jinzhou Bay early to wait for him.

But for three whole days, William seemed to have vanished.

On Thursday morning, Michael called her into his office.

"This contract was specifically requested by Vice President Johnson." He handed her a folder. "Deliver it to him."

Emily took the file. "Aren't you coming?"

Michael smiled meaningfully. "It's your project. You know the details best."

She understood his implication, but this time, she genuinely needed to see William.

Her sister's surgery couldn't wait any longer.

During the elevator ride, her heartbeat quickened with each passing second.

Ding—

The doors opened, and the first person she saw was Grace Lee.

The newly appointed chief secretary was elegantly instructing colleagues.

Grace glanced at her briefly before returning to her tasks.

Emily waited quietly.

"Yes?" Grace finally spoke.

"Emily Smith from the Business Department. Here to deliver a contract."

Grace reached out, but a deep voice suddenly came from the vice president's office:

"Come in."

William stood at the door, his expression unreadable. After a brief glance, he turned back inside.

Grace's eyes flickered with surprise before she smiled. "And you are?"

"Emily Smith."

"Vice President Johnson is calling you. Go ahead." Grace's smile was knowing.

Taking a deep breath, Emily walked toward the half-open office door.
###Chapter 45
The office was chilled by the powerful air conditioning.

William Johnson's slender fingers danced across the keyboard, the blue glow from the screen illuminating his chiseled profile. His brows were slightly furrowed as he stared intently at the monitor, radiating an aura that warned others to keep their distance.

Emily Smith entered quietly, her high heels making no sound on the plush carpet. She extended a folder with both hands. "Vice President Johnson, the MJ overseas cooperation contract."

The typing continued without pause.

Emily remained perfectly still, holding out the document. Her beige blazer accentuated her fair complexion. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting delicate shadows on her eyelashes.

Ten minutes passed. Her arms began to ache.

After fifteen minutes, her fingertips trembled slightly.

Finally, William hit send and leaned back into his leather chair. His gaze lifted to her shaking hands.

"Tired?" His voice was deep.

Emily pressed her lips together. "Yes."

Unexpectedly, William patted his thigh. "Come here."

She stubbornly kept the folder raised. "Please review the contract first."

The air grew heavy with tension.

William finally took the file. The sound of turning pages echoed in the silent office. After a quick scan, he fired off several challenging questions in rapid English.

Emily answered fluently, switching effortlessly between languages.

As she finished the last response, she took half a step back. "If there are no further questions, I'll take my leave."

William snapped the folder shut. "Stop."

Emily had already turned away, continuing toward the door.

The screech of chair legs against the floor made her heart race. She quickened her pace.

Two steps from freedom—

A warm hand seized her waist. The world spun as she found herself pinned against the door. William's presence overwhelmed her as he gripped her chin, his breath hot against her skin.

BANG!

The slamming door made several secretaries outside jump in their seats.
###Chapter 46

His dark eyes gleamed as his thumb brushed her flushed earlobe. "Throwing a tantrum?"

Emily Smith turned her head away, lashes fluttering. "Vice President Johnson, it's working hours."

Her fingers tightened around the files, knuckles turning white.

William Johnson chuckled, his warm breath grazing her neck. "Since when do we care about time and place?"

His long fingers tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet his gaze.

Emily suddenly lifted her eyes, clear and composed. "We absolutely should. After all, you only bought my nights."

"Oh?" He raised a brow, fingertips trailing down to her collarbone. "Name your price for now, then."

"No." She took half a step back. "I'm on the clock."

The man's gaze darkened instantly. He seized her slender waist.

As his heated lips descended, Emily pressed a hand against his chest in panic. "It's my time of the month."

The air froze.

William stilled, his Adam's apple bobbing. After a long pause, he released her and leisurely adjusted his cufflinks. "Get out."

Emily didn't look back as she yanked the door open.

Grace Lee from the secretary's office nearly dropped her coffee at the sight of Emily's reddened eyes and slightly swollen lips.

Emily splashed cold water on her face in the restroom when her phone buzzed.

A message from Michael Thompson: Any issues with the contract?

She took a deep breath before replying: Vice President Johnson didn't mention anything.

No sooner had she returned to her desk than the intercom rang. Michael's voice carried undisguised curiosity: "Come to my office."

"Manager Wu will review the quarterly data next week." Michael handed her a stack of reports, feigning casualness. "Anything unusual happen on the 57th floor this morning?"

Emily accepted the files. "Just routine handover procedures."

At lunch, Robert Miller from Finance slid into their table with his tray.

"You must be the new hire," Robert said, eyes fixed on Emily. "I'm Robert Miller from Finance."

Lily White kicked Tom Brown under the table.

"Emily Smith." She offered a polite smile before focusing on her soup.

Robert seized the chance to push a stew toward her. "This is good for women's health."

Just then, a commotion erupted at the entrance. William entered with Grace in tow, his gaze turning icy as it swept over their corner table.

Robert was eagerly serving Emily more food. "There's an art exhibition this weekend—"

"Excuse me." Emily abruptly stood. "I forgot some documents."

As she hurried away, she could feel a pair of eyes burning into her back.

In the executive dining box, William slammed his chopsticks down.

"Vice President Johnson?" Grace asked tentatively. "Is the food not to your liking?"

He straightened his suit jacket and rose. "Move the afternoon meeting forward."

Passing through the main hall, he spotted Robert grinning at his phone. William narrowed his eyes and turned to Grace. "Audit Robert Miller's expense reports."

Grace blinked. "Now?"

"Immediately."
###Chapter 47

The June downpour arrived without warning.

Emily Smith stood at the entrance of BestTech Tower, frowning at the relentless rain. She had just finished overtime work and hadn’t expected to be caught in this sudden storm.

"Emily!"

A black Lexus pulled up slowly in front of her. The window rolled down, revealing Robert Miller’s cheerful face.

"Get in. I’ll give you a ride."

Emily hesitated for a moment. She had intended to refuse, but then she remembered the information Robert had inadvertently shared during lunch. She changed her mind.

"Thank you, Manager Miller." She smiled faintly and opened the car door.

Just as she bent to enter the car, a black Rolls-Royce approached from behind. The raindrops on the tinted windows obscured the expression of the person inside, but the oppressive atmosphere seemed to cut through the storm.

"Second Young Master, should we follow them?" The driver, Sam Wilson, asked through the rearview mirror.

William Johnson tapped the armrest with his long fingers, his dark eyes fixed on the Lexus disappearing into the distance.

"No need." He withdrew his gaze. "Take me back to Jinzhou Bay."

Inside the Lexus, Robert eagerly handed Emily a tissue.

"Thanks." She accepted it casually. "You’ve been with BestTech for a long time, haven’t you?"

"Over eight years." Pride laced his voice. "I was here before the company went public."

Emily’s eyes brightened. Eight years—just long enough to know about the financial scandal from back then.

"That’s impressive." She adopted an admiring tone. "You must know a lot of company secrets, right?"

Flattered by her gaze, Robert launched into a boastful recount of his "glorious achievements" at the company.

Emily gasped at all the right moments, skillfully steering the conversation. She needed more information—the more, the better.

By the time the car reached Central Hospital, the rain had stopped.

"Should I go up with you?" Robert offered.

"No need." She declined politely but added, "How about I treat you to lunch tomorrow? As thanks for the ride today."

Robert’s eyes lit up. "It’s a deal!"

Watching the Lexus’s taillights fade into the distance, Emily exhaled deeply. She turned and walked into the inpatient ward, unaware of the familiar black car parked not far away.

Behind the tinted window, William’s gaze lingered on her retreating figure.
###Chapter 48

The night was ink-black when Emily Smith pushed open the door to her apartment at Jinzhou Bay, greeted by a wave of biting cold.

The crystal chandelier bathed the living room in bright light.

William Johnson's deep American accent resonated in the entryway, each syllable sharp as ice shards.

Her fingers tightened around the strap of her bag.

The morning's office confrontation flashed through her mind.

Her fingertips turned cold.

This was William Johnson.

How dare she—

The shoe cabinet clicked softly. Emily slipped into her slippers and saw the man seated rigidly on the sofa, his chiseled profile illuminated by the cold glow of his laptop.

The video conference was still ongoing.

He didn't even blink.

The master bedroom door was slightly ajar. Emily tiptoed inside and had just changed into loungewear when the doorbell shattered the silence.

Olivia Davis's crimson lips glared from the security screen.

"Mr. Johnson is busy." Emily blocked the doorway, deliberately knocking over a soup tureen as she took the meal cart. Scalding broth splashed onto the other woman's silk dress.

Olivia's shriek was cut off by the closing door.

The sweet and sour pork ribs glistened on the dining table. Emily set out the dishes just as William removed his Bluetooth earpiece.

The way he rolled up his sleeves resembled disassembling a firearm.

"Try this." She picked up a shrimp with trembling chopsticks, holding it midair.

He ignored the porcelain spoon entirely.

The glass turntable screeched.

The balcony door slid open and shut. Night wind carried fragments of a woman's voice from his phone call—"operating room," "lead surgeon."

Amid the dishwasher's hum, Emily opened the new script Daniel Chen had sent.

"This monologue needs more fragility," the director's voice instructed through her headphones. "Imagine having your ribs ripped out."

The digital clock glowed eerie blue in the early hours.

William loosened his tie as he passed the hallway. A sliver of light escaped from a cracked door, carving a golden triangle on the carpet.

"...he pinned me against the mirror by my throat—"

The girl's gasping voice behind the door suddenly pitched higher.

"...said my eyes..."

William's knuckles hovered above the doorknob. He narrowed his eyes, then abruptly turned toward the entryway upon hearing the next line.

In his coat pocket, the vibrating phone screen flashed "Central Hospital."
###Chapter 49

William Johnson stood outside the door, his fingers hovering midair.

He heard Emily Smith's soft voice drifting from inside the room, as if she was reciting something. The tone fluctuated between lighthearted and somber, like a moving melody.

He pushed the door open gently.

Emily sat with her back to the entrance, headphones on, recording intently while facing her computer screen. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a soft glow around her.

William leaned against the doorframe, listening quietly.

Her voice flowed like a clear spring, narrating the novel's plot with perfect pacing. Every pause, every transition was executed flawlessly.

Suddenly he understood why she'd been shutting herself in her room lately.

A smile tugged at his lips as he retreated silently without disturbing her.

Only when the apartment door clicked shut did Emily whirl around.

The bedroom door stood slightly ajar.

She removed her headphones and walked to the living room. William's slippers sat neatly arranged by the entrance.

Her fingertips lightly traced the shoe's surface.

The next afternoon, Emily waited outside a Japanese restaurant for Robert Miller.

"Emily!" Robert waved from a distance, jogging toward her. "Sorry to keep you waiting."

She smiled. "I just arrived."

Inside the private room, Robert's gaze never left her.

"This place isn't cheap," he leaned closer. "You shouldn't have."

Emily subtly shifted back. "You've been so helpful at work. It's the least I could do."

When the server left after serving their food, Robert suddenly grabbed her hand. "Actually, I've always thought you were very—"

Emily withdrew her hand swiftly. "Mr. Miller, I'm quite curious about the Finance Department. Could you tell me more about it?"

Meanwhile, in the hallway.

William paused mid-step.

Familiar voices filtered through the paper door.

"...Our Finance Department handled a major project last year..." Robert's boastful tone carried clearly. "The cash flow exceeded a hundred million..."

William's eyes narrowed.

"Really?" Emily's voice brimmed with admiration. "You know so much, Mr. Miller."

A vibrating phone interrupted William's thoughts. Glancing at the caller ID, he strode toward the innermost private room.

Behind the sliding door, Emily discreetly pressed the record button on her phone.
###Chapter 50

William devoured the food on the table with gusto, talking nonstop between bites.

Emily sat quietly, her plate barely touched. The prices at this restaurant made her heart race—a single steak cost half her monthly living expenses.

"This project has incredible potential..." William gushed animatedly, completely oblivious to Emily's discomfort.

An hour later, William finally wiped his mouth in satisfaction. Emily checked her watch and stood to pay the bill.

"Your total comes to $1,200," the cashier said with a polite smile.

William, who had been standing beside Emily, immediately took a step back upon hearing the amount.

Emily had braced herself. She pulled a debit card from her purse. "Please charge this."

The card held her hard-earned voice-acting income—every penny painstakingly saved.

"Of course, ma'am." Just as the cashier reached for the card, commotion erupted at the entrance.

William Johnson walked in arm-in-arm with a stunningly beautiful woman. His gaze landed on Emily's debit card, his expression instantly turning icy.

"Vice President Johnson!" William's eyes lit up with recognition, and he scurried over obsequiously. "What a coincidence! Let me cover this bill for you!"

The cashier couldn't help rolling her eyes.

Emily turned and met William's penetrating stare. She froze, her heartbeat skipping.

"Ma'am, would you like to combine the checks?" the cashier asked.

"No." William's voice was cold as he handed over a black card.

William continued babbling, "Vice President Johnson, please don't stand on ceremony—"

A single glance from William silenced him mid-sentence.

"William, are these your employees?" the woman asked sweetly.

Emily finally noticed the woman beside William. Dressed in designer labels, she carried herself with the effortless grace of a wealthy heiress.

"Subordinates," William replied, his tone uncharacteristically gentle.

The woman waved cheerfully. "Hello!"

"Hello! Hello!" William eagerly handed over his business card. "I'm Robert from Finance."

Emily forced a smile, her throat tightening as if something were lodged there.

"Let's go." William guided the woman away without so much as a glance at Emily.

Only after they disappeared through the door did Emily exhale deeply. She suddenly remembered that night in the underground garage—the woman in William's arms had been the same one.

So in his eyes, she had never been special at all.
###Chapter 51

The neon lights of the city flickered to life as dusk settled.

Emily Smith stood in front of the corporate building, watching the endless stream of cars, a faint smile playing on her lips. These solitary moments somehow brought her peace.

Not far away, a sleek black luxury car pulled away silently. Inside, William Johnson leaned back against the leather seat, eyes closed, his brow furrowed.

"William..." The girl beside him tugged at his sleeve, her voice sickly sweet. "Please say yes to BestTech."

He yanked his arm away, his tone icy. "Go ask Alexander."

She pouted. "Alexander is always so stern. You're much more fun."

William didn't respond, feigning sleep. Only he knew the fire burning in his chest, threatening to consume his rationality.

Meanwhile, Emily slid into Robert Miller's car.

"Dinner was lovely tonight." Robert's hand crept toward her knee.

Emily shifted away smoothly. "Thank you for the ride, Mr. Miller."

As she stepped out, she nearly collided with Michael Thompson.

"You two had dinner together?" Michael's gaze darted between them.

Emily nodded, catching the flicker of concern in his eyes.

Inside the elevator, Michael lowered his voice. "Robert... you should keep your distance."

"I know," Emily murmured, though her mind was already made up.

The afternoon meeting dragged on until sunset. By the time the clients left, the office was deserted. Rubbing her stiff neck, Emily turned back to the mountain of unread emails.

Her phone lit up—a message from Robert. With a quick tap, she sent a polite refusal.

At 7:30 PM, the building was nearly empty. Emily hurried toward the subway station when sudden headlights blinded her.

A familiar black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop beside her.

She glanced around, ensuring no one was watching, then slipped inside.

"Afraid to be seen?" William's voice was glacial. "Yet you had no problem getting into Robert's car."

Emily shrank into the corner, silent.

"Is your salary enough?" His tone shifted abruptly. "Should I give you a raise?"

She muttered, "There's still the bonus..."

He scoffed. "Dreaming of bonuses before passing probation?"

Emily bit her lip. Staring at his stormy profile, she suddenly mustered her courage—and straddled his lap.

The air in the car froze.

###Chapter 52

William Johnson didn't push her away, allowing her to straddle his lap, her slender arms wrapping around his neck.

Emily Smith leaned closer, her soft lips brushing against the tip of his nose before trailing to the corner of his mouth and finally settling on his chin. Playfully, she nipped at his prominent Adam's apple, feeling it bob slightly beneath her touch.

Yet today, William remained unusually composed. He reclined in his seat, his deep eyes watching her intently without moving a muscle.

Emily gathered her courage, her fingers sliding down the buttons of his shirt.

Still, William didn't stop her, letting her do as she pleased.

But he had underestimated his own resistance to her.

His body tensed instantly, muscles tightening visibly. He pressed the control button to raise the partition, then seized her restless hand, his voice husky. "Are your hands clean?"

Emily lifted her glistening eyes and nodded obediently. "I washed them."

William suddenly smirked coldly. "Where did Robert Miller touch you?"

He had already asked Grace Lee to investigate Robert's background.

Emily shook her head hastily. "He didn't touch me."

William's gaze turned icy. "So you wanted him to?"

"No," she denied quickly.

"Then why did you get so close to him?"

Emily faltered, at a loss for words.

Unwilling to dwell on the topic, she pressed her lips to his.

This time, William didn't hold back. He retracted the armrest and pinned her against the seat, taking control of the kiss and deepening it.

Only when she was breathless did he pull back slightly, his eyes burning. "Do you want this?"

Emily nodded without hesitation.

Half to appease him, half out of genuine desire.

William chuckled lowly. "Sure about doing this in the car? No extra charge?"

"No..." Her words were swallowed by his kiss.

......

BestTech Group's headquarters was close to Jinzhou Bay, just a ten-minute drive without traffic.

Sam Wilson drove in circles nearby, waiting until things had settled in the backseat before finally heading into the underground garage.

William adjusted her clothes and pinched her flushed cheek. "Go up by yourself."

Emily wanted to ask where he was going but simply replied, "Okay."

As she turned to leave, he added, "I'm attending a cocktail party. I'll be back later."

"You're going like that?" She eyed his wrinkled shirt.

William glanced down. "Grace has prepared clothes at the hotel."

"Then go quickly." She flashed him a bright smile and turned to leave.

But he yanked her back. "In such a hurry?"

Emily sighed in exasperation.

"Professor Johnson is available this Sunday to operate on your sister," he said abruptly.

Emily's eyes widened in disbelief. "Really?"

"You don't want it?"

She shook her head immediately, kissing him excitedly. "Thank you, William."

Seeing the fire reignite in his eyes, she quickly escaped the car.

Watching her flustered retreat, William's lips curved into an unconscious smile.

###Chapter 53

The night deepened, but William Johnson never returned.

Emily Smith leaned against the headboard, her fingertips lightly tracing the phone screen. She didn’t feel disappointed—instead, there was an inexplicable sense of relief.

She had no regrets about her relationship with William. In this transaction, she had gained too much: her sister’s surgery fees, the VIP hospital room, and medical resources she had never dared to dream of before.

She spent the entire Saturday at the hospital, talking to her sister. On Sunday morning, she woke before dawn. The surgery was scheduled for 9:30, but she arrived at the hospital by 7:00.

Professor Johnson’s words still echoed in her ears: "The surgery is high-risk. You need to be mentally prepared."

She had no choice. Without the surgery, her sister could be gone at any moment. With it, there was at least a sliver of hope.

At exactly 9:00, the nurse wheeled in the surgical cart. The razor buzzed as strands of her sister’s dark hair fell away. Emily clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

"Xiao Yi, I’ll be waiting for you," she whispered by her sister’s ear. "Come back to me safely."

The sound of the gurney’s wheels echoed down the hallway. When the red light above the operating room lit up, Emily felt her heart stop along with it.

She stared unblinking at that red light, her eyes burning but refusing to close. As long as she kept watching, maybe her sister would come out unharmed.

Then, footsteps broke the silence of the empty corridor.

Emily turned and saw William striding toward her. He wore a dark gray suit, his tie slightly loosened, as if he’d rushed here from some important event.

"How long has it been?" He stopped in front of her and ruffled her hair.

Only then did Emily check the time. "Three and a half hours." Her voice was hoarse.

"Have you eaten?"

She shook her head. Her stomach felt like it was stuffed with a rock—she couldn’t even sense hunger.

William frowned and reached to pull her up. "Let’s get something to eat first."

"I’m really not hungry." She stubbornly stayed seated.

He didn’t push further, sitting down beside her instead. Leaning back against the wall, he closed his eyes to rest. Sunlight slanted through the window at the end of the hallway, casting fragmented light across his sharp profile.

Emily stole glances at him—his lashes casting faint shadows, his Adam’s apple bobbing slightly with each breath. She suddenly remembered nights when he’d tilted his head back just like that, sweat trailing down his neck—

"Done staring?" His voice startled her so badly she nearly jumped.

He opened his eyes and caught her hand effortlessly. His thumb brushed lightly over her palm, sending a shiver through her.

"Grr—"

The sound of her stomach growling was embarrassingly loud in the quiet hallway. Emily’s face burned.

William chuckled lowly and pulled out his phone to make a call. Twenty minutes later, Sam Wilson arrived with an exquisite food box.

Inside were six steaming dishes. Only then did Emily realize how ravenous she was. She picked up a piece of sweet and sour pork and took a bite.

William propped his chin on his hand, watching her eat. She always focused intently on food, her eyes slightly narrowed like a contented cat. Even the simplest home-cooked meal could make her look blissful.

The operating room light remained on. As Emily ate, her movements gradually slowed. She stared at the food, her appetite vanishing again.

"She’ll be fine," William said suddenly.

She looked up, meeting his deep gaze. The certainty in his eyes gave her an inexplicable sense of peace.
###Chapter 54

Emily Smith nibbled on the sweet and sour ribs from her lunchbox, her cheeks puffed up like a little hamster.

"Good?" William Johnson suddenly asked.

She nodded, her chopsticks reaching for the last piece of rib. "Delicious."

William narrowed his eyes. "Only thinking about yourself?"

Emily's chopsticks froze mid-air. She turned to him, sauce still smeared at the corner of her lips. "Why didn't you say so earlier?"

William stared at her in silence.

"Only this one left..." she mumbled under her breath, hesitantly offering the rib toward him.

He caught her wrist and guided her hand, taking the rib straight from her fingers into his mouth.

"Not bad."

Emily's ears burned.

The operating room light finally dimmed. Emily shot to her feet but nearly stumbled when her legs gave out.

William caught her in one swift motion.

Professor Johnson emerged with his team, arching a brow at the sight.

"How's my sister?" Emily's voice trembled.

"The surgery was a success," Professor Johnson removed his mask. "But whether she wakes up depends on her recovery."

Tears spilled down Emily's cheeks instantly.

Once her sister was wheeled into the ward, William tilted Emily's chin up. "Now it's your turn to keep me company?"

Emily nodded without hesitation.

In the car, she straddled his lap and pressed her lips to his. "Thank you."

William gripped her waist with a low chuckle. "Just words?"

She shook her head, deepening the kiss.

"Not tired?" His voice roughened.

Blushing, she shook her head again.

"Then take the lead." He leaned back against the seat, letting her set the pace.

Laughter drifted faintly from the villa entrance.

Emily suddenly stilled.

"What's wrong?" William glanced back.

"Who's... inside?"

"Just some friends." He laced his fingers through hers. "Casual gathering."

Emily's chest tightened.

"William! You promised lunch—what time do you call this?" someone called out teasingly.

A sharp whistle cut through the air. "And who's this beauty?"

Every eye in the room locked onto her.
###Chapter 55

Several pairs of burning eyes locked onto Emily, making her feel as if their gazes could pierce right through her chest.

"Busty soft girl?" Someone whistled.

Emily's ears turned red instantly. She lowered her head uncomfortably, fingers twisting the hem of her dress. Her bra had been feeling tight lately—her weight hadn't changed, yet that area seemed to have grown.

"Damn, Will, you've got sharp eyes!" George Taylor stared openly, unable to look away.

William Johnson pulled her into his arms, his fingers giving a warning pinch at her waist. "Use her name."

Emily forced a composed smile. "Hello, everyone. I'm Emily Smith."

"Oh, same last name as Will—" George deliberately drew out his words, smirking suggestively. "Could it be...?"

"Shut it." William grabbed a throw pillow and hurled it at him. "Same last name means we can't contribute to humanity's future?"

George raised his hands in surrender. "Fine, fine! Nice to meet you, Emily."

Just as Emily reached out to shake his hand, William caught her wrist. He arched a brow, scanning the room. "Mine. Don't touch."

"Can this little girl handle your temper?" Ethan Zheng teased around his cigarette. "Tell me, how does Will bully you?"

Emily's earlobes burned crimson. "William... treats me well."

"Ohhh—" The group erupted in exaggerated cheers.

Suddenly, a female voice cut in. "Second Young Master, does Olivia know you have a new girlfriend?"

The air froze.

Emily turned toward the voice, her pupils shrinking—it was the woman who had kissed William in the car that day. Clutching her skirt, she murmured, "I'm not his girlfriend."

"Vivian Lu." William's voice turned icy. "My affairs are none of Olivia Davis' concern."

Ethan yanked his girlfriend back. "If you can't speak properly, get out."

Vivian paled. As a mere branch of the Lu family, she wasn't even fit to carry Olivia's shoes. Under the men's cold stares, her voice instantly softened. "I... I was just worried about Olivia..."

"Cut the fake sisterly act." Ethan sneered. "When has Olivia ever glanced your way?"

Emily suddenly remembered the kiss outside the hospital. So this woman was just a clown. She gave Vivian a faint smile, her eyes glinting with frost.

William gripped the back of her neck, pressing her into the couch. His tone was dangerous. "Say that again. You're not my girlfriend?"

Emily looked up at him, lashes fluttering. "Am... I?"
###Chapter 56 

Vivian Lu's nails dug into her palms as she stared at Emily Smith and William Johnson's intertwined hands.

The crystal chandelier cast shimmering light over the dinner table. Emily sat quietly beside William, occasionally serving him dishes. She could feel Vivian's gaze like poisoned needles pricking her skin.

"Try this." William placed a peeled shrimp in her bowl, his fingers brushing her wrist.

The sharp crack of billiard balls echoed from the basement game room. Emily stood behind William as he leaned over to take a shot, the defined lines of his waist visible beneath his shirt. Vivian scoffed.

At the mahjong table, the moment Emily touched a tile, Vivian sneered, "Quite skilled, aren't you, Miss Smith?"

"First time playing," Emily replied softly.

William excused himself to answer a call. The screen flashed—Olivia Davis's name appeared briefly. Emily lowered her eyes and drew another tile, winning two consecutive rounds with perfect hands.

"Your girl's cheating, Will!" George Taylor groaned, knocking over his tiles.

When William returned, he caught the faint blush on Emily's ears. He kissed the top of her head, making George drop his chips. "You two are running a scam!"

The bathroom mirror reflected Emily's pale face. The door swung open—Vivian leaned against the frame, arms crossed, lips curled in mockery.

"You think sleeping with William will make you royalty?" She jabbed Emily's shoulder. "Amanda Lin was far more dazzling than you, and now she's six feet under."

Emily's hands stilled under the running water.

"Miss Lu." She turned, droplets sliding down her chin. "I'm just a plaything. Why lower yourself?"

Vivian grabbed her jaw. "Don't act innocent! William will marry Olivia eventually. You—"

"Vivian." Ethan Zheng's voice drifted from the hallway. "Your turn."

Emily pulled free, hearing Vivian hiss behind her, "Leave now, or else..."

Back at the table, William toyed with a strand of Emily's hair. The pile of chips before her resembled offerings on an altar.
###Chapter 57

Emily Smith crossed her arms, a mocking smile curling her lips. "Olivia Davis is the jewel of the Lu family. She grew up with Vice President Johnson." She shot Emily a sidelong glance. "Everyone in Jinzhou knows Miss Davis is determined to marry him."

She paused, malice flashing in her eyes. "And then there's Amanda Lin—the one who holds Vice President Johnson's heart. All these years, she's been the only one he's ever loved."

Though Olivia had instructed her to teach Emily a lesson, Vivian Lu didn't dare go too far, given how protective William seemed of her.

She gave Emily a once-over and sneered. "If your face didn't resemble Amanda's, do you really think Vice President Johnson would spare you a second glance?"

"We look alike?" Emily suddenly spoke up.

"Of course." Vivian didn't hesitate. "Especially those eyes—they're practically identical."

Emily pressed her lips together, swallowing the words on the tip of her tongue. She remembered Emma Clark had said the same thing.

Back in middle school, she and William had attended the same school—she in seventh grade, he in twelfth. Years later, when they met again at The Royal Club, he'd insisted on driving her home without explanation. What other reason could there be besides this resemblance?

"Why didn't Amanda end up with William?" she asked softly.

"Like you deserve to know," Vivian scoffed.

Emily turned to leave, but Vivian grabbed her arm.

"Fine, I'll tell you." Vivian smirked. "Amanda wanted to marry Alexander Johnson—William's older brother. She never saw William as good enough. That's why he's playing around with a stand-in like you. Got it?"

Emily nodded numbly, her eyes reddening.

Bored, Vivian let go and walked away.

Emily stood frozen, her chest tight. Suddenly, she didn’t want to go back. Almost unconsciously, she stepped out of the villa.

The night wind hit her, making her shiver. The glittering city lights below reminded her she was halfway up the hillside.

After a few steps, the cold air cleared her mind. What was she, really? Just someone doing a job for money. Stand-in or tool—none of it mattered as long as she could save her sister.

She turned back.

Inside the game room, William won two rounds in a row before realizing Emily hadn’t returned. He excused himself to look for her but found no trace.

"Where’s Emily?" he demanded when he returned, his sharp gaze landing on Vivian.

"I—I didn’t say anything," Vivian insisted, forcing composure.

"Are you out of your damn mind?" Ethan Zheng exploded.

William stopped him. "Find her first."

The group hurried out of the game room.
###Chapter 58

The night was dark as Emily Smith walked back along the mountain path. Suddenly, she heard someone urgently calling her name.

That voice was all too familiar—William Johnson.

Her heart clenched, and she quickened her pace into a run.

Just as she reached the villa entrance, she collided with a solid chest.

"Where were you?" William grabbed her shoulders, his voice laced with unmistakable anger.

Emily tilted her face up, her eyes glimmering under the moonlight. "I just wanted to see Jinzhou's night view."

She turned and pointed downhill. "Look, isn't it beautiful?"

William studied her for a few seconds before abruptly pulling her into his arms. He roughly ruffled her hair. "This little view enchanted you?"

"Is there something even more beautiful?" Emily blinked.

William smirked. "Want to see?"

"Yes!" She nodded eagerly.

"Then you'll have to cheer me up first." He narrowed his eyes, the city lights reflecting in their depths.

Not far away, Vivian Lu clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

She glared hatefully at the embracing couple but didn't dare approach.

Ethan Zheng was right. What she feared most wasn't Olivia Davis—it was William Johnson.

...

At six on Monday morning, the alarm had barely sounded when Emily found herself pinned under a heavy weight.

William reached out to turn it off, then settled his entire body atop hers to continue sleeping.

"William..." She pushed at him. "I can't breathe."

The moment she spoke, he flipped them over, bringing her on top of him.

Emily tried to rise, but his iron-like arms locked around her.

"Don't move." His voice was hoarse. "Sleep a bit longer."

Feeling the change beneath her, Emily froze.

"I want to visit Xiao Yi at the hospital..." she whispered.

William kept his eyes closed. "You started this fire. Aren't you going to put it out?"

"Then...can we make it quick?" She bit her lip.

His eyes snapped open. "How quick?"

"Ten minutes?"

William: "......"

...

Ten minutes later, Emily rushed through her morning routine and left without breakfast.

At the hospital, all of her sister's vitals were stable. The EEG showed significantly increased brain activity.

This good news kept Emily in high spirits all morning.

Near noon, Robert Miller texted to invite her to lunch.

Remembering her father's situation, she agreed.

At the Japanese restaurant, Robert ordered the most expensive items.

Emily got straight to the point, asking about BestTech Group's economic case from seven years ago.

Robert dodged the question, revealing nothing important.

When the bill came, it showed sixteen thousand.

Emily had just pulled out her card when a familiar voice spoke from behind—
###Chapter 59

"Well, if it isn't Manager Miller and Emily Smith?" Michael Thompson spotted the two sitting by the window as he checked out with his friends, his lips curling into a knowing smirk.

Emily turned at the sound of his voice and offered a polite smile. "Boss."

Robert Miller's smile faltered for a split second before he stood up enthusiastically. "Manager Thompson, you're dining here too? We should've joined you."

"Exactly." Michael strode over, snatching the bill from Emily's table. "Tsk, over ten grand? Manager Miller, you sure know how to spend."

He suddenly slapped the bill against Robert's chest. "Last time you said you'd treat me. No time like the present—why don't you cover my table too?"

With that, he wrapped an arm around Emily's shoulders and walked out without looking back.

"Wait!" Robert's face darkened. "When did I agree to that?"

Michael paused, raising an eyebrow at Emily. "Emily, was this meal your treat?"

She shook her head, her voice clear. "Manager Miller invited me."

"See?" Michael scoffed, leading Emily away without another glance.

Behind them, the cashier's sweet voice chimed, "Sir, your total comes to 23,868 dollars."

......

Inside the black sedan, Michael's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

"Boss..." Emily bit her lip. "I had my reasons."

He glanced at her. "What reasons?"

She lowered her lashes, silent.

As the car merged onto the main road, Michael suddenly asked, "Did Vice President Johnson give you money?"

Emily nodded faintly.

"Heh." He let out a cold laugh. "You think he'd be happy knowing you used his money to treat another man?"

Her fingers clenched around the hem of her shirt. "I understand."

"Emily." His tone turned grave. "If you've chosen this path, don't be foolish. Cross Vice President Johnson, and you won't last a day in Jinzhou."

She stared at the scenery flashing past the window and murmured a firm, "Mm."

......

Near the end of her shift, Emily opened WeChat.

[Are you coming home for dinner tonight?] she texted William Johnson.

A question mark popped up instantly in reply.

[I want to cook for you.] she added.

Another question mark appeared.

[It's to thank you for Professor Johnson.] she explained honestly.

This time, the reply came quickly: [Okay.]

Emily stared at her screen, her lips curving upward without her realizing it.

"Seeing someone?" Lily White teased, leaning in.

Emily hurriedly locked her phone. "Not at all."

She began planning the evening's menu. It had been a long time since she'd cooked properly—not since her grandmother passed away. She wondered how much of her once-sharp knife skills and timing she still retained.
###Chapter 60

The supermarket lights glared harshly. Emily Smith pushed her cart through the fresh produce section.

Her fingertips brushed over the ribs in the cooler. She selected the most tender package.

Turning to the seafood area, she picked out a lively turbot fish.

The cart gradually filled up. Light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, vinegar, cooking wine... She carefully checked each condiment's expiration date.

At the checkout counter, two heavy bags of groceries weighed down her arms. She gritted her teeth as red marks appeared on her skin.

In the taxi, she watched neon lights flicker outside the window. Her phone screen lit up and dimmed—still no new messages.

Soon, the aroma of cooking filled her apartment kitchen. Sweet and sour sauce bubbled in the pan as she carefully turned the ribs, coating each piece evenly.

8:00 PM. The dining table was neatly set with five dishes and a steaming soup.

9:30 PM. She reheated the fish for the third time. Steam fogged up her glasses.

11:00 PM. She jolted awake at the table, realizing she'd dozed off. The sweet and sour ribs had cooled, their grease congealing into white patches.

3:00 AM. The master bedroom door remained still.

At dawn, she silently dumped all the food into the trash. Porcelain bowls clinked sharply against each other.

The subway car swayed. Her phone vibrated. As she read the message, her nails dug crescent-shaped marks into her palm.

"Disgusting."

She replied with a perfect smile. But her eyes burned suddenly.

Keyboards clattered in the office. She was organizing meeting minutes when the intercom lit up.

"Not necessary."

She hung up more decisively than expected.

The hospital still reeked of disinfectant. Her sister's IV drip echoed in the room. Emily peeled an apple with steady hands.

The roadside stall's spicy noodles made her eyes water. She added two spoonfuls of vinegar, then another of chili oil.

The apartment lock clicked open. The man on the balcony turned, phone still pressed to his ear.

Their gazes met and parted instantly. She closed the door softly—like a sigh.

The recording software loaded. Daniel Chen's voice came through her headphones: "Ready, Emily?"

As she pressed record, the doorknob behind her turned silently. A shadow stretched across the floor, slowly engulfing her silhouette.
###Chapter 61

"William... stop..."
"Please... I beg you..."
"It hurts... so much..."

Emily Smith's headphones played the breathless moans as she focused intently on recording a romantic novel scene into her microphone.

William Johnson pushed open the door just in time to hear those provocative lines.

Snap!

He yanked the headphones off her head with enough force to nearly break the cord.

"Who gave you permission to record this kind of thing?" His voice was low, simmering with restrained fury. "Who's the man acting opposite you?"

Emily jumped at the sudden intrusion. Recognizing William, she exhaled in relief—only for her cheeks to flush crimson immediately.

"It's a legitimate job," she defended softly. "Romantic scenes between leads are normal in novels."

"Romantic scenes?" William scoffed, his long fingers gripping her chin. "Then what do you call what's between us?"

Emily pressed her lips together, eyes glistening.

"Speak!" His grip tightened.

"You're the patron. I'm just—" Her voice faded to a whisper.

"Just what?" His gaze turned dangerous.

Emily stubbornly turned her face away, but William hauled her up and threw her onto the bed.

"Ah!"

Before she could react, he pinned her down, one hand beside her head, the other clamping her wrist.

"What do you think you are to me?" he demanded through gritted teeth.

Emily glared back defiantly. "You pay, I perform. Isn't that clear?"

"Perform?" A cold laugh escaped him. "Perform what?"

The words stabbed into her like a blade. She went still, her eyes dimming.

William crushed his lips against hers in a punishing kiss—rough, domineering.

On the desk, her phone vibrated incessantly, the name Daniel Chen flashing on the screen. But neither of them noticed.

Tears streamed down Emily's face from the pain, yet she bit her lip, refusing to make a sound. Her silent resistance only fueled his anger.

When it was over, the room echoed with heavy breathing.

Emily curled into herself at the edge of the bed like a wounded animal. William watched her back, an inexplicable tightness gripping his chest.
###Chapter 62

William's movements abruptly halted.

He stared at Emily's tear-streaked face, his Adam's apple bobbing.

After a long pause, he bent down and scooped her up in his arms. His lips brushed against her damp eyelashes as his tongue caught the salty tears.

"I was recording a proper romance novel." Emily kept her eyes closed, voice trembling. "You can check if you don't believe me."

William's kiss landed on her swollen lips, where the metallic taste of blood lingered. "Why didn't you use the card I gave you?"

Emily opened her eyes, her glistening gaze meeting his directly. "I haven't earned the fifty thousand yet. I'm afraid I can't pay it back."

William stopped moving, narrowing his eyes. "Should I raise your allowance?"

"No." She shook her head. "The current amount is more than enough."

The more she received, the more it would hurt when she lost it all.

William suddenly chuckled low. "So little confidence in yourself?"

Emily remained silent.

He flicked her forehead with his finger. "The card is meant to be spent." His eyes darkened. "But don't let me catch you spending it on another man."

Emily bit her lip.

Even without love, a man's possessiveness never diminished.

"Will you do it yourself, or shall I?" Dark flames flickered in his eyes.

Emily gently pushed him down and straddled him, taking the initiative.

...

The next morning.

William sat at his desk, the computer screen casting light on his sharp profile.

He suddenly recalled the recording he'd heard last night.

The male lead's name was... Cold Tingyu?

His slender fingers danced across the keyboard. Three characters appeared in the search bar.

Over ten million results instantly popped up.

He clicked into an audiobook platform and found the title. The male narrator went by Mountain Stream, while the female narrator was clearly listed as Thousand One.

Play count: 260 million.

William raised an eyebrow and clicked on the first chapter.

A deep male voice spoke first, rich as a cello.

Then came the female voice—even processed, he recognized Emily immediately.

Leaning back in his chair, he closed his eyes to listen.

The story was captivating, their performances utterly immersive. When the chapter ended, he found himself wanting more.

The rankings page refreshed, showing the book at the top of the weekly chart.

Another fantasy novel narrated by Emily approached 500 million plays.

William's eyes gleamed as he pressed the intercom.

"Investigate this male narrator." He handed printed materials to Grace. "And check their earnings."

Grace took the documents, visibly startled when she saw "romance novel" written on them.

"Any problems?" William glanced up.

"N-no, sir." She hurried out.

As the office door closed, William reopened the audio file.

The female narrator's melodious voice filled the room.

His gaze fixed on the screen displaying the ID "Thousand One," his eyes darkening.
###Chapter 63

Grace Lee's efficiency was always astonishing.

Emily Smith and Daniel Chen's backgrounds were thoroughly investigated in no time.

When Grace saw the real name behind the pseudonym "Qian Yi," her fingers trembled violently.

Emily Smith.

So that's why.

No wonder Vice President Johnson had taken such a keen interest in an audiobook.

She took a deep breath, composed herself, and knocked on William Johnson's office door.

"Come in."

William took the file, his gaze freezing on the name "Daniel Chen."

His knuckles tightened unconsciously.

As he flipped through the pages, the 1:5:4 royalty distribution ratio made his pupils constrict sharply.

"Explain." His voice was icy.

Grace reported truthfully, "Originally it was 4:3:3, but Anchor Chen voluntarily gave up 20% to Miss Smith."

William stared at Emily's projected earnings.

Three hundred thousand.

Enough to repay that five hundred thousand in just two months.

The cruel irony was that this side income was forty times her regular salary.

"Hah." He suddenly laughed, though his eyes remained frozen.

"Get Michael Thompson."

Grace didn't dare ask questions and turned to summon him.

Michael hurried in. "Boss?"

"Grasshopper Audiobook. Know it?"

Michael blinked. "The largest audiobook platform in the country."

"Buy it." William closed the file, his tone leaving no room for argument.

......

Night deepened.

Emily pushed open the apartment door to complete darkness.

Used to it by now, she changed her shoes when her phone suddenly vibrated.

A WeChat message from William: [Business dinner. Late return.]

Just six simple words, yet they made her eyes burn.

Her fingers shook as she replied: [Okay.]

This was the first time he'd ever proactively informed her of his whereabouts.

The apartment suddenly felt warmer.

At exactly ten o'clock, her recording was interrupted.

The front door made noise.

Emily tore off her headphones and rushed out to see William being half-carried by two men, completely drunk.

"I'll take it from here!" She knelt to change his shoes.

Michael studied her for a long moment before suddenly asking, "You're Emily Smith?"

Now he finally understood why the boss had wanted to acquire that audiobook platform.

It was all for this girl.
###Chapter 64

"It's me." Emily Smith smiled faintly and nodded. "Hello, Mr. Zhang."

"Please, don't call me that." Zhang Xiao'an waved his hands hastily. "Just call me Xiao Zhang."

Emily understood exactly why he was being so deferential but chose not to comment. She simply gestured for them to help William Johnson into the bedroom.

After Zhang Xiao'an and Sam Wilson left, Emily stood by the bed, gazing at William, who was completely passed out from drinking. She leaned down and gently shook his arm.

"William."

The man didn't move a muscle, showing no reaction.

He must be completely wasted.

Emily climbed onto the bed, kneeling beside William. She first loosened his tie, then moved to remove his suit jacket.

He was lying flat on his back, so taking off the jacket required lifting him up. Whether it was because William was as heavy as a block of iron or because she was too weak, she couldn't budge him.

Left with no choice, she straddled him, hooking one arm around his neck while using the other to pull off the jacket.

After a tremendous effort, she finally managed to remove it. Next were his socks and pants.

When she undid his waistband and pulled them down just past his hip line, she noticed something unusual.

Emily jerked her hand back as if shocked and immediately looked at William's face—

The man who had been dead drunk moments ago now had clear, alert eyes, burning with intensity.

The moment their eyes met, Emily froze. "You... weren't you—"

Before she could finish, William pounced like a panther, pinning her beneath him and sealing her lips with his.

Staring at his handsome face so close to hers, Emily hesitated for a few seconds before closing her eyes and responding.

Perhaps fueled by alcohol, William was unusually fierce. Emily bit her lower lip to endure, refusing to make a sound.

Just as she was about to draw blood, William suddenly cupped her face and kissed her, rescuing her poor lip.

Whether it was exhaustion or something else, William only took her once that night before letting her be. Even when he held her in the bathtub afterward, he didn't push further, simply resting with his eyes closed.

Emily picked up a towel and began washing him, deliberately skipping a certain area.

"Hah!" William suddenly opened his eyes and chuckled lowly. "Not going to wash there?"

Emily shoved the towel into his hand. "Do it yourself." She started to get up.

Before she could stand, a large hand clamped around her wrist and pulled her back into the tub with a gentle tug.

"Ah!" Emily gasped as water splashed everywhere, and she found herself back in William's arms.

"After all this time, you still won't wash me there?" He pinched her chin, smirking devilishly.

Meeting his scorching gaze, Emily's face instantly flushed to the tips of her ears.

Though they had been intimate countless times, she still couldn't bring herself to do this for him.

Flustered, she blurted out, "You've never washed me either."

"Oh?" William arched a brow. "That's easy. I'll wash you then." He moved to act on his words.

Emily frantically grabbed his hand. "No, no need!"

"It's only fair," he insisted.

"Really, it's fine!" Her voice trembled.

Somehow, in their playful struggle, their positions reversed.

"William, weren't you tired?" Emily pressed against his firm chest.

He smirked. "If you want it, I can still deliver."

Emily shook her head vehemently. "I don't want it."

"Tch." He laughed softly. "Fine. But you owe me a favor."

Emily had a bad feeling but asked anyway, "What favor?"
###Chapter 65

"Choose." William Johnson's long fingers gripped her chin, his voice icy. "Either quit voice acting or replace Daniel Chen."

Emily Smith's pupils contracted. The warm bathwater suddenly turned piercingly cold.

"You think I'm joking?" He leaned closer, water droplets falling from his hair onto her collarbone.

She shook her head, fingers unconsciously digging into the tub's edge.

"William, Daniel and I are just colleagues." She grasped his wrist. "There's nothing between us. Please believe me."

He scoffed, thumb brushing her flushed earlobe. "Nothing?"

"It's true!" Her eyes reddened with urgency. "We've never—"

"Then why does he look at you like a starving wolf?" William suddenly gripped her waist. "Why is he always present during your recordings? Why—"

"You investigated me?" Emily shoved him away violently.

Water sloshed. William leaned back against the tub, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Did I need to?"

She noticed coffee stains on his shirt hem—he'd come straight from the recording studio to pick her up.

"I won't give up voice acting." She took a deep breath. "Daniel helped me enter this industry. I can't betray that kindness."

William's expression darkened. He knew Daniel's tricks—using coaching as pretext for physical contact, frequent work meetings, even deliberately favorable profit splits.

"Prove it." He yanked her against his chest.

"How?"

"Call him now." William shoved his phone into her hand. "Tell him you're terminating the collaboration."

Her fingers trembled. Memories flashed of Daniel staying up late to revise scripts with her.

"Can't do it?" He sneered. "Then I'll handle it."

"William!" Her voice rose sharply. "You have no right to interfere with my work!"

Water splashed. William froze, surprised the timid rabbit had claws.

"Because I'm your man." His grip tightened on her nape, voice hoarse. "Is that reason enough?"

The bathroom mirror fogged as they glared at each other.

Finally, Emily turned away. "I'll reduce contact...but we must finish the recordings."

William studied her stubborn profile, recalling the investigation report—the fifteen-year-old girl who'd supported her family alone.

"Remember your promise." He stood abruptly, water cascading off him.

A towel slung around his hips, he paused at the door. "If I find you meeting him privately—"

The slammed door cut off his threat.

Emily slowly submerged, releasing a stream of bubbles. Rose petals swirled on the water's surface, mirroring her tangled thoughts.
###Chapter 66

Emily Smith tossed and turned in her room until late at night before finally falling asleep. When she woke the next morning, the apartment was eerily silent. William Johnson didn't even glance her way, treating her as if she were invisible.

She ate breakfast alone in silence before taking the crowded subway to work.

Friday's workload was particularly heavy. At lunch, she only managed a few hurried bites before returning to her desk. Around four in the afternoon, just after finishing a supplier meeting, her office phone rang. The caller ID showed Robert Miller's extension.

"There's a gathering after work. Want to join?" Robert's voice carried a hint of anticipation.

Emily's fingers tightened around the receiver. She needed more clues—it was worth the risk. "Sure," she heard herself say.

As she packed up near the end of the workday, William's extension suddenly flashed on her phone. She hesitated for two seconds before answering.

"Meet me in the basement parking garage." His voice was icy.

"Sorry, I already have plans tonight." Before she could finish, dead silence filled the line.

Seven or eight seconds later, William's voice came through, laced with unmistakable jealousy. "Is it that Daniel again?"

"It's a cowork—"

Click. The line went dead.

Emily waited twenty extra minutes before leaving the office. The basement garage was dimly lit. She had just located Robert's black Lexus when the elevator doors dinged open behind her.

William stood inside the elevator, his hawk-like gaze locking onto her slender figure dozens of meters away. When he recognized the license plate, his expression darkened instantly.

"Have someone tail Robert's car," he ordered Sam Wilson, his voice terrifyingly cold.

Inside the car, Emily forced herself to remain calm as she made small talk with Robert, subtly steering the conversation toward the economic case from seven years earlier. When she mentioned it for the third time, Robert gave her a knowing smile.

"Emily, why are you so interested in this?" he asked as they stopped at a red light, turning to study her face.

Her heartbeat quickened. She decided to gamble. "Because Henry Johnson was my father."

Robert nodded, unsurprised. "No wonder you looked familiar." When the light turned green, he suddenly pulled over.

"If I tell you the truth," he leaned closer, his breath warm against her cheek, "how will you thank me?"

Emily maintained her sweet smile, though a cold glint flashed in her eyes. "What would you like, Manager Miller?"
###Chapter 67

Robert Miller's palm pressed against Emily Smith's cheek, his thumb stroking her smooth skin.

His eyes burned with raw desire as his lips curled into a disgusting smirk.

"Just one night with me. That's all I'm asking."

Emily let out a cold laugh and shook her head without hesitation.

"Manager Miller, I can't agree to that condition."

His greasy fingers slid down her chin as his voice oozed with sleaze.

"Stop acting so pure. It's not like you have a boyfriend."

Emily finally saw the true nature of this man.

She knew this greedy expression all too well. If she gave in now, she'd be trapped in endless harassment.

She jerked her head back to avoid his wandering hand and quickly unbuckled her seatbelt.

A professional smile remained on her face.

"Apologies, Manager Miller. I just remembered some unfinished work. I'm afraid I'll have to cancel tonight's dinner."

Before he could respond, she turned to open the car door.

"Trying to run?" Robert lunged at her like a starving wolf, his arms locking around her.

His eyes gleamed with animalistic fury as he hissed, "Emily Smith, do you really think you can play with me?"

Suppressing her disgust, Emily replied calmly, "What do you mean, Manager Miller? We're just colleagues."

"I never spent your money or led you on emotionally."

"Bullshit!" Robert's face twisted with rage.

"That dinner last time cost me over ten thousand! You kept accepting my invitations, and now you're backing out?"

Emily nearly laughed at his shameless lies.

She realized now how naive she'd been to keep encountering such scum.

Her voice turned icy.

"What exactly do you want, Manager Miller?"

"I've made myself clear." He sneered, leaning closer.

"One night with me, or your career at BestTech is over."

Emily suddenly smiled.

"Do you really think Vice President Johnson would allow his woman to sleep with another man?"

Robert froze, then burst into mocking laughter.

"You? Vice President Johnson's woman? Don't make me laugh."

He knew William Johnson's reputation.

If Emily really belonged to him, why would she be stuck as a lowly assistant in the Business Department?

And during their encounter at the Japanese restaurant, William had barely glanced at her.

"Believe what you want." Emily struggled against his grip.

"Now, let me go."

Her resistance only fueled Robert's aggression.

The piggish man panted heavily, his foul breath washing over her face as he tried to force himself on her.

"Get off!" Emily shuddered in revulsion, desperately pushing his greasy head away.

She rolled down the window to scream for help, but the highway was empty except for speeding cars.

In desperation, she kicked him hard between the legs.

"Ah!" Robert howled in pain, his face turning green as he clutched his crotch.

His eyes flashed with rage as he raised his hand to strike her—

Emily instinctively curled into a ball, shielding her head.

BANG!

A deafening explosion shattered the air.
###Chapter 68

Robert Miller's hand was raised high, about to strike.

"Bang!"

A deafening explosion erupted behind him. His entire body jerked as he whipped his head around.

The car window had cracked into a spiderweb pattern. Two towering silhouettes stood outside the vehicle.

"Crash—"

Another impact shattered the glass completely.

A large, bony hand reached in, gripping Robert's collar with precision, yanking him out of the car.

Emily Smith sat frozen in the passenger seat, her pupils contracting violently.

Her door was suddenly wrenched open.

"Em—"

She looked up and met those familiar dark eyes. Her vision instantly blurred with unshed tears.

"William Johnson."

She threw herself into the man's arms, her voice trembling with suppressed sobs.

Every time danger struck, he descended like a guardian angel.

William bent slightly as she clung to his neck. The sound of his name brushed against his heart like a feather, stealing his breath.

"Is this why you rejected me?" His voice was icy, laced with fury. "For trash like him?"

Emily released him, biting her lip as she met his gaze.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

William's eyes softened slightly as they swept over her pale face.

"Are you hurt?"

She shook her head.

"Get out." He stepped back, his tone still rigid.

Emily obediently followed.

On the other side of the car, Sam Wilson and the bodyguards were delivering brutal kicks and punches to Robert. The man's howls mixed with the wind, creating a grotesque symphony.

Robert's face was covered in blood. When he saw them approaching hand in hand, his eyes widened in terror.

"How should we handle this?" William asked.

Robert suddenly dropped to his knees, kowtowing. "Vice President Johnson, spare me! I'll never dare again!"

Emily recoiled in disgust, hiding behind William.

"Send him to the police," she said coldly. "Charge him with attempted rape."

"No!" Robert's face turned ashen. "I just lost my head for a moment—"

William smirked. "Once is enough."

He wrapped an arm around Emily and turned away, instructing the bodyguards, "Make sure he gets at least ten years."

Inside the Rolls-Royce, Emily finally relaxed, glancing at the man beside her.

"Thank you."

William leaned back with closed eyes, frowning at her words. "Find a new line."

She opened her mouth but ultimately stayed silent, gazing out the window instead.

The night swallowed the wreckage on the overpass, dark as ink.
###Chapter 69
The car left the overpass as dusk quietly enveloped the city.

Neon lights flickered on one by one, painting the urban landscape in a dazzling glow.

Inside the vehicle, the silence was suffocating.

Emily Smith clutched the hem of her shirt, her fingertips trembling slightly.

She knew she had truly angered William Johnson this time.

The shifting lights outside cast fleeting shadows across her face, revealing traces of regret.

"So you can cook?" William suddenly spoke, his voice icy. "Make dinner for me when we get back."

Emily turned her head sharply.

The man kept his eyes closed, not even sparing her a glance.

"Okay," she replied softly.

"Reluctant?" William's eyes snapped open, dark and stormy.

Emily quickly shook her head. "I'm afraid it won't suit your taste."

He studied her for a few seconds before closing his eyes again.

She leaned in to kiss him, but he turned his face away.

"Wash up first," he muttered, wrinkling his nose in distaste.

Emily bit her lip.

Upon returning to Jinzhou Bay, she immediately retreated to the bathroom.

The warm water cascaded over her body, yet it couldn't wash away the lingering disgust.

Robert Miller's scent seemed to cling stubbornly to her skin.

She scrubbed the places he had touched until her skin turned red.

In the living room, William dialed Olivia Davis' number.

"Bring some groceries over."

Half an hour later, Olivia arrived with armfuls of bags.

"Need any help, Mr. Johnson?" she asked, batting her lashes.

William didn't even look up. "Get out."

Olivia paled and fled.

The kitchen island was now piled with enough ingredients to last a week.

William checked the time.

Twenty minutes had passed.

Just as he was about to stand, he heard footsteps.

Emily emerged in a white nightgown, her damp hair dripping water.

The red marks from her vigorous scrubbing stood out starkly against her fair skin.

William's gaze darkened.

"So much food?" She stared at the kitchen in surprise.

"Just cook something," he replied, his voice slightly hoarse.

Emily began sorting through the ingredients.

The hem of her nightg swayed gently with her movements, revealing slender ankles.

William pretended to focus on his laptop, but the words blurred before his eyes.

His attention kept drifting uncontrollably toward her.

The apron strings cinched around her waist, accentuating its slimness.

Suddenly, William stood.

The sound startled Emily.

When she turned, he was already standing right behind her.
###Chapter 70
The sky darkened as enticing aromas wafted from the kitchen. Emily Smith focused intently on preparing ingredients, anxious not to keep William Johnson waiting. With deft movements, she deveined shrimp, completely unaware of the scorching gaze fixed on her back.

Suddenly, the familiar crisp scent of sandalwood enveloped her from behind. Before she could react, strong arms encircled her in a warm embrace. His palms burned against her skin as they trailed slowly down her waistline.

"Ah!" Emily's hand jerked, scissors nearly nicking her fingertip. The shrimp slipped into the sink with a splash.

William's lips brushed her ear, his heated breath tickling the sensitive lobe. "So focused? Didn't even notice me." His voice dropped to a husky murmur laced with unmistakable suggestion. Emily's legs weakened, the scissors clattering onto the countertop.

"Stop..." Her voice dripped like honey. "Dinner isn't ready..."

A low chuckle vibrated against her skin as his teeth grazed her earlobe. "I'm hungry for something else right now."

...

When it ended, Emily lay boneless on the couch watching William stride toward the kitchen in his robe. As water ran, she drowsily realized dinner plans had evaporated.

Thirty minutes later, mouthwatering aromas roused her from near-sleep. Dragging her aching body to the kitchen doorway, she froze at the unbelievable sight—

William stood at the stove expertly flipping ingredients. His slender fingers gripped the spatula with professional ease as glistening beef slices tossed in crimson sauce sizzled in the wok.

"You can cook?" Emily's eyes widened.

"Surprised?" William didn't turn, amusement coloring his voice.

Emily edged closer, swallowing hard at the perfectly seared beef. "I thought you only ate at Michelin-starred places."

"Ready to admit you're wrong?" William glanced sideways, mischief flashing in his eyes. "Go sit down."

Three dishes and soup soon covered the table. Emily's stomach growled as she admired the feast. Eagerly, she served William rice with both hands. "Your meal, Chef Johnson."

William looked up from his phone to find her bright-eyed like an expectant kitten. Deliberately slow, he set his phone aside and picked up chopsticks.

Emily watched impatiently as he selected a beef slice, biting her lip. The moment he started eating, she shoveled a large portion into her mouth.

"Mmm!" Spicy umami exploded on her tongue, making her eyes flutter shut. "This is amazing! Is there anything you can't do?"

William smiled at her stuffed cheeks, warmth softening his gaze. "Slow down. It's not going anywhere."
###Chapter 71

William Johnson set down his phone and glanced at the petite woman across the table, who was engrossed in her meal. His lips curved into an unconscious smile.

"Do you like it?" he asked, raising a brow.

Emily Smith's cheeks were stuffed full as she nodded vigorously. "Mhm, I love it."

"Do you love the food I made, or do you love me?" William propped his chin on one hand, his gaze burning into her.

Emily paused her chopsticks, blinking. "The food is delicious."

"Just the food?" he pressed.

"You're... really good at everything," she mumbled under her breath.

"Care to elaborate?" William suddenly seemed intrigued, setting down his chopsticks and leaning closer.

The tips of Emily's ears turned pink as she lowered her head and poked at the rice in her bowl. "I mean... you're just amazing."

"What do you like most about me?" His deep voice was laced with temptation.

Emily jerked her head up, meeting his teasing gaze—then instantly understood. Her fair cheeks flushed crimson.

"I... like everything," she stammered before shoving a large bite of rice into her mouth.

William chuckled lowly. "Really?"

"Since when are you so insecure?" she shot back, her face still burning.

William: "......"

Dinner ended late into the night. Emily was in her nightgown, and William wore a bathrobe. Neither could call housekeeping to clean up, so Emily volunteered to wash the dishes.

When she finished tidying the kitchen, she spotted William on the balcony, phone pressed to his ear. Through the glass door, she could see his furrowed brow.

She was about to slip back to her room when William suddenly crooked a finger at her.

Emily hesitated but stepped forward. The moment she entered the balcony, he yanked her into his arms, pressing her back against the railing.

"William, I miss you. Come to New York with me, okay?"

A woman's sultry voice drifted from the phone. Emily stiffened, instinctively trying to turn around.

But William angled the screen away while his other hand slid beneath her nightgown.

"Ah—" She gasped, then immediately bit her lip.

"What are you doing?" The woman's voice sharpened abruptly.

Emily frantically grabbed his wandering hand, but he easily overpowered her.

"What do you think?" William smirked into the phone, his fingers growing bolder.

"William Johnson! Is there a woman with you?" Anger now laced the voice on the other end.

Emily clenched her teeth, refusing to make another sound.

"Is that a problem?" His tone was deliberately flippant.

Silence stretched for a few seconds before the woman suddenly laughed. "Fine. I'll give you one last chance."

The call ended abruptly. William tossed his phone onto the couch, then gripped Emily's chin and crushed his lips against hers.

"Stop... someone might see..." She struggled weakly against him.

William swept her into his arms and murmured against her ear, "Relax. No one can see us."
###Chapter 72

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Emily Smith opened her eyes. The space beside her was already empty.

Not even a trace of warmth remained on the sheets.

She got up and washed her face with practiced indifference, unconcerned about William Johnson's whereabouts.

After breakfast, she headed to the hospital to visit her sister as usual.

Just as she stepped out of Sky City One, a breaking news segment played on the giant LED screen across the street.

Alexander Johnson, eldest son of the Shen family, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Sophia Song, heiress of the Song family from Ninghuai. They announced their engagement, set for the eighteenth of next month.

Under the flashing cameras, he looked impeccable in his tailored suit while her gown fluttered elegantly—a picture-perfect aristocratic couple.

Emily paused to watch for a few seconds.

Such well-matched unions were commonplace among high society.

Alexander was William's older brother.

With the Shen-Song alliance now official, what did that mean for William?

Would he end up with Olivia Davis, the prized daughter of the Lu family? Or perhaps his rumored first love, Amanda Lin?

The memory of that coquettish female voice on last night's phone call made Emily's chest tighten inexplicably.

Had Amanda failed to marry Alexander and now set her sights on William instead?

It seemed her arrangement with William would soon come to an end.

The thought stole her breath.

She was actually reluctant.

Reluctant to let go of the man who transferred money to her, rescued her from tight spots, and even cooked for her.

But reason told her this transactional relationship was destined to conclude.

......

In the recording studio, Daniel Chen noticed her subdued mood.

"Emily, are you free for dinner tonight?" he ventured cautiously.

She'd been distancing herself from him lately, limiting contact to strictly professional matters.

"Sorry, Daniel. I already have plans."

Her refusal was crisp and final.

Disappointment flickered in his eyes, but he smiled gently. "Another time, then."

After hanging up, Emily checked the time and decided to go shopping for lingerie.

The moment she stepped outside, Mia Harris's video call came through.

"Miss me?" Her best friend's radiant smile filled the screen.

"To the point of lovesickness," Emily teased.

"Liar!" Mia pouted. "If you really missed me, you'd come see me right now."

Emily froze mid-step as realization struck. "You're back in the country?!"

Her delighted shriek echoed down the street.
###Chapter 73

"I'm back!" Mia's radiant smile filled the screen, her eyes crinkling into crescents. "Can't wait to see me?"

"I've missed you so much!" Emily nearly jumped with excitement. "Send me your location right now."

"Don't forget to bring little Yiyi along. I've been dying to see her." Mia mentioned Emily's sister cheerfully, completely unaware of the situation.

Emily's smile froze. Her fingers tightened around the phone unconsciously. "Yiyi... hasn't been well enough to go out lately," she said softly. "I'll bring her to see you another time."

Understanding the implications of Yiyi's autism, Mia didn't press further and simply agreed with a bright, "Okay!"

The moment the call ended, the location notification popped up. Emily glanced at the address—not far from Sky City—and quickly hailed a taxi.

Mia had chosen a newly opened seafood restaurant. She remembered how much Emily loved seafood, but ever since the family crisis, they hadn't indulged in a proper seafood feast in ages.

"Emily!"

The familiar voice reached her the second she stepped out of the cab. Mia stood at the restaurant entrance, rushing toward her like an excited little bird.

Under the sunlight, Mia's smile was as dazzling as ever. Emily's eyes grew warm as she opened her arms for the long-awaited embrace.

"Oh my god!" Mia pulled back, scrutinizing her before suddenly frowning. "Now I know why you never initiate video calls."

Emily raised a brow. "Hmm?"

"You've been secretly getting prettier!" Mia poked her cheek indignantly. "How unfair!"

Emily couldn't help but laugh. "You caught me."

Mia dragged her toward the restaurant, half-threatening, "You better spill everything later. What have you been up to this past year to become this stunning?"

"As you wish, Your Majesty." Emily grinned.

They had been classmates since middle school, hailed as the two golden flowers of their class. Some admired Emily's cool elegance, while others adored Mia's vibrant charm.

But instead of rivalry, they became inseparable best friends. For six years, they shared school uniforms, sipped from the same bubble tea, and even kept each other's secrets.

Mia led her straight to the most luxurious private room. Before they could even order, waiters began bringing in platters of seafood, covering the entire table.

"What's all this?" Emily's eyes widened in surprise.

"My mom's new place." Mia winked proudly. "Eat as much as you want today!"

Emily laughed. "Are you trying to fatten me up?"

"If it's you..." Mia smirked, pinching her chin. "I wouldn't mind feeding you forever."

...

After the feast, Mia was eager to hit a bar. Though reluctant, Emily didn’t want to dampen her friend’s mood and followed along.

The bar pulsed with dim lights and deafening music. They settled at the counter and ordered two Pink Ladies.

"Let's dance!" Mia shouted over the noise, leaning close to Emily’s ear.

Emily shook her head. "I'm not really good at it."

"Liar!" Mia rolled her eyes. "You were amazing at ballet. This is nothing!"

Emily chuckled and stood. "Wait here. I’ll be right back—just need the restroom."

"Hurry!" Mia called after her. "I’m not dancing without you!"

The moment Emily left, their drinks arrived. Mia picked up one and downed it in a single gulp. She usually had a high tolerance, but this time, just half a glass made her head spin.

She clutched her forehead, trying to steady herself. Then a tall figure approached, slipping an arm around her swaying shoulders.

When Emily returned from the restroom, the bar counter was empty. Assuming Mia had grown impatient and gone to dance, she scanned the crowd but couldn’t spot her.

Just as she pulled out her phone to call, her peripheral vision caught a burly man leading a girl up the stairs.

That figure—it was unmistakably Mia.
###Chapter 74

A familiar perfume scent suddenly wafted into Emily Smith's senses.

She whipped her head around.

In the dimly lit corner, a burly man was leading a petite girl upstairs. That unmistakable silhouette made Emily's pupils constrict.

"Mia!"

She lunged forward and grabbed the girl's wrist.

Mia Harris lifted her head slowly, her gaze unfocused and lips pale. Her body hung limply in the man's arm like a broken marionette.

Emily's chest tightened.

She'd seen this too many times at The Royal Club—victims of spiked drinks.

"Back off!" The man snarled at her.

Suppressing her trembling, Emily forced a smile. "Sir, my friend seems unwell. Our other friends will be here any minute."

The man suddenly shoved her onto the stairs.

Emily's back slammed against the metal railing. Ignoring the pain, she clung to Mia's leg.

"Help! Someone's being kidnapped!"

Her cries drowned in the bar's noise. A few curious glances flickered their way before turning away.

"Looking to die?" The man raised his foot.

"Tiger."

A lazy male voice drifted from the second floor.

Emily looked up to see a young man in a floral shirt leaning against the railing. His gaze slithered over her like a venomous snake.

"Sweetheart, come up for a drink?" He smirked.

Emily tightened her grip on Mia's sleeve. "No thanks. Our boyfriends are waiting outside."

The floral-shirted man descended the stairs. He pinched Emily's chin, forcing her to meet his eyes.

"Calling the cops?" He spotted her phone and burst into laughter. "How amusing."

Two brutes appeared out of nowhere, hauling Emily toward the second floor. Mia was dragged behind like a ragdoll.

The private room door crashed open. Blinding light made Emily squint.

A dozen men and women lounged on the couches. At the center, Olivia Davis swirled a glass of red wine, flashing a triumphant smile.

Emily's blood turned to ice.

She finally understood—this was a carefully laid trap.
###Chapter 75

The moment the door closed, Emily Smith's back was already drenched in cold sweat. Mia Harris leaned weakly against her shoulder, cheeks flushed an unnatural red.

"Well, if it isn't Secretary Smith?" Olivia Davis swirled the juice in her crystal glass, her red lips curling into a mocking smirk.

Emily dug her nails into her palms. She should have known—Vivian Lu's malicious eyes had been full of ill intent when they crossed paths in the elevator.

"Miss Davis, what a pleasant surprise," Emily forced a smile, shielding Mia behind her.

Whistles erupted around the private room. A silver-haired man sauntered forward, tilting Emily's chin with his fingers. "Olivia, this one's got some fire."

"Lucas Lu!" Olivia suddenly smashed her glass. "Who said you could touch her?"

Shards of glass scattered. Emily seized the chance to reach for her phone, but someone behind her grabbed her wrist.

"Calling the cops?" The man sneered, snatching the phone and hurling it into the corner.

Mia suddenly trembled violently, sliding toward the floor. Emily caught her in panic, realizing her pupils were dilated.

"What did you give her?!"

Olivia smoothed her skirt with deliberate calm. "No need to rush. The fun's just beginning." She jerked her chin toward the door. "Lock it."

At that critical moment, the door burst open. George Taylor stood in the doorway, phone raised, its camera trained on the scene.

"Wow, quite the party," he said, shaking the phone. "I just went live. The audience thinks Miss Davis really knows how to entertain."

Olivia's face paled. "George, have you lost your mind?"

"You're the crazy ones." George strode in, yanking Emily toward him. "Daring to lay hands on what's mine?"

Emily caught on instantly, pressing into his arms. "They drugged Mia..."

"Bullshit!" Lucas lunged for the phone, but George sidestepped him.

"Still live, Mr. Lu," George said coldly. "Want me to let the viewers judge?"

Chaos erupted in the room. Seizing the moment, George whispered to Emily, "Hold your friend. We're leaving."

The three stumbled out of the bar, Mia barely conscious. George scooped her up and shoved her into the backseat of his sports car.

The emergency room lights glared stark white. After administering a sedative, the doctor shook his head. "Another half hour, and this dosage could've been fatal."

Emily's tears finally fell. She fumbled for her cracked phone, but William Johnson's number wouldn't connect.

"Stop calling." George handed her a hot coffee. "He flew to Zurich this morning." Seeing her pale face, he added, "But Olivia crossed the line this time. My brother won't let her off."

Outside, neon lights still flickered. Emily stared at Mia's unconscious form on the hospital bed, her nails carving deep crescents into her palms.
###Chapter 76

"Was it Olivia Davis who ordered the attack on you?"

Emily Smith bit her lower lip in thought. "Most likely."

George Taylor frowned, inhaling sharply. "It seems Olivia already knows about you and William."

Emily's heart clenched. "Did I cause trouble for William?"

George suddenly chuckled. "A little trouble, perhaps. But I told her you're under my protection now. She won't touch you—for the time being."

Given Olivia's temperament, if she knew how much William cared for Emily, she wouldn't hesitate to end Emily's life.

Last time, when Sophia Song was merely rumored to be involved with William for a few days, she returned to Jinzhou severely beaten and spent over half a month in the hospital.

And Sophia was a famous celebrity. Olivia had no qualms about targeting her—what chance did an ordinary girl like Emily stand?

Emily hesitated, then finally nodded quietly. "Thank you."

"Should I stay with you?" George asked.

Emily quickly shook her head. "No need. You've already helped us enough tonight. I'll treat you to dinner another time."

"Then let's exchange numbers. Contact me if anything happens." George pulled out his phone.

"Alright."

After seeing George off, Emily sat alone by the hospital bed, his words echoing in her mind.

William had gone abroad.

Was that woman's voice on the phone last night Amanda Lin?

Had he gone to see her?

Amanda was his first love—the one who still held his heart. If she reached out, how could he refuse?

Did this mean it was over between her and William?

Perhaps it was for the best.

Olivia was already targeting her because of William, and now Mia had gotten hurt too.

If she stayed with William, who knew what else Olivia might do?

She remembered Olivia's warning during their first encounter all too clearly.

Given Olivia's relationship with William, would he ever risk offending the Davis family for her sake?

Leaving William might be her only way out.

Lost in thought, her phone suddenly rang.

It was Mia's phone.

The caller ID read "Brother—Ryan Harris."

After a brief hesitation, Emily answered and informed him about Mia's hospitalization.

When Ryan arrived, Mia had just woken up, murmuring weakly about feeling cold.

Emily quickly fetched another blanket and wrapped Mia tightly in both, holding her close.

Ryan stepped into the room just in time to see the scene, his heart aching.

The moment Mia saw her brother, she threw herself into his arms and burst into tears.

It took Ryan a while to calm her down before she could recount the events between sobs.

Though her body had been weak, her mind had remained clear—she remembered everything.

Then she grabbed Emily's hand, her face full of guilt. "Emily, this is all my fault. I shouldn't have dragged you to that bar. If it weren't for you, I'd be..."

Emily shook her head, unable to tell them the truth—that she was the real reason behind the attack.

"I swear... sob... I'll never go to a bar again!" Mia wept pitifully.

Ryan couldn't stay angry seeing his sister like this. He sighed and coaxed her back to sleep.

"Emily, thank you for being there tonight." After tucking Mia in, Ryan turned to Emily, his voice gentle. "Let me arrange a ride home for you. You should rest."

It had been a long time since he'd last seen Emily.

The moment he laid eyes on her earlier, he'd been stunned.

Now, studying her more closely, he couldn't look away.

He couldn't understand how she'd transformed into such a radiant beauty.

Perhaps it was the magic of growing up—she now carried both the purity of a girl and the allure of a woman, the two blending seamlessly in her.
###Chapter 77

"Mr. Harris, will you tell Olivia Davis and the others about what happened tonight?" Emily Smith asked softly.

She had just learned from George Taylor that the man who forcibly took her and Mia Harris was Lucas Davis, Olivia's cousin.

The Davis family had deep roots in Jinzhou. Olivia's grandfather alone had three wives.

William Harris chuckled. "What, afraid I can't handle it?"

Emily bit her lip, hesitating.

"Don't worry. I won't throw myself against a stone wall." Seeing her unease, he reassured her, "As long as they don’t provoke Mia again, this ends here."

Only then did Emily’s tension ease.

After exchanging a few more words and confirming Mia was fine, she left.

It was late when she returned to Jinzhou Bay No. 1.

The moment she turned on the lights, her phone rang.

William Johnson’s name flashed on the screen.

She hesitated before answering.

"Hello."

"Who gave you permission to go to a bar?" His voice was tight with suppressed anger.

Standing in the foyer, Emily’s nose stung inexplicably.

"It won’t happen again," she murmured.

Silence stretched on the other end.

"I’m coming back the day after tomorrow." After a pause, his tone softened slightly. "Don’t leave the house tomorrow."

She opened her mouth, wanting to ask if he was worried Olivia would cause more trouble.

But all she said was, "Okay."

"Nothing else to say?" he asked.

"What do you want to hear?"

William let out a low laugh. "Go to sleep."

That night, she tossed and turned until dawn.

On Sunday, she stayed home obediently.

She couldn’t afford to get into trouble.

Her sister needed her. Her father in prison needed her.

Monday morning, just as she was heading to a meeting, the office phone rang.

The caller ID showed William Johnson’s office.

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Emily, the meeting’s starting," Lily White reminded her.

"You go ahead. I’ll take this call," she said with a strained smile.

Once her colleagues left, she picked up.

"Come here now." His voice sounded weary.

"I have a meeting in a minute," she refused.

"The meeting is more important than me?" His tone darkened.

"It’s work hours."

"I’m your boss’s boss’s boss." He scoffed. "Is obeying the CEO a problem?"

"What if missing the meeting affects my supervisor?" she countered.

"So the meeting is more important than me?"

"Is it urgent?" she asked quietly.

The line went dead.

Listening to the dial tone, she hesitated before grabbing her notebook and heading to the conference room.
###Chapter 78

Emily Smith had just stood up to head to the conference room when she ran into Lily White leading a stream of colleagues out the door.

"Meeting canceled?" she asked in surprise.

Lily shrugged. "The director got a call. It's been rescheduled for two this afternoon."

Emily nodded thoughtfully.

"Buzz—"

Her phone vibrated on the desk. The screen lit up with a WeChat message from the big boss:

[Come upstairs]

......

When the elevator doors opened on the 67th floor, Grace Lee's gaze immediately locked onto her.

Emily sensed the practiced smile on Grace's face—a carefully painted mask that didn't reach her eyes.

"Vice President Johnson is waiting for you," Grace said, rising to greet her. She linked arms with Emily in a show of familiarity. "Let's have lunch sometime?"

Emily smoothly withdrew her hand. "Sure. Thank you, Grace."

She walked to the office door and knocked lightly.

Silence.

Two more knocks. Still no response.

Emily pressed her lips together, amused. Throwing a tantrum again?

"Come in." The deep voice finally sounded from inside.

She pushed the door open.

"Close it," William Johnson ordered without looking up.

Emily shut the door behind her and maintained a safe distance. "What instructions do you have, Vice President Johnson?"

William set down his documents and leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing. "If I hadn't changed the meeting time, were you planning to ignore me all day?"

"Discussing personal matters during work hours isn't appropriate," she replied evenly.

"Concerned about my reputation?" He raised a brow.

Emily remained silent.

William chuckled lowly. This woman always knew how to get under his skin.

"I called you here for business."

She gave a slight nod. "Your orders?"

The phrase "romantic talk" she'd blurted earlier now felt bitterly ironic.

"Come here." His gaze burned into her.

Emily had barely taken two steps forward when a strong hand yanked her into his lap.

"Ah!"

She landed hard against him, trapped in his grip. His fingers lifted her chin as dark intensity swirled in his eyes.

"Not here for talk," he murmured, voice rough. "Here for—"

The last word vanished into a searing kiss.
###Chapter 79

"No..."

Emily Smith pushed against William Johnson's chest with trembling fingers, her resistance evident.

He effortlessly captured her slender wrist with one hand, pinning it behind her back. The office chair swiveled as he pressed her against the cold desk. His kiss was relentless, overpowering her defenses with practiced ease.

He knew every sensitive spot of her body too well. Soon, her struggles dissolved into breathless gasps, her fingers clutching desperately at his shirt.

When her knee-length skirt was pushed up, she turned her face away in embarrassment. Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, the city sprawled two hundred meters below, cars crawling like ants. As her back met the icy glass, she startled and threw herself into his arms.

"Hiss—"

William sucked in a sharp breath, pain flashing across his features. Gripping her waist, he growled through clenched teeth, "Emily Smith, are you trying to end my bloodline?"

Realizing her mistake, her cheeks burned crimson. "I—I didn't mean to..."

"Bed. Now." His darkened gaze left no room for argument as he swept her into his arms. "Thorough inspection required."

......

The curtains in the restroom swayed gently.

Exhausted, Emily curled at the edge of the bed when her eyes caught the document on the nightstand.

The bold letters of BestTech Group Economic Case Investigation Report seared into her vision.

Her fingers shook uncontrollably. Every word on those pages was a knife, brutally exposing the truth buried seven years ago. When she reached the familiar name at the end, her nails dug deep into her palms.

The bathroom door opened. Her head snapped up.

"You planned this?" Her voice was feather-light.

Water dripped from William's hair as he nodded silently, his stormy eyes locked onto her pale face.

This report had always been meant for her.
###Chapter 80

Emily Smith stared at the documents in her hands, her fingertips trembling slightly. She looked up at William Johnson, forcing a bitter smile. "Is all this... true?"

"Should I arrange for your mother to confront you in person?" William stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, hands in his pockets, sunlight casting shadows across his sharp profile.

"No need." She shook her head, nails digging into her palms.

So this was the truth.
The year her father was imprisoned, her mother couldn't wait to remarry and have another child.
She had betrayed their family long before that.
For her new lover, she'd sent her own husband to prison.
For her new lover, she'd abandoned Emily and her sister without hesitation.
How ironic.

"Emily, actually—"

"William." She suddenly interrupted him, flashing a bright smile. "Could you find me some clothes? A blouse or dress would do."

The man frowned slightly, his Adam's apple bobbing. He reached out to ruffle her hair. "Wait here."

Turning away, he dialed an internal number and precisely recited Emily's measurements. Grace Lee on the other end understood immediately—a complete outfit would arrive within fifteen minutes.

After hanging up, William glanced toward the lounge. Just as he was about to step forward, the office phone rang again.

"Vice President Johnson, Miss Davis has arrived downstairs," the secretary reported urgently.

His eyes darkened as he hung up and strode toward the lounge. Pushing open the door, he found Emily curled up by the window, her slender frame looking as if it might dissolve into the sunlight at any moment.

The sound of the wardrobe opening startled her. Emily turned to see the man efficiently changing into a dress shirt and slacks.

"Olivia's here." He fastened his cufflinks as he approached her, suddenly leaning down to grip her chin. "Want to meet her?"

Emily's pupils constricted violently, her lips trembling too much to form coherent words. How could she face anyone like this? Nothing beneath the borrowed shirt, telltale marks still visible on her neck.

William chuckled lowly, his thumb brushing over her swollen lips.

"William!"
The lounge door burst open.
###Chapter 81

Emily trembled and instinctively took half a step back.

William remained composed. He lowered his head to brush his lips lightly against hers before releasing her and turning to push the door open.

"William—"

"I'm here."

Olivia was about to call out again when his deep voice, laced with a hint of coolness, came from the direction of the lounge.

"Oh, you were in there!" Olivia's eyes brightened as she trotted over to loop her arm through his.

William withdrew his hand without expression and walked straight to his desk. He flipped open a file without looking up. "What is it?"

Pouting, Olivia circled to stand in front of him, resting her hands on the edge of the desk. "Can't I miss you? It's been a whole week."

His gaze remained fixed on the document. He didn't respond.

"William~" She leaned down to grasp his hand. "Just have lunch with me."

William reclined in his chair, pulling his hand away again. His eyes flicked to her briefly. "Did I say no?"

"Of course not!" Olivia beamed instantly, changing the subject. "By the way, I met your classmate's cousin last Saturday."

Inside the lounge, Emily's breath hitched.

"Which one?" William's brow twitched slightly.

"That girl named Emily. She was wild at the bar." Olivia blinked. "I wanted to buy her a drink, but George took her away. Said she was your latest fling."

William's expression didn't shift. "And?"

"She works at BestTech." Olivia tilted her head. "Why would you introduce her to George? That plain little thing isn't even in his league."

"Just for fun." William chuckled. "Since when do you care?"

Just for fun.

The words stabbed into Emily's heart like knives. She'd foolishly allowed herself to believe William saw her as something special.

But reality always delivered its slap at the perfect moment.

Someone like her—even George was only after novelty. What hope did she have with William?

"So does that mean you also..." Olivia's eyes gleamed.

"Guess." William stood and picked up his suit jacket. "Weren't we going to lunch? Let's go."

He strode out without waiting. Olivia hurried after him, giggling. "Wait for me!"

###Chapter 82

Emily Smith curled up in the corner of the lounge, only releasing a long sigh when she was certain the footsteps in the hallway had completely faded away.

Just as she began to relax, the crisp sound of high heels approached from a distance.

"Knock, knock—" A knock sounded at the door. "Emily, are you in there?" Grace Lee's voice came from outside. "Vice President Johnson asked me to bring you some clothes."

"I'm here. Please come in." Emily scrambled up from the floor in a hurry.

Grace pushed the door open, carrying several elegant shopping bags. The moment she took in the scene before her, her breath caught.

Emily stood on the carpet wearing only black lingerie. Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains, casting a glow over her body and outlining her perfect curves. Her porcelain skin shimmered like pearls, and her long, slender legs were so striking it was impossible to look away.

But what drew the most attention were the faint red marks scattered across her body. They trailed from her delicate collarbone all the way down to her inner thighs—each one a testament to the intensity of what had just transpired.

"You can leave the clothes here." Sensing Grace's gaze, Emily quickly grabbed a towel from the bed to cover herself, her ears turning pink.

Grace set down the shopping bags and turned to leave, but then, as if possessed, she glanced back. "Vice President Johnson... must be quite impressive, huh?"

"What?" Emily's eyes widened.

"Nothing." Grace shook her head with a smile and swiftly exited the lounge.

......

By the time Emily returned to the Business Department, it was nearly noon. She kept her head down as she hurried to her workstation, hoping to avoid drawing her colleagues' attention.

"Emily!" Lily White called out to her. "The boss has been looking for you all morning. Head to his office right away."

"Got it. Thanks, Lily." Emily was about to leave when Lily stopped her again.

"Huh?" Lily gave her a once-over. "You changed clothes? Weren't you wearing a white dress this morning?"

Emily glanced down at the fitted blouse and trousers she now wore—clearly expensive, tailored to perfection.

"I spilled something on the other one, so I had to buy a new set," she explained softly.

Lily nodded knowingly. "It suits you."

When Emily knocked on Michael Thompson's office door, she immediately noticed his gaze lingering on her for a few extra seconds.

"Do you think you can secure this contract?" Michael handed her a document.

After quickly scanning it, Emily nodded. "I'll do my best."

"Oh, and one more thing," Michael said casually. "Robert Miller was fired. HR just sent out the email."

Emily's expression remained neutral. "I haven't had a chance to check my emails yet."

Michael smiled thoughtfully. Last Friday, he had personally witnessed Emily getting into Robert's car—only for Vice President Johnson to storm out of the elevator moments later, his face dark with anger. Now, with Robert suddenly terminated, the connection was impossible to ignore.

It seemed the young vice president cared about Emily far more than anyone had realized.
###Chapter 83

Emily had stayed too long in William's office that morning. When a new project suddenly landed on her desk, she had no choice but to work overtime. She set her phone to silent and tossed it aside, completely missing the incoming WeChat notifications flashing across the screen.

The clock ticked past eight when she finally finished the last report. Just as she began packing up, a chorus of "Vice President Johnson" echoed through the office.

Five colleagues from the Business Department were still working late. At first, Emily paid no attention—until the second greeting reached her ears. She snapped her head up.

William was striding toward her with long, purposeful steps, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Her heart lurched.

She shot to her feet on instinct, grabbing her bag and bolting for the restroom. No one could find out about their relationship.

"Emily Smith!"

His deep, icy voice cracked like a whip behind her. She froze mid-step, then slowly turned under the stunned stares of her coworkers.

"Did you need something, Vice President Johnson?" Her voice was barely a whisper as she kept her eyes downcast.

William narrowed his eyes, the corner of his mouth curling into a dangerous smirk. "What do you think?"

"Was it my cousin who sent you?" She forced out the lie, nails digging into her palms.

His expression darkened instantly. He glanced at his watch. "One minute."

Emily seized the lifeline, darting back to her desk. Shutting down her computer, gathering her things, and slinging her bag over her shoulder—she did it all in one frantic motion, never daring to meet her colleagues' eyes.

"Done," she murmured.

William's gaze was stormy as he turned on his heel and walked away. She trailed after him, her back damp with cold sweat.

The elevator doors had barely closed before he slammed her against the metal wall. His scorching lips crashed into hers with punishing force. A pained whimper escaped her, but she didn't resist.

Then came the sharp sting of teeth on her tongue.

"Are you ashamed to be with me?" William panted against her forehead, his thumb swiping at the blood on her lip.

Emily turned her face away, the metallic taste filling her mouth. "You're the one who's ashamed."

Outside the Business Department's glass doors, five pairs of eyes were glued to the elevator. The buzz of hushed voices erupted like a stirred hornet's nest, piercing through the quiet of the night.
###Chapter 84

"Say that again." William tightened his grip, his long fingers pinching her chin as he forced her to meet his gaze.

Emily stared back defiantly. "I said, if people knew we slept together, it's you who should be ashamed, not me."

His brow arched slightly, a dangerous glint flashing in his eyes. "So you've been avoiding me in public because you're afraid people might find out?"

"Isn't that how it should be?" she countered.

William abruptly released her and took a step back, his lips curling into a cold smile. "How considerate. You're absolutely right."

The air in the elevator turned icy.

Emily opened her mouth but ultimately lowered her head in silence. She knew better than anyone—aside from that fifty thousand, she shouldn't hope for anything more.

"I'm sorry," she murmured.

His expression darkened instantly. "What did you say?"

The elevator dinged as it reached the basement level. Without waiting for her reply, he strode out.

Emily hurried after him. Once inside the car, her phone buzzed twice—a reply from Mia saying she was feeling better. Relief washed over her; she had planned to visit Mia today.

Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed William leaning back with his eyes closed, his jawline tense with displeasure. She opened WeChat and saw his four unread messages:

[Wait for me after work.]
[Come down at 7:10.]
[Where are you?]
[Get down here now.]

The last one was clearly laced with anger.

Emily bit her lip. Suddenly, she set her phone aside, lowered the partition, and climbed onto his lap.
###Chapter 85

William Johnson's Adam's apple bobbed as his breathing grew noticeably heavier. When Emily Smith playfully flicked her tongue against it like a mischievous kitten, his eyes flew open.

He gripped her chin, forcing her to look up. Dark currents swirled in his inky gaze as he rasped, "That trick's getting old. Got anything new?"

Emily curved her lips into a smile, tracing circles on his chest with her fingertip. "It works, doesn't it?"

William chuckled lowly, capturing her wandering hand. "Emily Smith, you're getting bolder."

She nuzzled closer, brushing her soft lips against the corner of his mouth. "Sorry I missed your messages. Don't be mad?"

William sucked in a sharp breath and yanked her against him by the waist. "Don't cry later." Before she could react, he flipped their positions, pinning her to the seat in a searing kiss.

......

Afterwards, Emily gazed up at him with damp, red-rimmed eyes. "Still angry?"

William narrowed his eyes. "That was all an act?"

She shook her head hastily. "You went too deep... It really hurt."

"Is that a compliment?" He arched a brow.

"Be gentler next time?" she mumbled, cheeks flushed. "Felt like you were trying to break me."

William laughed darkly, pinching her crimson cheek. "You started this, little minx."

As night fell, William took her to the rotating restaurant atop Jinzhou's tallest building. Over six hundred meters in the air, the city's glittering lights stretched beneath them.

Emily stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, the dazzling skyline reflected in her pupils. She remembered that night at the hillside villa when she'd lied about wanting to see the view—and William had promised to show her something more spectacular.

Now all of Jinzhou shimmered at their feet.

Though the restaurant bustled with patrons, William didn't hesitate to lead her through the crowd, hand in hand. Under countless curious glances, he pulled out her chair with perfect decorum.

"William, what a coincidence."

A familiar voice rang out behind them.
###Chapter 86

"What a coincidence, William."

A deep male voice came from behind.

Emily Smith instinctively turned around to see Alexander Johnson approaching with Sophia Song on his arm. Sophia wore a Chanel suit, every movement exuding the grace of a socialite.

"Brother, Miss Song." William Johnson stood up, a polite smile curving his lips.

Emily quickly rose to her feet, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress. She kept her head lowered, unable to meet their gazes.

"And who is this?" Alexander's scrutinizing eyes swept over Emily.

Sophia also studied her with interest.

"My friend, Emily Smith," William said calmly, then turned to Emily. "This is my elder brother and his fiancée."

Emily lifted her head, forcing a polite smile. "Mr. Johnson, Miss Song."

"Miss Smith?" Sophia arched a brow. "Are you perhaps some distant relative of the Johnson family?"

Alexander scoffed. "No such person exists in our family."

"Just a coincidence of surnames," William said, his gaze lingering on Emily with unexpected warmth. "A close friend."

Sophia let out a knowing "Oh" and tightened her grip on Alexander's arm. "Seems we've interrupted the second young master. Alexander, let's go."

As the sole heiress of the Song family, Sophia had always looked down on others. But now, as the future daughter-in-law of the Johnson family, she paid unusual attention to Emily. After all, William marrying a woman of modest background would only work in her favor.

"Enjoy your meal." Alexander nodded at them before leading Sophia away.

Only when their figures disappeared around the corner did Emily slowly sit back down. She clutched her water glass, her fingertips slightly cold.

"What's on your mind?" William asked.

Emily looked up at him, hesitating. She recalled what William had said to Olivia Davis that morning—just having some fun.

"Miss Song is very beautiful," she finally said.

William chuckled. "Once you get to know her better, you'll see what kind of person she really is."

Once you get to know her better?

Emily's heart clenched. What future did she and William even have?

She lowered her head and took a sip of water, changing the subject.
###Chapter 87

The night deepened as Emily Smith stepped out of the hospital after visiting her sister. William Johnson's car was still parked in the same spot, its window half-lowered, revealing his slender fingers tapping lightly on the steering wheel.

By the time they returned to Jinzhou Bay No.1, it was already late. William headed straight to the balcony, phone pressed to his ear, his expression grave. Emily tactfully left him alone and retreated to her room for a hot shower.

The warm water washed away her exhaustion. Wrapped in a towel, she stepped out to find the living room lights still on. William sat on the couch, a document clenched in his hand, his brow furrowed.

She tiptoed to bed. Sleep claimed her almost instantly the moment her head touched the pillow.

Half-asleep, she felt the mattress dip behind her. A cool chest pressed against her back, the crisp scent of cedar enveloping her. Emily's lashes fluttered as she drowsily turned over.

In the warm glow of the bedside lamp, William gazed down at her. He brushed a kiss against her forehead, his voice laced with amusement. "Want me?"

"No." She burrowed deeper under the covers.

"Then sleep." He reached to turn off the light, pulling her into his arms.

Emily slept soundly through the night. In her haze, she felt something warm and wet tracing her collarbone, sending shivers down her spine. Instinctively, she tried to push it away, but her wrist was pinned to the pillow.

"William—" Her protest was cut off by his lips.

By dawn, Emily lay tangled in the sheets, breathless. William hovered above her, damp strands of hair falling over his forehead, desire still darkening his eyes.

"Shower together?" His voice was rough.

"We'll be late." She shook her head, her voice trembling slightly.

William chuckled, nipping her lower lip. "So dedicated. Maybe I should promote you early."

"Will that come with a raise?" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

He arched a brow. "How much do you want?"

Emily bit her lip, realizing her slip. "This is already good enough."

"Easy to please?" His gaze darkened. "Or is the salary beneath you?"

"Of course I care," she hurried to explain. "With hard work, maybe I could become a manager in a few years—"

Her words were cut off by his laughter. William ruffled her hair, his tone teasing. "Mm. Work hard."

The last three words were deliberately emphasized, making Emily's ears burn. She grabbed a pillow and threw it at him, only for him to pin her back into the mattress. The morning sunlight shattered into golden fragments between their entwined bodies.
###Chapter 88

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains.

Emily Smith opened her eyes to find the space beside her empty. She reached out, feeling the lingering warmth on the sheets where William Johnson had slept.

She rose and headed to the bathroom, hearing water running in the adjacent one. They'd silently chosen separate bathrooms to get ready.

The aroma of coffee filled the dining room.

Emily hastily ate her sandwich while glancing at the wall clock. She needed to organize the files before Michael Thompson arrived at work.

"I'm leaving first." She grabbed her bag to rush out.

"Wait for me." William set down his phone, his gaze heavy upon her.

Emily paused. "Something wrong?"

"Can't we commute together without a reason?" His lips curved in a faint smile.

Her fingers twisted the bag strap unconsciously. She didn't want colleagues seeing them arrive together.

"The subway's more convenient." She turned to leave.

"Emily." His voice turned icy.

She looked back to meet his darkened expression.

"Am I that embarrassing to be seen with?" His question was blunt.

She bit her lip. "What should I say if people ask about us?"

"Friends."

"Do you think anyone would believe that?" Her laugh was bitter.

William's face grew stormier.

"It's all pretend anyway. Why deceive ourselves?" Without looking back, she pushed through the door.

...

The following days passed without any sign of William.

Emily forced herself not to think about him. Her life became a stagnant routine between the office and the hospital.

Before her weekend prison visit, she bought new clothes and supplements for her father. The cashier gave her extra glances, seemingly recognizing her as the Johnson family's daughter.

In the visitation room, her father's gaze was sharper than usual.

"How are Grandma and Xiaoyi?" He asked the same question for the hundredth time.

Emily clenched her skirt. The prepared lie stuck in her throat, refusing to come out.

"Emily?" His voice trembled.

A tear hit the table.

"I'm sorry..." She finally broke. "I failed to protect them..."

Her father pressed against the glass, as if trying to wipe her tears through the barrier.

"Tell me what happened."

Tears flooded down her face. She opened her mouth, but no sound emerged.
###Chapter 89

Emily Smith stood before the glass partition in the prison visitation room, her fingertips trembling slightly.

She remembered how, at ten years old, she had bitten her lip hard to hold back tears when her mother walked away without looking back. But now, the tears fell uncontrollably, like beads from a broken string.

"Emily..."

Henry Johnson pressed his rough palm against the glass, his eyes red-rimmed. His voice cracked. "I failed you. I made you carry this family alone. You've done more than enough all these years."

Emily took a deep breath, her nails digging into her palms.

"Dad," she whispered, her voice feather-light. "Lily was in a car accident. The doctors said... she might not wake up."

The man on the other side of the glass froze, the color draining from his face.

"And Grandma..." Emily's throat tightened. "She had a heart attack. They couldn't save her."

A loud clatter echoed as Henry stumbled against the chair. He covered his face, his shoulders shaking violently.

"It's all my fault..." Emily's tears splashed onto the back of her hand. "If only I hadn't let her go out alone that day—"

"No!" Henry jerked his head up, his bloodshot eyes locking onto his daughter. "This is my sin to bear..."

As the visitation time neared its end, Henry suddenly grabbed the receiver. "That boss who lent you money—who is he?"

Emily hesitated, then forced a weak smile. "He's from a legitimate company. Don't worry."

Stepping out of the prison gates, the harsh summer sunlight blinded her. Her phone buzzed—a message from Mia Harris, inviting her to go shopping.

The mall's air conditioning was icy. Emily stood in the lingerie section as a sales assistant measured her with a soft tape.

"70D," the assistant announced.

Mia's shriek nearly shattered the ceiling.

"Emily Smith!" Mia yanked at the loose hem of Emily's T-shirt. "You've been hiding this bombshell figure!"

Emily swatted her hand away, her ears burning crimson.

"Spill it," Mia whispered hotly against her ear. "Is there a man?"

"Stop it!" Emily fumbled to cover Mia's mouth.

Mia dodged, her eyes gleaming. "How is he? Does he know how to—"

"Shut up!"

"Boyfriend? Hmph..."

A voice colder than ice cut through the air. Emily stiffened and slowly turned.

The mall lights were too bright. Squinting, she saw William Johnson leaning against the boutique entrance, a mocking curve on his lips. His tailored suit made him look out of place—like a deity who had strayed into the mortal world.

Mia gasped, her fingers tightening around Emily's arm.
###Chapter 90

Emily Smith was browsing lingerie with Mia Harris when a sharp, mocking laugh cut through the air.

"Well, if it isn't Emily Smith."

Both women turned to see Emma Clark strutting into the store, arm-in-arm with her mother. Emma's gaze sliced into Emily like a knife, her lips curled in a sneer.

"Emily, have you no shame?" Emma's voice was shrill. "A nobody like you dares to claim William Johnson as your boyfriend? You're not even fit to polish his shoes!"

Mia immediately stepped in front of Emily, eyes blazing.

"Emma, did your mouth grow out of your ass?" Mia scoffed. "Every word you spew reeks like garbage."

Emma's mother stiffened. "Watch your tone, young lady!"

"Mrs. Clark," Mia shot back, unflinching, "control your daughter's filthy mouth first. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree—you both need to wash your mouths out with soap."

Emma trembled with rage and raised her hand to strike.

Slap!

Emily shoved Emma hard. The girl staggered back and crashed to the floor.

"Assault!" Mrs. Clark shrieked, rushing to her daughter. "Everyone, look! This shameless niece of mine just attacked her own cousin!"

A crowd quickly gathered, murmuring and gawking.

"She runs wild every night, and when we try to advise her, she turns violent!" Mrs. Clark jabbed a finger at Emily, spittle flying.

Mia's face flushed with fury. "You started this with your insults!"

Mrs. Clark yanked a wad of cash from her purse and hurled it at Emily. "You're just after money, aren't you? Here, take it!"

The bills struck Emily's forehead and scattered across the floor.

Emily's fists clenched until her knuckles turned white.

"Enough!" She shoved Mrs. Clark back. "Haven't you two tormented me for over a decade already?"

Mrs. Clark stumbled, momentarily speechless.

Whispers rippled through the onlookers. Some held up phones, recording the scene. Emily took a deep breath and grabbed Mia's hand to leave.

"Don't you dare run!" Mrs. Clark lunged again.

Just then, a cold male voice cut through the crowd.

"What's going on here?"
###Chapter 91

"You think I need money?" Emily Smith let out a cold laugh, her voice cutting through the mall. "You're right. I do."

Her gaze sharpened like a blade, piercing straight at Mrs. Chen. "But I've needed money for years. Seven years, to be exact. Where were you when I was working four or five jobs a day? Now you throw cash at me in front of all these people—what's your game?"

Mrs. Chen's face twisted, but before she could speak—

"Your daughter has always hated seeing me succeed," Emily continued, her voice icy. "The moment I did better than her, she wanted to destroy me."

Mia Harris trembled with anger, pointing at the Chen mother-daughter pair as she addressed the crowd. "Look at them! All polished on the outside, but they only pick on the vulnerable!"

Whispers spread through the onlookers. Someone raised their phone to record.

Emily took a deep breath, then bowed deeply to the crowd. "Sorry you had to witness this." She grabbed Mia's hand and walked away, her back straight and unyielding.

Behind them, Mrs. Chen's hysterical screams faded into irrelevance.

That night, a video titled "Two Women Brawl Over a Man in Mall" went viral. Posted by a small influencer, its explosive content quickly racked up tens of thousands of views.

Twelve hours later, New York.

William Johnson had just wrapped up a meeting when his assistant, Daniel Chen, sent him a video link. One glance, and his expression turned glacial.

The sight of Emily's defiant figure made his chest tighten. When Mrs. Chen threw money at her, his knuckles whitened from the force of his grip.

"Daniel," he said into the phone, his voice like ice. "Handle this. Now."

Back in Jinzhou, it was Monday morning. Within ten minutes, every trace of the video and related accounts vanished without a trace.

On the subway, Emily stared blankly at her phone. The link Mia had sent her no longer worked—the video had been scrubbed from the entire internet.

"Emily!" Mia's call came through. "The video's gone! Even the account got banned!"

Emily froze. "How...?"

"It must be your mysterious friend!" Mia exclaimed. "Who is he? He's got serious pull!"

Emily pressed her lips together, William's stern face flashing in her mind. "He..." She hesitated. "I'll tell you over dinner."

"No 'someday'!" Mia insisted. "Today! Lunch or dinner?"

Emily sighed in resignation. After hanging up, she watched the scenery blur past the subway window, her emotions tangled.

What she didn't know was that, at that very moment, in the Chen Group's boardroom, Mr. Chen was receiving a phone call—one that would bring his entire family to ruin.
###Chapter 92

Emily hung up the phone with Mia and gazed blankly at the scenery flashing past the car window.

The only person who could make all the negative news about her vanish overnight was William Johnson. She couldn’t think of anyone else.

Her fingertips lingered on the phone screen for a long time before she finally locked it.

He had once said the last things he wanted to hear from her were "thank you" and "sorry."

Besides, she had no idea where he was now or who he was with.

Barging in uninvited would be inappropriate.

The company building came into view. She took a deep breath and pushed aside her tangled thoughts.

"Emily, did you see that video circulating in the group chat?" her colleague Lily whispered as soon as she stepped into the office.

Emily paused, her expression neutral. "What video?"

"It’s just—" Lily hesitated, then shook her head. "Never mind. It’s gone now anyway."

Emily calmly returned to her desk and turned on her computer.

Murmurs drifted from the break room.

"She must have hooked up with some big shot. Otherwise, how could everything disappear so cleanly?"

"I heard she worked multiple jobs back in college..."

The sound of the glass door swinging open cut the gossip short.

Michael Thompson walked in with a coffee cup, his gaze sweeping over the female colleagues. "Not busy? Quarterly reports all finished?"

They scattered like startled birds.

During their private meeting that afternoon, Michael seemed hesitant. "If you need any help—"

"Thank you for your concern," Emily interrupted with a smile. "It’s all in the past now."

Michael nodded knowingly. "With Vice President Johnson around, I suppose you don’t have to worry."

She simply smiled without explaining.

Just as she returned to her seat, her phone buzzed violently.

"Emily Smith! You bitch!" Emma Clark’s hysterical voice nearly pierced her eardrum. "Did you tell William to go after the Clarks?"

Emily calmly held the phone away from her ear.

"I’m warning you—go beg him to stop! Otherwise, I’ll tell Amanda Lin all about how you seduced him! Just wait and see—"

Click.

She ended the call decisively and blocked the number.

At the end of the workday, Mia burst into the office like a whirlwind.

"Come on! I’m treating you to a feast!"

Emily shook her head. "I want to visit Yvonne first."

The hospital still reeked of disinfectant.

On the bed, the young girl’s smooth scalp was marred by jagged stitches.

Mia’s bag hit the floor with a thud.

"This… this is…"

Emily gently took her sister’s cold hand and quietly recounted the nightmare of the past year.

"Emily!" Mia suddenly pulled her into a tight embrace, tears soaking her shoulder. "You idiot! Why didn’t you tell me sooner?"

Fists rained down on her back, but they didn’t hurt.

Finally, Emily’s eyes reddened too.
###Chapter 93

Emily Smith forced down the surge of emotions and curved her lips into a faint smile. "Didn’t we agree back then? Share the money when we have it, but run when trouble comes."

"Bullshit!" Mia Harris stomped her foot in frustration and shoved Emily’s shoulder. "That night at the bar when I was being harassed, why didn’t you run? Why did you jump in to fight with me?"

Emily staggered but steadied herself, her smile deepening. "Look at me now. I’m doing just fine, aren’t I?"

Mia’s eyes widened, her chest heaving. She wanted to turn and walk away, to never bother with this stubborn girl again.

But the sight of Emily’s thin shoulders made her heart ache unbearably.

When the Smith family fell apart—her father imprisoned, her mother fleeing with the money—Mia had silently vowed to protect her best friend. Who knew that while she was abroad, Emily would face an even greater ordeal?

"How much was the surgery for Lily?" Mia pulled out her phone, her fingers tapping aggressively on the screen. "Give me your account number. I’ll transfer the money right now."

Emily shook her head. "I really don’t need money right now."

Under Mia’s skeptical gaze, Emily laid out the truth about her relationship with William Johnson.

Mia was stunned.

Of course, she knew William—the second son of the Johnson family in Jinzhou, who had recently made headlines for his scandal with a celebrity. Her family even had distant ties to the Johnsons—her aunt was the cousin of the current Mrs. Johnson.

"You’re telling me… William paid for Professor Johnson to operate on Lily?" Mia’s voice cracked.

Then again, it wasn’t surprising that someone as beautiful as Emily had caught William’s eye. Especially since they were alumni.

"Yeah." Emily’s expression remained calm. "He paid for the treatment. I sleep with him."

"Emily, you—"

"Mia," Emily cut her off, "sleeping with William isn’t a bad deal. He’s handsome, fit, skilled, and treats me gently. In this arrangement, I haven’t suffered at all."

Mia frowned. "So you’re fuck buddies?"

Emily chuckled. "No. It’s more like boss and employee. Fuck buddies take what they need from each other. But here… I’m the only one benefiting."

"Then he could just dump you whenever he wants!" Mia protested.

"So what if he does?" Emily shrugged. "I got the money. My sister’s illness was treated. And I enjoyed myself. Isn’t that a hundred times better than ending up with a scumbag like David Brown?"

Mia fell silent.

When she thought about it, it made sense. William had looks, money, and treated Emily well. Even if they broke up someday, it would just be a fleeting romance. By any measure, Emily wasn’t losing out.

"You’re right." Mia finally relaxed.

Emily patted her stomach. "Weren’t you treating me to dinner? If we don’t go soon, the restaurant will be full."

"Let’s go!" Mia slung an arm around her shoulders. "Even if William dumps you, I’ll take care of you for life!"

Emily grinned, her eyes crinkling, and gave a firm nod. "Mm."
###Chapter 94

Night enveloped the No.1 apartment at Jinzhou Bay.

Emily Smith pushed open the door to complete darkness. Only moonlight filtering through the floor-to-ceiling windows cast mottled shadows on the wooden floor.

She leaned against the entryway, fingertips lightly tracing her phone screen. William Johnson's WeChat conversation remained unchanged from six days ago—his last four unread messages still displayed.

"Busy?"

"Not coming home for dinner."

"Get some rest."

"Goodnight."

Those four brief sentences. She'd reread them countless times.

Her thumb hovered over the screen, hesitating. Should she message him? Ask when he's returning? Inquire if he's angry?

Finally, she turned off the screen.

In the dark, she walked straight to her bedroom without turning on any lights.

Morning sunlight bathed New York in golden warmth.

William adjusted his tie in the walk-in closet when his phone lit up with an alert. The security cameras at Jinzhou Bay had detected movement.

He tapped the notification.

In the dim lighting, Emily's figure flashed across the screen before disappearing into the guest bedroom doorway.

Six full days.

She'd been leaving early and returning late each day, living so busily it seemed she didn't need him at all. Not even his help with her problems warranted a simple greeting.

"Hmph."

He exited the surveillance app with a cold laugh. His finger hovered over her contact before ultimately withdrawing.

He wanted to see how long it would take for her to remember him.

The shower stopped running.

Emily stepped out drying her hair when her phone screen illuminated. A missed call from "William Johnson."

Her heartbeat accelerated instantly.

She immediately called back.

"Hello?"

A bright female voice answered.

Emily's fingers froze.

"William's busy right now. Can I help with something?" The woman's voice carried laughter.

"N-no. Nothing." She ended the call abruptly.

Something heavy lodged in her chest.

"William."

Such an intimate address.

Taking a deep breath, she opened her laptop to begin recording. Tonight's workload demanded complete focus.

But sleep came fitfully.

When her morning alarm sounded, only a splitting headache greeted her. The mirror reflected puffy eyes and pallid skin.

Then her phone vibrated.

Bank notification: $387,863.85 deposited.

She counted the digits three times, confirming her second audiobook payment. Combined with previous savings, her balance now exceeded five hundred thousand.

The number made her eyes burn.

Never had she imagined earning six figures monthly from a side job. Never dreamed her account could hold so much.

Sunlight streamed through the window as she blinked away the stinging in her eyes.
###Chapter 95

The phone screen lit up with a bank notification displaying a six-figure royalty payment.

Emily Smith stared at the numbers. The gloom that had weighed her down for days instantly lifted.

This was the proudest moment of her twenty-two years.

Money earned through her own efforts felt more satisfying than anything else.

Near noon, Mia Harris's call brought another pleasant surprise.

Mia sounded mysterious on the phone, only saying she was waiting downstairs at the company to have lunch together.

When they met at the restaurant, Emily learned Mia had just finished an interview at BestTech Group.

"When did you apply?" Emily set down her chopsticks in surprise. "You kept it from me?"

Mia winked. "Why tell you? So you could ask Vice President Johnson for favors?"

Emily shook her head. "I don’t have that kind of influence."

"Relax." Mia pinched her cheek. "The HR director is my mom’s best friend. Besides—" She flipped her long hair. "With my qualifications, landing an HR specialist position is a piece of cake."

"You’ve always been outstanding," Emily said sincerely.

"Exactly!" Mia raised her juice glass. "Now we’ll be colleagues and besties. Cheers!"

Their glasses clinked with a crisp sound.

Soon, it was the eve of their graduation ceremony on Friday.

Emily finished her recording work early for once but tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep.

Thinking about seeing her classmates after months apart, she grabbed her phone.

The university group chat was flooded with unread messages. She scrolled quickly but found no mention of herself, then exited to browse social media.

Among the posts, one photo uploaded half an hour ago stood out painfully.

Though the poster’s profile picture was unfamiliar, the people in the photo were all too recognizable.

The first image showed a lavish banquet hall, crystal chandeliers glinting above clinking glasses.

The second was a group photo—William Johnson stood at the center with Olivia Davis in his arms, his lips curved in a careless smile, eyes gleaming.

In the corner, George Taylor and two others stood in tailored suits, raising their glasses in celebration.
###Chapter 96

Emily Smith stared blankly at her phone screen.

The WeChat contact named "I'm a White Rabbit" had just updated their status. Two photos accompanied by a simple English word—"Cheers."

It suddenly dawned on her. This must be George Taylor's account. Back at the hospital, she had hastily added him but forgotten to save his name.

With a tap of her finger, she changed the nickname to "George Taylor."

She continued scrolling through her feed, but nothing registered. The posts and pictures blurred before her eyes.

Images of the Sky City apartment flashed through her mind. Had William Johnson been staying there these past days? Did every apartment hide a woman like her?

Women who lived in the shadows.

Only society princesses like Olivia Davis or true loves like Amanda Lin could stand openly by William's side.

A tear splashed onto her phone screen.

Emily jolted awake, quickly wiping the tear away before turning off the light and lying down.

Meanwhile, at the gala.

William checked his watch—11 p.m. Rubbing his temples, he rose from his seat.

The alcohol and exhaustion made him lean back and close his eyes the moment he got into the car.

"Sir, back to Sky City?" Sam Wilson asked through the rearview mirror.

"Hmm," William murmured.

Halfway through the drive, he suddenly spoke. "Take me to the mansion."

The thought of Emily not sending a single message in over ten days evaporated his drowsiness. A fire burned in his chest.

Sam glimpsed his boss's stormy expression in the mirror and silently changed course.

That night, William tossed and turned.

At dawn, he headed straight to the gym. Only after working up a sweat did the fire in his chest slightly subside.

At the office, the elevator should have gone straight to the 67th floor. Instead, William pressed the button for the 50th.

Security footage showed Emily had left early. By now, she should be at her desk.

The doors opened. William strode toward the Business Department, with his assistant trailing behind.

Though it was still twenty minutes before work hours, many had already arrived. Michael Thompson was booting up his computer when a tall figure passed by in his periphery.

William stopped before Emily's workstation.

The empty seat darkened his expression. The temperature in the office seemed to plummet.

"Good morning, Vice President Johnson," Michael said, stepping forward. "Emily took the day off for her university graduation ceremony."

William shot him a cold glance before turning away, leaving a chill in his wake.
###Chapter 97

William Johnson's sharp gaze swept over Michael Thompson, freezing him to the core. A cold sweat instantly broke out down his back.

James Wilson trailed behind William, feeling the temperature in the hallway plummet. He held his breath, cautious with every step. Having worked for William for six years, he had never seen his boss look so terrifying.

The usually composed and gentle executive now radiated an oppressive aura that was suffocating.

"Sir, should I contact Miss Smith?" James ventured hesitantly.

William sat in his office chair, his eyes as sharp as blades. "Why would you look for her?"

James immediately felt the weight of his mistake. Forcing an awkward smile, he retreated from the office.

At 7:30 in the morning, Emily Smith wheeled her suitcase out of Jinzhou Bay No.1.

The dormitory building of the Foreign Language Institute stood under the swaying shadows of plane trees. When she pushed open the door, her three roommates were already packing.

"Morning," she greeted softly, heading straight to her bed.

"Well, look who's back—our star student," the short-haired roommate said with a mocking tone. "Heard you've climbed the social ladder?"

Emily paused briefly before continuing to organize her books. "David Brown and I broke up a long time ago."

"Really?" The curly-haired roommate widened her eyes dramatically. "But he confessed his love to you in front of the whole school!"

Emily didn’t respond, methodically folding her clothes into the suitcase.

"Emily, did you find a job?" The bespectacled roommate suddenly leaned in.

"Yes. At BestTech."

Silence fell over the room. The three girls exchanged glances. The short-haired one sneered, "BestTech’s hiring standards are sky-high. You didn’t…"

"I’m just a regular intern," Emily said, closing her suitcase and turning to leave.

"Wait!" The curly-haired roommate chased after her. "Can you put in a good word for me?"

Without looking back, Emily pulled open the door. "The recruitment portal is on the official website."

Sunlight streamed through the corridor windows. Just as she pulled out her phone, Michael Thompson’s call flashed on the screen.
###Chapter 98

"Michael?"

"Emily, Vice President Johnson just came to the Business Department looking for you. He seemed furious." Michael Thompson's voice was laced with concern. "Did you upset him?"

William came to the department for her?

Emily Smith froze for a second before quickly explaining, "No, we didn't argue."

"Really?" Michael's tone grew serious. "When he heard you weren't here, his expression turned even darker. I told him you took the day off for your graduation ceremony. Maybe you should reach out and clarify?"

"Alright, thanks, Michael."

After hanging up, Emily hesitated for a moment before opening her WeChat chat with William.

I'm off today. Did you need something?

She reread the message several times, ensuring the tone was neutral before hitting send.

Vice President's Office, BestTech Group

William Johnson was forcing himself to focus on paperwork, his anger simmering beneath the surface. His phone buzzed.

Seeing Emily's name, the tension in his brow eased slightly—until he read the message.

Off today. Did you need something?

That was her attitude toward him? A transactional relationship? No meetings on weekdays?

Thud. His phone slammed onto the desk. He leaned back, eyes shut, veins pulsing at his temples.

Emily Smith.

Fine.

He abruptly stood, grabbed his suit jacket, and strode out.

Foreign Language College

Emily stepped out of the department office and checked the time before heading toward the auditorium. The graduation ceremony was about to start, and students were already gathering.

As she descended the stairs, a figure suddenly lunged from the bushes.

"Ah!"

Emily staggered back, her ankle twisting as she fell hard. She looked up—Emma Clark, her face twisted with rage, was charging at her.

"You bitch! How dare you block me! You seduced William and ruined my family! I'll kill you!"

Emily curled into a protective ball as onlookers quickly formed a circle around them.

Nearby, a black Rolls-Royce rolled to a stop. From the backseat, William's sharp gaze locked onto the scene—Emily being attacked by the deranged Emma.

"Stop the car!"

Before the vehicle fully halted, he shoved the door open. But just as he moved to intervene, another familiar figure stepped in first—Daniel Chen, shielding Emily.

William stilled, his expression icy as he watched from a distance.
###Chapter 99

Daniel Chen shoved Emma Clark aside and immediately crouched down to check on Emily Smith. His brows furrowed with concern. "Emily, where are you hurt?"

Emily slowly lifted her head, strands of hair obscuring half her face. She blinked in surprise. "Daniel? What are you doing here?"

Daniel gently brushed the disheveled hair away from her face, his fingertips accidentally grazing her cheek. He studied her carefully. "Does anything hurt?"

Just as Emily started to shake her head, she saw Emma struggling to stand up again. This time, Emily didn't retreat. She pushed herself up and shoved Emma back forcefully.

Emma stumbled and fell to the ground once more. The Chen family had been in chaos these past days, with everyone taking their frustrations out on her. She'd tried every possible way to contact William Johnson, but all attempts had gone unanswered.

In desperation, she'd called Amanda Lin. After listening to Emma's exaggerated accusations, Amanda had only laughed coldly. "Are we close?"

"I've known about William and that Emily Smith for a while," Amanda's voice dripped with sarcasm. "He's protecting her now, just like he once protected me. Haven't you heard what happened to Lucas Lu?"

After the call ended, Emma completely lost it. She frantically dialed Emily's number, only to be blocked repeatedly. Today, she'd finally seized her chance to corner Emily during graduation.

Emily looked at Emma slumped on the ground and started to step forward when a sharp pain shot through her ankle. She gasped, swaying unsteadily.

"Don't move!" Daniel caught her, his gaze dropping to her slightly swollen ankle. Without waiting for her reaction, he scooped her up into his arms.

"Daniel!" Emily exclaimed.

"The infirmary isn't far." Daniel tightened his hold and strode purposefully toward the campus medical center.

Nearby, beside a black Rolls-Royce, William stood tall by the car door. He narrowed his eyes, watching their retreating figures, an icy aura radiating from him.

Emma was still cursing when she suddenly met William's frigid stare. She froze mid-sentence, her voice cutting off abruptly.

William withdrew his gaze and got into the car. The window rolled down as he ordered Sam Wilson, "Bring her to me."

"Yes, sir." Sam immediately headed toward Emma.
###Chapter 100

The crowd gradually dispersed, leaving only a few stragglers still peering curiously.

Sam Wilson strode toward Emma Clark with measured steps, each one radiating intimidation.

Emma recognized William Johnson's personal bodyguard. Her legs trembled involuntarily as she lifted her gaze to meet his icy stare, her throat tightening with fear.

"Miss Clark, the boss wants to see you," Sam said, his voice devoid of warmth.

Emma forced herself to ask, "W-what does Vice President Johnson want?"

Sam didn't bother responding. He seized her wrist and dragged her toward a black sedan parked nearby, handling her like a ragdoll.

Tears welled in Emma's eyes from the pain, but she dared not make a sound.

The car door slammed shut. Sam took the driver's seat as the temperature inside plummeted. Emma shrank into the corner, staring at William, who sat in the back with his eyes closed.

"Seven years ago, when Yang Yi stole BestTech's confidential files from Shen Mingli, your parents were involved too, weren't they?" William spoke abruptly.

Emma's face turned deathly pale. She knew exactly what he was referring to—she had already been an adult back then.

"I... I don't know..." Her voice shook.

William finally opened his eyes, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Last warning. If you dare trouble Emily Smith again, I won't hesitate to swap your parents out for Shen Mingli."

He paused. "Or maybe all three of you together."

Emma's face drained of color. She scrambled out of the car in sheer panic.

——

In the infirmary, the doctor examined Emily's ankle. "It might be a ligament strain. We'll need an X-ray to confirm."

Daniel Chen returned with medicated oil and knelt to apply it for her when his phone rang.

"I'll do it myself," Emily said, taking the bottle from him.

By the time Daniel finished his call, she had already applied the ointment.

"The graduation ceremony is about to start," she said, attempting to stand—only to wince in pain.

Daniel moved to carry her, but she refused. "I can walk."

Yet the moment she took a step, cold sweat drenched her back.

"I'll get the car," Daniel said, helping her sit back down before rushing toward the parking lot.

Emily watched him go, gently massaging her swollen ankle. Sunlight fell across her pale face, highlighting the fine beads of sweat on her skin.
###Chapter 101

The Rolls-Royce's license plate gleamed coldly under the sunlight. Emily Smith's heart skipped a beat.

Her pale face reflected in the tinted window.

Though she couldn't see inside, she felt a pair of eyes boring into her.

That gaze was like a poisoned arrow.

Her fingers hovered over William Johnson's number on her phone.

Each unanswered ring tightened the knot in her spine.

"Beep—"

The dial tone jolted her back to reality.

Why should she feel guilty?

This was nothing but a transaction between them.

Emily snapped her flip phone shut.

The metal casing left angry red marks on her palm.

Her scraped knees burned as she pushed herself up from the steps.

Twenty meters away, the Rolls-Royce's door swung open.

William's polished shoes crushed fallen leaves.

Daniel Chen's Toyota rounded the corner at that exact moment.

"Watch your step." Daniel's hand hovered near the small of her back.

The rearview mirror caught a glint of something sharp as the car door closed.

Emily's nails dug into the leather seat.

"You look pale." Daniel offered her a water bottle. "Did you hurt yourself when you fell?"

Condensation dripped down the chilled plastic.

She shook her head, catching movement near the Rolls-Royce in her periphery.

William's tie fluttered in the wind like a hissing snake.

"Is that the Johnson family's second son?" Daniel asked suddenly.

Two pairs of eyes locked in the rearview mirror.

Emily twisted the cap open with force. "I don't know him."

Water splashed onto her skirt.
###Chapter 102

The graduation ceremony was packed with people as the university administrators delivered speeches on stage.

Emily Smith hastily pulled on her graduation gown. Daniel Chen helped her slip in quietly, taking seats at the very edge of their class section.

The School of Foreign Languages always had more female students. Out of thirty classmates, only six were male. When Daniel escorted Emily to her seat, curious glances immediately followed.

As a well-known radio host, Daniel naturally stood out with his refined demeanor. Today, his tailored shirt and dress pants only accentuated his elegance. Soon, whispers spread as some students recognized him.

Emily appeared focused on the stage, but her mind was filled with thoughts of William Johnson. She remained oblivious to the murmurs and stares around her.

It wasn’t until a classmate nudged her shoulder, reminding her it was time to receive the tassel-turning ritual, that she snapped back to reality.

With Daniel’s support, she walked slowly toward the podium. As she turned to stand in place, her gaze inadvertently swept over the dimly lit back rows of the auditorium—

Her heart skipped a beat at the sight of a familiar figure.

Though she couldn’t make out his face, she was absolutely certain it was William.

Suppressing the surge of emotions, she calmly completed the tassel ceremony. But once back in her seat, she felt an intense gaze burning into her, as if piercing through her.

"Senior, I need to use the restroom," she suddenly stood up.

"I’ll go with you," Daniel immediately offered.

Emily shook her head politely. "It’s just outside. I can manage."

"Let a classmate accompany you," Daniel turned to the girl beside them.

The girl agreed readily. As she helped Emily walk out, she couldn’t resist gossiping. "That handsome guy is your boyfriend, right? He’s so good to you."

"He’s not—"

Before she could finish, a strong arm suddenly wrapped around her waist. The world spun as she was hoisted over a shoulder.

The girl froze in shock. The man who had appeared out of nowhere exuded an overpowering aura—his striking, aristocratic features radiating an almost suffocating dominance.

Amid the jostling, Emily caught the familiar scent of cold cologne and instantly knew who was carrying her.

"William Johnson! Put me down!" She pounded his back.

In seconds, they reached a Rolls-Royce parked at the entrance. Sam swiftly opened the door. William roughly shoved her into the backseat before climbing in after her.

"Drive."

As the partition slowly rose, the car became a sealed space.
###Chapter 103

The midsummer sun scorched the empty campus. The distant cheers from the graduation ceremony in the auditorium only made the tree-lined path feel more desolate.

Emily Smith's left ankle throbbed with excruciating pain. When she was roughly thrown into the backseat of the Rolls-Royce, she curled into a tight ball. Tears welled in her eyes, but she stubbornly refused to let them fall.

"Does it hurt?" William Johnson's voice was ice-cold.

He yanked her wrist with enough force to crush bone. His long fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

His pitch-black eyes churned with a terrifying storm.

"Did I not warn you?" Each word seemed to grind between his teeth. "Stay away from that Daniel Chen."

Emily bit her lip until it bled. The metallic taste spread across her tongue.

"We're just friends," she whispered, barely audible.

"Friends?" William sneered, tightening his grip. "The way he looks at you is anything but friendly."

The air in the car turned suffocating. Emily could hear her own ragged breaths.

"And what about you?" The moment the words escaped, she regretted them.

William's gaze darkened dangerously.

"Me?" He leaned in, his warm breath fanning her face. "Don't forget your place."

The words stabbed straight through her heart.

Emily suddenly laughed. But the tears wouldn't stop.

"Right. I'm just an employee," her voice trembled. "I have no right to question my boss's personal life."

William's expression flickered. He released her and pulled a handkerchief from his suit pocket, roughly wiping her tears away.

"Remember," he said lowly. "Your sister's treatment. Your father's sentence. They all depend on my mercy."

That shattered her completely.

"I was wrong..." Emily clutched his sleeve like a drowning woman grasping at driftwood. "I didn't know he would come... Please..."

Her tears soaked into his cuff. William stared at the damp fabric, his gaze unreadable.

Outside the window, the cicadas' shrill cries grew deafening.

###Chapter 104

William Johnson stared into her tear-filled eyes, his heart constricting violently.

Her lashes trembled as teardrops rolled down, tracing glistening paths on her cheeks.

"Why should I believe you?" His voice was icy, yet his grip loosened involuntarily.

Emily Smith tilted her face up, her vision blurred by tears. "Then what do you want me to do?"

Her voice cracked, shoulders shaking slightly.

"Did you take my words as empty air?" William sneered, frost gathering in his gaze.

Emily shook her head desperately, strands of hair clinging to her damp face. "I didn't—"

"From today onward, you're forbidden from working with Daniel Chen again." His tone brooked no argument.

"No." The refusal slipped out before she could stop it, her nails digging into her palms.

William's eyes darkened dangerously. "Can't bear to let him go?"

His knuckles whitened, the pressure on her chin turning painful.

"I promise..." She choked back a sob. "I'll avoid him from now on, but the recording—"

"Find someone else." He cut her off sharply. "No negotiations."

Emily's tears stopped abruptly, replaced by a spark of fury in her eyes.

"William Johnson, I don't belong to you!" Her voice trembled. "We had an agreement—"

"Fifty thousand dollars for you—was it a bad deal?" His lips curled mockingly.

The words stabbed like a knife through her heart.

Emily laughed, the sound more bitter than any cry. "Right. I'm worthless."

Tears poured down uncontrollably. "Not even worth a thousand!"

She shoved him away violently. "I quit! Go ahead and kill me if you dare!"

William's expression turned thunderous.

"Fine. Very well." Each word was ground out between clenched teeth.

The car's partition shot up with a sharp sound.

"Stop the car!" he roared.

Tires screeched against the pavement.

"Get out." He pointed at the door, veins bulging on the back of his hand.

Emily didn't hesitate. She flung the door open and stumbled out, ignoring the searing pain in her left foot.

The door slammed shut behind her with a deafening crash.

"Drive!" William's furious command echoed through the car.

Sam Wilson stole a glance in the rearview mirror. His boss's face was stormy, the air around him suffocatingly tense.

He pressed the accelerator silently, heart pounding—in all his years working for Mr. Johnson, this was the first time he'd seen him lose his temper over a woman.

The night wind howled as Emily staggered along the roadside.

Every step sent sharp jolts of pain through her ankle.

She wiped her face roughly, only to find more tears spilling over.

Distant headlights swept past, illuminating her disheveled figure.
###Chapter 105

The car drove a hundred meters away. William Johnson glanced up at the rearview mirror, where the slender figure of Emily Smith was reflected. She crouched by the roadside, curled into a small ball, her shoulders trembling uncontrollably.

His knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists.

"Turn around." The words burned in his throat, but he swallowed them down. He leaned back heavily into the seat and closed his eyes.

Passersby cast curious glances her way. An elderly man with silver hair hesitated before finally approaching and gently patting her shoulder.

"Child, even the greatest storms pass," he said kindly. "Keep moving forward. Better days lie ahead."

Emily lifted her tear-streaked face and met the old man's gentle gaze. She smiled then—a smile more heartbreaking than her tears.

"Thank you," she whispered, wiping her cheeks with a shaky hand.

Her phone had been buzzing incessantly in her bag. The fifth missed call flashed "Daniel Chen" on the screen.

"I'm sorry, Daniel," she said, taking a deep breath, her nails digging into her palms. "My boyfriend is picking me up."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"William Johnson?" Daniel's voice turned sharp.

Emily shut her eyes. "He's keeping me." The words tore through her chest like a blade.

She heard his sharp inhale.

"How much do you need? I'll give it to you!" Daniel nearly shouted. "Just leave him, please!"

Tears spilled over again. She bit her lip hard enough to taste blood.

"I'm not worth it." She ended the call and tilted her head back, staring at the overcast sky.

Her ankle throbbed painfully. She dialed Mia Harris' number, her voice feather-light. "Can you come get me?"

The streetlamp stretched her shadow long and lonely across the pavement.
###Chapter 106

Emily's red-rimmed eyes betrayed recent tears, a detail Mia didn't miss.

"What happened?" Mia's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

After a pause, Emily recounted the events.

"Damn it!" Mia slammed the wheel. "Is William out of his mind? Does he think money makes him god? He's just a sugar daddy—who does he think he is?"

"Not a sugar daddy," Emily corrected softly. "A transaction."

"That makes it worse!" Mia gritted her teeth. "I'll lend you the money. Leave him."

The car turned into the hospital parking lot. Emily's swollen ankle was clearly visible.

"It's not just about money," Emily shook her head. "Professor Johnson was arranged by him. If I walk away..."

"Let my brother handle it!" Mia blurted.

The Harris family had struck gold overnight from a拆迁 deal a decade ago. Starting from scratch, her brother had built a company and risen among Jinzhou's elite—though old money still sneered at them as nouveau riche.

"I won't drag you into this," Emily smiled bitterly. "William could crush me with a snap of his fingers."

Mia fell silent. She knew better than anyone—the Harris family was no match for the Johnsons.

"So you'll just take it?" Mia asked, frustration simmering.

"He'll get bored," Emily gazed out the window. "Once he tires of me, he'll let me go."

That harsh "Get out" might have been the beginning.

"At least..." She forced a smile. "This way, he won't take it out on you."

Mia opened her mouth but said nothing.

As the car parked, Emily's phone buzzed.

A message flashed on the screen:
"8 PM. Imperial Hotel, Suite 8808. Don't keep me waiting."
###Chapter 107

The results of Emily Smith's foot examination came back. Fortunately, there was no fracture—just a ligament sprain.

The doctor instructed her not to put weight on her left foot for two weeks and to avoid walking as much as possible.

The hospital prescribed anti-inflammatory medication and topical ointment, along with a pair of crutches for emergencies.

After leaving the hospital, Mia Harris accompanied her to the university dormitory to pack her belongings.

The luggage couldn't be taken to William Johnson's place, so it had to be stored temporarily in the small rented apartment Emily had been living in.

Mia frowned the moment she saw the shabby rental. She insisted Emily find a better place to stay.

As it happened, Mia owned an empty apartment in a nearby upscale neighborhood and insisted Emily move in.

"I can't live there for free," Emily said firmly.

"Fine," Mia said, an idea striking her. "Pay me two thousand in rent each month. You take the master bedroom, and I'll keep the spare for when I visit. Deal?"

Emily finally smiled and nodded. But with her injured foot, moving would have to wait until she recovered.

Since they'd decided on the move, there was no point leaving the luggage in the old apartment.

Mia suggested taking everything back to the Harris residence first and retrieving it when they were ready to move.

Emily agreed, and the two returned to the Harris home together.

As longtime friends, Emily had visited the Harris household often.

Mia's parents had always liked the well-mannered young woman, and after learning about her family's hardships, they'd grown even more fond of her.

Seeing her again after over a year, they were delighted and asked the kitchen to prepare several of her favorite dishes.

Dinner ended close to nine. Mia wanted Emily to stay the night, but Emily insisted on returning to Jinzhou Bay No. 1.

She needed to speak with William face-to-face.

"At least let the driver take you," Mia relented, unable to change her mind.

The black sedan pulled up slowly at the gates of Jinzhou Bay No. 1.

Emily thanked the driver and stepped out, leaning on her crutches as she approached the security checkpoint.

When she tried facial recognition, the system displayed: "Identity not found."

She adjusted her angle and tried again—still no success.

A new security guard approached. "Miss, which resident are you here to see?"

"I live in Unit 6701, but the system won't recognize me," she said, frowning in confusion.

Just then, another resident passed by. Their face was instantly scanned and approved.

The guard's expression turned wary. "Please have the resident contact the concierge to escort you in. Otherwise, you'll need to leave."

Emily stepped aside and dialed the number for the concierge, Song Yan.

The call rang for a long time before being answered. The voice on the other end was cold. "What is it, Miss Smith?"

"Ms. Song, I can't get through the gate with facial recognition. Could you come and let me in?"

A soft laugh came through the line. "Mr. Johnson has already revoked your access privileges. Didn't he tell you?"

Emily's fingers tightened around the phone.
###Chapter 108

The dial tone in her phone felt like a blunt knife, slowly sawing at Emily Smith's nerves.

Her fingers tightened around the device, knuckles turning white.

William Johnson had hung up on her.

The realization sent a chill through her bones.

The July night was stifling, yet an icy numbness crept up from her feet.

What about her sister's treatment?

Would her father's situation in prison worsen?

Though he had never shown such ruthlessness before—

Did she truly know him at all?

Emily took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm.

Leaning on her crutch, she shuffled to the curb and dialed the familiar number again.

Once. Twice. Three times.

No one answered.

Just as she hesitated whether to keep trying, a black Rolls-Royce glided past her.

The tinted windows hid the occupant, but she could swear she felt a sharp gaze land on her.

The car disappeared into the underground garage without stopping.

Emily bit her lip and opened WeChat.

"William, I'm sorry." Her voice trembled slightly. "I promise I won't make the same mistake again."

As she sent the second voice message, her nails dug into her palms.

"Please... give me one more chance."

After sending them, she slumped onto the steps like a puppet with its strings cut.

The night breeze brushed her hair, carrying the oppressive heat of summer.

Upstairs in the penthouse, William loosened his tie and tossed his phone onto the couch.

The sound of running water in the shower did nothing to ease the restlessness in his chest.

When he stepped out, his hand instinctively reached for his phone.

Only two unread voice messages still sat on the screen.

He stared at the red notification dot for a long moment before looking away.

The video conference dragged on late into the night.

William barely listened to the reports, his gaze repeatedly flicking to his silent phone.

After the meeting ended, he finally tapped on the messages.

The girl's soft voice filled the quiet room, too clear, too intimate.

His throat moved, and heat stirred low in his body.

Then—

A third message suddenly appeared.

His finger tapped it almost reflexively.

"I'm waiting downstairs."

Five simple words that made his breath catch.
###Chapter 109

William Johnson's breath hitched.

The phone screen lit up again as the fourth voice message popped up.
"Let me come up tonight, please? I promise I'll behave..."

That soft, nasal voice brushed against his eardrums like feathers. His Adam's apple bobbed as he abruptly flipped the phone face down on the desk.

"Damn it." He cursed under his breath and grabbed the landline to dial the butler's extension.

Emily Smith answered immediately. "Mr. Johnson?"

"Bring Emily up here." His voice was hoarse. "Now."

"But she—"

"Do I need to repeat myself?" The sharp tapping of his fingers against the desk intensified.

Silence fell on the other end.

Outside the mansion, Emily sat hugging her knees on the stone steps. Night wind swirled fallen leaves past her feet as she stared at her phone screen flickering between light and dark.

The elevator's chime startled her.

A woman in stilettos emerged, her perfectly made-up face twisted in displeasure. "Follow me."

Emily's eyes brightened. She nearly tripped when pushing up with her crutch. The woman was already three meters ahead without a backward glance.

Their reflections appeared in the elevator mirror. The woman suddenly sneered. "Playing the victim card again? How predictable."

"Thanks for the compliment." Emily adjusted her bangs in the mirror.

Sensor lights flickered on with each step down the 67th-floor hallway. As the woman raised her hand to ring the doorbell, a beep sounded from behind them.

Emily's fingerprint still worked.

"Goodnight." She winked at the frozen woman before hopping one-footed into the foyer.

The heavy oak door clicked shut behind her. Emily leaned against it, taking a deep breath. The blinding lights revealed an air scented with cedar and red wine.

William lounged on the sofa, his robe loosely tied to expose a bronzed chest. Crystal-cut wineglass dangled from his fingers, refracting prismatic dots across the room.

"Come here." He commanded without looking up.

Emily swallowed hard. The crutch's rhythmic taps echoed on marble as she limped forward, her injured ankle throbbing.

William finally lifted his gaze.

His eyes raked over her like barbed wire—from red-rimmed eyes to trembling fingertips. The glass met the coffee table with a sharp clink.

"Explain." He yanked open his robe belt.
###Chapter 110

Emily Smith's left ankle was wrapped in bandages, but that didn't hinder her from nimbly moving toward William Johnson. She tossed her crutches aside and climbed onto him with the grace of a cat.

"William..." She pressed close to his lips.

The man turned his head away, his eyes icy.

"Daniel is really just a friend." Her fingers traced circles on his chest, her voice soft and sweet. "You're different."

William finally looked at her, the corner of his mouth curling into a dangerous smirk. "Oh? How am I different?"

Emily bit her lower lip. This time, she knew better than to mention their transactional relationship. "You were the first to touch me." Her lashes fluttered. "No one compares to you."

"Because of money?" He scoffed.

"Not just that." She shook her head, her fingertips brushing his tense jawline. "You're handsome, fit, and... skilled."

William suddenly gripped her chin. "Then why were you cozying up to someone else?"

Emily immediately raised three fingers. "I swear, if I ever touch Daniel again, I'll disappear from your life forever—"

"So I'll remember you for the rest of my life?" He sneered. "Clever."

"Then I'll change it!" Her eyes reddened with urgency. "If I ever—"

Before she could finish, William crushed his lips against hers. All her unspoken vows dissolved into muffled whimpers, swallowed by his kiss.

......

It ended sooner than expected.

Emily stared blankly at the man above her, catching a fleeting glimpse of something vulnerable in his eyes. But it vanished instantly, replaced by his usual unapproachable demeanor.

The next moment, the world spun as she was pinned into the couch. His scorching kisses trailed down her neck, lingering at her collarbone.

"Don't..." She trembled, pushing at him. "I'm... dirty."

William lifted his head, his gaze dark and intense. "If I don't care, why are you being coy?"

"I sweated a lot today..." Her voice shook.

Suddenly, he cupped the back of her head, silencing her gasp with his mouth. "Let me taste," he growled, "what you really taste like."

As the salty bitterness spread across her tongue, inspiration struck Emily. "Might still have Daniel's scent on me..."

Before she could finish, William's expression darkened. He scooped her up and strode toward the bathroom.
###Chapter 111
Steam curled through the bathroom, blurring the reflection on the glass door. Emily Smith was pressed against the cold tiles, warm water cascading over their entwined bodies.

William Johnson's fingertips traced circles on her waist, sending shivers down her spine. She tilted her head back, water droplets sliding down her hair and pooling in the hollow of her collarbone.

"Don't..." Her voice trembled as her nails left faint red marks on his back.

He chuckled lowly, kissing the moisture from her lashes. "Be good. Just a little longer."

Two hours later, Emily slumped weakly against William's chest. He carried her out of the bathroom, droplets from their hair darkening the carpet beneath them.

By the floor-to-ceiling window, William picked up the hairdryer. Warm air ruffled her strands as his fingers combed through her thick hair, gentle as if handling something precious.

Emily drifted in and out of drowsiness. The faint scent of shampoo lingered as her hair brushed against her neck. Even drying her hair felt like sweet torment.

Suddenly, the world spun. Her back met the chilled glass as city lights blurred into streaks of color behind her.

"William..." Her voice cracked, fingers clutching his collar.

He nipped at her earlobe, breath scorching. "Say it properly."

Their silhouettes merged against the glass. Emily bit her lip, gasping the title between ragged breaths.

The night stretched on.

When William finally laid her on the bed, she couldn't even lift a finger. Yet he remained annoyingly energetic, even massaging her ankles with idle care.

The sharp scent of medicated oil filled the room. Half-asleep, she felt soft lips graze her forehead.

"Rest," he murmured.

Emily nuzzled closer to his warmth, sinking into dreams. Moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting lace-like shadows on her lashes.
###Chapter 112 

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains as Emily Smith awoke from her slumber.

She blinked sleepily, realizing it was already nine o'clock.

The familiar bedroom carried the faint scent of cedarwood—William Johnson's signature cologne. She inhaled deeply, feeling the tension in her nerves finally ease.

But when she turned and saw William's peaceful sleeping face beside her, her heart clenched violently again.

Last night's passionate entanglement remained vivid in her mind. William had taken her to the heights of pleasure with near-ferocious intensity. Yet the more overwhelming it was, the more uncertain she felt.

She wasn't sure if the storm between them had truly passed.

Holding her breath, Emily slipped out of bed as quietly as possible.

Only after closing the master bedroom door did she realize her left foot barely hurt anymore. Looking down, she saw the ankle that had been swollen like a bun yesterday had mostly subsided.

Testing her weight on it, she found she could walk—albeit unsteadily. Remembering the doctor's orders, she leaned against the wall and hopped to the living room on one foot.

Her crutches rested by the sofa. Grabbing them, she made her way to the guest bathroom to freshen up.

After two months of tiresome hotel meals, she'd bought groceries to cook for herself. Even unfamiliar recipes turned out decent after watching a tutorial.

In the master bedroom, William had woken the moment Emily left.

He rarely lingered in bed, but today he did—until the call came from the Swiss sanatorium.

"Mr. Johnson, your uncle's cancer cells show signs of spreading..."

William's grip on the phone tightened. His uncle Henry Johnson, forty-two, had been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer six months ago. The man who'd raised him as his own son.

After hanging up, William took an ice-cold shower.

As he stepped out drying his hair, an enticing aroma greeted him.

The sweetness of pumpkin mingled with the savory crispness of pan-fried dumplings, making his furrowed brow relax involuntarily.

In the kitchen, Emily moved with effortless grace. Dressed in a simple white cotton dress with her hair loosely pinned up, she rolled dumpling wrappers at the island. In moments, she'd shaped a perfect shrimp dumpling.

The pan sizzled with golden dumplings while pumpkin porridge bubbled on the stove.

William leaned against the doorway watching her for a long while. Only when Emily turned to stir the porridge did he approach.

"Almost ready," Emily smiled over her shoulder, eyes crinkling like crescent moons.

William poured himself water, his tone laced with amusement. "Trying to butter me up?"

"Yes." She admitted without hesitation, never pausing her work.

A low chuckle escaped him, the shadows in his eyes vanishing completely.
###Chapter 113

"I thought you said your cooking was terrible." William Johnson leaned against the kitchen island, his long fingers tapping lightly on the marble countertop.

Emily Smith continued stirring the pumpkin and millet porridge without turning around. "I took a cooking class recently."

The coffee machine hummed softly. Her movements were fluid and practiced. She had secretly practiced latte art over a hundred times for this moment, her wrists aching from the effort.

William's gaze lingered on her slender silhouette. Morning light streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a soft glow around her. Something in his chest fluttered faintly.

"Five more minutes," she said, turning with a tray in hand, her hair swaying gently with the motion.

On the dining table, golden pumpkin porridge steamed, and the pan-fried shrimp dumplings had a perfect crispy bottom. The coffee cup bore an intricate heart-shaped design.

William took a sip of the coffee first. The temperature was just right, the bitterness balanced. He raised a brow at her expectant expression before tasting a spoonful of the porridge.

The sweetness of pumpkin bloomed on his tongue.

"How is it?" Emily propped her chin on her hands, her eyes sparkling.

He picked up a shrimp dumpling, biting into it as juices burst forth. "You've clearly practiced a lot."

"Grandma loves my cooking." She lowered her head to stir her bowl, her lashes casting delicate shadows. "She always eats half a bowl more when I cook."

William ate five dumplings in a row. As he reached for the sixth, he spoke abruptly. "I'm going to Switzerland."

The spoon clinked against the bowl. Emily's head snapped up, her lips parting slightly.

"Uncle's condition has worsened." His voice was quiet, almost as if speaking to himself. "The doctors say... he might not make it through winter."

Her fingers twisted together unconsciously. She hadn't expected him to confide in her. The BestTech chairman's health was top-secret, unknown even to most executives.

"He'll pull through," she murmured, reaching to cover his hand with hers.

William turned his hand to grip hers, his hold tight enough to make her wince. Silence stretched between them.

"There's something..." She hesitated. "Could I finish recording this audiobook with Daniel? Just one more week."

His fingers tightened abruptly.

"I can find you a new partner." He released her hand, his tone cooling. "Someone more professional."

"But—"

"No buts." William stood, his shadow falling over her. "This isn't up for discussion."

Emily looked up at him, her eyes glistening. She opened her mouth but said nothing in the end.
###Chapter 114

"William Johnson, I'm discussing this with you out of respect." Emily Smith bit her lower lip, her fingertips lightly tapping his chest. "Otherwise, I could've just recorded with Daniel Chen without telling you. You wouldn't have known since you're abroad."

William chewed his shrimp dumpling slowly, the corner of his lips curling into a meaningful smirk. He remained silent.

"Just one week." She held up a slender finger, her eyes shimmering with a hint of coquetry. "I promise it'll be the last time."

He set down his chopsticks, his long fingers tapping the table. "Do I seem that easy to persuade?"

Emily bit her lip, then suddenly climbed onto his lap. Her soft body pressed against him as her fingers traced circles on the back of his neck. "If you agree, I'll do whatever you say."

She always knew how to ignite his desire.

William's Adam's apple bobbed, his voice already husky. "You'd go this far for Daniel Chen?"

"It's not because of him." She leaned close to his ear, her warm breath brushing his skin. "I just want to give the listeners a perfect ending. I'd beg you the same way if it were someone else."

He chuckled darkly, his large hand gripping her waist. "Tell me, what can you do for me?"

"Make you breakfast every day?" she ventured.

"That's it?" He raised a brow.

"What do you want, then?" She tilted her face up to look at him.

William pinched her chin, his voice low. "Whenever and wherever I want you, no refusals."

Her lashes fluttered before she finally nodded.

......

Sunlight filtered through the curtains on the weekend.

William had indulged himself more than usual, leaving Emily feeling like her body had been taken apart. He'd been relentless, as if deliberately punishing her.

Afterward, she lay limp in his arms, too exhausted to even lift a finger.

"Uncomfortable?" He brushed aside the damp strands of hair at her temple.

She shook her head slightly, then suddenly opened her eyes. "William, do you think this could lead to... a pregnancy?"

He hadn't used protection last night.

He paused, then chuckled. "If you get pregnant, we'll have the baby. I can afford it."

Emily blinked but said nothing.

He scooped her up and carried her toward the bathroom. "I'm flying to London this afternoon. Behave. And use the card I gave you, or else..."

"Or else what?" she murmured weakly.

"Or I'll assume you're saving opportunities for someone else." His eyes narrowed.

She tightened her arms around his neck, smiling innocently. "You're all I need."

"Won't you miss anyone else while I'm gone for a month?"

"Only when I'm not missing you." She rested her head on his shoulder. "When I do miss you, it's all you."

His lips curved in satisfaction. "You like me that much?"

She nodded, her cheeks flushing.

"What else do you miss about me?" he pressed.

"Everything." She didn't hesitate. "All of you."

William laughed softly as he stepped into the steam-filled bathroom. The mist quickly blurred their figures, leaving only the sound of their mingled breaths echoing in the space.
###Chapter 115

William lifted Emily onto the bathroom counter, gently pinching her flushed cheek with his fingertips. "Don't overthink things while I'm gone."

Emily bit her lip, gathering courage before asking, "Do you really think I can help it?"

He paused while filling a glass with water, glancing up at her. "Hmm?"

"Between us..." She met his gaze steadily. "It's always been about money. I'm afraid one day you'll suddenly decide you don't need me anymore."

William frowned slightly.

He had assumed she didn't care about him at all. After all, she hadn't even sent a single message during their two weeks apart.

"Afraid I'll dump you?" His eyes locked onto hers.

Emily nodded.

He suddenly laughed.

He'd almost mocked her, wondering if she was more worried about losing his money—but then he remembered. Aside from the initial 500,000, she'd never touched a cent of his money. She'd built her own career in voice acting, standing firmly on her own feet. She didn't need to rely on him anymore.

"Want to be my girlfriend?" The words slipped out before he could stop them.

Emily froze, then quickly shook her head.

He gripped her chin. "You should want to. It'd be weird if you didn't." Handing her the glass, he added, "I'll give you an answer when I get back from Switzerland."

......

At 2 p.m., the moment the apartment door closed behind him, his words echoed in her ears again.

What was there to consider? Was it about whether they'd continue this arrangement—or about something more?

She'd been too stunned to ask at the time. Now, she worried she might be reading too much into it.

She glanced down at his shirt, still draped over her body. Their last encounter before his departure had been intense. He'd left in high spirits, even kissing her forehead with a murmured, "Be good. Wait for me."

In the walk-in closet, she slipped off the shirt and stood before the mirror. Her skin still carried a faint, telltale flush, certain marks standing out vividly. She couldn't deny it—William's skills had grown more refined, nearly driving her to lose control earlier.

Her fingertips traced the mirror's surface. The curves reflected back seemed more alluring than before. Perhaps that's why he keeps coming back. But beauty fades. Novelty wears thin. Eventually, they would part ways.

She slapped her cheeks lightly, shaking off the thought, then changed into her usual clothes and headed to the hospital. Her sister's EEG showed promising improvements. Professor Johnson said if treatment continued, she could wake up any day now.

Provided, of course, the specialist remained on her case. And that meant... for now, she still needed William's support.

###Chapter 116

The evening had fallen by the time Emily returned from the hospital to the recording studio at Jinzhou Bay No.1.

She put on her headphones and connected with Daniel Chen to continue their audiobook recording.

"Daniel, let's pick up where we left off," she said softly.

Her voice echoed alone in the empty studio.

Daniel's gentle tone remained unchanged as always. "Alright, I'm ready."

Their seamless collaboration lasted four straight hours.

It was past eleven when Emily finally rubbed her stiff neck. "Let's call it a night."

"Emily," Daniel suddenly called out before she could remove her headphones. "The editor approached me about something today."

Her fingers froze mid-air.

"The website wants us to change partners after finishing this book," Daniel's voice carried hesitation through the headphones.

Emily's heart sank.

She tightened her grip on the headphone cord. "I'm sorry, Daniel."

Silence lingered for several seconds.

"William's doing?" Daniel asked quietly.

Emily bit her lower lip. "Yes. He... doesn't like me getting too close with other men."

A nearly imperceptible sigh traveled through the headphones.

"Emily, are you happy?" Daniel's unexpected question hung in the air.

She answered without hesitation. "I am."

Her voice held steady conviction. "He treats me well, just a bit possessive sometimes."

"That's good then." Relief colored Daniel's words. "As long as you're happy."

After ending the call, Emily remained seated in the studio for a long time.

Moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting dappled shadows across the floor.

She remembered her first recording session with Daniel - how her voice had trembled with nervousness as a newcomer.

He had patiently guided her through countless retakes, teaching her techniques.

And now...

Emily took a deep breath and picked up her phone.

Her fingertip hovered over William's messaging app before she pressed the voice note button.

"William, I miss you."

Her whisper carried crystalline clarity in the quiet room.

After sending it, she pressed the phone against her chest as if trying to feel his heartbeat through the device.
###Chapter 117

Emily Smith sent the voice message and waited briefly for a reply before drifting into a deep sleep.

Morning sunlight filtered through the gaps in the curtains.

She reached for her phone on the bedside table.

The screen lit up, revealing a message from 2 AM: "Where do you miss me?"

Three simple words made her fingers tremble slightly.

Unwanted images flooded her mind, heating the tips of her ears.

"In my heart... and everywhere else."

She pressed the voice button, her tone softer than usual. Since becoming a voice actress, she knew exactly how lethal her voice could be to men.

It must be late night in Switzerland.

She didn’t expect an immediate response.

Ding—

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

"Then wait obediently for me to return."

The simple text curled her lips upward. She even put her slippers on the wrong feet.

In the kitchen, eggs sizzled in the pan.

Ding-dong—

The doorbell rang abruptly.

Drying her hands, she peered through the peephole—and froze.

Alexander Johnson stood outside, dressed casually yet exuding effortless elegance.

"Good morning, Mr. Johnson." She opened the door just a crack. "William is away on business."

"That brat didn’t even tell me." Alexander chuckled, stepping inside. His polished shoes left marks on the pristine floor. "Did he mention when he’d be back?"

"No." She retreated half a step.

Alexander scanned the room before his gaze settled on her flushed earlobes. "Seems my brother doesn’t value you much."

The dim glow of a Swiss sanatorium cast shadows across the bed.

William Johnson stared at the frail figure lying there, his thumb tracing the edge of his phone.

The screen suddenly brightened.

Security footage showed Alexander standing outside the apartment door.

William’s eyes turned icy.

When Alexander barged into the living room, a faint click sounded from the phone in his grip.

Some lines should never be crossed.
###Chapter 118

William Johnson stood in the center of the apartment, his intense gaze fixed on Emily Smith.

When she remained silent, he suddenly stepped forward, closing the distance between them in an instant.

His long fingers lifted, about to brush against her cheek.

Emily jerked back, panic flashing in her eyes. She forced herself to sound composed. "Mr. Johnson, should I check when William will be back?"

Before he could respond, she hurried toward the coffee table, reaching for her phone to call for help.

It finally dawned on her—he hadn’t come here for William at all.

Her fingers barely grazed the phone before his larger hand snatched it away. He tossed it onto the sofa, his lips curling into an amused smirk. "Scared of me?"

Emily took a deep breath. "You misunderstand. I just don’t want to waste your time."

"Interesting." His eyes narrowed. "No wonder William likes you."

His gaze roamed freely over her—from the delicate curve of her collarbone to the slender dip of her waist, finally lingering on her slightly trembling lips.

Emily forced a smile. "William treats me well."

"He treats you well?" He suddenly gripped her chin. "I could treat you better."

The heat of his touch made her stiffen. Her voice wavered. "Mr. Johnson, my feelings for William are genuine."

"Genuine?" He scoffed. "He’s just playing with you."

His grip tightened. She swallowed hard. "Maybe you should ask William first—"

"Little liar." He cut her off. "Do you really think I don’t see through your stalling?"

His thumb brushed lightly over her lower lip. "A woman William has slept with... I find that even more intriguing."

Her eyes reddened. "Please let me go..."

"What’s there to fear?" He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "I’ll be gentle."

The heat of his whisper made her shove him away. "William will be furious!"

"You still don’t understand." He pinned her against the kitchen counter. "Let me show you just how much he cares about you."

Emily struggled desperately. "Stop!"

Ding-dong.

The doorbell rang sharply.

William Johnson froze.
###Chapter 119

Emily Smith shoved Alexander Johnson away and stumbled toward the foyer.

Her nails left red marks on his arm.

The door swung open just as Olivia Davis raised her hand to ring the bell.

"Olivia!" Emily's voice trembled with unshed tears.

Olivia's gaze darted past her shoulder, finding only an empty living room.

"Someone's waiting for me downstairs." Emily rushed out before getting a response.

Her slippers slapped against the floor in a frantic rhythm.

Only when the elevator doors closed did Emily dare to breathe.

"What happened?" Olivia studied her red-rimmed eyes.

"Can I borrow your phone?" Emily's fingers shook.

When Olivia dialed, William Johnson's voice sliced through like a blade: "Put her on."

As the receiver pressed against her ear, Emily's tears splashed onto the screen.

"William..." She bit her quivering lip.

Down the nursing home corridor, William's fist collided with the wall.

"He's at the apartment?" His voice dropped dangerously low.

The sound of shattering glass carried through the phone.

Olivia's office door had just clicked shut when the phone rang again.

"He's gone." William's breathing was uneven. "I changed the door code."

Emily clutched her shirt hem. "When are you coming back?"

Silence stretched for several heartbeats.

"Emily Smith." He suddenly used her full name.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, twilight swallowed the last sliver of sunlight.

"Don't let another man into our home."

The dial tone pierced the office like a needle.

Olivia noticed the sudden flush creeping up Emily's ears.
###Chapter 120

Alexander Johnson vanished completely from Emily Smith's life after that day.

She moved between the company, the hospital, and her apartment at Jinzhou Bay No.1. Recording audiobooks became her only moment of relaxation. Every other day, she texted William Johnson, and he always replied instantly.

A week later, the office erupted in chaos.

Henry Johnson's email detonated like a bomb within BestTech Group. It announced his immediate resignation as CEO, though he would remain Chairman of the Board. William Johnson would take over as the new CEO.

Whispers filled the break room.

"The Chairman is barely in his forties."
"BestTech is his life's work."
"Rumor has it Vice President Johnson has been running things for months."

Emily clutched her coffee cup, fingers turning cold. She understood better than anyone what this sudden change meant.

Henry's condition must be far worse than imagined.

Her phone lit up with a WeChat message from William: "Saw the email?"

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Yes," she typed hesitantly. "How is the Chairman...really?"

The typing indicator flickered, then stopped. Finally, a reply came: "Define 'okay.'"

Those five words stabbed through her chest.

She could almost see William standing alone in the Swiss snow, his silhouette desolate.

"If he's in good spirits, then he's okay," she sent before flipping her phone face down.

On her way home, her editor Yinyin messaged her with profiles of several top male voice actors.

"Potential new co-hosts for you," Yinyin wrote. "Take your pick."

Emily stared at the familiar names—each a star in the industry. She smiled bitterly. William's doing again, no doubt.

Neon lights flashed outside the car window. She suddenly felt like an insect trapped in amber—pampered yet paralyzed.
###Chapter 121

Emily Smith finally chose the most experienced veteran anchor from the list sent by Yinyin.

Yinyin quickly forwarded a booklist for her to select a trial recording. Emily immediately spotted that familiar fantasy novel—a classic she had once adored.

[All set. The male anchor will add you on WeChat. You two can get acquainted first. Let me know when you're ready for the trial recording.] Yinyin's message brimmed with enthusiasm. [Sweetie, take care of your voice. Reach out anytime~]

Emily replied with a cute sticker. [Thanks, Yinyin! I’ll do my best!]

After her usual hospital visit to see her sister, Emily returned to Jinzhou Bay and began studying the new book. Before bed, she hesitated but finally sent William Johnson a message: [The new partner is very professional. Thank you for arranging it.]

The message sank like a stone. By dawn the next day, there was still no reply.

Watching the sky brighten outside her window, Emily figured he must be swamped—newly appointed as the group president while also tending to his hospitalized uncle.

In the days that followed, she deliberately avoided disturbing him. And William, as if vanished from the face of the earth, remained silent.

The 18th marked Alexander Johnson and Sophia Song’s engagement. Starting from the 16th, major media outlets flooded with coverage of this high-society union.

Scrolling through the news, Emily’s finger paused briefly over William’s name. As the groom’s younger brother, he’d surely attend the engagement party, wouldn’t he?

The thought inexplicably lifted her spirits.

On Saturday, Emily and Mia Harris took a driver to Xiawei Village to move her things. Since she hadn’t lived long in that rented farmhouse, packing was quick.

When the landlord insisted on deducting a month’s deposit, Emily agreed without protest. As the car entered Splendid Garden, she realized it was just two subway stops from Jinzhou Bay.

Standing on Mia’s balcony, the outline of Jinzhou Bay No. 1 was clearly visible. Squinting toward the top floor, she could almost make out that familiar terrace.

"What’s on your mind?" Mia asked, drying her hands as she approached.

Emily looked away. "Just wondering if I should buy a telescope."

As they laughed, her phone suddenly rang. The name "Daniel Chen" on the screen made her breath hitch.

They hadn’t spoken since their last collaboration ended a week ago. Yinyin mentioned the website had assigned Daniel a new partner, but he seemed ready to quit voice acting altogether.

Emily clenched her phone. She should’ve apologized sooner, but any words now felt hollow. Having chosen to comply with William’s wishes, what right did she have to beg for forgiveness?

The ringing persisted, relentless as a blunt knife sawing at her conscience.
###Chapter 122

"Daniel." Emily Smith swiped to answer the call, her voice soft.

"Emily, are you busy?" Daniel Chen's warm voice came through the receiver.

Her fingers absently traced the edge of the desk. "I happen to be free today."

"Are you available at eight tonight?" He paused. "The fans have been asking for a livestream."

"Livestream?" Her breath hitched slightly.

"The new audiobook surpassed 500 million plays. Everyone wants to hear us chat about it." Daniel chuckled. "We don't have to meet in person—just connect from our own homes."

Emily bit her lower lip. She'd seen the comments, but she was worried about William Johnson's reaction.

"Daniel..." she hesitated before asking, "Are you really leaving the voice-acting industry?"

Silence stretched for a few seconds.

"You can stand on your own now." His voice carried quiet acceptance. "You don't need me to guide you anymore."

Her eyes suddenly burned.

"I'm sorry..." She took a deep breath. "Eight o'clock. I'll be waiting for your call."

As she hung up, Mia Harris's fork was already pointed at her nose.

"Spill it!" Mia narrowed her eyes. "Who is this senior that made your eyes turn red?"

Emily sighed and explained everything about Daniel.

"Tsk, what a waste to let a man like that slip away." Mia shook her head dramatically. "If it were me—"

"Eat your food!" Emily stuffed a rib into Mia's mouth. "Do you still want your Monday work gift or not?"

......

7:50 PM, Sky City Apartments.

Emily adjusted her equipment as a notification chimed in her ear. Daniel sent the livestream link.

At exactly eight, the moment the stream went live, comments flooded in like a tidal wave.

[Finally! We've been waiting for you!]
[I've listened to the new book ten times—it's not enough!]
[Let the gifts roll in!]

"Good evening, everyone." Emily's voice was sweet and clear. "This is Emily."

"And this is Daniel." His smooth voice overlapped with hers.

The viewer count skyrocketed, and gift animations exploded across the screen. They took turns answering questions, sometimes finishing each other's sentences, other times playfully teasing one another. The audience soon surpassed 100,000.

"Next up is the fan mail segment," Daniel said with a smile.

Emily was about to respond when the sound of a key turning in the front door lock cut through the air.

Her breath caught as she turned toward the entrance.
###Chapter 123

William Johnson pushed open the door. The motion-activated hallway light flickered on.

As he bent to remove his shoes, a crystalline laugh rang out from the side bedroom.

The laughter was bright and melodious, like wind chimes dancing in a spring breeze.

He froze mid-motion, then moved toward the sound as if drawn by an invisible force.

The door stood slightly ajar. Emily Smith's voice carried clearly: "Mr. Cold is definitely my ideal type, but no one that perfect exists in real life."

William halted at the threshold.

"My type?" She seemed to be pondering. "Looks don't matter much, but they should have a good physique, gentle personality, and ambition..."

The glow from her computer screen illuminated her delicate features.

Fan comments flooded the screen as she laughed, her eyes crinkling. "Mountain River? No, he's just my senior."

William's expression darkened.

[You two look perfect together!]
[That boat scene was fire!]
[Just admit it already!]

The comments grew increasingly suggestive. William's face turned stormy.

"We're really just—" Emily began to explain when strong hands yanked her up.

Her headphones clattered to the floor as she gasped, tumbling onto the bed.

A familiar masculine scent enveloped her. William pinned her beneath him.

"Since they're so eager to hear," his voice dropped to a dangerous murmur, "why not give them a live show?"

Emily's eyes widened in panic. She shook her head frantically.

With a cold smirk, he captured her lips in a punishing kiss devoid of tenderness.

On the computer screen, comments continued to pour in—unanswered and unnoticed.
###Chapter 124

"Ah—"

Emily Smith trembled in pain, barely suppressing a cry. She bit her lower lip hard, forcing the whimper back down her throat.

"Go on, scream," William Johnson sneered, gripping her chin. "Let your fans hear what you sound like right now."

He yanked her collar open and bit down again.

"Ah!"

A sharp cry finally escaped Emily's lips.

The live stream exploded. Comments flooded the screen as everyone heard the strange noise.

Daniel Chen's face paled, and he hastily ended the broadcast.

Emily stared at the darkened screen, her tense body relaxing slightly. But William's torment continued. She turned her face away stubbornly, tears soaking the pillow.

His movements grew rougher, as if determined to break her apart. Emily's lips bled, the metallic taste filling her mouth, but she refused to make another sound.

Finally, William stopped. He gazed down at the tear-streaked woman beneath him and leaned in for a kiss.

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

The air froze.

William touched his stinging cheek and suddenly laughed. The sound sent a chill down Emily's spine.

He stood, calmly adjusting his shirt cuffs, and walked out without a backward glance.

"William!" Emily called after him.

The only response was the slam of the door.

The room was eerily silent. Emily stared blankly at her right hand, still tingling from the slap.

Her phone buzzed violently on the table.

Daniel.

She ignored it, dragging her aching body to the bathroom. As hot water cascaded over her skin, she finally let the sobs break free.

Should she apologize?

But he was the one in the wrong.

Yet... he was William.

Trembling fingers dialed the familiar number.
###Chapter 125

Emily's fingers slid across the screen repeatedly, each call automatically ending before connecting.

The cold robotic voice echoed in her ears: "Sorry, the number you dialed is currently unavailable..."

Her hands trembled as she opened WeChat, recording and deleting voice messages over and over.

"William, I..."

The words caught in her throat. Tears splashed onto the screen, blurring her vision.

She threw her phone aside and curled into a corner of the bathtub. The once-warm water had turned icy, the chill seeping into her bones.

At 2 AM, she finally dragged herself out. The mirror reflected her swollen eyes—a pitiful, abandoned woman.

Her phone screen flickered on and off, but no message from him appeared.

Dawn approached before exhaustion pulled her into a fitful sleep.

Ding—

A WeChat notification jolted her awake. The photo Mia sent made her blood run cold.

William stood in a tailored black suit, a woman in a matching gown clinging to his arm.

Is that Amanda Lin? Her fingers shook as she typed.

Yeah. The Lin heiress is back. Mia replied instantly. They look good together, don't they?

Emily stared at the image, her heart squeezed by an invisible fist.

So that was it.

No wonder he'd left without hesitation last night. No wonder he couldn't even spare her an explanation.

A hollow laugh escaped her, tears streaming down her face.

How pathetic—she'd actually been planning how to apologize.

The bathroom mirror showed her pale reflection. She wiped away the condensation, studying herself.

"Time to wake up," she whispered.

Her phone buzzed again. Mia's new message appeared: Want to come to the engagement party? My brother can get you in.

Emily stared at the words for a long moment before replying: No.

She set the phone down and began packing. Slow. Methodical. Unwavering.

William's shirt still hung in her closet. She took it down, smoothing the wrinkles before placing it in a storage bag.

The mug from their first date sat on the nightstand. She wrapped it carefully and tucked it into a box.

Halfway through, the doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, she saw a familiar face.

Amanda Lin.

###Chapter 126

Emily's fingers turned white as she clutched the blanket. She took a deep breath and threw it off abruptly.

The moment her feet touched the floor, the room spun violently.

She gripped the edge of the bed, waiting for the dizziness to pass before she could stand steadily.

The bathroom mirror reflected a ghostly pale face. She brushed her teeth and washed her face mechanically, unaware of the water droplets dripping from her chin.

The antiseptic smell of the hospital sharpened her senses slightly. By her sister's bed, she forced a smile and talked for a long time.

The subway rattled like a cradle on her way back. When she woke again, the train had reached the terminal station.

By the time she returned to Jinzhou Bay No. 1, the city lights had already lit up the night.

She stood in the walk-in closet, her suitcase open on the floor. Her fingers traced the clothes—each one still carried William's scent.

Her phone spun three times in her palm.

"Beep—"

"Hello?" A bright female voice came through the receiver.

Emily's blood ran cold.

"William, the towel," the woman's coquettish voice mingled with the sound of running water.

The dial tone after the call ended felt like a slap across the face.

In the mirror, her eyes were bloodshot, her lips trembling. The next second, she grabbed her phone and stormed out.

At Mia's apartment, the air conditioner hummed loudly. Emily curled up on the sofa, staring at the ceiling until dawn.

The morning mirror showed a shadow of a ghost. She caked on thick foundation, but it couldn't hide the red veins in her eyes.

The pharmacy near the subway exit was just steps away.

"Ring—"

Michael's voice came through the phone. "The merger contract—Mr. Lu needs it by ten."

Her mind was a fog. She quickened her pace toward the office. At the corner, her legs suddenly gave way, nearly sending her crashing to the ground.

"Emily?" Michael frowned as he approached. "You look terrible."

She instinctively took half a step back, forcing a smile. "Pulled an all-nighter."

The glare from the computer screen burned her eyes. She mechanically revised the contract terms, her temples throbbing.

Michael's reply popped up just as she was resting her forehead in her hand, dozing off.

"Ding—"

The office phone rang sharply.

The caller ID made her whole body freeze: 8808.

The extension number for the Vice President's Office.
###Chapter 127

He had her WeChat.
He had her phone number.
Yet he deliberately called the company landline to reach her.

The message behind this action couldn't be clearer.

Emily Smith felt as if an invisible hand had clenched around her heart, squeezing so hard that her eyes instantly reddened. She bit her lower lip fiercely, forcing herself to pick up the phone. "Vice President Johnson, you wanted to see me?"

"Come upstairs."

His voice was cold as ice, devoid of any warmth. Emily’s tears finally spilled over. She hastily replied with a "Yes" and nearly slammed the receiver down.

She rushed into the restroom, locking herself in a stall. The mirror reflected her red-rimmed eyes—a pitiful sight of defeat. Digging her nails into her palms, she scolded herself for breaking down over something like this.

Hadn’t she seen this ending coming all along?

From the very beginning, what existed between her and William Johnson was nothing more than a transaction with clearly defined terms. Now that it was over, what right did she have to grieve?

Emily splashed cold water on her face until no trace of tears remained. She fixed her expression and headed to the 67th floor.

"Good morning, Emily," Grace Lee greeted with a smile, though her gaze lingered on Emily’s slightly swollen eyelids.

"Good morning, Grace," Emily forced a smile and walked straight toward the heavy office door.

She knocked lightly.

"Come in."

William didn’t even look up. Emily kept her head down, her eyes fixed on the corner of his desk.

The air was suffocatingly still.

"Do you need anything, Vice President Johnson?" she broke the silence first, her voice eerily calm.

William finally lifted his gaze, his dark eyes boring into her like knives, slicing through her fragile composure.

When he remained silent, Emily spoke again. "If there’s nothing else, I’ll return to my work."

She turned to flee the oppressive space.

"Emily Smith."

His voice struck her like a thunderclap, freezing her in place.

"It ends here. Move out of Jinzhou Bay today."

Two simple sentences drained all the strength from her body. Emily clenched her fists so tightly her nails nearly pierced her palms.

"Fine," she heard herself say. "I packed everything last night. I’ll collect my things after work."

She practically bolted, keeping her head down as she rushed toward the elevator. The doors slid open—and she collided with a soft figure.

"Watch your step."

The voice sent a jolt through her. Emily looked up and met the smiling eyes of Amanda Lin.

That flawlessly made-up face radiated the ease of a victor.
###Chapter 128

The elevator doors slid open, and Emily Smith found herself face to face with Amanda Lin’s smiling eyes.

Amanda wore a champagne-colored silk dress that made her skin glow like snow. The diamond bracelet on her wrist scattered tiny reflections of light, sharp enough to sting Emily’s eyes.

Emily instinctively glanced down at her wrinkled blouse and jeans. She had stayed up all night revising a proposal and hadn’t even had time to put on makeup this morning. Standing before the radiant Amanda, she felt like Cinderella crashing a royal ball.

"Are you alright?" Amanda’s voice was soft as water, but her gaze lingered a second too long on Emily’s red-rimmed eyes.

Emily yanked her hand back, nails digging crescent moons into her palm. "Thanks for asking." She practically fled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, Amanda suddenly smiled. "It was nice meeting you, Emily."

The words struck Emily like a thunderbolt. She looked up in horror just as the narrowing gap distorted Amanda’s smile into a grotesque, gaping maw.

Darkness surged like a tide. The last thing Emily heard was the sound of her knees hitting the elevator floor.

"Someone help! She fainted!"

The lobby erupted into chaos. Colleagues waiting for the elevator rushed forward in a panic, one already dialing emergency services.

Michael Thompson was reviewing quarterly reports when his phone buzzed violently. His pen skidded across the paper, leaving an ugly ink trail.

"What? Emily fainted?" He shot to his feet, his chair screeching against the floor.

Lily White barely had time to react before Michael barreled past her, nearly spilling her coffee. "Boss?"

"Emily collapsed in the lobby!" His voice faded as he disappeared down the hall.

On the 67th floor, Grace Lee’s hand trembled as she held the phone. She took a deep breath and knocked on the heavy oak door.

The scene inside stole her breath. William Johnson had Amanda caged in his arms, his long fingers toying idly with her bracelet. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting them like a masterpiece.

Grace started to retreat, but William’s icy voice stopped her. "What is it?"

"Mr. Johnson..." She swallowed hard. "Front desk reports that Emily Smith fainted in the elevator."

Amanda turned, lips parting. "That girl from earlier?" She gently squeezed William’s hand. "Should we go check on her?"

William’s mouth curved faintly. "If you wish."

The private elevator descended to the lobby. When the doors opened, William’s pupils contracted—Michael was already carrying Emily’s unconscious form toward the exit, her pale face slumped against his shoulder.

"Vice President Johnson!" Greetings rippled through the lobby.

Amanda nodded gracefully to the crowd. But William’s gaze remained fixed on the retreating figure until the elevator doors sealed shut again.
###Chapter 129

Michael Thompson and Lily White rushed Emily Smith to the nearest hospital.

The nurse took her temperature—40.3°C. Everyone gasped in shock.

"Quick! Start an IV to bring the fever down!" The doctor swiftly prescribed medication.

The nurse expertly inserted the IV, frowning. "This fever has lasted at least 24 hours. Any later, and the consequences would've been dire."

Lily paled at the words.

After the medical staff left, Lily stared at Emily, unconscious on the hospital bed, her voice trembling. "She's always so careful. How could this happen...?"

Michael's expression was grave. "Go back to the office. I'll handle things here."

"Should we notify her family?" Lily hesitated.

"I'll take care of it." Michael pulled out his phone.

Once Lily left, Michael sat silently by the bed for a long time. He first called his supervisor to request leave, then contacted HR for Emily's emergency contact.

"No record?" Michael frowned.

The HR colleague confirmed, "There's no family information in her file."

Michael asked Lily, but the answer was equally disappointing.

How could a local girl have no family? It made no sense to him. With no way to reach her relatives, he decided to stay by her side.

Meanwhile, at BestTech Group headquarters.

Mia Harris was excitedly completing her onboarding. As the company heiress, she had deliberately hidden her identity to gain experience at the grassroots level.

"Let's have lunch with Emily." She pulled out her phone, but no one answered.

As soon as her lunch break began, Mia hurried to the Business Department.

"Where is Emily Smith's workstation?" She stopped a female employee.

Lily studied the unfamiliar girl. "And you are?"

"I'm her best friend. It's my first day." Mia beamed.

When she heard Emily was hospitalized with a high fever, Mia's face instantly fell.

"Which hospital? I need to go now!" Mia stamped her foot in urgency.

Seeing her genuine concern, Lily nodded. "I'm heading there too. Let's go together."

Outside, the wail of an ambulance siren added urgency to the sudden crisis.
###Chapter 130

Mia Harris pushed open the hospital room door carrying a thermal lunchbox. Lily White sat by the bed peeling an apple. Emily Smith lay motionless on the bed, her pale cheeks flushed with fever.

"Her temperature has dropped a little," Michael Thompson whispered as he took the lunchbox. "The doctor wants to observe her overnight."

Mia nodded, her gaze lingering on Emily's furrowed brows. She reached out to tuck the blanket tighter around her friend, her fingertips brushing against cold skin.

"You two should go home," Mia said with a tired smile. "I took time off work."

Michael hesitated. "Should we contact her family?"

"Family?" Mia's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "What family does she have left?" She immediately regretted her words and added, "Her younger sister's been in the ICU for over a year. Comatose."

Lily's apple slipped from her fingers and hit the floor with a thud. Michael swallowed hard before asking, "What about her parents?"

"That's..." Mia shook her head. "Let's wait until she wakes up."

After seeing them out, Mia scrolled through her phone by Emily's bedside. The company group chat was flooded with photos of William Johnson and Amanda Lin holding hands. The image of their intertwined fingers burned her eyes.

"Xiao Yi—"

A heart-wrenching scream erupted from the bed. Mia dropped her phone in shock as Emily suddenly sat upright, yanking the IV line violently.

"Nightmare?" Mia grabbed Emily's flailing hands.

Emily trembled violently, fat tears rolling down her cheeks. "I dreamed... William stopped Xiao Yi's treatment..."

Mia's heart clenched. She recalled the morning elevator gossip about the VP personally canceling special care for a certain patient.

"Don't worry." She pulled Emily into a tight hug. "We can transfer hospitals. My cousin has connections at Johns Hopkins. If necessary, we'll go to America."

Emily's sobs gradually quieted. She fumbled for her phone and dialed the caregiver with shaking fingers. Only after confirming her sister's stable condition did she collapse back against the pillows, drained.

"Is it because of him?" Mia handed her tissues, the implication clear.

Emily lowered her lashes, shadows dancing across her face.

"That bastard!" Mia slammed her fist onto the nightstand. "Playing both sides—flaunting his relationship with Amanda while messing with you!"

In her fury, Mia didn't notice the door creaking open slightly. William Johnson stood in the corridor shadows, the bouquet of lilies in his hand crushed beyond recognition.
###Chapter 131

William Johnson's footsteps came to an abrupt halt.

Mia Harris's furious voice carried from the hospital room: "William Johnson is nothing but a complete scumbag!"

Emily Smith's tone was eerily calm. "Don't blame him. It was just a transactional relationship—he paid, I slept with him. Now that he's reunited with his true love, he doesn't need me anymore. That's how it goes."

William's fingers tightened unconsciously.

"A transactional relationship?" Mia's voice rose sharply. "Then why did he get to terminate it unilaterally? Labor laws entitle you to compensation!"

Emily suddenly laughed, the sound light as wind chimes. "BestTech has a three-month probation period. I was three days short. Guess I didn't pass, so no payout."

"Emily Smith!" Mia jabbed a finger at her forehead in frustration. "Where's your self-respect?"

"You said he's a scumbag, didn't you?" Emily caught her hand, eyes bright. "Isn't it good to leave early?"

Outside the door, William's expression darkened dangerously.

He turned and strode away, his leather shoes striking the floor with heavy thuds.

Inside the room, Mia continued ranting. "Men are all led by their lower halves, especially when they're single—"

"I know, I know." Emily nodded obediently.

The next morning, Emily insisted on checking out and going straight to work.

She wore flawless makeup, but the dark circles under her eyes were impossible to hide.

Michael Thompson and Lily White were so concerned they practically forced her to sit at her desk and rest.

At lunch, Emily reserved a private room at One Taste Restaurant.

"My treat," she said with a smile. "Thank you all for taking care of me."

Michael excused himself to "take a call" and slipped out to pay.

"Sir, your table's bill has already been settled," the cashier informed him politely.

Michael blinked. "By whom?"

Just then, the door to the adjacent private room opened.

William stepped out, phone in hand, and his gaze locked directly with Michael's.
###Chapter 132

"It was Miss Smith who settled the bill in advance," the cashier replied with a smile.

Michael Thompson frowned. "When did she pay? How much was the private room?"

"Right when you arrived." The cashier pulled up the receipt. "Total was 2,568."

"Refund it. I'll pay." Michael took out his phone.

"But—"

"Do it now." His tone left no room for argument.

The cashier had no choice but to comply.

Not far away, William Johnson's expression darkened the moment he heard "Miss Smith."

He hadn’t expected Michael to care so much about Emily.

A cold smirk curled his lips as he turned and walked toward the garden to take a call.

Inside the private room, Emily was laughing with her colleagues when her phone buzzed.

A bank notification showed the refund—the exact amount of their lunch.

Understanding immediately, she excused herself to the restroom and hurried out.

Michael had just finished paying when Emily rushed up to him.

"Boss!" Her eyes were slightly red.

He chuckled and ruffled her hair. "The celebration lunch is on me. That’s the rule."

William happened to return from the garden just then.

His gaze darkened as he caught sight of Michael’s hand in Emily’s hair and the faint redness in her eyes.

"But I promised to treat everyone..." Her voice trembled.

"Stop insisting on paying all the time," Michael said gently. "It makes the team uncomfortable."

Emily opened her mouth to protest, but he gently pulled her back toward the room.

Neither noticed William standing in the shadows.

His knuckles whitened around his phone, a mocking smile playing on his lips.

When Emily and her colleagues left later, two familiar figures stood at the cashier.

Amanda Lin clung to William’s arm, their silhouettes painfully perfect together.

"It’s Vice President Johnson!" a colleague gasped.

William turned at the sound.

Emily had no time to hide—their eyes locked.

Time seemed to freeze.

She quickly ducked behind a coworker, her heart pounding so hard it hurt.

The others stepped forward to greet him.

Michael smiled and nodded, but Emily stayed hidden at the back.

"William, are these your colleagues?" Amanda beamed.

William intertwined their fingers. "From the Business Department."

"Hello, everyone. I’m Amanda Lin, William’s girlfriend." She introduced herself with effortless grace.

The word "girlfriend" stabbed through Emily like a blade.

Her head snapped up—just in time to see their clasped hands.

Her nails dug into her palms, but she forced herself to stay composed.
###Chapter 133

"Miss Lin has such elegant grace. You and Vice President Johnson make a perfect match." Michael Thompson fawned with an ingratiating smile.

The Business Department staff were all shrewd opportunists, masters at reading the room. They quickly joined in with flattering remarks.

Amanda Lin responded with a graceful smile, intimately linking arms with William Johnson as she whispered something in his ear. Fingers intertwined, they left first.

As she turned, Amanda's gaze fleetingly swept past Emily Smith standing in the corner.

Emily met that meaningful look and forced a faint smile.

Her conscience was clear. Her relationship with William had been nothing more than a mutually agreed transaction. She hadn't stolen or cheated—what did she have to be ashamed of?

She had just sat back at her workstation when the desk phone rang.

The caller ID showed William's office.

Emily took a deep breath and answered.

"Go pack up your things tonight." The man's icy voice carried suppressed anger.

"Alright."

Click.

The call ended abruptly.

Emily closed her eyes briefly before turning to her computer, forcing herself to focus on work.

The moment the workday ended, she headed straight to Skyline Bay Apartment No. 1.

Standing before the familiar door, her heartbeat quickened uncontrollably.

She silently prayed William wouldn't be home. At this hour, he was never usually here.

Beep. The fingerprint lock clicked open.

She froze, surprised her access still worked.

Apparently, William couldn't be bothered with such trivialities—or with her.

The apartment was dark, so quiet she could hear her own breathing.

Using the last fading light from the windows, she walked straight to the guest room. Her belongings were already packed—just one suitcase.

Retrieving it from the closet, she placed the black card and phone on the nightstand, eager to leave immediately.

"Did I say you could go?"

That deep, familiar voice suddenly spoke behind her.

Emily shuddered, nearly dropping the suitcase handle.

Turning slowly, she saw William seated in an armchair shrouded in shadows. In the dim light, his eyes gleamed like a predator's—dangerous and intent.

"Sorry, I thought you weren't home," she said, her voice eerily calm.

William chuckled, long fingers tapping the armrest. "Leaving me seems to make you happy?"

Backlit, his expression was unreadable, but the chill in his tone said everything.

Emily bit her lip. "You ended things first."

"So you didn't want to?" His eyes narrowed, the air around him turning oppressive.

After a pause, she finally mustered courage. "William, could you please let Professor Johnson continue treating my sister?"

"Begging me?" His gaze turned dangerous.

"Yes, I'm begging you." She nodded without hesitation.

"Begging requires the right attitude." His words were deliberate.

"What do you want me to do?"

"Come here."
###Chapter 134

"Come here."

William Johnson's voice was icy.

Emily Smith tightened her grip on the suitcase handle, her nails nearly digging into her palms. She took a deep breath and slowly walked toward him.

"What will it take for Professor Johnson to continue treating my sister?" Her voice trembled.

William toyed with his cufflinks, not even lifting his gaze.

"Kneel." The word slipped from his thin lips.

Emily's head snapped up, meeting his fathomless eyes.

"You have a girlfriend," she gritted out.

William suddenly laughed, though the amusement never reached his eyes.

"Do you think I'd make my girlfriend do this?"

The words cut like a knife, plunging straight into Emily's heart. She finally understood—in his eyes, she wasn't even human.

"Name another condition," she rasped.

William stood, looking down at her with disdain.

"Emily Smith, do you think you're in any position to bargain?" He tilted her chin up with a finger. "What other value do you have besides this?"

Each word burned like a brand, making her entire body shake.

She turned to leave, but his demonic whisper stopped her cold.

"Your sister's hospital bed seems permanent now."

Emily froze, her blood turning to ice.

Slowly, she turned back, tears welling in her eyes. Finally, she sank to her knees, trembling.

"Get out!"

Before she could touch him, he shoved her away violently. She fell to the floor, watching the fury swirl in William's eyes.

"Professor Johnson will keep treating her, right?" she pressed stubbornly.

William yanked his tie loose, his Adam's apple bobbing. "If you don't leave now, I'll call to terminate her treatment immediately."

Emily scrambled up, grabbed her suitcase, and fled.

The subway station was packed with people.

She stood at the platform's edge as trains roared past. Her phone screen flickered on and off. Finally, she opened WeChat and transferred the 500,000 back—ten installments.

Each transfer felt like carving out her own heart.

When she blocked all his contacts, her hands shook so badly she could barely hold the phone. The last train arrived, and she stepped on without looking back.

The window reflected her pale face and the city that had devoured every last shred of her dignity.
###Chapter 135

William Johnson had been sitting motionless by the floor-to-ceiling window of Jinzhou Bay Apartment No.1 for an entire day. The fading sunlight streamed through the glass, casting golden hues over him, yet it couldn't dispel the icy aura surrounding him.

His phone suddenly vibrated violently on the coffee table, its screen lighting up and dimming repeatedly—ten times in total.

Slowly, he reached out and picked it up. When he saw the ten transfers totaling five hundred thousand dollars, his pupils constricted sharply. His knuckles turned white from the force of his grip, veins bulging menacingly across the back of his hand.

Did she really think repaying this money would settle everything between them?

A cold smirk curled his lips as a storm raged in his eyes. Without hesitation, he dialed the CEO of Grasshopper Audiobook.

"Mr. Johnson? How may I—"

"Take down all works by Emily Smith and her co-anchor immediately." His voice was frigid, laced with venom. "Blacklist them across all platforms. Anyone who dares to work with them is challenging me."

Dead silence filled the other end of the line.

"But... Mr. Johnson, they're our top anchors—"

"Do I need to repeat myself?"

"N-no! I’ll handle it right away!"

Three days later, Saturday afternoon.

Emily Smith returned from the hospital, ready to contact her new partner to prepare for recording a new book. But then, a message popped up:

"The website has terminated all collaborations with you."

She froze, her fingers trembling slightly.

"All your works have been removed," another message followed. "Who did you offend?"

Panicked, she logged into the website, only to find her profile completely wiped clean. She sent multiple messages to her editor, but there was no response.

By seven in the evening, she finally couldn’t hold back and texted Daniel Chen. The moment she hit send, her phone rang.

"Daniel..."

"Emily, are you okay?"

They spoke simultaneously, then fell into silence. Over the line, she could hear his heavy breathing.

"Let’s meet in person," he finally said.

Half an hour later, Emily arrived at the restaurant entrance, where Daniel had been waiting. He strode toward her, his gaze scanning her carefully.

"I’m sorry for dragging you into this again," she murmured.

Daniel shook his head and led her inside. After ordering, he looked straight into her eyes.

"Has William Johnson been giving you trouble?"

The question made everything click into place. She remembered William’s fury that night, the engagement banquet photos circulating everywhere.

"No," she forced a faint smile.

"Even now, you’re still defending him?" Daniel’s voice tightened. "He cut off your income—isn’t that trouble enough?"

Emily lowered her lashes, shadows falling across her face. "Daniel, I’m really sorry..."

Outside, the city lights flickered to life. The restaurant buzzed with chatter, but it all felt distant—irrelevant to them.
###Chapter 136

"Emily, those recording earnings mean nothing to me." Daniel Chen clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white. "All I care about is whether you've been wronged."

The girl he cherished had been trampled on like this.

The past seven days had felt like an eternity.

He wanted to reach out to her but feared his messages would vanish into the void.

When she finally called, he nearly dropped his phone.

"You earn your living through talent. Who gave him the right to suppress you?" Daniel's voice trembled. "Breaking up wasn't enough—he had to cut off your livelihood too? What kind of twisted mentality is that?"

"Daniel, was it really William who took down my work?" Emily gripped the hem of her shirt.

After a pause, he nodded. "Not only did he remove your audiobooks, but he also blacklisted us. No platform will dare work with us now."

Her pupils constricted.

"To control you, he acquired Grasshopper Audiobook." Daniel let out a cold laugh. "Of course, it was a profitable deal for him."

Her fingertips turned icy. Her sister's medical bills were a bottomless pit.

She couldn't understand—what had she done to provoke William like this?

"Don't be afraid." Daniel suddenly took her hand. "There's always a way out."

"What way?" she pressed urgently.

"My friend is looking for voice actors for a game." His eyes brightened. "Your voice would be perfect."

"Really?" A spark of hope flickered in her eyes.

"You can audition tomorrow."

The next day, the audition went surprisingly well.

The studio owner signed her on the spot. The pay wasn't as much as before, but it would tide her over.

At lunch, she treated Daniel to a meal.

When ordering, she deliberately picked his favorites.

"You don't have to accommodate me." He smiled softly. "I love whatever you like."

Emily shook her head. "I like these too."

She had once dreamed of being a food streamer, but building an audience was tough.

"Seems we have similar tastes." His gaze was tender.

She excused herself to the restroom—only to bump into George Taylor and his group on the way.
###Chapter 137

Ethan Zheng emerged from the private dining room with an unfamiliar woman draped over his arm. The way she clung to him made it clear she wasn’t Vivian Lu.

Emily Smith paused mid-step in the hallway.

Vivian had already been dealt with by William Johnson. As Olivia Davis’s lackey, she’d become disposable. Naturally, Ethan, as her so-called friend, was quick to cut ties.

George Taylor spotted Emily first, his eyes lighting up. "Emily Smith? What a coincidence."

Ethan finally glanced up, his smirk lazy and suggestive. "Look who’s here—the soft, curvy girl."

Emily offered a tight smile. "Mr. Taylor. Mr. Zheng."

Daniel Chen rose from his seat, subtly positioning himself between her and the two men. "And you are?"

"Daniel Chen from Jinzhou Radio?" George studied him. "I’ve heard of you."

Ethan pulled out his phone and snapped a quick photo of the pair.

The image captured Daniel shielding Emily in a protective stance. Without hesitation, Ethan sent it to William. [Has your little pet found a new owner?]

At the Johnson mansion, William descended the spiral staircase.

His phone buzzed. He opened the message, and his pupils constricted.

The sight of Emily nestled against Daniel’s chest sent a sharp pang through him. His knuckles whitened as he gripped the phone, jaw clenched.

He swallowed hard, shut his eyes briefly, and shoved the phone back into his pocket.

Just a woman. Nothing more.

Monday morning, Emily and Lily White met at the subway entrance.

"Did you hear? The marketing department just got a new director—" Lily’s words cut off as a black Rolls-Royce screeched to a halt beside them.

Emily’s breath hitched the moment she recognized the license plate.

The door swung open, and William stepped out. She lowered her gaze, murmuring in unison with Lily, "Good morning, Vice President Johnson."

His sharp stare lingered on her face for a fraction of a second.

As they waited for the elevator, Lily tugged her sleeve. "Did you see the way he looked at you just now?"

"Hmm?"

"Like he wanted to devour you." Lily shivered. "So terrifying."

Emily watched the elevator numbers flicker, silent.

Inside his private elevator, William loosened his tie. His phone screen lit up—the same photo.

He pressed delete.
###Chapter 138

Emily's fingers trembled slightly. She forced a smile. "Lily, you must be mistaken."

Lily White nodded thoughtfully. "You're right. Vice President Johnson wouldn't..."

The sentence hung unfinished as both women fell into silence.

Emily stared down at her coffee, stirring it absently. She had always believed William's feelings toward her amounted to nothing more than dislike. Hatred was too strong a word—it required a reason profound enough to carve into one's bones.

What was she to him? Just a discarded plaything, unworthy of even being remembered.

The next day at lunchtime, the staff canteen buzzed with noise. As Emily turned with her tray, she collided with Grace Lee. Soup splattered across Grace's pristine skirt, leaving an ugly stain.

"I'm so sorry, Grace!" Emily apologized hastily. But when she looked up, she met eyes cold as ice.

William stood beside Grace, his presence instantly chilling the air around them. The way he looked at her—as if she were something filthy.

"Clean it." Three words, sharp and final.

Grace opened her mouth to decline but froze under William's glare.

As Emily knelt, she heard gasps ripple through the silent cafeteria. The sound of paper towels scrubbing fabric was deafening in the stillness.

"Vice President Johnson..." Michael Thompson tried to intervene.

"Need I repeat myself?" William's voice was laced with venom.

Emily's hands shook—not from fear, but from sudden understanding. When someone despised even the air you breathed, that was hatred in its purest form.

"I'll buy you a new one," she said softly, standing up.

But William had already turned away. "Make sure it's fully compensated."

Grace hurried after him, her stiletto heels clicking nervously against the floor. She had seen it—the moment the elevator doors closed, her boss's gaze remained locked on the kneeling figure.

Inside the private elevator, Grace held her breath.

She remembered how, just half an hour earlier, William had abruptly decided to eat in the staff canteen after already returning to the 67th floor. And how conveniently they had crossed paths with Emily and her colleagues.

Coincidences like that didn't exist.

Stealing a glance at the man beside her, Grace felt a chill creep up her neck. She was certain now—that look in his eyes wasn't dislike.

It was the gaze of a predator fixated on its prey.
###Chapter 139

By the time lunch break ended, the entire BestTech Tower was buzzing with rumors about Vice President Johnson's apparent disdain for Emily Smith from the Business Department.

Emily stood before the dressing room mirror in the department store, her fingertips lightly tracing the hem of a dress identical to the one Grace Lee owned. The price tag—five thousand yuan—made her breath hitch. It was the most expensive piece of clothing she'd bought in seven years.

"Miss, shall I wrap it up for you?" The salesgirl smiled sweetly.

"Yes." She nodded, pulling out the credit card she rarely used.

The next morning, the elevator reached the 67th floor before seven. The secretary's office was dark, and behind the frosted glass door of Vice President Johnson's office, silence reigned. Emily placed the paper bag gently on Grace's desk. As she turned, the hem of her dress swept a sharp arc through the air.

"Coffee."

A deep male voice startled her from behind. Emily stiffened before turning with a practiced professional smile. "Apologies for disturbing you, Vice President Johnson. I was just returning Ms. Lee's dress."

She walked away quickly, her heels clicking a crisp rhythm against the marble floor. William watched her rigid retreat, his right hand absently tracing the watch on his left wrist.

In the break room, Mia Harris nearly crushed her mug when she overheard the gossip.

"That bastard William!" she fumed, typing furiously into her phone. "Are you okay?"

Emily replied almost instantly: 【?】

At noon, Mia dragged Emily to the entrance of "Pine Moon," a high-end Japanese restaurant. Emily hesitated at the sight of the gilded sign. "This place costs two thousand per person—"

"Relax," Mia waved her phone. "Mom just texted that they got a fresh bluefin tuna today."

Inside the private dining room, plump shrimp glistened like pearls on a bed of ice. Mia viciously bit into her salmon. "William is a heartless jerk! If I'd known he'd—"

"Miss Harris." The manager suddenly entered, his expression strained as he gestured discreetly toward the hallway.

Outside, William stood at the corner with Amanda Lin on his arm. He wore a dark-patterned suit today, his tie pin glinting coldly under the lights.

Mia's furious voice carried clearly through the paper door:

"...Who does he think he is, some icy CEO? Just another playboy who toys with people's feelings!"
###Chapter 140

"That old man William Johnson is almost thirty and still so shameless!" Mia Harris slammed the table in anger. "The vice president of BestTech Group actually humiliated you in public. Who does he think he is?"

"Mia!" Emily Smith quickly covered her mouth. "Stop it."

Mia shook her off. "Why shouldn't I say it? He was the one who provoked you first, and now he's making you look bad in front of everyone. A scumbag like him deserves to be torn to pieces!"

Emily pressed her lips together and whispered, "Actually, this is good."

"Good? How?" Mia widened her eyes.

"The more he acts like this, the clearer I see his true colors." Emily lowered her lashes. "It's better to face reality now than to keep being trapped in illusions."

Hearing this, Mia finally calmed down and took her hand. "You're right. A jerk like him isn't worth it."

Outside the private room, William's expression darkened dangerously. Amanda Lin, holding his arm, chuckled softly. "So there are women who don't care about you after all."

The manager asked nervously, "Mr. Johnson, will you still be dining?"

William gave him a cold glance before turning to leave. Amanda smiled sweetly at the manager. "Please let those two inside know they should learn their place."

The manager wiped sweat from his brow. When Emily and Mia left later, he relayed the message truthfully.

"What?" Mia jumped in shock. "He heard everything?"

The manager nodded awkwardly.

Mia paled. "Oh no. Is he going to retaliate?"

Emily reassured her, "He won't. That's not the kind of person he is."

"How do you know?" Mia eyed her suspiciously.

Emily said softly, "If he wanted to make things difficult for me, he would have done it already."

Mia sighed. "Whatever. If I see that scumbag again, I'll curse him out every time!"

Back at the company, Emily threw herself into work. When her shift ended, Daniel Chen called to say he'd pick her up.

After a brief hesitation, she agreed.

As she stepped out of the building, Daniel was already waiting by the roadside. Spotting her, he waved and called, "Emily!"

A car passed by as Daniel hurried to the middle of the road, reaching out his hand. Emily took it, and they dashed across the street together.

On the 67th floor, in the vice president's office, William stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the scene unfold. His grip on his phone tightened, knuckles turning white.
###Chapter 141

William Johnson's gaze remained fixed on Emily Smith as she gracefully slipped into the passenger seat of Daniel Chen's car.

Her blurred profile reflected in the window, bathed in the warm golden glow of the sunset.

The white Audi slowly pulled away, its tires crunching over fallen leaves with a faint rustling sound.

William stood motionless, watching until the taillights disappeared around the corner before finally looking away.

"Sir? Are you still there?" His assistant's hesitant voice came through the phone.

He glanced down at the device in his palm, then suddenly hurled it against the wall.

The metallic clang of impact against marble was sharp, the screen shattering instantly.

Emily's words from earlier that afternoon echoed in his mind.

Youth. Time. Feelings.

So she had already found someone else.

All those obedient, sweet expressions—just waiting for him to say the words first.

...

As dusk deepened, William's car should have been heading toward the Johnson family estate.

But at the third intersection, he abruptly ordered the driver to turn around.

The fingerprint lock at his apartment in Jinzhou Bay beeped softly as he entered.

Darkness greeted him when he pushed the door open.

His eyes instinctively flicked toward the kitchen—where a slender figure in an apron should have been.

He flipped the switch, and the crystal chandelier blazed to life.

The empty living room felt suffocating, the air stagnant.

He strode toward the master bedroom but paused at the doorway, turning instead to push open the adjacent room.

The bed was perfectly made, not a single wrinkle in sight.

He bent down, lifting the pillow—not a single strand of long hair remained.

On the island in the walk-in closet lay a phone and a black credit card.

William stared at them for a long moment before letting out a low, humorless laugh.

He collapsed onto the bed, exhaustion crashing over him.

Ding-dong—

The doorbell shattered the silence.

William frowned, burying his face deeper into the pillow.

Ding-dong— Ding-dong—

The sound persisted, repeating every two minutes.

By the seventh ring, he sat up abruptly, his eyes dark with irritation.

The security screen showed Amanda Lin smoothing her skirt.

William watched her for two seconds before slowly unclenching his fist.

"William!" She beamed as the door opened, lifting a food container. "I brought truffle foie gras."

She breezed past him into the dining room, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Your mother mentioned you've been staying here a lot lately, so I thought I'd check on you."

William followed in silence, his gaze tracking every surface she touched.

"This place is lovely." She turned to him with a playful wink. "How about I move in with you?"

He handed her a pair of chopsticks, his tone flat. "Do what you want."

"Then it's settled." She picked up a piece of foie gras and held it to his lips. "I'll have my things sent over tomorrow."

William accepted the bite mechanically, chewing without tasting.

On the drive back, the car stopped at a red light.

His bored gaze drifted out the window—then froze.

Across the street, inside a parked white Audi, Emily was laughing, her head tilted back as Daniel Chen tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
###Chapter 142

The traffic light turned green.

Daniel Chen turned the steering wheel as the white Audi slowly merged into the right lane.

William Johnson's gaze remained fixed on the car until it disappeared around the corner.

"What are you staring at?" Amanda Lin followed his line of sight.

When she caught Emily Smith's profile through the window, her red lips curled into an amused smirk.

"Did you catch feelings after sleeping together?"

William withdrew his gaze and glanced at his watch.

10:50 PM.

"What if I did?" He gave her a sidelong glance, voice dripping with indifference.

"Since when did you become so insecure?"

Amanda suddenly leaned in, pressing her crimson lips against his cheek.

"I've always been confident." Her fingers trailed along his tie.

"Everyone knows who truly holds your heart."

William chuckled and stepped on the accelerator.

The black Maybach melted into the night.

The Audi came to a gentle stop outside Sky City's gates.

"Thanks, Daniel." Emily unbuckled her seatbelt as the night breeze brushed against her loose strands.

Daniel rolled down the window.

"Don't forget to use the throat lozenges I gave you."

She nodded and waved goodbye.

Only after her slender figure disappeared through the residential gates did he drive away.

The elevator numbers climbed steadily.

Ding.

As the 29th-floor lights flickered on, Emily stepped forward—

A dark figure suddenly lunged from the emergency stairwell.

David Brown's face twisted grotesquely under the hallway lights.

She spun toward the elevator, but her hair was viciously yanked backward.

A searing pain tore across her scalp as her body slammed onto the floor.

"You bitch!" A sharp slap whistled through the air.

"You think cozying up to William Johnson makes you untouchable?"

The metallic tang of blood flooded her mouth.

Emily suddenly grabbed his wrist and sank her teeth in deep.

A howl of pain erupted—

Just as the apartment door burst open.

"You bastard!" Mia Harris charged forward like an enraged lioness.

Neighbors rushed out at the commotion.

Some restrained the thrashing David while others dialed emergency services.

"She's my girlfriend!" David roared, struggling violently.

"This slut cheated on me!"

Supported by Mia, Emily trembled as she spoke.

"He was the one who cheated during our relationship."

Her voice shook.

"And he served jail time for assault."

Four security guards arrived as David broke free and lunged at her again.

The hallway lights stretched his shadow into the shape of a rabid beast.
###Chapter 143

The security guards at the upscale residential complex weren't pushovers. The moment David Brown lunged forward, two burly men pinned him to the ground.

"Let me go! Do you know who I am?" David thrashed violently, spewing obscenities.

Mia Harris pulled out her phone and called her brother. After hanging up, she couldn't stand listening any longer and spat, "You're worse than dirt. Emily must have been blind to ever fall for your lies!"

"You bitch, asking for death?" David snarled, his face twisted with rage.

"Listen to this, everyone. Does this sound like something a decent human would say?" Mia scoffed. "Breaking into your ex-girlfriend's home in the middle of the night, hurling insults—officers, please take this trash away!"

Neighbors whispered among themselves, casting disdainful looks at David.

The wail of police sirens grew louder. Even as he was shoved into the patrol car, David continued to shout threats. Emily Smith and Mia followed to give their statements. When they stepped out of the station, Mia's brother was already waiting outside.

"Are you hurt?" he asked with concern.

Emily shook her head. "Thankfully, security arrived in time."

"Bro, can you make sure this bastard rots in jail for years?" Mia clenched her teeth.

Mia's brother glanced at Emily, who murmured, "I heard his family has connections..."

"Connections mean he can break the law?" Mia stomped her foot in frustration.

After a moment of thought, Mia's brother said, "Let me look into it first. At the very least, he won't be getting out tonight."

Back at the apartment, Emily tossed and turned, unable to sleep. She remembered Michael Thompson mentioning that after the last fight, William Johnson had pulled strings to ensure David would be locked up for three to five years.

Yet here he was, free after only three months.

The thought that William might have orchestrated this made Emily's heart turn to ice. So he was no different from David—even after their breakup, he wouldn’t let her move on.

Over the next few days, David remained in temporary custody. Daniel Chen drove Emily to and from work daily, but the constant tension and exhaustion took their toll. Her throat became inflamed, and by Friday, she was running a low fever.

"I took the day off," she told Mia over the phone. "When can you leave?"

The sound of furious typing came through the line. "Ugh, the manager dumped a ton of reports on me last minute and basically said 'take it or leave it'..."

"I'll wait for you," Emily insisted.

Even after taking medicine, her head still spun. She forced herself to finish preparing for next week's tasks. It wasn’t until 9:30 PM that Mia finally wrapped up.

The elevator dinged. Dazed, Emily stepped inside—and collided straight into a solid chest.
"Tsk—"

###Chapter 144

A sharp pain shot through Emily's forehead. She instinctively pressed her hand to the injury and looked up, meeting a pair of icy, fathomless eyes.

William Johnson's cold, chiseled face was mere inches away.

Her entire body trembled as she hastily stepped back. "I'm sorry, Vice President Johnson."

His fingers suddenly clamped around her wrist, yanking her forward with undeniable force. The elevator doors slid shut silently behind her.

"Let go!" She struggled fiercely, her voice laced with disgust.

William's gaze darkened. In one swift motion, he pinned her against the cold metal wall of the elevator.

"Two weeks apart, and you've already grown distant?" His breath scorched her skin as he leaned in.

Emily tilted her chin up defiantly. "We're over."

"Over?" A humorless laugh escaped him. "Since when can an employer-employee relationship just end?"

Her fists clenched. The words I quit burned on her tongue.

But her sister's hospital bills loomed over her. She couldn't afford to be reckless.

"It's my fault," she said suddenly, softening her tone. "But Mia is innocent."

William's expression turned glacial. "How touching. You care so much about her."

The elevator jolted to a stop at the basement level. The doors opened, then closed again—no one entered or exited.

He gripped her chin, his lips grazing her earlobe. "Want them to stay unharmed?" His voice was a dark whisper. "Then behave."

"You—"

Before she could protest, his mouth crashed down on hers. The metallic tang of blood spread across her tongue. She went rigid, ceasing all resistance.

"William..."

A sweet, feminine voice drifted in from outside the elevator.

Emily froze. Through the narrowing gap of the closing doors, she caught a glimpse of Amanda Lin's shocked face.

William stilled, his ragged breaths hot against her neck.

The moment the doors sealed shut, she finally wrenched free of his grasp.
###Chapter 145

He took two steps back, calmly straightening his shirt collar.

When the elevator doors opened again, Amanda Lin stood outside. William lifted his gaze, all traces of desire gone from his eyes, replaced by cold indifference.

The scene made Emily Smith look utterly disheveled. She stood inside the elevator, clothes rumpled, like a mistress caught in the act.

"William, you two—"

"Here to pick me up? Let's go."

William cut Amanda off, stepping out of the elevator and naturally wrapping an arm around her waist. His voice was uncharacteristically tender.

But Amanda didn’t move.

She stared at Emily inside the elevator and smirked. "Emily Smith? Working this late—or were you just waiting for William?"

Emily met their gaze head-on.

William’s back was turned, hiding his expression. But the hatred in Amanda’s eyes was almost tangible.

"I’ll let it slide this time," Amanda said, her red lips parting. "But if there’s a next time, I’ll remind you who his real girlfriend is."

She linked arms with William and walked away.

As the elevator doors slowly closed, Emily finally collapsed against the wall, sliding to the floor.

She didn’t cry.

Someone like him wasn’t worth her tears.

On a quiet weekend morning, Emily’s fever broke.

After visiting her sister at the hospital, she went straight to the game company for a recording session.

On Tuesday evening, Ryan Harris invited her and Mia Harris to dinner.

"David Brown’s been detained for now," Ryan shared the good news. "But it’s unclear how long they’ll hold him."

"Bro, wasn’t David sentenced to years in prison before?" Mia asked, chewing on her straw. "Who got him out?"

"Rumor is the Johnson family intervened."

Emily’s grip on her chopsticks faltered.

"Which Johnson?" Mia pressed, glancing subtly at Emily.

"Alexander Johnson."

"Alexander Johnson?!" Mia’s eyes widened. "What connection does he have with David?"

Emily’s head snapped up.

"James Wilson is David’s cousin," Ryan explained. "James’ mother and Mrs. Johnson are cousins. He calls Alexander ‘uncle.’"

Emily suddenly remembered that night at The Royal Club.

James had indeed called William "little uncle."

"Then will Alexander try to—" Mia started, but Emily tugged her sleeve.

"Thank you, Ryan," Emily said softly. "Even a short detention is better than nothing."

Ryan nodded. "If he gets released, we’ll figure something out."

Emily smiled faintly.

So she’d misjudged William.

But then again, this wasn’t the first time she’d misunderstood him.
###Chapter 146 

Mia Harris's WeChat messages bombarded Emily Smith's phone first thing in the morning. Her manager had been giving her a harder time lately, not only increasing her workload but also making snide remarks.

"You know what?" Mia sent an angry emoji. "That old witch is jealous because the hot guy she secretly likes was nice to me!"

Emily stared at her phone screen, remembering how she'd misunderstood William Johnson before. The harsh words she'd said in the elevator now filled her with regret.

But then again, given their current relationship, apologizing would only seem unnecessary.

The past two weeks had been orderly and productive. Her routine—company, hospital, recording studio, home—left little room for overthinking. When colleagues mentioned William was on a business trip, she felt an unexpected sense of relief.

On the subway, a celebrity news notification popped up on her phone. A photo of William and Amanda Lin vacationing in Europe dominated the screen, with the headline "Power Couple Nearing Wedding Date."

Emily's finger hovered for a second before swiping past it. A strange feeling flickered in her chest, though she couldn't quite name it.

While organizing files that afternoon, she suddenly remembered the missing USB drive. It contained important recording materials she'd left behind in her rush to move out of the Sky City apartment.

Should she contact William? The thought vanished as quickly as it came. In her current position, reaching out would only invite humiliation.

After much deliberation, she decided to take the risk. With William abroad, she could retrieve her belongings unnoticed.

Standing outside the familiar apartment building, her heartbeat quickened. To her surprise, the security system still recognized her, granting her seamless access to the elevator.

The fingerprint lock emitted its familiar beep as her hand trembled slightly. When she pushed the door open, the sight before her froze her blood—

William stood shirtless, Amanda Lin in his arms wearing nothing but a black silk slip. Her long legs wrapped around his waist, the hem barely covering what needed to be hidden.

Both turned toward the door simultaneously. In that moment of six eyes meeting, the air seemed to solidify.
###Chapter 147

The sound of movement came from the foyer. William Johnson and Amanda Lin turned their heads simultaneously.

Emily Smith stood outside the door, caught off guard by the two pairs of intertwined gazes.

Amanda was practically draped over William's body, a posture Emily knew all too well. Just yesterday, she had been pinned against the wall by him in the exact same position.

Memory and reality overlapped, churning a sour taste in her stomach.

"I'm sorry!" She slammed the door shut and fled.

In the elevator, the mirrored walls reflected her pale face. Her fingers clenched the strap of her bag so tightly her nails nearly dug into her palms.

Vivian Lu's words echoed in her ears: "You're just a replacement."

Her phone suddenly vibrated in her bag. An unknown number.

"Who is this?"

"Basement level one. Now." William's voice was laced with ice before the call abruptly ended.

Emily stared at the darkened screen. How did he know she lived here?

The underground garage was damp and chilly. The black Rolls-Royce crouched like a lurking beast, its window half-open to reveal the man's sharp profile.

Sam Wilson opened the car door for her. "Miss Smith."

The interior carried a faint scent of cedar. William crossed his long legs, his slender fingers tapping lightly against his knee.

"Bold of you to trespass," he said suddenly, his voice low.

Emily pressed her back against the seat. "I knocked."

"And?" He turned, dark currents swirling in his eyes. "Proud of interrupting?"

She bit her lower lip. From this angle, she could clearly see the lipstick stain on his collar—bright as blood.

"I'll pay for the lock."

William smirked and abruptly leaned in. The mix of ambergris and tobacco overwhelmed her senses. She instinctively recoiled, her head thudding against the window.

"With what?" His fingertip grazed her earlobe. "Like last time?"

The overhead light cast shadows over his brow. Those usually charming peach-blossom eyes were now terrifyingly cold. Emily suddenly remembered Amanda's manicured fingers, likely resting on this very suit jacket right now.

"You're joking, Mr. Johnson." She turned her face away. "You don't lack women."

The air froze. William gripped her chin, the force making her wince.

"Jealous?"

Footsteps approached outside the car. Emily seized the chance to pull away, her fingers brushing the door release just as the central lock clicked shut.

"Running?" He leisurely loosened his tie. "Weren't you going to apologize?"

His words were cut off by a sudden phone ring. The name "Amanda" on the screen stung her eyes.

William glanced at the caller ID and smirked. "Want to see how I answer her call?"
###Chapter 148

Emily's fingers trembled slightly.

Her gaze lingered on Sam's face for a moment before she finally stepped into the car.

The door slammed shut with a sharp thud.

Sam quickly started the engine, and the black sedan glided silently into the night.

She sat pressed against the window, her peripheral vision catching William reclining motionless against the leather seat.

The icy aura surrounding him seemed to drop the temperature inside the car.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, clutching the hem of her shirt.

"I didn't know you and Miss Lin were at the apartment."

William remained still, like a statue carved from ice.

"I just..." Her throat tightened.

"I needed to retrieve the USB drive I left in the guest room."

"USB drive?" William's eyes snapped open, a cold glint flashing in them.

"What could possibly be so important that you'd sneak in at midnight?"

"It's blue, in a box inside the desk drawer." She met his gaze steadily.

"If you've seen it—"

"You want me to fetch it for you?" His lips curled into a sneer as his long fingers suddenly gripped her chin.

"That important?"

Emily nodded, hearing the faint crack of his knuckles.

"Perfect." Dark flames flickered in his eyes.

"Even a damn USB drive is worth more than me."

Silence stretched between them.

"Forget it." She turned her face away.

"Just stop the car."

"You don't get to decide." William tightened his grip abruptly.

"Emily, who the hell do you think you are?"

The mechanical sound of the partition lowering made her tense.

Before she could react, she was yanked into his arms.

"Let me—"

His scorching lips smothered her protest.

He tore at her blouse like unwrapping a prize, buttons scattering with sharp clicks.

"William!" She drove her knee toward his stomach, but he easily blocked her.

His burning palms seared her waist, leaving trails of shivers in their wake.

The once-familiar touch now only made her sick.

"Stop pretending," he growled against her ear.

"Isn't this what you wanted?"

Tears splashed onto the back of his hand.

She suddenly went still.

"Does Amanda know you're like this?"

The words acted like a switch.

William paused, then ripped her skirt open with renewed brutality.

The car jolted violently.

In the rearview mirror, Sam stared rigidly at the road ahead, beads of sweat forming at his temples.
###Chapter 149

William Johnson abruptly looked up, his dark eyes fixed on her with a chilling sneer. "You dare mention her? If you hadn't come begging to me, would I even be here?"

Emily Smith shook her head desperately, her entire body trembling.

But William was relentless, determined to teach her a lesson.

Gazing up at his cold, unyielding face, terror surged through her like a tidal wave. Instinctively, she cried out, "William, don't! Or I'll hate you—I swear I'll—"

Her last word was cut off abruptly.

Whether it was the word "hate" that struck him or something else, William suddenly froze, as if paralyzed.

He stared down at the woman beneath him, her face streaked with tears, the veins in his temples throbbing violently.

Instinct urged him to continue.

Yet he forced himself to stop.

Emily shut her eyes in despair and turned her head away.

The car was filled with nothing but heavy breathing.

After what felt like an eternity, William pulled back and moved to the window, fishing out a cigarette and lighter. With a sharp click, the flame flickered to life, casting shadows across his sharp profile.

Emily remained motionless, silent tears still rolling down her cheeks.

The scent of nicotine slowly permeated the air.

Much later, a coat was gently draped over her. The partition lowered, and William spoke to Sam in the front seat. "Take her home."

"Yes, sir." Sam kept his eyes forward and immediately changed direction.

Emily finally sat up, straightening her disheveled clothes.

All the buttons were gone, but the zipper still worked. She wrapped William’s suit jacket tightly around herself, shielding her body completely.

The moment the car stopped, she pushed the door open and fled.

William’s eyes snapped open, but all he saw was the frantic silhouette of her retreating figure.

The next morning, Emily was at work when her phone buzzed with a bank notification.

Over $17,000 in royalties—sent by Grasshopper Audiobook.

She stared at the screen, stunned. Her book had been taken down two weeks ago. Why was there so much money now?

What should have been good news only reminded her of last night’s humiliation, sending a wave of unease through her.

William had just been with Amanda Lin, then turned around and humiliated her. And now, this sudden payment—what was his game?

Hesitantly, she sent a message to her editor, Yin Yin.

The reply came instantly: Sweetie, I was just about to reach out to you!

Emily forced a bitter smile.

Your book with Shan Shan Er Chuan is back online! The site has reimbursed all the unpaid royalties and is giving it a major promotion~

Her book was back up?

She quickly opened the Grasshopper Audiobook app and saw their work prominently displayed on the homepage, with bold promotional banners.

The higher-ups went crazy for a bit—we were just following orders. Don’t be mad~

The site wants to make it up to you. Not only is your book back, but we’ve secured the best resources and featured spots for you. You’re always welcome to return~

Emily read the rapid-fire messages, tempted to refuse outright. But remembering William now owned Grasshopper, she swallowed her words.

Thanks. I’ll think about it.

After sending that, she immediately closed the chat and forced herself to focus on work.

###Chapter 150

Emily Smith was organizing meeting minutes when Mia Harris's message popped up.

"Lunch together? Mom just got fresh bluefin tuna."

Emily glanced at the calendar, her fingertip brushing lightly over the number 22.

It was the same private room at the Japanese restaurant. As she pushed the door open, Emily froze mid-step.

At the center of the lavish sashimi platter sat an exquisite cream cake, candlelight flickering over the number "22."

"Happy birthday, my love."

Mia wrapped her arms around Emily from behind, presenting a Tiffany-blue gift box. Inside lay a diamond-studded smile pendant, glimmering in the candlelight.

"It suits you." Mia gently pinched Emily's flushed earlobe. "Just like how you always face life with a smile."

Emily lowered her head to fasten the necklace, the diamonds warm against her collarbone. The sterile scent of disinfectant from last year's birthday still lingered in her memory, but now the room was filled with the sweetness of salmon.

"I have to attend Grandma's birthday dinner tonight, so lunch is all I can spare." Mia placed a slice of fatty tuna on Emily's plate. "Eat extra for me."

Emily nodded with a smile, the candlelight casting delicate sparks in her eyes.

Meanwhile, on the 67th floor of BestTech Tower, William Johnson loosened his tie by the floor-to-ceiling window. Across the street, Daniel Chen was pulling an extravagant bouquet of blue roses from his car trunk.

He remembered the date on her resume. Today was her 22nd birthday.

At 6:05 PM, Emily appeared at the building's entrance. When Daniel approached her, the blue roses burned vividly under the sunset.

William watched the girl's lips curve as she accepted the flowers, his knuckles rapping a dull rhythm against the glass.

"William?"

Amanda Lin entered just as he stared absently at the fading taillights.

"Mother wants us back at the mansion for dinner." She linked her arm with his, the scent of her perfume overwhelming.

As the black Maybach passed through the commercial district, William caught sight of Daniel helping Emily try on a bracelet in front of a jewelry store window. The girl's upturned profile, illuminated by neon lights, was strikingly vivid.

Suddenly, he recalled the trembling of her lashes when she resisted him last night, his Adam's apple bobbing involuntarily. The uncontrollable restlessness made him roll up the window in irritation.

Amanda flipped through an auction catalog, her diamond earrings casting cold glints with each movement. William closed his eyes, but all he could see was another face—bare and serene.
###Chapter 151

"William, does this jewelry suit me?" Amanda Lin held her phone screen up to William Johnson's face, her fingertip lightly tapping the diamond necklace displayed.

The call had just ended. William's Adam's apple moved almost imperceptibly. Amanda noticed the subtle tension in his body, her gaze flickering between his clenched jaw and the fabric of his trousers.

She reached up and pressed the partition button. The car cabin instantly transformed into a private space. In the next moment, she straddled his lap, her delicate fingers winding around the back of his neck.

William leaned back against the leather seat, his dark eyes like ink. The image of Emily Smith beneath him refused to leave his mind—every muscle in his body taut as a drawn bowstring.

Amanda's fingertip traced his Adam's apple before her red lips brushed against his tightly pressed mouth. "William, I'm in your heart, aren't I?"

"What do you think?" His voice was rough as he cupped the back of her head.

The kiss was fierce. Amanda's nails dug into his shoulders. Just as her hand moved to unbuckle his belt, William suddenly froze, the heat in his eyes receding like a tide.

"What's wrong?" she asked breathlessly, but in his pupils, she caught a fleeting moment of distraction.

William straightened, methodically adjusting his shirt cufflinks. "Tired."

Amanda's smile stiffened. She leaned back against his shoulder and picked up her phone again. "Then this necklace—"

"Buy it," he interrupted, his gaze fixed on the neon lights flashing past the window.

......

Outside the rotating restaurant's glass walls, Jinzhou's nightscape glittered as brilliantly as ever. Emily Smith stared at the familiar seat, her fingers trembling slightly around the silverware.

"Happy birthday." Daniel Chen pushed a Tiffany-blue gift box toward her. The roses glowed like velvet in the candlelight.

Emily shook her head. "Daniel, this is too much."

"Emily." He suddenly grasped her hand. "You know how I feel."

Her eyelashes fluttered violently, casting delicate shadows across her cheeks.

"Is it because of William?" His grip tightened. "I don't care."

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, the sightseeing elevator ascended slowly, its glass refracting countless starlights. Daniel's voice blended with the soft strains of the violin. "Your father's situation, your sister's illness—none of that matters to me."

Emily looked up sharply, meeting the burning sincerity in his eyes.

"Give me a chance." He opened the jewelry box, the diamonds inside bursting with dazzling brilliance under the candlelight. "Be my girlfriend."

Her vision blurred. At that moment, the city lights melted into a flowing river of stars—and Daniel's eyes shone brighter than any jewel.
###Chapter 152

"Emily, let me be your anchor." Daniel Chen's fingertips gently traced the back of her hand. "From now on, I want to share every joy and sorrow with you."

Emily's lashes fluttered as William Johnson's domineering silhouette from last night flashed through her mind. She clenched the napkin, her knuckles turning white.

"Daniel..." Her voice cracked. "I don't deserve someone like you."

"Silly." He leaned forward suddenly, his warm palm covering her icy fingers. "I want you—as you are now, and as you'll be."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, traffic flowed endlessly. The crystal chandelier's reflections danced across his glasses. Emily stared into the sincerity in his eyes, feeling something shift in her chest.

"My past—"

"Shh." He pressed a finger to her lips. "None of that matters."

A blue velvet box slid toward her. The Tiffany smile pendant glittered under the lights, identical to the one Mia had given her. Emily's breath hitched.

"Happy birthday, my girl." He moved behind her, fingers brushing through her cascading hair. The faint sandalwood scent made him pause momentarily.

Emily suddenly grabbed his wrist. "I want to cut my hair short."

The sterile hospital hallway clung to William as he leaned against the ICU door. His reflection in the glass showed dark, brooding eyes. His phone lit up—a private investigator's photo of Daniel fastening a necklace around Emily's neck.

Bang. The phone shattered against the wall.

"Mr. Johnson?" A nurse gasped.

He loosened his tie, gaze fixed on the girl inside the room, tubes snaking across her body. The monitor's steady beeps sounded like a countdown.

Mia twirled Emily's severed locks between her fingers. "Such beautiful hair. What a waste to turn it into a wig." She leaned in suddenly, her nose almost touching Emily's ear. "Running from someone, are we?"

Emily studied her reflection. The chestnut bob accentuated her delicate collarbones—and the unmistakable red mark she could no longer hide.

"Ladies, care to try our new color-protecting serum?" Tony waved a gilded bottle. "Special price—just $888."

Mia rolled her eyes. "Fetch your manager. Tell him Mrs. Lin's daughter has a complaint."

Night deepened. Emily stood alone under the shower, hot water rinsing away the last traces of dye. A key turned in the front door.

"Darling, I'm home!" Mia's voice carried down the hall. "Guess who I ran into downstairs—"

The water cut off abruptly.
###Chapter 153

Sunday morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Emily Smith stood before the mirror, adjusting her newly cut short hair that just grazed her shoulders, accentuating her slender neck.

Her phone vibrated. A message from Daniel Chen: I'm waiting downstairs.

"Why the sudden haircut?" His gaze lingered until she fastened her seatbelt.

She twirled a strand between her fingers. "Needed a change."

At the prison gates, Daniel tactfully stayed behind.

"Dad." Emily's voice was soft through the glass.

Henry Johnson's eyes brightened. "My girl gets prettier every time."

She updated him on her sister's condition. The thirty-minute visit passed in a blink.

The Sichuan restaurant buzzed with evening chatter.

Daniel was serving Emily a dish when commotion erupted at the entrance.

Alexander Johnson entered with Sophia Song on his arm. His gaze flickered imperceptibly when it landed on Emily.

As they passed, Emily kept her eyes fixed on the boiled fish in her bowl.

"You know him?" Daniel noted Alexander's lingering look.

She shook her head, poking at a chili with her chopsticks.

The Shen mansion blazed with light.

William Johnson had just left the study when Alexander cornered him in the hallway.

"Amanda Lin was quite the experience." Alexander slowly undid his cufflinks. "Now it's my turn for something fresh."

William's expression turned glacial.

"Emily Smith." Alexander licked his lips. "Since you've discarded her—"

William slammed him against the wall before he could finish.

"Lay a finger on her and see what happens."

"William!" Mrs. He's shriek echoed down the corridor.

Hidden from his mother's view, Alexander smirked.

William released him just as Mrs. He began scolding: "Have you no manners left?"

He strode to his room without turning back, locking the door behind him.

Outside, the moonlight looked sickly pale.
###Chapter 154

Morning sunlight streamed through the car window, illuminating William Johnson's fingers as they tapped lightly against the armrest.

The car came to a stop at a red light. He was reviewing the quarterly report when—

"Emily Smith!"

A familiar voice made his head snap up.

Michael Thompson's car was parked by the roadside, its window fully rolled down. Following his gaze, William's breath hitched.

The slender figure on the sidewalk was unmistakable.

Black ankle-length trousers accentuated her long legs, while a white chiffon blouse fluttered gently in the morning breeze. Most striking was her chestnut-colored bob, grazing her shoulders.

"Boss!"

Her clear voice rang out as Emily turned, sunlight dancing on her hair. The smile she gave Michael outshone the entire street.

William's knuckles turned white.

He watched as she slipped effortlessly into the backseat of Michael's car, completely oblivious to the black Rolls-Royce parked nearby.

Even after Michael's car disappeared into traffic, William remained frozen in place.

He closed his eyes. The report in his hand was now crumpled beyond recognition.

Emily had just settled at her desk when the intercom buzzed.

The caller ID made her fingers tremble slightly.

"Come here. Now."

The cold, clipped order was followed by the sharp click of the line disconnecting.

Her gaze dropped to the paper bag beneath her desk—inside was the freshly dry-cleaned men's jacket.

The elevator ride felt endless. Her reflection in the mirrored walls showed a tense profile as she took steadying breaths.

"Miss Smith, the Vice President is waiting for you."

Grace Lee's professional smile only heightened Emily's unease.

The moment the office door closed behind her, the air grew suffocating.

William didn't look up from the documents he was processing, his long fingers moving swiftly across the keyboard.

"Your jacket."

She placed the bag at the edge of his desk.

"You washed it?"

"Dry cleaner."

The atmosphere turned glacial.

William leaned back in his chair, his dark eyes boring into her.

"May I return to work now?" Emily spoke first.

"Did I dismiss you?"

His voice was icy.

Emily lowered her gaze to her shoes. The office air conditioning was so cold it made her shiver.
###Chapter 155

Emily lowered her lashes, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse.

William's gaze darkened, the rhythm of his knuckles tapping the desk growing increasingly rapid. "Emily Smith, how many times have I warned you?" His voice was laced with ice. "You're getting better at attracting attention."

"I haven't," she said softly, yet every word was clear.

"Haven't?" He suddenly smirked, twirling a pen in his palm. "Daniel Chen visits your workstation daily. Michael Thompson texts you at midnight. And you call that nothing?"

"Daniel is my boyfriend." She lifted her head abruptly, a spark of defiance in her eyes. "Manager Thompson was just discussing work. In your eyes, is normal social interaction a crime?"

"Boyfriend?" William leaned forward abruptly, the scent of sandalwood mingling with danger. His fingers brushed the silver chain at her collarbone, his voice turning cold. "Already lining up your next option? Were you planning to leave all along?"

Emily's breath hitched.

The absurdity of the question almost made her laugh. She turned her face away, her tense profile reflected in the floor-to-ceiling window.

Silence thickened the air. Suddenly, William seized the necklace, the silver chain glinting sharply under the light.

"Daniel gave this to you?" His thumb traced the pendant.

It was a birthday gift from Mia. But she didn't bother explaining, pressing her lips together.

A crisp snap echoed.

As the necklace clattered into the trash bin, Emily reacted like a startled cat. She lunged for it, only to be intercepted by an iron grip. The world spun as her back hit the cold desk.

"William Johnson!" Her nails dug into his arm. "How dare you—"

"Because your father is still in prison." He pinned her wrists above her head with one hand, his breath hot against her ear. "Because your sister's medical bills still come from my account."

The words doused her like ice water. Her lashes trembled violently, all resistance freezing midair.

His kiss was punishing. Emily turned her face away, only for the back of her head to meet his waiting palm.

"I have... a boyfriend..." The fragmented protest was swallowed by their tangled breaths.

As silent tears slid into her hairline, she heard the sound of a pen rolling across the floor.
###Chapter 156

The salty taste of tears spread between her lips as William Johnson gradually slowed his movements before stopping completely.

When he released Emily Smith, her face was already streaked with tears.

Disheveled strands of hair clung to her forehead. The corners of her eyes were red, her nose slightly swollen, and her lips glistening with moisture. She looked like a shattered porcelain doll—beautiful in a way that made one's heart ache.

William took a step back, releasing his grip.

Emily opened her tear-filled eyes and gazed at him with crystalline clarity.

Adjusting her collar, her voice came out hoarse. "William Johnson, I'm a person. Not your plaything."

"If you don't want Professor Johnson to continue treating my sister, then this ends here." She lifted her chin, a faint smile curling at the corner of her lips. "Even a rabbit will bite when cornered."

With that, she turned and walked away, her retreating figure resolute.

William remained rooted in place, his knuckles turning white from how tightly he clenched his fists.

...

After that day, William never appeared in Emily's life again.

Her days became busy yet fulfilling. Royalties from Grasshopper Audiobook flowed in steadily, and her income from game dubbing was substantial. When her bank balance surpassed a million, she could hardly believe it was real.

That evening, Daniel Chen walked her home as usual.

"Goodnight," she said, about to step out of the car when his hand caught hers.

Daniel looked at her tenderly. "You haven't said goodnight to me yet."

"Goodnight, Daniel."

He leaned in, pressing a kiss toward her forehead. Just as their lips were about to meet, the sudden glare of high beams cut through the darkness.

Emily instinctively turned her face away.

"Goodnight," she murmured hastily, brushing a kiss against his cheek before fleeing the car.

Back in her apartment, she had just picked up her script to practice when her phone buzzed.

A voice call notification from George Taylor lit up the screen late at night.

Emily stared at it, her finger hovering over the answer button.
###Chapter 157

"Mr. Taylor, this is Emily Smith." Emily confirmed the identity after the call connected.

"Heh." George Taylor's low chuckle came through the phone. "I know it's you. You didn't dial wrong."

Emily pressed her lips together.

"Sounds like you're still awake?" George got straight to the point. "Can you come to The Royal Club?"

The mention of The Royal Club made her fingers tremble slightly.

She remembered how Susan Miller had looked out for her when she worked there. She'd always wanted to thank her but never found the right moment.

"What's the matter?" she asked cautiously.

A brief silence followed on the other end. "William's drunk. He's insisting on seeing you."

Emily's expression instantly turned cold. "Sorry, we're long over. I have a boyfriend now."

"Oh?" George chuckled. "But you're still a BestTech employee. Piss off the boss, and you and your colleagues—"

"Do all rich people act this unreasonable?" Emily cut him off.

"Ha!" George laughed outright. "Plenty are worse than us."

"It'll take me an hour to get there." She deliberately dragged out the time.

"We'll wait." His tone was firm. "If you don't come, he won't leave."

After hanging up, Emily took out the new TF lipstick set from her closet. It was originally meant as a birthday gift for her colleague Lily White, but she changed her mind.

Forty minutes later, the car stopped at the entrance of The Royal Club.

Under the neon lights, Jinzhou's most luxurious entertainment venue still glittered extravagantly. Emily took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

"Emily?" The security guard at the entrance widened his eyes. "Almost didn't recognize you!"

It was true—the current Emily was completely transformed. After brief pleasantries, the guard let her through without question.

Inside, the lighting was dim. Emily navigated effortlessly to where Susan was reprimanding someone.

"Newbies don't know the rules!" Susan's voice was as loud as ever.

Emily stood nearby, her lips curling involuntarily.

"And who might this lady be—" Susan turned, then her eyes bulged. "Emily?!"

"Susan." Emily smiled and nodded.

"Oh my god!" Susan rushed over and hugged her tightly. "Did you take some magic potion? I barely recognized you!"

Emily returned the embrace. "Still as sweet-tongued as ever, Susan."

"I mean every word!" Susan released her, looking her up and down. "Look at this poise. Nothing like that hardworking student from back then."

Indeed, the current Emily carried herself with quiet confidence. Though her clothes weren't expensive, they suited her perfectly.

"Come, let's chat in my office." Susan took her hand. "I want a proper look at you."

Emily retrieved the lipstick set from her bag. "Susan, this is for you."

"Oh, I couldn't—" Susan protested verbally, but her eyes sparkled.

"You took such good care of me back then." Emily said sincerely.

As they spoke, a waiter hurried over. "Manager Miller, the guests in VIP888 are causing trouble again."

Emily's heart skipped a beat—that was the room number George had given her.
###Chapter 158

Emily Smith handed the carefully prepared gift to Susan Miller, who waved her hands in refusal.

"If you don't accept it, I won’t dare come back," Emily said with mock seriousness.

Unable to resist, Susan finally took the limited-edition lipstick and teased, "You didn’t come all this way in the middle of the night just to give me a gift, did you?"

"My boss is drunk," Emily replied with a faint smile.

Susan raised an eyebrow suggestively. "Oh? Your boss?"

"He really is just my boss," Emily emphasized.

As they spoke, someone came to fetch Susan for work matters. Politely declining company, Emily headed alone to the fifth-floor VIP private room.

Just as she reached the door, it suddenly swung open from inside.

"Right on time," George Taylor said, stepping out with his phone in hand. His eyes brightened when he saw Emily.

Inside the room, William Johnson’s lashes fluttered slightly as he rested with his eyes closed.

"Mr. Taylor," Emily greeted with a polite nod.

Ethan Zheng and another man warmly ushered her inside. Five hostesses sat far in the corner, keeping their distance from William.

"No idea what got into him today—drank like there’s no tomorrow," George said, draping an arm over Emily’s shoulder and guiding her toward William.

Emily eyed the man sprawled on the couch and said bluntly, "Help me lift him."

At 6'2", William was too much for her petite frame. George cheerfully obliged, and together they hauled him into the elevator.

The moment the doors closed, William slumped heavily against Emily. By the time they reached the first floor, she was nearly crushed under his weight.

"Switch sides," she gritted out.

George shot a knowing glance at the "completely wasted" man but cooperatively swapped positions. Yet within a few steps, William’s full weight shifted back onto Emily.

Rolling her eyes internally, she stubbornly dragged him out of the club.

"Where’s his car?" she asked.

"Sam’s handling something," George answered quickly before flagging down a taxi.

The second he let go, William toppled onto Emily. She staggered, nearly falling, but suddenly felt a steadying grip at her waist.

When she looked up, William remained "drunkenly" slumped against her, his scorching breath brushing the top of her head.

The taxi pulled up, and George unceremoniously shoved them into the backseat. William promptly rested his head on her shoulder as Emily stared resignedly at the neon lights flashing past outside.

George waved from the curb. "Call if you need anything!"

The window reflected Emily’s utterly defeated expression.
###Chapter 159

"Miss, where to?" The driver studied Emily Smith through the rearview mirror.

Her fingers curled slightly as she gave the hotel name: "Four Seasons."

She couldn't return to her apartment, and Jinzhou Bay was out of the question. The Four Seasons was close to Sky City—perfect.

"Got it." The driver stepped on the gas.

Emily scooted closer to the door, nudging the heavy head resting on her shoulder.

She was already pressed against the door with nowhere left to retreat.

Each time she pushed him away, the head would slump back onto her. After several attempts, she realized he was faking it.

Her phone screen lit up as she began booking a room.

In the rearview mirror, the driver's gaze lingered on her neckline.

When they reached a red light, the driver stole another glance—only to meet eyes colder than ice.

He shuddered and kept his eyes forward after that.

Emily booked the cheapest room available. Sixteen hundred—half her monthly food budget.

As she put her phone away, the man beside her remained motionless, eyes closed. She turned to watch the neon lights blur past the window.

"We're here."

While scanning the payment QR code, the bellhop opened the rear door. She asked for help with the drunk man.

At the front desk, William Johnson draped himself over her. When staff tried to assist, he only leaned harder into Emily.

By the time they reached the room, her back was drenched in sweat.

The moment she thanked the staff and closed the door, an arm locked around her waist.

The world spun as she tumbled onto the soft mattress.

"William!"

Gasping like a fish out of water, she struggled. Her pushing hands were easily pinned as scorching breath burned her ear.

"You bastard... You told me to leave..."

Her tearful protests and weak punches gradually faded.

"I have a boyfriend... We're getting married..."

Tears weighed down her lashes until they finally closed.

When her breathing steadied in sleep, the man above her opened his eyes—

Not a trace of drunkenness remained.

He propped himself up, fingertips brushing her tear-stained cheeks. His gaze softened as if beholding fragile treasure.
###Chapter 160

The persistent vibration of a phone buzzed near her ear.

Emily Smith stirred awake as sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains. Groggily, she reached for the source of the sound, her fingers brushing against the cool metal casing.

"William..."

The name slipped out instinctively before she jolted fully awake.

The screen displayed the words "Sweetheart" in bold letters. This wasn’t her phone.

Behind her, steady breaths warmed the back of her neck. Memories of last night flooded back, and she turned her head stiffly.

The sharp line of a man’s jaw was inches away.

"William? Where are you? Why aren’t you saying anything?" Amanda Lin’s gentle voice floated from the speaker.

Emily fumbled to end the call, tossing the phone onto the bed like it was scalding. She threw off the covers to check herself—her shirt and jeans were still perfectly intact.

William Johnson slept soundly beside her, his shirt buttoned all the way to the top. Carefully, she lifted the edge of the blanket to confirm his pants were also neatly in place before exhaling in relief.

Grabbing her bag from the couch, she cast one last glance at his handsome, sleeping face before bolting out of the room without looking back.

The moment the door clicked shut, William opened his eyes.

There wasn’t a trace of drunken haze in his sharp gaze. His phone vibrated again on the nightstand. He glanced at the caller ID and headed straight for the bathroom.

Meanwhile, Emily jogged back toward her apartment. Her phone rang from inside her bag—Daniel Chen was calling.

"Daniel." She answered, still slightly breathless.

"I’m downstairs," his voice came through the line. "We agreed to meet at the studio at ten."

Emily paused mid-step. "Sorry, I overslept. I might need a little more time."

Silence stretched on the other end. The sound of a car horn made her realize Daniel might already be nearby.

"You’re outside?" he asked.

Emily tightened her grip on the phone. "I... just went out to grab breakfast."

Across the street, she spotted his familiar car. Behind the window, Daniel’s thoughtful gaze met hers. There wasn’t a breakfast shop in sight.

"No rush," he said, his voice softening. "I’ll wait for you at the gate."

"Should I bring you something?"

"No need."

After hanging up, Emily quickened her pace. She didn’t notice the black sedan trailing behind her—or how Daniel’s eyes lingered on her before shifting to the gilded sign of the Four Seasons Hotel.
###Chapter 161

Emily Smith hurried back to Mia Harris's apartment at a jog.

She rushed into the bathroom, her fingertips still trembling slightly as the hot water cascaded over her body.

After hastily drying her hair, she grabbed a dress and slipped it on, not even bothering with makeup before bolting out the door.

In the elevator, she touched up her lipstick against the metallic wall.

The mirror reflected her slightly pale face.

The familiar black car was parked outside the apartment.

Daniel Chen sat in the driver's seat, the window halfway down, his gaze distant.

As Emily approached, she noticed his slender fingers absently tapping the steering wheel.

"Daniel."

She called his name twice before he seemed to snap out of his thoughts and turned to her.

A gentle smile curved his lips, but there was something unreadable flickering in his eyes.

"You seem distracted today," Emily remarked casually as she fastened her seatbelt.

Daniel started the car with a light chuckle. "Pulled an all-nighter revising a proposal. Just a bit out of it."

He paused. "Don't make me wait so long next time."

Emily's heart skipped a beat. She had left ten minutes early.

As they drove past the Four Seasons Hotel, both of them instinctively glanced at the opulent building.

Emily's nails dug into her palm—she saw William Johnson stepping out of the revolving doors, his tall frame accentuated by the black suit.

At the same moment, Daniel spotted him too.

His grip on the steering wheel tightened abruptly, his knuckles turning white.

"Watch out!"

A sharp honk shattered the morning quiet.

Emily's startled cry was cut short as the car swerved violently, scraping against a white sedan in the next lane with a screech.

"Are you okay?" Daniel immediately turned to check on her.

Emily shook her head, but she noticed the fine beads of sweat forming at his temples.

This wasn't the composed Daniel she knew—the ever-unflappable senior.

The other driver stormed over angrily.

Daniel efficiently handled the insurance details before flagging down a taxi for her.

"Go ahead to the recording studio," he said, opening the door for her, his voice uncharacteristically tender. "Meet me at the usual spot for lunch."

Emily hesitated, wanting to say more.

In the rearview mirror, Daniel stood watching her leave, his figure growing smaller until it disappeared around the corner.

She clutched her bag strap tightly.

Inside was the hotel keycard she hadn't had the chance to return.
###Chapter 162

Emily Smith's taxi disappeared into the traffic. Only then did Daniel Chen turn to face the middle-aged man.

"Sir, let's discuss the compensation," he began, but the man cut him off rudely.

"Cut the crap! Ten thousand to settle this privately. I'm in a hurry."

Daniel glanced at the dented rear of the ordinary Volkswagen, his brow furrowing slightly. The repair wouldn't cost more than a thousand.

"I suggest taking the car to an authorized dealership. I'll cover all repair costs," he said politely.

The man scoffed. "What about my losses while the car's in the shop?"

"The damage isn't severe. The dealership can fix it in a day," Daniel replied calmly.

"Bullshit!" The man raised his voice sharply. "Think you're special just because you drive an Audi? Pay up now, or you're not leaving!"

"Mr. Chen, need some help?"

A deep male voice suddenly interrupted. The window of a black Rolls-Royce rolled down, revealing William Johnson's sharply defined face.

The air froze instantly.

Daniel's expression darkened, while the middle-aged man's eyes widened. "V-Vice President Johnson?"

"Unnecessary," Daniel refused coldly, turning back to the man. "Two thousand. Take it or we go through insurance."

"Two thousand is fair," William added lightly from inside the car.

Sweat beaded on the man's forehead as he snatched the money and fled in panic.

Daniel turned to leave, but William's voice carried a meaningful tone. "How are things between you and Emily?"

He whirled around, his knuckles turning white.

"Mr. Johnson, remember that Emily is my girlfriend now," he bit out, each word dripping with tension.

William lounged lazily against the leather seat, a playful smirk curling his lips. "Yet she came to my hotel room willingly last night."

The window rolled up as the Rolls-Royce sped away.

Daniel stood rooted to the spot, his nails digging into his palms. The luxury car's taillights blurred in his vision, leaving a gaping hole in his chest.

Through the rearview mirror, Sam Wilson caught sight of his boss's triumphant smirk and sighed inwardly—since when had Vice President Johnson resorted to such childish games?
###Chapter 163

Daniel Chen's car repair plans left Emily Smith alone at lunch. During her break, she wandered to the mall across from the office.

She picked out a navy blue suit for Daniel, pairing it with two white dress shirts and a subtly patterned tie. As a host, he always needed polished attire.

Since they started dating, Daniel had insisted on paying for everything and never missed picking her up. This was her way of returning his kindness.

Passing the jewelry counter, she selected a delicate collarbone chain for Lily White, whose birthday was next week.

At seven in the evening, Daniel arrived punctually outside the recording studio. When he took the gift bag, Emily caught a fleeting shadow in his eyes.

"Don't you like the clothes?" she asked softly.

Daniel shook his head and squeezed her hand. "I love them."

"Work trouble?"

He forced a smile. "It's handled."

On the drive back, Emily deliberately shared funny stories from the studio. Watching her try so hard to cheer him up, Daniel's tense brow gradually relaxed.

After dinner, they visited her sister at the hospital. By the time they returned to Sky City, it was late. In the elevator, Daniel suddenly said, "I have a surprise for you."

"Can't you tell me now?" Emily blinked, tugging his sleeve.

Under the streetlights, he gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "You'll see tomorrow morning."

The next day, the doorbell interrupted Emily as she brushed her hair. Peering through the peephole, she saw Daniel holding a steaming breakfast tray.

"You didn't..." She stared at the golden fried eggs and fresh soy milk.

"I moved into 2803," he said, stepping inside with a smile. "Now we're neighbors—just one floor apart."

Emily's eyes suddenly stung. "You didn't have to..."

Daniel set the tray down and cupped her face. "I want to make you breakfast every day." He rested his forehead against hers. "Now tell me—do you like me?"

"Yes," she answered without hesitation.

Her response dissolved the doubts Daniel had carried since yesterday. He knew Emily. And he trusted his choice.
###Chapter 164
On Monday morning, Emily Smith was buried in paperwork when Lily White suddenly sidled up to her with a conspiratorial air.

"Emily, look!" She waved her phone excitedly. "Vice President Johnson's wedding photos just leaked! They look like a poster for a romantic drama!"

The image of William Johnson and Amanda Lin gazing at each other made Emily's fingers tremble. She forced a smile.

"They do make a handsome couple," she heard herself say calmly.

Lily lowered her voice. "Rumor has it the Lins originally tried to match Amanda with Alexander Johnson, but the Johnsons refused. Who knew Vice President Johnson would—"

"I'm not interested in office gossip," Emily interrupted, her fingers tapping absently on the keyboard.

"Oh come on, I'm just curious." Lily persisted. "Did you see how lavish Sophia Song and Alexander's engagement party was? Compared to that—"

"Lily," Emily looked up suddenly. "Why do you think he chose her?"

"True love, obviously!" Lily declared. "With BestTech's current standing, he could've picked someone from an equally prominent family—"

"Good morning, Vice President Johnson!"

The sudden chorus of greetings silenced them. Emily looked up to meet William's inscrutable gaze.

His long fingers tapped her desk. "Gossiping during work hours?"

Lily turned pale. But Emily stood slowly, her professional smile flawless. "We were discussing corporate culture. Your exemplary commitment to monogamy is something all employees should learn from."

William's eyes darkened. He glanced at his wedding photo on Lily's phone and gave a cold laugh.

"Miss Smith seems particularly interested in my personal life?"

The office fell silent. Emily felt dozens of eyes boring into her back.

"As employees, we naturally wish our leaders happiness," she replied smoothly. "Congratulations on your marriage."

Michael Thompson rushed over to defuse the tension, but William raised a hand to stop him. He leaned close to Emily's ear, his voice barely audible:

"Stay late tonight. I expect an explanation."

Emily clenched her pen. Ink bled across the document like the wound in her heart that refused to heal.
###Chapter 165

"Emily Smith, you certainly have a sharp tongue."

His dark gaze pinned her in place, each word gritted through clenched teeth. "Good. Keep it up."

With that, his expression stormy, he turned and strode away.

The others exchanged bewildered glances.

In the entire office, only Emily and Michael Thompson seemed unfazed—everyone else looked utterly lost.

During lunch break, Michael discreetly pulled Emily aside.

"You're still young, Emily. You have a long road ahead." His tone was fatherly. "Sometimes, you need to learn to bend—especially around those more powerful than you."

Emily nodded obediently. "Thank you for the advice, boss. I understand."

"Understand?" Michael frowned. "Then why did you act like that earlier—"

"I was just trying to please Vice President Johnson," she said, blinking innocently.

Please him?!

Michael's lips twitched. "I think you nearly gave him a heart attack instead."

"Did I?" She tilted her head, feigning cluelessness.

Michael sighed, rubbing his temples.

———

Late the next night, Emily stepped out of the subway station to a torrential downpour.

It had been clear when she boarded the train.

Almost eleven now. Daniel Chen was working overtime and couldn’t pick her up. She hadn’t brought an umbrella.

Even if she had, it wouldn’t have stood a chance against this storm.

The streets were nearly empty. The occasional taxi that passed was already occupied.

She tried hailing a ride, but the app showed over twenty people ahead of her—at least a thirty-minute wait.

Her apartment was only a ten-minute walk from the station.

Running would be faster.

She’d shower as soon as she got home—no risk of catching a cold.

Taking a deep breath, Emily hoisted her waterproof bag over her head and dashed into the rain.

She’d barely gone a few steps when a car horn blared behind her.

A sleek black luxury sedan pulled up ahead.

The window rolled down, revealing a familiar face.

"Get in."

William Johnson’s voice cut through the downpour.

Emily glanced at him—then kept running.

But before she could take three more steps, a strong hand seized her arm.

"Ah—!"

She stumbled backward, colliding with a solid chest.

The next second, she was shoved into the car.

"William—!"

She struggled, but he was already sliding in beside her, slamming the door shut.

"Drive," he ordered coldly.

"William Johnson, have you lost your mind?" Emily glared at him. "Even if I’m your employee, you can’t just—"

"Kidnap you?" His eyes darkened as he gripped her chin. "Emily Smith, you’re getting bolder."

Yesterday’s anger still simmered in him.

The fury in his chest burned hotter.

Emily realized her own temper had grown shorter too.

She needed to ask him for a favor—she should back down.

But right now, she couldn’t rein in her rage.

She turned her face away, refusing to look at him.

"What were you trying to say yesterday in the Business Department?" His irritation flared at her silence. "No one’s here now. Spit it out."

What was she trying to say?

Emily almost laughed.

The anger inside her suddenly dissolved.
###Chapter 166

Emily turned her face away, her gaze icy as she looked at William. "You're getting married. Why won't you let me go?"

"What's wrong? Are you unhappy about my marriage?" The darkness in William's eyes lightened slightly.

Emily let out a bitter laugh. "Whether I'm happy or not has nothing to do with you, Vice President Johnson. You get married, I date who I want. We're long over. Stop using your position to pressure me. You know I have no choice but to beg you."

William raised a brow. "Then beg."

Emily stared at him, disgusted by his shamelessness.

"Fine. I'm begging you." She took a deep breath. "Let me go. Pretend you don't know me. Treat me like roadside weeds you ignore. Is that okay?"

William suddenly smiled. "Do you really like Daniel Chen that much?"

"Yes, I like him." Emily didn't hesitate. "He's my boyfriend. Why wouldn't I?"

"Break up with him." His voice was cold, leaving no room for argument.

Emily frowned. "What?"

"Break up with Daniel Chen. Call him right now." William's eyes darkened as he spoke each word with command.

Emily couldn't believe her ears.

This was absurd!

"William, who I date is none of your business!" She laughed in frustration.

"Will you do it or not?" His grip on her chin tightened painfully.

Emily winced but met his gaze defiantly.

"I won't break up with him. Not even if you kill me." She fired back, enunciating every word.

"Emily!" William narrowed his eyes, his other hand gripping the back of her head as he pulled her close and crushed his lips against hers.

"Mmph—"

Emily struggled desperately.

The car entered the underground garage of Jinzhou Bay No. 1 and came to a smooth stop. The commotion in the backseat was too obvious—Sam tactfully stepped out of the vehicle.

Nearby, Amanda's car pulled up and parked beside them.

She got out and glanced at Sam before shifting her gaze to the backseat. Despite the soundproofing, faint noises could still be heard in the silent garage.

Amanda walked toward the car.

"Miss Lin." Sam blocked her path.

"Is William not in the car?" Amanda asked with a polite smile, her expression unreadable.

As an illegitimate daughter brought back to the Lin family, she'd known since childhood that she was merely a tool for alliances. If she couldn't marry Alexander, William was the next best option. What her future husband did outside marriage meant nothing to her.

"The boss had some business. He asked me to return first," Sam replied, lowering his head.

"Is that so?" Amanda's gaze lingered meaningfully on the still-shaking backseat.

"Miss Lin, you should go upstairs and rest." Sam gestured politely.

Amanda arched a brow. She had no intention of humiliating herself.

"Fine."

In the end, she turned and left.
###Chapter 167

Emily had barely taken two steps when the sound of a car door slamming open echoed behind her.

She whirled around to see William Johnson stumbling out of the vehicle. The girl was drenched, her collar torn, lips swollen and bleeding.

Emily's pupils constricted sharply.

William steadied herself, only then noticing Emily standing just a few feet away. She opened her mouth but said nothing, turning to leave instead.

As they brushed past each other, Emily suddenly raised her hand.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the strike reverberated through the empty garage.

Before William could react, a second slap landed on her cheek. The searing pain made her vision blur.

"You bitch!" Emily hissed through gritted teeth, raising her hand for a third strike—only for a strong, bony hand to clamp around her wrist.

"Enough."

William Johnson's voice was icy. He was soaked, water dripping from his disheveled hair, a fresh bite mark visible on his lip.

Emily stared at him in disbelief. "You're protecting her?"

William wiped the blood from his lip with his thumb and chuckled darkly. "Just a plaything." He released Emily's wrist and instead pulled her close by the waist. "I was worried you'd hurt your hand."

William swayed slightly on her feet.

She turned slowly, her gaze sweeping over the two of them locked in an embrace, then walked away without looking back.

Emily watched her retreating figure, an inexplicable sense of defeat creeping over her.

"William," she softened her voice, "promise me you won't see her again, okay?"

William guided her toward the elevator. "Did you see anything you liked at the show today?"

"Plenty," Emily smoothly changed the subject. "Should I have my assistant send you the pictures?"

"No need." William pressed the elevator button. "Buy them all."

In the pouring rain, William hailed a taxi.

Back in her apartment, she sank into the bathtub. The hot water rose past her chest, but it couldn't dispel the bone-deep chill.

The word plaything cut into her heart like a knife.

She should have known. Those three months of tenderness had been nothing but a transaction—yet she'd foolishly believed it was real.

The water grew cold. William dried herself and examined the marks on her face in the mirror.

The girl staring back at her had hollow eyes.

Suddenly, she raised her hand and slapped herself hard across the face.

"Wake up," she told the mirror.
###Chapter 168

Emily Smith took a deep breath, pushing down all the negative emotions.

She stood before the bathroom mirror, her cool fingertips lightly touching her swollen cheek. The sound of ginger tea bubbling came from the kitchen, steam curling in the air as she poured herself a full bowl.

"Why should I ruin myself for someone who doesn't deserve it?" she said to her reflection.

Before bed, she applied another layer of ointment. By morning, the redness had faded significantly. She carefully applied makeup, perfectly concealing the last traces.

The doorbell suddenly rang.

"Daniel?" She opened the door to find Daniel Chen standing there with breakfast. "Didn't you work late last night?"

He smiled as he stepped inside. "Watching you eat my cooking makes me happier than sleeping in."

Emily couldn't argue and obediently sat down. Daniel watched her sip the porridge, his eyes filled with tenderness.

"By the way," he suddenly said, "my parents know about us. They want to meet you."

Her spoon nearly dropped into the bowl. "They... came specifically to see me?"

"My dad's here for business, and my mom tagged along." Daniel took her hand. "Don't worry, they're very easygoing."

Emily nodded, already mentally planning her outfit for the meeting.

......

On Saturday morning, Emily was jolted awake by her phone vibrating. A message from Daniel: Parents are in Jinzhou. Dinner tonight?

She sat bolt upright, all sleepiness gone.

"That's too soon..." she murmured.

From the next room came the sound of Mia's snoring. Emily tiptoed into her best friend's bed and yanked the blanket off.

"Mia! Help!"

"It's so early..." Mia groaned sleepily. "You're meeting the parents, not me..."

"Come shopping with me! Now! Right now!"

With a dramatic wail, Mia was dragged out of bed by Emily.

At the mall, Emily was overwhelmed by choices. She finally settled on a high-quality inkstone for Daniel's father and a silk scarf for his mother.

"Are you really this nervous?" Mia sipped her milk tea. "Daniel already said his parents are easygoing."

Emily didn't respond, picking up another dress to examine.

By evening, Emily stood before the full-length mirror. White cropped pants hugged her slender waist, while the chiffon blouse with a bow at the front made her look effortlessly elegant. A light Chanel-style jacket draped over her arm, and a delicate smile pendant necklace rested just above her collarbone.

"Oh my god..." Mia dramatically clutched her chest. "If I were a guy, I'd pounce on you right now."

She pretended to lunge, but Emily dodged with a laugh.

"Stop it! You'll ruin my makeup!"

The doorbell rang as Emily was fixing her hair. Daniel stood at the entrance, freezing the moment his eyes landed on her.

"Hey!" Mia waved a hand in front of his face. "Snap out of it!"

Daniel blinked, his ears turning slightly red.
###Chapter 169

"Emily, you're so breathtaking today I can't look away." Daniel Chen gazed at her with burning intensity, admiration dripping from his voice. "My parents will be completely charmed by you."

Mia Harris leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, deliberately putting on a stern face. "What, isn't our Emily beautiful every day?"

Daniel immediately flustered. The confident host who could captivate thousands on stage now stumbled over his words. "N-no, Emily is always as lovely as a painting. But today, she's especially radiant."

Only then did Mia curl her lips in satisfaction.

Emily Smith felt her ears grow hot under his scorching gaze. "We should get going," she murmured softly.

Daniel naturally took her hand, and after saying goodbye to Mia, they left together.

She carried a light-colored Lady Dior bag that perfectly complemented her makeup and outfit. Mia had insisted she take it, saying it was a shame to let such a beautiful bag gather dust in the closet.

In the elevator, Daniel took the gift bag from her hand, his brow furrowing slightly. "I told you not to bring anything."

"It's our first meeting. I wanted to show my sincerity." Emily blinked at him playfully.

"You're amazing. They're going to adore you." He gave her palm a reassuring squeeze.

The Golden Pavilion was Jinzhou's most renowned fine-dining restaurant, elegantly decorated with an air of sophistication. Emily's calm composure wavered the moment they stepped inside.

"Don't be nervous," Daniel whispered close to her ear, his warm breath brushing her lobe. "My parents are very easygoing."

Just then, William Johnson entered the restaurant, guided by a server. His gaze landed on the intimate pair ahead, and his eyes darkened instantly. His steps faltered unconsciously.

At the private room's entrance, the server knocked lightly before opening the door. Mr. and Mrs. Chen were deep in conversation but looked up at the sound. The moment they saw Emily, surprise flickered in their eyes.

"Dad, Mom." Daniel led Emily inside, their hands still entwined.

"Mr. and Mrs. Chen, I'm Emily Smith." She greeted them gracefully, her voice steady despite the drumming of her heart.

Mr. Chen studied her discreetly before giving a slight nod. "Have a seat."

Mrs. Chen, however, stepped forward eagerly, taking Emily's hands to examine her up and down. "Daniel has excellent taste. Such a lovely girl."

"Mom, when have I ever let you down?" Daniel smirked proudly.

"Yes, yes, you're the best." Mrs. Chen shot her son a mock-scolding glance.

"Mrs. Chen, you have such elegance. I'd love to learn from you." Emily smiled gently.

The atmosphere remained warm throughout the meal—until Mrs. Chen suddenly excused herself. "Emily, would you accompany me to the restroom?"

"Of course." Emily agreed readily.

The moment they stepped out of the private room, Mrs. Chen's smile vanished. She abruptly released Emily's hand.

Emily froze, staring at the sudden coldness in Mrs. Chen's expression. A heavy weight dropped in her chest.
###Chapter 170

Emily's hand was abruptly shaken off. She stood frozen in place.

Mrs. Chen strode toward the rooftop garden without looking back, her silhouette radiating finality.

Wasn't she going to the restroom?

Emily stared at the completely opposite direction, unease pooling in her chest. She quickened her pace, her heels clicking urgently against the marble floor.

The glass door slid shut silently behind her.

In the garden, Mrs. Chen stood with her back turned, facing the railing.

"Auntie, did you need—"

Slap!

A stack of papers struck her face with force.

Emily didn't flinch. The sheets grazed her cheek before fluttering to the ground.

"Look at what you really are!" Mrs. Chen whirled around, her mask of kindness now torn to shreds. Her eyes burned with disgust. "How dare you cling to my son?"

Emily's lashes trembled.

"Earlier—"

"An act," Mrs. Chen sneered. "Just the fact that your father is a murderer is enough to ruin our entire family!"

Emily's fists clenched.

"Playing innocent?" Mrs. Chen's gaze swept over her necklace and bag. "Didn’t my son buy all this for you? And your comatose sister’s medical bills—was Daniel supposed to foot those too?"

The garden breeze turned bitingly cold.

"The necklace was—"

"Shut up!" Mrs. Chen cut her off sharply. "Did your sugar daddy toss you aside, so now you’re targeting Daniel?"

Emily's face drained of color.

"Fifty thousand." A bank card was flung at her face. "Take the money and disappear. If you dare bother Daniel again—" Mrs. Chen leaned in, her voice a venomous whisper. "I’ll make sure you can’t stay in Jinzhou."

The sound of heels faded into the distance.

Emily remained motionless. The bank card lay on the ground, its surface reflecting a harsh glare.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt no pain.
###Chapter 171

The number stabbed into Emily Smith's heart like a sharp blade.

Half a million.

The exact same amount William Johnson had given her before.

How did Mrs. Chen know about this?

Her fingers clenched, nails digging into her palms, but she felt no pain.

William's icy voice suddenly echoed in her ears—

"You're just a tool for my pleasure."

Her heart contracted violently. A chill crawled up from her feet, making her tremble uncontrollably.

The world spun around her. She slowly crouched down, hugging her knees, curling into a tight ball.

Tears fell silently onto the ground.

Not far away, Alexander Johnson ended his call and glanced at the trembling figure in the corner.

He narrowed his eyes and sauntered toward her.

"Need help?" he asked with feigned courtesy.

Emily jerked her head up, meeting a pair of lust-filled eyes.

Alexander!

Her pupils shrank. She scrambled to her feet to escape, but he yanked her wrist.

"Running away?" He pulled hard, sending her stumbling into his arms.

Pinning her against the railing, he traced her cheek with his fingers. "Crying so pitifully. Who hurt you? Tell me, and I'll make them pay."

Emily leaned back desperately, voice shaking. "Mr. Johnson, my friend is waiting for me..."

"Friend?" Alexander chuckled, thumb stroking her chin. "Let them wait."

He leaned closer, breath hot against her ear. "Kiss me, and I'll let you go."

Emily pressed her hands against his chest, shaking her head. "No..."

"Scared?" He gripped her chin. "I won't bite."

His face inched closer. Emily shut her eyes in despair.

Suddenly—

Thud!

Alexander was yanked away and slammed onto the floor.

Emily opened her eyes to a familiar face.

William stood before her, fury blazing in his eyes.
###Chapter 172

Alexander Johnson staggered back from the sudden punch, nearly losing his balance before crashing to the ground.

William Johnson reacted swiftly, pulling Emily Smith back from the railing where she had been dangerously leaning. He wrapped his arms protectively around her.

"Who the hell dares to hit me?!" Alexander roared, scrambling to his feet. Without even seeing his attacker, he swung a wild punch.

William seemed to sense the blow coming. Still holding Emily, he pivoted smoothly, dodging the strike with ease.

Alexander's momentum carried him forward, sending him stumbling toward the railing. He barely caught himself before toppling over.

"Brother, Father and Chairman Song are waiting for you," William said, his lips curving into a cold smile. "Are you sure you want to waste time here?"

Today was supposed to be about finalizing Alexander and Sophia Song's wedding plans. Yet here he was, harassing Emily.

Recognition flashed in Alexander's eyes as he finally saw William. Wiping blood from his lip, he straightened his suit with deliberate calm.

"Dear brother, isn't your wedding with Amanda Lin coming up soon?" His gaze slid meaningfully to Emily. "And yet you still have time to meddle in other people's business?"

"Likewise," William replied icily. "No need to concern yourself with my affairs."

Emily remained stiff in William's embrace, disgust churning inside her. But she knew pushing him away now would only embolden Alexander further.

Watching these brothers clash over her, she felt nothing but bitter amusement.

This was the so-called bond between wealthy heirs.

Alexander's lingering stare sent a chill down her spine.

"If you like her that much, I'll let you have her for now," he sneered. "Just let me know when you're done playing."

Emily shuddered. Only when Alexander disappeared from sight did she finally exhale.

"Are you hurt?" William asked softly, his hands gently checking her for injuries.

Emily shoved him away and slapped him hard across the face.

The sharp crack echoed through the garden.

Both froze in shock.

"William Johnson, I'm begging you—just leave me alone!" Her eyes burned with unshed tears. "I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life."

Without another word, she turned and ran, leaving her purse behind as she fled the restaurant.

Daniel Chen had been waiting for her return. When she didn't come back, he went searching.

At the corner, he caught a glimpse of Emily rushing out of the garden before vanishing into the night.

He started after her—then stopped.

Through the glass doors, he spotted William still standing in the garden.

Hesitating only a moment, Daniel chased after Emily instead.
###Chapter 173

William Johnson stood frozen, watching Emily Smith's retreating figure disappear around the corner. He lifted a hand to touch his stinging left cheek, fingertips brushing the heated skin.

That slap had been vicious.

His tongue pressed against the inside of his mouth. Just as he turned to leave, his gaze caught on scattered papers and a bank card on the ground. He bent to pick them up. The moment he unfolded the A4 sheet, his brows furrowed sharply.

The page was crammed with Emily's personal details:
Her father, imprisoned for fifteen years for financial crimes.
Her mother, who vanished after remarrying.
Her younger sister, now in a vegetative state due to autism.

The most glaring line was the last one—the words "kept woman" stabbed into his vision like a blade.

William clenched the paper, knuckles whitening. Who had given her this? Whose bank card was this? Who else had she met here?

Questions exploded in his mind. His expression darkened dangerously.

Daniel Chen rushed out of the restaurant just in time to see Emily's taxi speeding away. He stood there, chest heaving.

Inside the car, Emily's fingers trembled around her phone. She shouldn’t have run. She wasn’t the one in the wrong.

But then again, Daniel had always been so kind to her. A public scene would only humiliate him. A relationship without his parents’ blessing wouldn’t last.

If the Chen family despised her this much, maybe it was better to let go. The thought twisted her heart like an invisible fist.

What terrified her more was Alexander Johnson’s chilling glare. Would that madman come after her again?

Outside the restaurant, Daniel stared at the bustling street, his chest tight. Emily had left without a word—abandoning him and his parents.

He laughed bitterly. So, in her heart, she still couldn’t forget that cold-hearted William.

When he returned to the private room, his mother rushed to him. "Daniel, what happened?"

"She had an emergency." His voice was hoarse as he picked up Emily’s forgotten bag. "I’ll return this to her."

Mrs. Chen grabbed his arm. "Daniel, I think you should focus on your career right now—"

"I know." He cut her off and walked away without looking back.

Watching her son’s retreating figure, Mrs. Chen slammed her chopsticks down in frustration.
###Chapter 174

Emily Smith thought the apartment would be empty.

Mia Harris had clearly said she'd be home tonight.

The moment she pushed open the door, the smell of instant noodles hit her.

Mia sat at the dining table, the glow from her phone screen illuminating her face.

"Sweetie?" Mia slurped up a noodle and looked up. "Weren't you meeting Daniel Chen's parents?"

Emily bent down to change her shoes, her hair falling forward to hide her swollen eyes. "Finished early."

She hurried toward the kitchen. "Don't eat instant noodles. I'll make you something."

"Where's Daniel?" Mia craned her neck to peer toward the door.

"He went home." Emily opened the fridge, her voice slightly hoarse.

Mia suddenly dropped her chopsticks.

She rushed into the kitchen and cupped Emily's face.

"Holy shit!" Mia's eyes widened. "Who made you cry like this?"

Emily's defenses crumbled instantly.

She hugged Mia, her shoulders trembling slightly. "It's nothing... I just needed to cry..."

"Bullshit!" Mia pulled back. "Was it Daniel?"

Emily shook her head. "His parents... didn't really accept me."

"What did they say?" Mia's voice rose.

"Just... that we're not a good match." Emily downplayed it.

Mia narrowed her eyes. She knew Emily too well.

"That's it?" She scoffed. "You think I'm a child?"

Emily bit her lip. "His father's an official... and my dad..."

The doorbell suddenly rang.

Mia stormed to answer it.

Daniel stood outside, his expression dark.

"Where's Emily?"

"Didn't your family reject her?" Mia blocked the doorway. "Why are you here?"

Emily rushed over and covered Mia's mouth.

Daniel's gaze landed on Emily's red, swollen eyes. His pupils constricted.

"Why stop me?" Mia broke free. "If she's been wronged, she should say it!"

Emily's eyes welled up again.

In that moment, all her grievances were softened by her best friend's fierce protection.

She opened her mouth, but didn't know where to begin.
###Chapter 175

"Emily, did my mother say something to you?" Daniel Chen suddenly grabbed Emily Smith's wrist, his voice tense.

Emily froze at his abrupt action, then gently pulled her hand back and nodded.

"We need to talk." Daniel's brows furrowed deeply, his tone almost pleading.

Mia Harris scoffed beside them. "Go ahead. I'll be in my room." She shot Daniel a warning glare. "If you make Emily cry again, you'll regret it."

The living room fell silent with just the two of them. Emily poured Daniel a glass of water and sat across from him on the single sofa.

"Daniel, we—"

"What exactly did my mother tell you?"

They spoke at the same time, then both fell quiet.

Emily took a deep breath and met his gaze. "I don't think we're right for each other."

Daniel's expression froze. The glass in his hand trembled slightly. "What did you say?"

"Let's break up." Emily's voice was soft but clear.

Daniel stood abruptly, slamming the glass onto the coffee table. "Because of a few words from my mother?"

"Not just that." Emily lowered her lashes. "Your father's position is... complicated. Our relationship could become his weakness."

"That's not a problem!" He gripped her shoulders. "I can stay in Jinzhou. We can—"

"Daniel." Emily cut him off. "You know the rules of politics better than I do. One misstep could ruin everything your father has built."

His hands slowly loosened, his voice hoarse. "So you're giving up just like that?"

Emily shook her head. "It's not giving up. It's being rational."

"Rational?" Daniel let out a cold laugh. "Or is this about William Johnson?"

Emily's head snapped up, surprise flashing in her eyes.

"You've always had feelings for him, haven't you?" Daniel pressed closer, his voice sharp. "Were you just using me to forget him?"

Emily's face paled. She opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Daniel stared into her eyes, enunciating each word. "Tell me. Is that true?"

The air turned suffocating. Emily's fingers twisted together unconsciously, her knuckles turning white.

"Answer me!" Daniel raised his voice suddenly, the sharpness in it unlike anything she'd heard before.
###Chapter 176

Emily Smith snapped back to reality and shook her head hastily. "No, I'm not hung up on William Johnson. I don't love him. Since I chose to be with you, I wouldn't think about anyone else."

"Really?" Daniel Chen's piercing gaze bore into her.

"Absolutely." Emily met his eyes directly. "I swear, I haven't thought about William since being with you."

"Then why did you keep meeting him?" Daniel's voice suddenly rose. "Why did you lie to me?"

Emily froze.

"Can you honestly say you never lied?" Daniel pressed forward relentlessly.

She suddenly remembered something. "Are you talking about that time..."

"Yes, that time." Daniel laughed bitterly. "You spent the night with William at the Four Seasons Hotel. Why did you lie about it?"

He lowered his head in self-mockery. "No, the lie isn't even the main issue. The real question is—" He looked up sharply. "Why did you spend the night alone with him in a hotel after our breakup, when you were already my girlfriend?"

"Daniel..."

Emily took a deep breath. "I apologize. But nothing happened that night."

"William got drunk at The Royal Club. His friend called me to pick him up." She explained the entire incident. "I didn't want to go, but he's the VP of BestTech. I was worried it might affect my colleagues."

"Nothing at all happened?" Daniel stared at her intensely.

"I swear." Emily nodded. "After taking him to his room, I was exhausted and fell asleep. He was completely passed out—what could possibly happen?"

"And today at the restaurant," Daniel continued, "you saw him again?"

"Yes." Emily admitted frankly. "It must have been a coincidence. After talking with your mother, he happened to come to the rooftop garden."

"Then why did you leave without telling me?" Daniel pressed. "That's not like you."

Emily was silent for a moment. "Daniel, why don't you ask your mother? Ask her what she said to me. Ask her how she feels about us."

She looked up. "A relationship opposed by parents won't bring happiness. Your kindness toward me will eventually be worn down by these conflicts."

Finally, Daniel understood.

"Emily, I apologize for my mother." He stood up, his voice firm. "But I won't agree to a breakup. I'm an adult, and my feelings are my own decision."

He leaned down and took her hands. "Let me sort things out with my mother. Until then, don't overthink things, okay?"

Meeting his resolute gaze, Emily gave a slight nod.
###Chapter 177

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains. Emily Smith opened her eyes and stared blankly at the ceiling for a moment.

Her phone screen lit up with a message from Daniel Chen: "I'm waiting downstairs."

Her finger hovered over the screen before she finally replied with a single word: "Okay."

Inside the recording studio, Emily immersed herself in her work with complete focus. Daniel sat outside, watching her concentrated profile through the glass window.

"Cut!" the director called. "That's a wrap."

Emily removed her headphones and stepped out. Daniel immediately handed her a thermos. Her fingers trembled slightly as she took it, nearly spilling the water.

"Careful," he said, reaching out to steady her, but she subtly avoided his touch.

Silence hung like an invisible wall in the car on the way back. Daniel opened his mouth several times but ultimately only adjusted the air conditioning two degrees warmer.

Outside her apartment building, the night was deep.

"We're here," Daniel said, stopping the car and turning to look at her.

Emily unbuckled her seatbelt. Suddenly, he leaned toward her. Instinctively, she flinched back, her shoulders pressing against the car door.

Daniel froze, a flicker of pain flashing in his eyes before he forced a casual smile. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight," she murmured, quickly exiting the car without looking back as she headed for the elevator.

The moment the elevator doors closed, Daniel slammed his fist against the steering wheel. The sharp honk startled a night bird from the trees.

He pulled out his phone and dialed his mother.

"Mom, what exactly did you say to Emily yesterday?" His voice was icy.

The faint clink of a teacup came from the other end. "What could she have told you? Probably just some self-righteous nonsense."

"What's this about fifty thousand?" Daniel cut straight to the point.

His mother hesitated. "She told you? Seems she didn't mind taking the money after all."

"She never accepted it!" Daniel's voice rose sharply. "Mom, do you even know how much she earns in a month now?"

"How much could a voice actor possibly make?" His mother scoffed. "Daniel, don't be fooled by her. I looked into it—she's involved with William Johnson from BestTech—"

"Enough!" Daniel snapped. "I'm coming over."

Hanging up, he stared at the lit window of her apartment for a long moment before abruptly turning the car around.

Twenty minutes later, Daniel stood in the underground garage of Jinzhou Bay, dialing William Johnson's number.

"I'm downstairs."

A faint rustle of fabric came through the phone before William's deep, amused voice replied, "Interesting."

A sliver of light from the master bedroom cut across the floor. Amanda Lin emerged in a silk nightgown that accentuated her curves.

"Going out this late?" She leaned against the doorframe, her gaze lingering on the loose collar of William's robe.

William tightened the belt without turning. "Business to handle."

As the elevator doors closed, Amanda caught the dangerous curve of his lips.

The garage lights were harsh. Daniel stood by a pillar, shadows obscuring his expression.

Footsteps approached. William strode over in his robe, his collar revealing a glimpse of golden skin.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," he said lazily, stopping three paces away. "Surely you didn't come at this hour to discuss scripts, Director Chen?"

Daniel's fists clenched, veins bulging. "What exactly is your relationship with her?"

William arched a brow before letting out a low laugh. The sound echoed through the empty garage, slicing through the night like a blunt knife.
###Chapter 178

The elevator doors slid open at the basement level.

William Johnson stepped out lazily, draped in a silk robe. The cold garage lights accentuated the sharp contours of his profile, making him appear even more aloof and aristocratic.

Daniel Chen's car was parked right in front of the elevator. Through the windshield, he caught sight of William's disheveled state. His knuckles turned white as he flung the car door open and stormed out.

"William Johnson!" Daniel swung a fist straight at his face.

William tilted his head, narrowly avoiding the blow. The hem of his robe fluttered gracefully in the air. When the second punch came, he caught Daniel's wrist with precision.

"Such anger in the middle of the night?" William chuckled lowly, his eyes reflecting the harsh garage lights.

Daniel wrenched his hand free, chest heaving. "You know exactly what you did!"

"Oh?" William leisurely adjusted the sash of his robe. "Do enlighten me."

"Stop playing dumb!" Daniel sneered. "You dug up Emily's past and threw it in my mother's face. Couldn't stand seeing us happy, could you, Mr. Johnson?"

A flicker passed through William's gaze as he noticed a flash of red by the elevator. His lips curved. "Is that all?"

"You think this will tear us apart?" Daniel followed his line of sight and smirked when he saw Amanda Lin standing there. "Sorry to disappoint you."

Amanda lingered by the elevator, her silk nightgown clinging to her waist in the draft.

Before getting back into his car, Daniel deliberately raised his voice. "By the way, Emily spent the night at my place yesterday—thanks to you, Mr. Johnson."

The engine roared as William turned away expressionlessly. When he passed Amanda, she reached for his arm, but he subtly evaded her touch.

"William..." Amanda hurried after him into the elevator.

As the metal doors closed, William pressed the button for the penthouse. "Don’t you have anything better to do?"

Her manicured fingers trailed over his chest. "Jealous?"

The Monday morning meeting had just ended when Emily Smith walked out of the conference room, files in hand. Grace Lee approached in stiletto heels, drawing sharp intakes of breath from those nearby.

"Miss Smith." Grace offered a professional smile. "The Vice President requests your presence upstairs immediately."

The weight of curious stares prickled Emily's back. She tightened her grip on the folder. "Did he say why?"

"How would I know the Vice President's business?" Grace stepped aside, gesturing toward the elevator. "This way, please."

The elevator ascended straight to the top floor. When the frosted glass door of the Vice President's office closed behind her, Emily heard the soft creak of a leather chair turning.

Silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows, William twirled a pen between his fingers, its metallic glint cold and sharp.

"Come here." His voice gave nothing away.
###Chapter 179

Sunlight outlined William Johnson's tall figure by the floor-to-ceiling window, casting a golden halo around him. His fluent American English echoed through the spacious office as he spoke into the phone.

Emily Smith's footsteps made him glance sideways. His dark eyes swept over her before he continued dictating product development details to the caller.

The technical jargon was lost on Emily, but she knew it had nothing to do with BestTech Group's business. She stood quietly, her fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of the folder in her hands.

The moment the call ended, William turned. His obsidian eyes, deep as an abyss, swallowed her reflection whole.

"Any instructions, Vice President?" Emily broke the silence first.

The corner of William's lips curved slightly as his gaze shifted to the desk. Two folded A4 sheets and a gold card lay conspicuously on the polished surface.

The "breakup compensation" Mrs. Chen had thrown at her.

Emily's pupils contracted. She hadn't expected to see them here—let alone retrieved by William.

"Thank you." She reached for them, but the instant her fingers brushed the papers, his hand closed around her wrist.

"That slap that night," William stepped closer, "deserves an explanation."

Emily scoffed, lifting the gold card. "Isn't this answer enough?"

"What if I told you I didn't do it?" His breath suddenly warmed her ear as he leaned down.

"It doesn't matter anymore." She tried to pull free. "Let go."

William tightened his grip instead. "That was the first time anyone's ever struck me." His thumb stroked the inside of her wrist. "Don't you think it matters?"

Emily shut her eyes briefly. "Do whatever you want—hit me, punish me."

She tilted her face up, lashes trembling. Sunlight filtered through the glass, scattering golden flecks across her porcelain skin.

William's gaze darkened. Without warning, he dipped his head and nipped her lips—not too hard, not too gentle.

"You—" Emily's eyes flew open. She raised her hand to strike, but he caught it midair.

"Next time," he stepped back, Adam's apple bobbing, "it won't be this simple."

Emily's fingertips burned. Memories of being reduced to tearful pleas under his torment flooded back, setting her ears aflame.

She snatched the items and bolted for the door.

William watched the door sway, then lifted a hand to touch his lips. The faint sweetness of her lipstick lingered.

His gaze dropped to the growing strain against his trousers. A bitter laugh escaped him.
###Chapter 180

Emily stepped out of the elevator on the 67th floor. Instead of heading straight to her desk, she turned toward the restroom.

The mirror reflected her flushed cheeks. The skin beneath her fingertips burned unnaturally hot.

What was wrong with her?

That sudden kiss from William had sent her heart racing out of control.

Did she still have feelings for him?

Emily shook her head violently.

It was just an involuntary physical reaction—nothing more. Any woman would blush when touched by someone she desired.

It had nothing to do with William specifically.

She took deep breaths, splashing cold water on her face until her reflection looked normal again. Only then did she smooth her expression and return to her seat.

At the end of the workday, Daniel Chen waited outside the building as usual.

Emily didn’t leave until 6:30 PM.

Daniel naturally wrapped an arm around her waist, leaning in to kiss her cheek.

She instinctively flinched but forced herself to stay still at the last second, letting his lips brush her skin.

"What would you like to eat?" he asked gently.

"Whatever you prefer." She forced a small smile.

Daniel held the car door open for her. As Emily settled into the passenger seat, her peripheral vision caught a faint silhouette by the 67th-floor window.

She knew exactly who it was.

At the restaurant, Emily pulled a bank card from her purse and slid it across the table.

"Your mother gave this to me."

Daniel took it with a guilty expression. "I'm sorry. I'll handle this. I won’t let my parents' disapproval come between us."

"They only want what’s best for you," Emily murmured, sipping her water. "If you ever feel like this is too much—"

"I won’t." He grasped her hand firmly. "I’ve already chosen you."

Emily met his determined gaze and gave a faint nod.

The next two weeks passed uneventfully.

William seemed to have left Jinzhou—a piece of information she’d accidentally overheard from Grace Lee.

Daniel’s parents had also returned to their hometown, leaving her in peace.

The only thing troubling Emily was her body’s instinctive resistance whenever Daniel tried to get close.

Once, she forced herself to endure his kiss but pulled away after just a few seconds.

Daniel never pressured her, but his patience only deepened her guilt.

Tonight, Daniel was working late, so Emily took a taxi home alone.

She had just settled into the backseat and given the driver her address when she noticed his odd stare in the rearview mirror.

Midway through the ride, the car abruptly pulled over.

Emily, wearing earbuds and scrolling through her phone, assumed it was a red light.

Then the opposite door was yanked open.

A tall figure swiftly slid in beside her.

Before she could react, the driver hit the gas, and the car shot forward like an arrow.

Emily’s heart plummeted.
###Chapter 181

Emily felt a heavy slap on her shoulder.

She whipped her head around, her pupils shrinking in shock.

David's twisted face was inches from hers.

Smack!

Her phone was ripped from her hand, arcing through the air before vanishing out the window.

"David!" Her voice trembled.

"You bitch!"

A stinging slap sent her head snapping sideways.

Darkness swam before her eyes as she was shoved onto the seat. David straddled her like a beast, his alcohol-laced breath hot against her ear. "Let's see who'll save you now!"

She kicked and screamed for the driver.

The driver only smirked, handing David a rope. "There's a rag by the door. Gag her—less trouble."

Emily's blood turned to ice.

This was a trap.

"I never wronged you!" She forced her voice steady.

"Bullshit!" David's fingers closed around her throat. "You got me locked up multiple times and still dare to lie?"

Oxygen deprivation made spots dance in her vision.

"You... deserved it..." she gasped.

"Playing the saint?" David sneered. "William got bored and passed you to Mason? Let's show the internet who you really are!"

Her heart stopped.

A filthy rag was stuffed into her mouth. The rope bit into her wrists, searing like fire.

The car halted outside a desolate motel.

She was hauled into a dim room, wrists bound to the bedframe. Four cameras glowed red like predator's eyes.

"This is a crime!" She spat out the gag, voice shaking.

"I'm past caring!" David unbuckled his belt.

"Who got you out?" She glared. "Alexander? Or someone else?"

Naked, he loomed over her. "Pleasure me, and maybe I'll tell you."

"Never!" She recoiled. "Those videos will prove you're a rapist!"

"Still defiant?" He gripped her chin. "I'll make you beg..."

Emily bit her lip till copper flooded her mouth.
###Chapter 182

William Johnson's private jet had just landed at Jinzhou Airport. The black Maybach sped through the night, neon lights outside the window casting fragmented shadows across the man's exhausted features.

"Boss, there's trouble." Sam Wilson's grip on the steering wheel tightened as urgent updates crackled through the Bluetooth earpiece.

William's eyes snapped open, fatigue instantly replaced by icy sharpness. "Explain."

Ever since discovering Alexander Johnson's predatory interest in Emily Smith, he'd stationed covert guards to protect her around the clock. Sam's voice carried unusual tension: "Miss Smith was forcibly taken by three unknown men into a budget hotel in the southern district."

The car screeched to a violent halt. William's knuckles whitened against the leather seat. "How long?"

"Fifteen minutes." Sam swallowed hard. "Our men report she's been resisting the entire time."

William loosened his tie, a storm brewing in his eyes. "Turn around."

Tires screamed against asphalt as the Maybach shot toward the southern district like an arrow.

In the dingy hotel corridor, surveillance cameras pulsed with eerie red light. Behind Room 307, the sound of tearing fabric mixed with men's ragged breathing.

"You think playing dead will help?" David Brown gripped Emily's chin, forcing the camera toward her bloodless face. "Once this video goes viral, let's see how long you can keep pretending to be pure!"

Nylon ropes bit into Emily's wrists, drawing blood. Her shirt gaped open, revealing savage bite marks on her collarbone. She clenched her teeth, the metallic tang of blood filling her mouth.

"In your dreams." Her voice was hoarse but clear. "I'd rather die than let you win."

David tore at her clothes, raising the camera—

BANG!

The door exploded inward. William emerged through the cloud of splinters, the hem of his black coat flaring like a raptor's wings.

David barely had time to react before an inhuman force slammed him to the ground. The camera shattered against the floor, its lens webbed with cracks.

William's pupils contracted when his gaze landed on the fragile figure on the bed. Emily resembled a broken butterfly—pale skin mottled with bruises, blood trickling from her lips, yet stubbornly refusing to shed a single tear.

"Sam." William wrapped his coat around her, voice colder than glacial ice. "Make sure he never sees another sunrise."

David collapsed, a dark stain spreading across his trousers. Sam hauled him up by the collar like a dead dog, dragging him out. Soon, muffled blows and strangled whimpers echoed down the hallway.

The moment the ropes loosened, Emily trembled violently. William gathered her into his arms with infinite care, his thumb brushing the bruise at the corner of her eye.

"It's over." He pressed a kiss to her quivering lashes, voice raw with emotion. "I'm taking you home."

The girl in his arms finally opened her eyes. Tears washed away the dried blood crusting her eyelashes. She clutched his shirtfront, knuckles bleaching white—as if clinging to the last lifeline in a storm.
###Chapter 183

The sharp contours of his face came into focus, and Emily Smith's pupils constricted violently.

She finally knew she was safe.

David Brown's twisted face could never hurt her again.

"Don't be afraid." William Johnson's voice was so deep it trembled. His arms tightened around her like steel bands. His lips pressed hard against the top of her head, his voice laced with lethal intent. "I'll make sure he dies."

Emily stared at him blankly, then suddenly, the floodgates burst.

"The cameras..." Her voice was shattered. "They're everywhere..."

William kissed her damp lashes. "I know."

His thumb brushed the scorching tear tracks on her cheeks. "Those recordings will disappear forever."

Emily buried her face in his chest, her slender shoulders shaking uncontrollably.

When William carried her out of the room wrapped in his suit jacket, Sam Wilson was already waiting outside. The moment the car door closed, Emily suddenly struggled. "I don't want to go to the hospital."

She couldn't bear the prying eyes of strangers.

"Take us to Jinzhou Bay," William ordered.

The girl in his arms shook her head violently, her hair brushing against his jaw. "Not there."

"Amanda Lin isn't home." He pushed the damp strands from her face, his thumb grazing the reddened corner of her eye.

"I said no!" Her voice rose sharply.

William's jaw tightened. "Then we'll go to the Four Seasons Hotel."

This time, Emily didn't protest, curling into him like a wounded animal.

The elevator ascended directly to the penthouse suite. The moment William placed her on the bed, she clutched her collar with a death grip.

"Let go." His voice was dark.

Emily suddenly opened her eyes, bloodshot and wild. "I have a boyfriend!"

"Boyfriend?" William sneered, his tongue pressing against his cheek. "Where is he?"

She lunged for the bedside phone, but before her fingers could touch the receiver, William flipped her onto her back. The phone cord whipped through the air with a sharp snap.

"Five minutes later," he gripped her chin, "and you know what would've happened."

"This is your fault!" Her voice was hoarse. "If it weren't for you—"

William's pupils contracted sharply. "He's approached you before?"

A knock sounded at the door. Sam's voice filtered through the wood. "Mr. Johnson, the doctor is here."

William stared at her tear-streaked face, a storm raging in his eyes.
###Chapter 184

William Johnson suppressed his surging rage and coldly ordered the doctor to enter.

The male physician entered the suite with a medical kit, his gaze shifting uncertainly between the two.

"Leave the kit. Get out." William's voice was icy.

The doctor hesitated, glancing at the curled-up figure on the bed, then silently set down the kit and retreated.

The moment the door closed, William yanked open the medical kit. The sharp scent of antiseptic filled the air.

"Take off your clothes." He pulled out a cotton swab, his voice low.

Emily Smith hugged her knees and shook her head. "I'll do it myself."

"Emily!" His grip tightened around the medicine bottle.

She lifted her pale face. "My boyfriend wouldn't like this."

"Daniel Chen?" William sneered. "Where was he when you needed him?"

"That's none of your business." Her nails dug into her palms. "I won't forget that you saved me, but that doesn't mean you can cross the line."

"I crossed the line?" He hurled the cotton swab into the trash. "Do you even hear yourself?"

The robe's collar slipped, revealing vicious bite marks. William's eyes darkened with fury.

"Please leave." She turned her face away, her voice soft but firm.

William kicked over the coffee table. The shattering glass made the bodyguards outside flinch.

"Fine." He slammed the door behind him, the entire suite trembling.

Only when the elevator descended did Emily drag the medical kit into the bathroom. The mirror reflected bruises covering her body. Clenching a towel between her teeth, she disinfected her wounds, her robe soaked with sweat.

Meanwhile, the surveillance footage played on the projector screen in the presidential suite. William punched the wall, blood dripping from his knuckles.

"How did David Brown get out?" His voice was deadly calm.

Sam Wilson lowered his head. "Miss Lin used your name."

The screen froze on David's twisted grin. William yanked the power cord.

"Tell the warden," he loosened his tie, "I want him to wish he was dead."

Sam made the call. Faint screams echoed from the other end.

The bathroom light finally turned off. When Emily stepped out, wrapped in her robe, the suite was empty. Only a brand-new dress lay on the bedside, its price tag worth half a year's living expenses for an average person.

Outside, rain poured relentlessly. Staring at the city's neon lights, she suddenly remembered Daniel was supposed to accompany her to an audition today. Her phone screen lit up, then dimmed—seventeen missed calls, all from the same name.
###Chapter 185

Sam had just left when the master bedroom door lock clicked softly.

William turned sharply. Emily emerged wrapped in a snow-white bathrobe, her face drained of color.

Her eyes met his stormy gaze as her fingers unconsciously twisted the robe's belt. "Thank you," she whispered, barely audible. "I'll go now."

William watched her slender back, his Adam's apple bobbing. He wanted nothing more than to tear that damned robe off and make her sob until her voice broke, trembling with surrender.

"Leaving like that?" His laugh was cold. "Not afraid of running into another pervert?"

Emily froze. The hem of her robe fluttered faintly with her trembling.

William clenched his fists. He hadn't realized the incident had traumatized her so deeply.

"May I borrow your phone?" She turned abruptly, her lips paler than her face.

William narrowed his eyes. "Who are you calling?"

"My boyfriend."

The air turned to ice. William's jawline sharpened like a blade, his eyes swirling with a terrifying storm.

Emily had already picked up the landline receiver. She dialed wrong twice before a stream of obscenities erupted from the speaker. A tear hit the keypad, scattering tiny droplets.

William's chest burned. He pulled out his phone and found that infuriating contact.

Daniel had just loosened his tie when his phone vibrated. "William Johnson" on the screen made his pupils constrict.

A call this late could only mean one thing.
###Chapter 186

"Daniel Chen, Emily Smith is in the Presidential Suite No. 1 at the Four Seasons Hotel." William Johnson's voice carried a hint of amusement through the receiver. "Whether you come or not is up to you."

Daniel's fingers tightened instantly. The call ended abruptly, leaving only the dull hum of the dial tone.

He stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his reflection showing a tense jawline. Eleven at night, a man and a woman alone in a hotel suite... The thought was like a blunt knife slowly sawing at his nerves.

His phone screen went dark. Daniel grabbed his coat and rushed out the door.

Inside the Four Seasons suite, Emily stared at the disconnected phone, her fingertips cold. She hadn't expected William to call Daniel out of the blue, let alone use such ambiguous phrasing.

"Satisfied?" William tossed the landline back onto the table, a cold smirk playing on his lips.

Emily turned and headed straight for the door.

"Stop!" William seized her wrist. "In such a hurry to throw yourself at him?"

She struggled but couldn't break free. "I'm just going to wait by the door."

"Wait?" William suddenly laughed, though his eyes remained icy. "Dressed like that?" His gaze swept over her thin nightgown, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Emily yanked her hand back and stumbled two steps, colliding with the hallway cabinet. The corner dug into her waist, but the pain was nothing compared to her humiliation.

"William," she took a deep breath, "don't make me hate you."

The words doused William like a bucket of cold water. He released her, irritably loosening his tie. "Go wait on the couch," he gestured to the living room. "Touch that doorknob, and I won't hesitate to take you right here."

Emily pressed her lips together and retreated to the living room. The floor lamp cast her shadow against the wall—slender, fragile, like a bamboo stalk on the verge of snapping.

Silence stretched between them. William leaned back in the armchair, eyes closed, his lashes casting shadows under his eyes. Then, the doorbell rang sharply.

Emily practically leaped up and ran to the door. She pulled it open to find Daniel standing there, the chill of the night still clinging to him, beads of sweat at his temples.

"Daniel..." Her voice trembled with unshed tears.

His eyes quickly scanned her, confirming she was unharmed before pulling her into a tight embrace. "It's okay," he murmured, his voice impossibly gentle as he stroked her back.

Emily buried her face in his shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of his woody cologne. Her tense nerves finally relaxed.

Daniel looked up, locking eyes with William across the room. The two men's gazes clashed—one calm and controlled, the other simmering with dark intensity.

"Thank you for looking after my girlfriend, Mr. Johnson," Daniel said first, each word deliberately weighted.

William rose, leisurely adjusting his cuffs. "Don't mention it." He smirked. "After all, Emily and I..." He deliberately trailed off, leaving the implication hanging.

Emily jerked her head up. "Let's go," she whispered, tugging at Daniel's sleeve, her voice shaking.

Daniel tightened his arm around her and turned away, tossing over his shoulder, "Watch yourself, Mr. Johnson."

The moment the door closed, William slammed his fist onto the coffee table. The glass cracked like a spiderweb, blood dripping between his fingers.
###Chapter 187

His gaze was like a bottomless abyss, cold as a thousand-year-old frozen lake, or the ocean before a storm—heavy with suffocating intensity.

Daniel Chen met William Johnson's eyes and actually felt relieved.

"Vice President Johnson, thank you for stepping in tonight," Emily Smith said from the doorway, her voice cool and distant. "Daniel and I will treat you to dinner another time."

She looked up at Daniel and murmured, "Let's go."

Daniel wrapped an arm around her shoulders, and the two walked away together.

William remained on the couch, his knuckles turning white as he watched their intimate figures disappear down the hallway.

——

When they returned to the Sky City apartment, Mia Harris was predictably absent.

Before Daniel could ask, Emily laid everything out.

She confessed her past with David Brown.

She recounted his relentless harassment.

She detailed how the taxi driver had conspired with David to abduct her that night.

Only the most degrading details were omitted.

The bruises David had left were hidden beneath her clothes. She tightened her coat, and Daniel noticed nothing.

"My clothes got torn," she said lightly.

When she mentioned William's timely intervention, even she seemed puzzled.

Daniel had heard of David before.

As Emily spoke, he suddenly slammed his fist onto the marble coffee table with a dull thud.

"I'm fine," Emily said, taking his reddened hand. "Don't do that."

Daniel pulled her into his arms, his voice shaking. "I failed to protect you. This time, I won't let him get away."

Though his roots in Jinzhou were shallow, his father's connections would ensure David paid the price.

"Mm." Emily rested her head on his shoulder and said no more.

She was truly afraid.

If David were released, she might not escape again. Whether it was William or Daniel, as long as he stayed locked away forever, she would be grateful.

That night, Daniel slept on the living room couch, while Emily's bedroom door remained open.

But she tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

The lingering terror refused to fade.

More questions swirled in her mind.

Why had William appeared just in time?

Why had he looked so frantic when he burst in?

What did those moments of tenderness mean?

These thoughts grew like weeds until, at five in the morning, she finally drifted off.

Daniel, listening to the sounds from her room, stayed awake all night. Only when he was sure she was asleep did he quietly close her door.

Without her phone alarm, Emily slept until the sun was high.

When she opened her eyes and saw light streaming through the curtains, she bolted upright.

Tuesday! She was going to be late!

Assuming Daniel had already left, she rushed to the bathroom to wash up.

Her reflection showed a pale face. She quickly applied light makeup, changed, and hurried out.

The rich aroma of porridge greeted her.

Daniel was in the kitchen. He turned at the sound of her footsteps. "Almost ready."

Emily meant to refuse breakfast and rush to work, but instead she said, "Can I borrow your phone? I need to call in."

Daniel gave her the passcode.

She dialed BestTech's main line and asked for Michael Thompson.

When she requested leave, Michael agreed easily. "Take your time. Handle what you need first."

"Thanks, boss." As she hung up, Daniel brought out a steaming breakfast.
###Chapter 188

Emily handed the phone back to Daniel Chen and turned to help in the kitchen.

"Stay seated." Daniel grabbed her wrist and guided her back to the dining table. He ladled a steaming bowl of century egg and pork congee and gently pushed it toward her.

Emily scooped a spoonful and blew on it to cool it down. The moment the congee touched her tongue, her eyes lit up. "So flavorful!"

Watching her devour the food, Daniel's eyes softened with amusement. "Slow down. There's more in the pot."

After finishing three bowls, Emily finally set down her chopsticks with satisfaction. Daniel suddenly took her hand. "Emily, there's something I want to discuss with you."

"Hmm?"

"Quit your job at BestTech." His thumb brushed lightly over her knuckles. "Focus on voice acting. With your talent, doubling your income wouldn't be a problem."

Her chopsticks froze mid-air.

"Your current job takes up too much of your time," Daniel continued. "If you channeled all that energy into voice acting—"

He didn't finish, but Emily understood the unspoken message. Ever since that night at Four Seasons Hotel, Daniel's wariness of William Johnson had been written all over his face.

"You're right," she murmured, lowering her lashes. "But BestTech was my first job. My colleagues have been so kind to me..."

"I respect your decision," Daniel cut in, his smile strained. "As long as you're happy."

Emily gave a quiet "Mm," and the air between them grew heavy.

Sunlight slanted through the windows of BestTech Tower at eleven in the morning. As Emily approached the elevator bank, the private elevator at the far end suddenly dinged open.

She instinctively took a step back.

Olivia Davis stormed out in ten-centimeter heels, her eyes red-rimmed. When she turned and spotted Emily, her expression twisted with fury.

"Miss Davis." Emily gave a slight nod.

Olivia let out a cold laugh, her nails digging into her palms. "What a coincidence. William's past and present lovers in one place today?"

Emily met her gaze in silence. The heiress of the Davis family looked like a bristling cat, every breath laced with hostility.

"Then again," Olivia sneered, stepping closer until her perfume overwhelmed the space between them, "someone like you isn't even fit to tie Amanda Lin's shoelaces."

With that, she strode away, her retreating figure radiating humiliation.

Three months ago, the scandal had rocked the entire city. Olivia had caused a scene at the Johnson mansion, allegedly pushing Amanda down the stairs. Yet in the end, William hadn't even shown his face.
###Chapter 189

Olivia Davis stormed into the Shen mansion, her perfectly made-up face twisted with fury. She shoved aside the servant blocking her path and marched straight to the side parlor where Amanda Lin was seated.

Slap!

The sharp sound of a palm striking flesh echoed through the room. Amanda staggered back, unprepared, her fair cheek instantly marked with a vivid red handprint.

"You shameless bitch!" Olivia hissed through clenched teeth, raising her hand for another strike.

"Stop!"

The voice came from the staircase. Sophia Song descended quickly, stepping between Amanda and Olivia, her gaze icy as she glared at Olivia. "Miss Davis, this is the Shen residence. You will not cause a scene here."

Olivia froze. She couldn't believe that Aunt Sophia, who had always doted on her, would now shield that wretched woman.

"Aunt Sophia, she seduced William—"

"Enough!" Sophia cut her off sharply, then turned to the butler. "Call the Davis family. Have them come collect her."

Half an hour later, Olivia's parents arrived in a hurry. In front of them, Sophia affectionately linked arms with Amanda. "Amanda is a sensible girl. It's our family's fortune that William gets to marry her."

The words struck Olivia like a hammer to the heart. She finally understood—the position of the second young madam of the Shen family would never be hers.

In the Davis family study, Mr. Davis slammed his teacup onto the table.

"Don't you get it? Sophia never intended for you to marry William!"

Olivia bit her lip, silent. Of course she didn’t understand. Why would Aunt Sophia, who had watched her grow up, suddenly turn against her?

"What’s the current situation in the Shen family?" Mr. Davis sighed. "Alexander is Sophia’s biological son. Why would she let William marry you?"

Olivia’s head snapped up, a flicker of realization in her eyes.

Three days later, Olivia was forcibly put on a flight to London. Before boarding, she clutched her phone tightly, William’s number displayed on the screen—but she never dialed.

Three months later, Mrs. Davis, unable to bear her daughter’s loneliness abroad, flew to London to bring her home. On the return flight, Olivia leaned against her mother’s shoulder and whispered, "Mom, I’ve figured it out."

Yet the moment the plane landed at Jinzhou Airport, the obsession in her eyes flared back to life.

Top floor of BestTech Group, the CEO’s office.

Crash!

Olivia swept all the documents off the desk. Her eyes red, she glared at William, who remained silent. "Why her? What does she have that I don’t?"

William lifted his gaze, his expression terrifyingly calm. "I’ve always seen you as a sister."

The words shattered Olivia’s last hope. She stumbled back, then suddenly burst into hysterical laughter. "Fine! Wonderful! Then I wish you a miserable marriage! May she cuckold you sooner rather than later!"

William merely quirked a faint smile, as if listening to a poorly told joke.

Business Department, BestTech Group.

Emily Smith was focused on her computer screen. During lunch break, only a handful of colleagues remained in the office.

The sharp click of high heels approached.

"Emily."

She looked up to see Grace Lee standing before her desk, a noticeable bruise on her temple. In her hand was a phone—the one Emily had lost the night before.

"Vice President Johnson asked me to return this to you," Grace said with a professional smile, deliberately raising her voice.

The eyes of nearby colleagues immediately turned toward them. Emily caught sight of someone subtly straining to listen.

"Thank you, Grace," she replied calmly, shaking her head. "But this isn’t my phone."

A flicker of surprise crossed Grace’s face before she resumed her polished smile. "Then I’ll confirm with the vice president."

Once Grace left, Emily returned to her work as if nothing had happened. Only she knew—her palms bore deep crescent marks from her nails digging in.
###Chapter 190
The glass door of the Business Department had barely closed when whispers began spreading through the office like wildfire.

Grace Lee's figure disappeared into the elevator, her high heels clicking against the marble floor. Several female colleagues immediately huddled together, exchanging meaningful glances.

"Did you see that? The chief secretary personally delivered a phone to Emily."

"Since when does Vice President Johnson pay such attention to his subordinates?"

The gossip floated into Emily Smith's ears. She kept typing without flinching, as if completely detached from the conversation.

The landline rang just as she was staring blankly at the report on her screen.

The caller ID displayed "Vice President's Office." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"Emily, phone call," the colleague beside her kindly reminded.

Taking a deep breath, she pressed the answer button.

"Come up." William Johnson's voice came through the receiver, commanding and leaving no room for refusal.

"It's lunch break," she clenched the receiver.

The sound of rustling papers came from the other end before the man chuckled darkly. "Shall I come down and get you myself?"

The call ended abruptly.

During the thirty-second elevator ride, Emily stared at the ascending floor numbers, her nails digging into her palms.

Grace stood by the secretary's desk with a knowing smile. "The Vice President has been waiting for you."

The office door was slightly ajar. Before she could knock, a deep male voice called out, "Enter."

William lounged in his leather chair, idly spinning a phone with his long fingers. Seeing her enter, he slid the device toward her.

"Last chance. Do you want it?"

Emily stared at the familiar phone, her throat tightening. "No need. My boyfriend—"

"Daniel Chen?" William cut her off, a mocking glint in his eyes. "Where's the new phone he bought you?"

Her breath hitched.

Suddenly, he unlocked the phone and tapped the screen twice. Immediately, the sound of heavy breathing and moans filled the spacious office.

"Oh... William..."

Every drop of blood in Emily's body turned to ice.

She lunged for the phone, her knee slamming hard against the desk edge. Pain made her vision blur, but she still managed to grab the device.

The recording stopped abruptly.

William watched with amusement as her trembling fingers fumbled across the screen. "Looking for something? The chat records?"

Her head snapped up, eyes blazing with fury. "When did you—"

"Last night." He leaned forward, his warm breath brushing her ear. "When you were begging me through tears."

The words struck her like a slap.

David Brown's twisted face flashed before her eyes. She staggered back two steps until her back hit the cold glass wall.

"Delete it," her voice came out hoarse. "Or I'll resign immediately."

William's eyes darkened.

His long fingers swiped across the screen before decisively pressing the delete button. He tossed the phone back onto the desk with a metallic clatter.

Emily turned to leave.

The moment his hand closed around her wrist, she caught the familiar scent of cedar. His burning palm against her icy skin sent a shiver through her entire body.
###Chapter 191

William Johnson's apology came without warning. Emily Smith stood with her back to him, her slender shoulders still trembling slightly.

She took a deep breath before turning around, her eyes filled with resolve. "William," she whispered, her voice feather-light, "we ended long ago."

Tears slipped down her cheeks uncontrollably. Memories of being restrained and violated flooded her mind, nearly suffocating her.

"I'm a person," she choked out, "not your plaything."

William's heart twisted painfully. He instinctively reached for her cold wrist, his voice hoarse. "I just wanted to have a meal with you."

A timely knock sounded at the office door. Grace Lee stood outside, pushing a food cart.

Emily quickly wiped her tears. "Sorry," she said, pulling her hand away, "I've already eaten with my boyfriend."

She turned and walked out, her thin frame looking as fragile as paper.

William watched her hurried retreat, pressing a hand to his forehead in frustration. He had never hated his own impulsiveness more.

As the elevator doors slid open, Amanda Lin stepped out gracefully in her high heels. When they passed each other, she clearly saw the redness in Emily's eyes.

Her nails dug into her palms. Amanda wore a perfect smile, but venom churned in her heart.

That useless David Brown! She cursed inwardly. Not only did he fail, but he also got himself caught.

"Miss Lin," Grace greeted respectfully.

Amanda gave a dismissive nod and walked straight into the office. William sat with his eyes closed, his brow furrowed.

She casually perched on his lap and pressed her red lips to his forehead. "Not feeling well?" Her voice dripped with sweetness.

William slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was sharp as a blade, sending a chill down Amanda's spine.

"Lunch is ready," she said, forcing composure as she stood and walked toward the fragrant meal.

William picked up his documents again. "You eat."

Amanda's smile froze. She stared at the extra set of tableware and suddenly sneered. "Because the person who was supposed to eat with you ran away?"

The documents snapped shut. William stood, the coldness in his eyes making her shiver.

He stepped closer, then suddenly smirked. "You're right."

Amanda's pupils constricted sharply.
###Chapter 192

Emily Smith's fingertips still trembled slightly as she returned to the Business Department.

She took a deep breath and shoved her phone into the deepest drawer. Only a few colleagues working overtime remained in the office, none noticing her pale complexion.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Emily, I'm waiting for you at the café downstairs." Amanda Lin's voice carried an imperious tone through the receiver.

"Miss Lin, if you have something to say, say it now." Emily clenched her fountain pen.

A light laugh came through the phone. "I heard David Brown is out? What a coincidence—I happen to know a few friends at the police station."

Emily's breath hitched.

"Oh, and your sister is at Renhe Hospital, right?" Amanda's voice softened unnaturally. "The security there seems... lacking."

The fountain pen snapped in her palm with a sharp crack.

"Miss Lin," Emily said, her voice eerily calm, "William Johnson and I are over."

After hanging up, she stared blankly at her computer screen for a long time.

The call from the nurse's station jolted her back to reality.

"Miss Smith, your sister just moved her fingers!"

When Emily rushed to the hospital, her sister still lay motionless. But the EEG monitor showed brainwaves more active than usual.

Gently holding her sister's hand, Emily suddenly made a decision.

The next morning, Michael Thompson's inbox received a resignation letter.

"Why?" He closed the glass office door behind him. "Because of the gossip?"

Emily shook her head. "I need more time to care for my sister."

Michael studied her for a long moment. "You know how difficult it is to find a job right now."

"I have voice-over work." She met his gaze steadily. "It's enough to cover the medical bills."

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating her resolute profile.

Michael finally sighed. "I'll expedite the process."

As Emily left the office, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Daniel Chen:

"Made your decision? Our team needs a voice like yours."

Her finger hovered over the reply button.
###Chapter 193

The night deepened as Emily Smith removed her headphones. The studio lights cast faint shadows across her face.

Her phone screen lit up with a message from Daniel Chen: "I'm downstairs."

The black sedan glided smoothly through the night. Emily gazed at the neon lights flickering outside the window, her fingers absently tracing the seatbelt.

"Have you decided?" Daniel's voice broke the silence, crisp in the enclosed space.

Emily turned from the window. "I've already submitted my resignation."

His grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly. "Do you still have the contract? Legally, they can't hold you for more than a month."

"I'll look for it." She lowered her lashes, masking her emotions.

Silence settled between them again.

As they turned the final corner, the gates of Sky Garden came into view. A flash of red caught Emily's eye—Mia Harris was hopping out of a Ferrari, waving goodbye to the driver.

Emily squinted. Under the dim streetlight, George Taylor's roguish grin was unmistakable.

"Want to grab a late-night snack at my place?" Daniel asked softly after parking.

"No, thanks." Her reply was distracted, her mind still replaying what she'd just seen.

In the elevator, Daniel's gaze lingered on her profile. Before parting, he leaned in to kiss her forehead but felt her subtle stiffness the moment their skin touched.

The elevator doors slid shut, separating them. Daniel stood motionless, watching the floor numbers change, his Adam's apple bobbing.

The moment Emily opened the door to unit 2801, the sweet scent of strawberry perfume enveloped her. Mia hummed off-key, bouncing to the foyer with a half-eaten apple.

"Darling!" Mia enveloped her in a wine-scented hug, leaving lipstick smudges on Emily's cheeks.

Laughing, Emily pushed her away. "George gave you a ride home?"

Mia's apple thudded to the floor and rolled under the coffee table. "You saw?" Her ears turned pink. "We've only had dinner twice."

"Two dinners warrant a personal chauffeur?" Emily picked up the apple and rinsed it under the tap. "Since when has George Taylor ever—"

"Shut up!" Mia shoved the wet apple into her mouth.

The next morning, Michael Thompson's office smelled of coffee. After discussing quarterly reports, Emily finally asked, "Has my resignation been approved?"

Michael adjusted his glasses. "Upper management declined."

The answer didn't surprise her. Emily stood, her nails digging into her palms. At BestTech, who else could "upper management" refer to but him?

The glass door clicked shut behind her, reflecting her tense expression.
###Chapter 194

"Emily, do you still keep in touch with VP Johnson privately?" Michael Thompson finally couldn't resist asking tentatively, then quickly added with a smile, "I mean, outside of work."

Emily Smith looked up, a faint smile playing on her lips. "We're barely acquaintances. Just slightly friendlier than strangers when we meet."

Seeing her reluctance to elaborate, Michael nodded understandingly. "Go ahead with your work."

As Emily pushed open her office door, she nearly collided with Grace Lee, who had been waiting for her.

"Emily, the VP wants to see you," Grace said with a professional smile.

Emily glanced at her wristwatch, suppressing the urge to ask questions. "Can I just drop something off first?"

"Of course. I'll wait," Grace replied, her smile unwavering.

At her desk, Lily White immediately leaned in. "Why does the VP keep summoning you lately?"

"It's about my cousin," Emily brushed off casually, her fingers tightening around the files until her knuckles turned white.

In the elevator, Emily stared at the flickering floor numbers. She needed answers. How could William Johnson block her resignation? Just because he held power at BestTech? The thought made her chest tighten.

When she pushed open the door to the VP's office, she didn't even bother with the courtesy of knocking.

William stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, phone to his ear. He turned at the sound, their eyes locking instantly. He clearly saw the fire burning in her gaze.

The call continued. Emily remained rooted in place, her nails digging into her palms. Every passing second fueled the flames inside her.

Fifteen minutes later, William finally ended the call.

"VP Johnson, does my resignation require your personal approval?" she cut straight to the chase.

William settled into his leather chair, the corner of his mouth lifting. "Who was it that kept you here in the first place?"

"The employment contract clearly states—"

"Pending approval," he interrupted, tapping the desk lightly with his fingertips. "And I haven't approved it."

Emily's breath hitched. This man always held himself above others, never caring about their feelings.

"William!" Her voice trembled. "Don't push it."

His eyes darkened, his Adam's apple bobbing slightly. The air in the office instantly grew heavy.
###Chapter 195

William Johnson's eyes darkened abruptly, his heart gripped by an invisible hand.

The moment their gazes met, the air seemed to freeze.

He stood and walked toward her, his long fingers clenching and unclenching in his pockets. His fingertips lifted, but stopped just before touching her cheek.

Her clear eyes were filled with rejection and disgust.

"Give me a reason for resigning," he withdrew his hand, his voice low.

Emily Smith curled her lips into a mocking smile. "Why ask when you already know, Vice President Johnson?"

"I don't understand," he said impassively.

"My boyfriend doesn't like it." She lifted her chin, enunciating each word. "He wants me to leave BestTech."

The words sliced through the silence like a blade.

A storm brewed in William's eyes. He suddenly gripped her chin. "When I told you to stay away from Daniel Chen, why didn't you listen?"

Emily struggled in vain, then sneered. "He's my boyfriend. And you? What are you to me?"

"What am I?" He laughed coldly, his knuckles turning white. "Emily Smith, listen carefully—"

She caught a flicker of panic in his gaze.

"From BestTech to Grasshopper Audiobook, even the game company you're doing voice work for now." He leaned closer, his breath scorching. "Every job you've had—you've been working for me."

Grasshopper had been acquired by him.

Even that obscure game company was now his property.

Emily's pupils contracted slightly before she suddenly smiled brightly. "William Johnson, are you in love with me? Is that why you're controlling me like this?"

"Delusional," he said, tightening his grip.

"Was David Brown released by Amanda Lin?" she abruptly changed the subject.

William narrowed his eyes.

"Want me to stay?" Her smile was radiant. "Send Amanda Lin to prison to keep David Brown company, and I'll be your—" Her red lips parted. "Plaything."

The words were laced with poison.

"Wishful thinking," he scoffed. "You think you can compare to Amanda Lin?"

Her heart tore open.

Emily suddenly sank her teeth into the base of his thumb. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth. She bit down viciously until crimson dripped from the corner of her lips.

When she released him, his wound was mangled.

Staggering back, her face pale, she met his eyes again—

There wasn't a trace of anger in them.
###Chapter 196

Emily Smith lifted her eyes, her gaze settling on William Johnson's face.

He was eerily calm, his dark eyes devoid of any emotion.

"I'll leave," she said, clenching her fists. "Even if you disagree."

She turned to walk away.

"Your sister's hospital bill is due next month," William's voice cut through the silence behind her.

Emily froze, her shoulders trembling slightly.

But she didn't look back. She pushed through the door and left.

Grace Lee happened to pass by, her face paling when she noticed the blood at the corner of Emily's lips.

......

The entire afternoon, Emily was distracted.

She made several typing errors, forcing Michael Thompson to correct her repeatedly.

At lunch, she mechanically chewed her food, tasting nothing.

By the end of the workday, she canceled her recording session, desperate to see her sister.

The rain poured heavily.

Emily stood at the company entrance, waiting for a cab, her shoes soaked at the tips.

A black luxury car suddenly sped past, splashing muddy water all over her.

The tinted window rolled up just enough to reveal Amanda Lin's smug smirk before it disappeared.

Through the glass, Emily saw William burying his face in Amanda's neck, their intimacy unmistakable.

She looked down at her drenched clothes, her eyes burning.

Unable to hail a cab, she rushed into the subway station.

The cold wind carried the scent of rain, making her shiver.

But the chill in her heart was worse.

The hospital room was unnervingly quiet.

Staring at her sister's pale face, Emily was suddenly overwhelmed by despair.

She had thought about running away.

But what about her sister?

It was her negligence that had led to this.

As despicable as William was, at least he ensured her sister's treatment.

Mia Harris and Daniel Chen were still by her side.

Why torment herself over a worthless man?

Taking a deep breath, she made her decision.

She would stay at BestTech and earn the ten million she needed.

Only then could she truly escape this nightmare.
###Chapter 197

The night deepened, the hospital corridor bathed in harsh fluorescent light.

Daniel Chen cut his meeting short and rushed to pick up Emily Smith. Her damp clothes had long dried under the air conditioning, and he noticed nothing unusual.

"Hungry? I'll make noodles when we get home." In the elevator, he squeezed her icy fingertips.

Emily shook her head, but the instant the smell of instant noodles wafted through the hallway, her stomach churned. She forced a nod, nails digging into her palms.

Back at Sky City, Daniel tied on an apron and disappeared into the kitchen. Emily curled into the corner of the sofa, a sheen of sweat glistening at her temples. Her gaze fixed on the fruit knife on the coffee table, its polished surface reflecting her ghostly pale face.

"Emily?" Daniel emerged with a steaming bowl of noodles, only to find her slumped against the cushions, lips tinged blue.

He brushed the damp strands of hair from her forehead—his fingers recoiled at the scorching heat of her skin.

"103.6°F!" The thermometer blared an alarm. Daniel wrapped her in his coat, scooped her into his arms, and bolted for the elevator.

The doors slid open. Mia Harris stood frozen, her bubble tea shattering on the floor.

"Move!" Daniel shouldered past the gathering crowd. Mia grabbed her purse and sprinted after them. She remembered how, at lunch, Emily had dropped her chopsticks three times.

The ER overflowed with patients. Mia stared at the red digital display—"42 patients waiting"—and dialed Alexander Johnson without hesitation.

Under the chandeliers of a gala, Alexander's phone vibrated against a champagne flute.

"ER at Second Hospital? I'll contact Director Wang immediately." As he turned, his gaze locked with William Johnson's icy glare—a silent battle crackling between them.

In the black Maybach, Amanda Lin's smudged lipstick streaked William's collar. Without warning, she sank her teeth into his throat, drawing blood.

"Stop pretending," she hissed, yanking his tie. "If you leave now, you might still catch her last breath."

William opened his eyes. The car's display flashed with an incoming call—Second Hospital ER.
###Chapter 198

William Johnson's eyelashes fluttered slightly, like butterfly wings brushed by the wind.

He spoke slowly, his voice low and measured. "Stop using those underhanded tactics against Emily Smith. She's far more pitiable than you."

Yesterday after work, Amanda Lin had deliberately ordered her driver to speed up, splashing muddy water all over Emily. William had watched coldly from the sidelines, making no move to intervene.

In that moment, he saw half her body drenched in filthy water.

"Helpless and alone?" Amanda scoffed, her eyes filled with mockery. "William, you're wrong. Isn't her greatest protector you?"

William's eyes snapped open, his dark gaze piercing through her like an abyss. A sudden chill crawled up Amanda's spine, and she shuddered involuntarily.

"If you cut ties with her completely, I promise I won't trouble her again," she said, softening her tone.

William's brow twitched, but he gave her no further response.

The fever came on fast and fierce.

Emily lay in bed, her forehead burning. She had taken sick leave, her mind drifting in and out of consciousness.

Daniel Chen and Mia Harris took turns watching over her.

By evening, she briefly regained awareness and saw their exhausted faces. Her eyes reddened instantly.

"I'm sorry for burdening you both."

Mia looked ready to smack her. "If you don’t want us to worry, then get better quickly!"

Daniel brought her a bowl of warm porridge, carefully feeding her spoonfuls.

But after just a few sips, she rushed to the bathroom and vomited violently.

By the third day, the high fever had subsided into a low-grade one.

Michael Thompson and Lily White came to visit. Emily forced herself to stay alert long enough to discuss work briefly.

On the fourth day, she could still only manage half a bowl of plain porridge.

In the car that morning, William asked casually, "Is she still in the hospital?"

Sam Wilson glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "I heard Miss Smith has pneumonia. Her fever won’t break."

The documents in William's hands crumpled under his grip.

"Send the best doctors." His voice was icy.

"Pneumonia usually takes a week to recover from," Sam couldn’t help adding.

William shot him a cold look and said nothing more.

In the office, William's temper was worse than usual.

When Grace Lee emerged with red-rimmed eyes, John Zhang pulled her aside. "What’s wrong with the boss?"

"Emily Smith is hospitalized," Grace whispered.

John’s expression cleared with understanding.

By eight that night, William was still in his office.

Finally gathering his courage, John knocked on the door—clutching a piece of good news.
###Chapter 199

The atmosphere in the vice president's office was suffocating.

William Johnson's slender fingers tapped on the keyboard. The cold glow from the screen accentuated the sharp angles of his face, adding to his icy demeanor.

David Brown knocked lightly before entering cautiously.

"Sir, Mrs. Johnson called. She said your uncle had an appendectomy at Second People's Hospital and asked if you'd visit."

"Uncle?" William's brows furrowed slightly as irritation flashed across his face.

Meeting David's meaningful gaze, realization dawned on him.

A glimmer of approval appeared in his eyes as he closed his laptop.

"Everything prepared?"

"All set." David smiled knowingly.

William grabbed his suit jacket and strode out purposefully.

......

VIP ward, Second People's Hospital.

Emily Smith slowly opened her eyes, her vision still blurry.

"Awake?" Daniel Chen's gentle voice reached her as he helped the nurse remove her IV.

She noticed the city lights glowing outside the window.

"What time is it?"

"Almost nine." Daniel adjusted her bed and carefully tucked in her blanket. "Hungry? What would you like?"

Emily suddenly remembered he'd taken days off to care for her.

"Sorry, I was sleeping too deeply." She smiled apologetically, some color finally returning to her pale face.

Daniel affectionately ruffled her hair. "Silly, no need to be formal with me."

He leaned closer. "Want your favorite spicy noodles?"

Her eyes lit up briefly before dimming. "Too far. Let's order delivery."

"No trouble." Daniel stood up. "I remember you liked that stinky tofu from Food Street too."

He kissed her forehead. "Wait for me. I'll be quick."

Watching him leave, Emily's lips curved unconsciously.

She went to the bathroom and barely recognized her haggard reflection in the mirror.

Splashing cold water on her face helped clear her mind.

When she opened the door, she froze.

The tall figure on the sofa made her breath catch.

William was staring intently at her, his dark eyes unreadable.

Emily clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

After three seconds, she turned expressionlessly and walked straight to bed.

Pulling up the covers, she lay down with her back to him and closed her eyes.

The entire motion was fluid, as if no one else occupied the room.

William's gaze never left her. His Adam's apple moved slightly, but no words came out.
###Chapter 200

Emily Smith lay on the hospital bed, her once full cheeks now hollowed out. Her pale skin was almost translucent. Dry strands of hair spread across the pillow like withered grass devoid of life.

William Johnson stood by the bed, his Adam's apple bobbing. The look she had given him earlier was colder than how one would regard a stranger—like a blunt knife slowly carving into his heart.

"Do you hate me that much?" His voice was hoarse, barely recognizable.

The figure on the bed remained motionless, her breathing so faint it was almost imperceptible. William stared at her frail back, a sudden tightness gripping his chest.

"What I said that day was just out of anger." His tone softened. "I won't touch your sister."

The room was so quiet the sound of the IV drip was audible. William waited for what felt like an eternity before finally sighing.

"I contacted a specialist from abroad." His voice carried a hint of pleading. "He has extensive experience with coma patients."

Still, no response.

William moved closer, bending down to look at her. Under the light, her eyelashes cast delicate shadows on her face, making her look like a fragile porcelain doll. He reached out to touch her but stopped midair.

"Get some rest." He withdrew his hand and turned to leave.

Only when the sound of his footsteps completely faded did Emily slowly open her eyes.

......

When night enveloped the city, William dialed George Taylor's number.

"Gather the guys." His voice was rough. "I need a drink tonight."

George was stunned. In over twenty years of friendship, this was the first time William had ever asked to drink. Within half an hour, the private lounge was packed.

George had assumed it was just work stress. But watching William down glass after glass like water, he realized it was something far more serious.

"Slow down, Mr. Johnson," a woman cooed.

"Get lost." William's gaze was icy.

The atmosphere in the room froze instantly. Only George and James dared to stay by his side as he continued drowning himself in liquor.

"Call... Baby Em..." William slurred, grabbing George's arm. "Tell her to come get me..."

George was baffled. "Who's Baby Em?"

The only response was William collapsing onto the table, unconscious. George stared at his drunken friend and suddenly remembered the girl named Emily Smith.

Baby Em.

He shook his head with a wry smile.

The nickname was sickeningly sweet.
###Chapter 201

George Taylor frowned at his phone screen.

Hadn’t William Johnson always been in love with Amanda Lin? Weren’t they about to get married?

He recalled Mia Harris’ words yesterday—Emily Smith was hospitalized with pneumonia, her fever stubbornly refusing to break.

This girl really was something else.

George scoffed and dialed Amanda’s number instead.

Amanda arrived quickly, accompanied by Sam Wilson, hauling the completely wasted William back to his apartment.

"You can go rest now," Amanda told Sam.

She had always been good at handling people, treating those around William with impeccable courtesy.

Sam glanced at the unconscious man sprawled on the bed and quietly retreated.

Amanda reached for William’s belt.

"Emmy..."

William suddenly opened his eyes and yanked her into his arms.

Caught off guard, Amanda’s lips curled into a secretive smile.

This was the first time William had ever been so affectionate with her.

Drunk, he resembled a sulky child, pouting as he whined, "Emmy, I’m mad at you... You have to make it up to me..."

Emmy?

Amanda froze.

Had she heard that right?

William’s hand cupped her face, his grin boyish. "Hurry up and make it better..."

Now she was certain. He had called her "Emmy."

Emily’s "Em," and "my" as in "mine."

Her nails dug into her palms.

Fury twisted into a smile as she leaned close to his ear. "William, how did I used to make it up to you?"

"Like this..."

William tilted his head up, mimicking how Emily had once comforted him—pressing reverent kisses to her forehead, the corner of her eye, the tip of her nose...

Just as his lips were about to descend, Amanda seized the back of his head and crushed her mouth against his.

Morning sunlight stabbed at William’s eyelids.

He lifted a hand to rub his temples, only to find his arm pinned beneath something.

Turning his head, he saw Amanda asleep against his chest.

And lower—

They were both stark naked.

William’s brow furrowed.

"William~"

Amanda stirred, pressing a kiss to his lips with a satisfied smile. "Sleep well?"

He stared at her. Last night was a complete blank.

"I’m going to shower." He threw off the covers and stood.

"Let’s go together." Amanda reached for him.

"No." William walked into the bathroom without looking back.

Amanda’s smile vanished.
###Chapter 202

Emily Smith spent an entire week recuperating in the hospital.

The day after her discharge, she returned to work with swift determination.

Though visibly thinner after her illness, her almond-shaped eyes still shone like stars. Colleagues were surprised to see her signature warm smile intact, as if the ordeal had never happened.

Michael Thompson adjusted her workload.

"Emily, your resignation is still being processed," he said hesitantly in the office, handing her a cup of hot tea.

Her fingers traced the rim of the cup. "I've decided to stay."

His tense shoulders visibly relaxed. "Let me know if you need anything."

The next morning, the phone in the vice president's office rang abruptly.

"Miss Smith, Vice President Johnson requests your presence," Grace Lee's voice came through the receiver.

Emily stood before the expansive desk, sunlight casting a sharp shadow at her feet through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Still thinking about leaving?" William Johnson asked without looking up, his pen scratching across documents.

Her pupils constricted slightly.

"Yes," she answered firmly. "Has Vice President Johnson finally decided to let me go?"

The pen stilled.

When he lifted his gaze, it met her defiant eyes—sharp as a blade, severing the last thread between them.

"Granted."

The single word landed softly but exploded like thunder in her ears.

Her lips parted, but an invisible hand seemed to choke her voice. A dull ache spread through her chest, as if someone were slowly chiseling it open.

"...Thank you."

As she turned, she missed the sudden pallor of his face.

In the elevator lobby, Emily mechanically pressed the down button.

Ding—

The doors slid open, releasing a wave of cologne. She instinctively stepped back, only to hear a low chuckle.

"In such a hurry to leave?"

Alexander Johnson's figure blocked the light, casting a shadow over her. He pressed the door-close button. As the metal doors began to shut, Emily lunged for the emergency stop.

"Hel—"

Her cry was cut off by the elevator's descending hum.

Grace Lee shot to her feet, high heels leaving chaotic imprints on the carpet. She spun toward the vice president's office, the glass door shuddering violently as she pushed through.
###Chapter 203

"Vice President Johnson, something terrible has happened!" Grace Lee rushed into the office, breathless. "Emily Smith is screaming for help in the elevator!"

William Johnson's eyes snapped open, a cold glint flashing in them.

He shoved his chair back and strode toward the elevator bank. Grace stumbled after him in her high heels.

The display showed the numbers rapidly descending. William slammed his fist against the down button. "Who's with her?"

"The receptionist said..." Grace swallowed hard. "It's President Alexander Johnson."

William's jaw tightened, his knuckles turning white.

Another elevator arrived just then. Spotting that Emily's elevator had stopped at the basement level, William immediately stepped inside.

Inside the elevator, Emily pressed her back against the cold metal wall. Alexander had one hand planted beside her head, the other reaching to tilt her chin up.

"Don't be shy, sweetheart," he said with a greasy smile. "Stick with me, and I'll give you everything you could ever want."

Emily clutched her collar tightly. "President Johnson, this is work hours."

"Work is so boring," Alexander whispered near her ear. "Why don't we have some fun instead?"

Ding—

The elevator doors suddenly opened. Before Alexander could react, a kick sent him sprawling to the floor.

William yanked Emily behind him, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Alexander Johnson, you're asking for death."

Alexander scrambled up, his face twisted with rage. "William Johnson! How dare you—"

"If there's a next time," William said slowly, enunciating each word, "I'll make sure you leave BestTech Group on a stretcher."

Shielding Emily, he turned to leave. Grace hastily pressed the close button.

In the confined space, William's burning gaze swept over Emily. "Where did he touch you?"

"I'm fine," Emily said, retreating half a step into the corner. "Thank you, Vice President Johnson."

She turned to Grace. "Please press the 50th floor."

Grace glanced at William's expression and didn't dare move.

William suddenly erupted. "Emily Smith! Did you deliberately put yourself in his path?"

Grace shrank back in fear.

Emily lifted her head calmly. "Yes, I'm an idiot." The corner of her mouth curled into a mocking smile. "Is that the answer you wanted?"

The air in the elevator froze instantly.
###Chapter 204

William Johnson's eyes darkened instantly, a terrifying storm brewing in their depths. His jawline tensed, his Adam's apple bobbed, and his knuckles turned white from gripping too hard.

The air inside the elevator seemed to freeze.

Emily Smith refused to look at him. She reached out and pressed the button for the 50th floor. The metal emitted a crisp click.

"Ding—"

The moment the doors parted slightly, she slipped out sideways. Her retreating figure was resolute, never once looking back.

William closed his eyes briefly, his lips curling into a self-deprecating smile.

......

A week passed, and that tall, imposing figure never reappeared in the office.

In the break room, Emily held her coffee cup as colleagues whispered, "I heard Vice President Johnson went on a business trip to Europe."

Her fingers trembled slightly, sending ripples across the surface of her coffee.

Her resignation had already been approved. Handing over her tasks methodically felt like saying goodbye to her past self with each completed file.

"Are you really leaving?" A colleague clutched her hand reluctantly.

Emily smiled and nodded. "It's not like we'll never see each other again."

Her phone screen lit up—a message from Daniel Chen: "Dinner at my place tonight?"

At the dinner table, Daniel shot up from his seat when he heard about her resignation. The chair screeched against the floor.

"That's great!" He seized her hands, his eyes shining brightly. "Now you can focus on voice acting."

Emily lowered her gaze to their intertwined fingers and murmured a soft, "Mhm."

Daniel suddenly stilled. He took a deep breath and leaned in slowly.

She saw his lashes tremble, his breathing growing uneven.

The moment their lips touched, Emily instinctively stiffened. Daniel's kiss was gentle and restrained, tentative with caution.

When his hand slid to her waist, Emily shoved him away abruptly.

"Bang!"

Daniel collided with the dining table behind him, sending a glass toppling over.

They both spoke at the same time:

"Sorry!"

Emily hurried to steady him, but her fingers recoiled the instant they brushed his warm skin.

"I was too hasty." Daniel's ears flushed red, his voice low and rough.

She shook her head, nails digging into her palms. "I just need more time."

Daniel suddenly smiled, the corners of his eyes softening. "Okay."

He tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and asked softly, "Want to try again?"

Emily froze.
###Chapter 205

Daniel Chen's fingers lightly traced Emily Smith's nose bridge, his eyes brimming with tenderness.

"Just kidding," he suddenly said seriously. "I have a business trip with the station leaders tomorrow. It'll take about three or four days."

Emily looked up at him.

"I've already arranged for a driver," he brushed away the stray hairs on her forehead. "He'll pick you up from Leap Studios on time every day."

Ever since the incident with David Brown, Daniel never dared to let her take a taxi alone. He had contacted a trusted driver he'd worked with for years to ensure her safety.

"Okay," she nodded obediently. "Do you want me to see you off?"

"No need. We're leaving as a group." His fingertips lingered near her ear. "Remember to eat on time and rest early. Call me immediately if anything happens."

"Alright."

Daniel's absence made Emily's life suddenly feel empty. Her resignation was being processed, and no new projects were assigned to her.

Time stretched endlessly before her.

After work, she still went to voice acting sessions and visited her sister at the hospital whenever possible. But a hollow ache had settled deep inside her, leaving her restless.

She'd never felt this way when she was alone before. Even with Mia Harris by her side, the emptiness clung to her like a shadow.

This void hadn't started with Daniel's departure—it had been growing silently until it became impossible to ignore.

Daniel video-called her the night he left. But in the dead of night, the weight of her emotions kept her tossing and turning for two hours before she finally fell asleep.

Mia came over specifically to keep her company. Lying in bed, they chatted aimlessly, and Emily felt slightly better.

On the third morning, as Emily finished handing over her last tasks, her phone vibrated three times.

Three MMS messages from an unknown number appeared on her screen.

When she opened the first photo, her pupils constricted violently.

No. This couldn't be real.

Her trembling fingers zoomed in. The man passionately kissing a stranger was unmistakably Daniel.

In the second photo, his shirt was already off, his skin pressed against the woman's.

The third was a direct bedroom shot. The angle deliberately focused on his face—clear and painfully sharp.

Emily's breath caught as if an invisible hand had seized her throat.

Daniel's eyes in the photos were alert, showing no signs of being drugged.

She snapped her phone shut and took a deep breath.

It had to be photoshopped. With today's technology, face-swapping was effortless.

Or... he'd been set up.

Just as she tried to console herself, her phone vibrated again. The caller ID showed the same unknown number.

Her blood ran cold.

She didn't need to answer to know the caller's intentions. The humiliating words of Daniel's mother echoed in her ears.

"Emily? You look pale," Lily White said worriedly, leaning closer.

Emily stood up abruptly. "I need to take this call."

She practically fled to the restroom, her phone burning like a branding iron in her hand.
###Chapter 206

Emily Smith walked into the bathroom just as the call ended automatically.

She let out a long breath.

Her reflection in the mirror showed a pale face. She was about to set her phone down to wash up when it rang again.

The same unknown number.

This time, she answered.

"Who is this?" Her voice was eerily calm.

"Emily Smith, right?" A haughty female voice came through.

Her brows furrowed slightly. "Yes."

"I'm Sophia Song. Did you see the photos?" The woman cut straight to the point.

Emily smirked. "Nicely taken. But I'd rather hear Daniel explain it himself."

"Daniel and I grew up together. The Chen family has always seen me as their future daughter-in-law." Sophia's tone dripped with smugness. "Uncle Chen is already arranging his transfer back to W City."

"Miss Song seems quite invested in my boyfriend. How long have you been planning this?" Emily shot back.

"The Chens despise you. Daniel will realize soon enough that you're not good enough for him." Sophia pressed on aggressively. "Last night was his choice. He said he'd take responsibility."

Emily's throat tightened. "Thanks for the heads-up. I'll wait to hear it from him."

The moment she hung up, her hands braced against the sink.

Her legs trembled so badly she could barely stand.

......

That evening during their video call, Emily forced a smile.

After a few minutes, she feigned exhaustion.

Daniel Chen, ever the gentleman, quickly wished her goodnight.

Once the call ended, she crawled into Mia Harris's bed.

In the darkness, silent tears rolled down her cheeks.

But after crying, she felt oddly lighter.

At twenty-two, why should she be trapped by love?

Romance was just a bonus. She could still live a full life without it.

She had made up her mind.

When Daniel returned, she'd hear his explanation. If he chose to end things, she'd wish him well.

If they stayed together, she'd take it as it came.

The next day at work, she carried her coffee toward the break room.

"Emily's quitting soon. Aren't you going to confess?" A male colleague's voice drifted out.

She froze.

"Those innocent-looking types are always wild in private," another voice chimed in.

"Fun to date, but good luck keeping up."

"Just for fun. What's there to worry about?"

......
###Chapter 207 

"It's just for fun. What's there to be afraid of?"

"You seem so invested. Don't tell me you've got a thing for Emily Smith too?"

The male colleague scoffed. "Of course I like her. With that figure and face, what man wouldn't be tempted?"

"Then why don't you ask her out?"

"Someone like me—do you really think Emily would spare me a second glance?"

Emily stood around the corner, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms. She turned and walked toward another break room, her steps quicker than usual.

The BestTech building housed nearly two hundred employees on the first floor alone, so there were naturally multiple break rooms. She never imagined that colleagues who always smiled at her would talk about her like this behind her back.

As her workload at BestTech decreased, Emily poured more energy into her voice-acting gigs. Before she knew it, Daniel Chen had been away on his business trip for four days.

During their video call, Daniel mentioned he still had unfinished business in W City and would be delayed by two days.

"It's fine. Focus on your work—don’t worry about me," Emily said with a smile into the camera.

"Emily, I miss you," Daniel murmured from the other side of the screen, his eyes dim but filled with longing.

Emily blinked, catching what seemed like a flicker of guilt in his expression.

"We see each other every day through video calls," she said softly.

"It's not the same," Daniel replied, his voice low. "I can't touch you. I can't smell your scent."

Emily pressed her lips together and nodded. "Then come back soon. I'll be waiting."

......

On the day of Daniel’s return, Emily took half a day off to meet him at the airport.

When Daniel emerged from the arrivals gate, dragging his suitcase behind him, Emily immediately noticed how haggard he looked—dark circles shadowed his eyes.

"Daniel!"

Only when she called out did he snap out of his daze and look up. The moment he recognized her, his eyes lit up.

"Emily!"

Daniel dropped his suitcase and rushed toward her in long strides, pulling her into a tight embrace. He buried his face in her hair, inhaling deeply as if starved for her presence.

Emily stood still, feeling the steady thud of his heartbeat against her. In that moment, she was certain—Daniel loved her.

Even if something had happened between him and Sophia Song, as long as he didn’t bring up breaking up, she was willing to forgive him this once.

"I missed you every second I was gone," Daniel whispered, his voice trembling. "Did you miss me?"

Emily lifted a hand to gently stroke his back. "I missed you too."

Not far away, a black sedan idled silently. William Johnson watched the embracing couple through the window, his gaze dark and unreadable.

"Wait," he suddenly said.

The driver hit the brakes. Sam Wilson, sitting in the passenger seat, frowned and turned around—only to see William staring intently at the pair, his expression inscrutable.

It wasn’t until Daniel led Emily into a taxi that William finally looked away, closing his eyes wearily.

"Let’s go," he said flatly.

The car rolled forward, leaving the airport behind.
###Chapter 208

The taxi glided smoothly down the street. Daniel Chen's gaze remained fixed on Emily Smith's face, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Have you been skipping meals again these past few days?" He reached out to gently touch her cheek. "Your chin has gotten sharper."

Emily swatted his hand away, her eyes lingering on the dark circles under his eyes. "You're one to talk. Look at yourself—you're practically a panda."

Daniel chuckled, fine lines appearing at the corners of his eyes. "That bad?"

"If your fans saw you like this..." Emily deliberately drew out her words.

Daniel was undeniably handsome. As a television host, he had perfectly symmetrical features and a warm demeanor, his smile as comforting as a spring breeze.

He was nothing like William Johnson. That man's features were too sharp, his gaze perpetually distant, as though he stood above the clouds looking down on the world.

Emily abruptly cut off the thought.

Why was she comparing the two of them? William was already a stranger to her.

"What others think doesn't matter." Daniel suddenly took her hand, his palm warm and dry. "As long as you like it, that's enough."

Emily pressed her lips together in a small smile. "I took the afternoon off. I'll cook you something good to make up for it."

"Really?" His eyes lit up.

"Don't get your hopes up," she warned. "I'm nowhere near as good as you."

Daniel tightened his grip on her hand. "Anything you make, I'll love it."

William returned alone to his apartment at Jinzhou Bay No. 1.

Amanda Lin wasn't there. To her, this apartment was more like a temporary stopover—she only appeared when William was around.

He was used to solitude. Over the years, though many loyal people had gathered around him, he never reported his whereabouts to anyone.

Just as he finished showering, the doorbell rang abruptly.

William picked up his wine glass and walked to the security monitor. Olivia Davis's face was clearly visible on the screen, her makeup flawless, her lips curved in a smug smile.

He took a sip of wine and leisurely made his way to the door.

"William!" Olivia's eyes brightened.

The man had just stepped out of the shower, water still dripping from his hair. The collar of his robe was slightly open, revealing the sharp lines of his collarbone. She inhaled deeply, as though she could catch the scent of his shower gel.

William responded with a cold hum and turned toward the living room.

Unfazed by his indifference, Olivia followed barefoot. She had come with explosive news.

The balcony offered a sweeping view of the city bathed in golden sunset light. William leaned against the railing, his posture as straight and unyielding as a pine tree.

"I have something to show you." Olivia pulled a manila envelope from her bag and stepped beside him.

William didn't turn around, merely swirling his wine glass.

Undeterred, Olivia held the envelope out to him. "Take a look."

After a few seconds of silence, William finally turned and sat on the sofa. He set down his glass and took the envelope.

Olivia watched his every move, her eyes glittering with excitement.

Just as the envelope was about to be opened, William suddenly looked up, his sharp gaze piercing straight through her.
###Chapter 209

William Johnson's slender fingers paused at the edge of the envelope.

He lifted his gaze, sweeping Olivia Davis's face with an inscrutable look.

A faint smirk playing on his lips, he tossed the envelope onto the coffee table and sank into the sofa, closing his eyes.

"Just look at it!" Olivia stomped in frustration, grabbing his arm. "This will show you that bitch's true colors!"

William lazily opened one eye. "How true?"

Fuming, Olivia snatched the envelope and dumped the photos across the table.

"Open your damn eyes!" she spat through gritted teeth. "This is the saint you've worshipped for over a decade!"

The photos clearly showed Amanda Lin entangled with Alexander Johnson.

William's gaze drifted over them, his expression as indifferent as if reviewing mundane documents.

"Your precious woman is nothing but trash!" Olivia's voice trembled with excitement. "Worse than that little slut Emily Smith!"

William's fingers tapped lightly against his glass.

Suddenly he remembered Emily's damp eyes beneath him.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he took a long drink.

"They're different," he said flatly after swallowing.

Olivia froze.

This reaction wasn't what she'd expected.

"Are you insane?" she shrieked. "Amanda's sleeping with your brother! She's cheating on you!"

William swirled his drink with an amused smile. "And?"

"Break off the engagement!" Olivia trembled with rage. "That whore doesn't deserve the Johnson name!"

"On what grounds?" he asked idly.

"She's having an affair! With Alexander! Isn't that enough?"

William suddenly laughed. "You want me to announce to the world that the Johnson heir slept with my fiancée?"

"So what!" Olivia snapped. "Sophia Song would break off her engagement too once she finds out!"

"Then what?" He stood, looking down at her. "Who bears the consequences when the Johnson-Song alliance collapses?"

Olivia's mouth opened, then closed as realization dawned. "You...you're afraid?"

William turned toward the bedroom, his posture straight as a pine.

"William Johnson!" Olivia chased after him. "Are you really this spineless? Can't even control your own woman?"

The slamming door was his only reply.
###Chapter 210

Ever since Amanda Lin moved into the master bedroom, William Johnson had relocated to the guest room.

"William, say something. Are you afraid your parents will blame you for everything?" Olivia Davis pressed relentlessly.

The Davis family knew all too well how biased William's parents were. Right or wrong, they always sided with Alexander Johnson.

From childhood, William had been the one sacrificed.

Most of his time was spent living with his uncle, Henry Johnson.

Later, Alexander effortlessly entered BestTech Group and became CEO within five years.

Meanwhile, William was barred from BestTech and spent years building his career abroad.

If not for Henry's illness requiring overseas treatment—leaving BestTech without leadership—William would never have returned.

William stepped into the guest room, blocking Olivia as she tried to follow. A faint smile curved his lips. "I have a dinner meeting. Need to change."

His voice was gentle, his smile mesmerizing.

Olivia stared, momentarily dazed.

"Take me with you?" she cooed.

William arched a brow, pretending to consider it. "Not this time."

Seizing her hesitation, he closed the door.

Olivia snapped out of it and walked away.

If William wanted to avoid conflict, she didn’t. She longed for chaos—preferably to ruin Alexander's favor and turn that bitch Amanda into public enemy number one.

Emily Smith and Daniel Chen returned from the supermarket, arms laden with fresh groceries.

The moment they entered, Emily nudged Daniel toward the bathroom. "Go shower and rest. I'll cook."

When he emerged, clean and ready to help, she shooed him out.

He pulled her into an embrace. "Emily, I don’t want to spend a single day apart from you."

She laughed softly. "I know! You must be exhausted after your business trip. Go relax—dinner will be ready in an hour."

Daniel released her, hesitating as if he wanted to say more.

Then his phone rang.

His expression darkened at the caller ID. He stepped onto the balcony to answer.

Through the closed kitchen door, Emily caught only a muffled shout.

She glanced toward the balcony but kept chopping vegetables.

Within an hour, four dishes and a soup were ready.

As she set the table, she noticed Daniel still on the balcony, smoking.

Five cigarette butts filled the ashtray.

"Daniel." She approached, frowning.

He spun around, hastily stubbing out the cigarette.

His eyes were bloodshot, his emotions barely contained.

"What’s wrong?" Emily asked gently.

Daniel forced a smile. "Work issues. Got chewed out by my boss."

She didn’t press. Instead, she hugged him. "Mistakes happen. Just learn from them."

Feeling his anguish, she had already forgiven him.

"Emily..." He held her tightly, finally murmuring, "I’ll do better."

"Mm. Let’s eat."

Daniel devoured every bite, clearing his plate.

After dinner, he insisted on washing the dishes.

His phone buzzed on the couch. The screen flashed: "Sophia Song."

Emily’s gaze flickered. She picked it up and carried it toward the kitchen.
###Chapter 211

"Daniel, your phone." Emily's voice came from the kitchen doorway.

Daniel Chen was washing dishes, the faucet running loudly. He turned off the water, shook droplets from his hands, and reached for his phone.

The name "Sophia Song" on the screen made his pupils constrict.

"What's wrong?" Emily noticed his tension.

"Nothing." He quickly declined the call and shoved the phone back into his pocket. "Just a telemarketer."

He avoided meeting her gaze.

But Emily kept her eyes locked on him. As he turned the faucet back on, she suddenly pressed a hand against his arm.

"Daniel, Sophia called me."

His spine stiffened instantly.

"She sent me photos of you two." Emily's voice was soft. "I know what happened."

Water dripped from the faucet. Daniel slowly turned, pain and guilt swirling in his eyes.

"I was drunk that night," he said, his voice trembling. "I thought she was you."

Emily studied him calmly. "When did you realize?"

"After I woke up." His fists clenched. "Emily, these past few days—"

She suddenly pressed a finger to his lips. "I believe you."

Daniel froze.

"You're really not angry?" he asked cautiously.

Emily shook her head. "But Daniel, what about your parents—"

"No!" He grabbed her shoulders abruptly. "Unless you say the word, nothing will tear us apart!"

He pulled her into a tight embrace. "You're worth everything to me."

Emily rested her head against his shoulder, a shadow flickering in her eyes.

She couldn't bear to see him sacrifice everything.

——

In the private room of an upscale club, crystal chandeliers cast dazzling reflections.

William Johnson clinked glasses with several tech moguls while his phone vibrated persistently in his pocket.

He glanced at the caller ID—Henry Johnson.

Declined. Turned on airplane mode.

Amanda Lin sipped her red wine elegantly, her lips curved in a flawless smile as she noted his actions.

Across the table, Robert Miller's phone lit up. He checked the screen and excused himself hurriedly.

A moment later, he leaned in to whisper in William's ear. "The Chairman demands your immediate return to the family estate."

William swirled his wine glass. "No rush."

Amanda arched a questioning brow.

Robert hesitated, then retreated to his seat in silence.

The crystal glasses chimed, and the dinner continued under an unspoken tension.
###Chapter 212

The phone buzzed incessantly in her bag. Amanda Lin glanced at the caller ID and declined Shen Huaiqing's call for the third time.

The tech elites in the private room exchanged knowing looks before politely excusing themselves. Amanda maintained her graceful smile until the last guest had left.

The black Maybach glided out of the club. Finally, Amanda retrieved her phone from her bag. The moment the screen lit up, her pupils constricted sharply.

Thirty-seven missed calls.

The red notification dot on WeChat kept climbing. Her fingers trembled as she opened the call log—most were from her father, with a few from close friends.

William Johnson reclined against the leather seat, eyes closed. Amanda bit her lip and dialed her father.

"You finally answer?!" His roar nearly shattered the car speakers. "Get your ass to the Shen residence now!"

Amanda instinctively looked at William. The man didn't even flinch, as if he'd anticipated this storm.

"Dad, what—"

"If I don't see you in thirty minutes, consider yourself disowned!" The line went dead with a violent click.

Clutching the overheated phone, she whispered, "Can we stop by the mansion first?"

William finally opened his eyes, his gaze fathomless. "It's on the way."

Neon lights flickered outside the window. When Amanda tapped the link her friend had sent, her nails scraped the screen with a grating sound.

Nine GIFs dominated the trending list. Her arched neck and Alexander Johnson's contorted expression were unmistakable beyond the censored blur.

"You knew already?" Her voice was ice.

William turned, his eyes skimming her trembling screen. "Alexander knows your habits well."

Those practiced movements couldn't lie.

Amanda suddenly laughed, the corners of her eyes turning crimson. "Because you wouldn't touch me."

The car plunged into silence.

"Why did you agree to the marriage alliance?" She seized William's sleeve.

He pried her fingers off one by one. "I was waiting for your confession."

Streetlights flickered across Amanda's bloodless face. "What if I were—"

"No what-ifs." William pressed the partition button. "We're here."
###Chapter 213

Amanda Lin's touch made William Johnson stiffen.

Even with Emily Smith's image in his mind, Amanda's proximity doused him like a bucket of cold water.

Perhaps it was because of her sordid history with Alexander Johnson.

"Hahaha—" Amanda suddenly erupted into hysterical laughter.

When the laughter ceased abruptly, her face was streaked with tears.

"It's all your fault!" She grabbed William's collar, her nails digging into his skin. "William Johnson, you ruined me!"

William kept his eyes shut.

Not even his lashes fluttered. Only the faint crease between his brows betrayed his emotions.

Amanda's breakdown lasted just thirty seconds.

The woman who'd spent her life scheming to marry into wealth quickly regained her composure.

"Will you still marry me?" She wiped her tears, her voice steady now.

"You're out of my league." William's tone was as indifferent as if he were discussing the weather.

Amanda's nails bit into her palms.

"Then at least help me marry Alexander Johnson." She took a deep breath. "You owe me that."

Silence stretched through the car.

"I'll try." He finally uttered those two words.

The Johnson family mansion was shrouded in the eerie calm before a storm.

Those scandalous videos and photos had spread like wildfire across the internet, dominating the top ten trending spots on every major platform with Alexander and Amanda's names.

By the time Henry Johnson mobilized all his connections to suppress the news, the damage was irreversible.

The Song family's statement arrived faster than expected.

Their one-sided termination of the engagement was publicly announced on their official website, without even the pretense of courtesy.

"You disgrace!"

Henry's polished shoe slammed into Alexander's chest.

Sophia Song screamed and threw herself over her son. "Are you trying to kill him?"

Alexander spat out a mouthful of blood and smirked. "Father, have you considered this might be William's scheme?"

"Exactly!" Sophia clung to this lifeline. "That bastard must've sent that slut to seduce Alexander!"

Alexander stared at his father's livid face and enunciated each word: "He's been setting this trap for a long time, waiting for today."
###Chapter 214

"Have you lost your mind?" William Johnson Sr. pointed at Alexander Johnson, veins bulging on his forehead. "Amanda Lin is your brother's girlfriend! How could you fall for her advances?"

Sophia Song quickly stepped in front of her son. "Alexander must have been drunk—maybe even drugged by William!" She glared at Alexander. "Tell your father the truth!"

Alexander caught on immediately. "Yes! Someone must have drugged me!"

William Sr. let out a cold laugh.

After decades in the business world, he had seen every trick in the book. But some things, he preferred to pretend not to notice.

"The Johnson family will be ruined by you sooner or later." He rubbed his temples wearily.

Sophia forced a smile. "Alexander may be reckless, but he’s sharp in business."

The butler stepped forward. "Mr. and Mrs. Lin have arrived."

"What about William and Amanda?"

"The young master said they’ll be here in twenty minutes."

William Sr. stormed downstairs with a dark expression. In the hall, Mr. and Mrs. Lin sat fidgeting nervously.

They feared the Johnsons’ retaliation—but secretly hoped to force Alexander into marrying Amanda. Wouldn’t that turn disaster into fortune?

"Mr. Johnson," Mr. Lin said, rubbing his hands together. "About this matter... I have a solution that benefits both sides."

William Sr. raised an eyebrow.

"Why not have the eldest young master marry Amanda?" Mrs. Lin blurted. "It’s the best outcome for both families."

"Dream on!" William Sr. slammed the table and stood.

Just then, William Jr. entered with Amanda.

"Father. Mother." His tone was calm.

Amanda greeted them timidly. Sophia sneered. "How dare you show your face here?"

"Auntie, it was Alexander who threatened me—"

"Bullshit!" Alexander exploded. "Everyone knows you’ve been scheming to become the Johnson family’s daughter-in-law!"

William Jr. scoffed. "How many women have you slept with, brother? If the Song family finds out, your engagement will be called off anyway." He gave Alexander a meaningful look. "Why would I bother setting you up?"
###Chapter 215

"William, stop twisting the truth!"

Emily didn't wait for Alexander to speak, launching her attack first. Her icy gaze bore into William, her voice dripping with venom. "Your brother was clearly drugged by Amanda. She set him up. Isn't this all part of your scheme with that vile woman?"

"Drugged?" William arched a brow, a mocking glint in his eyes. "Mother, your eyesight may be failing, but the videos online are crystal clear. Alexander didn’t look the least bit out of his mind."

"Exactly! The young master was perfectly lucid!" Lin Zhengyou couldn’t resist chiming in, but he shrank back under Emily’s withering glare.

William turned to Henry, who had remained silent. "Father, do you really think I’d gamble with the Johnson family’s reputation?"

Henry frowned deeply before finally speaking. "Hard to say."

"It was him!" Alexander snarled in agreement, a flash of triumph in his eyes.

William suddenly smiled—a cold, humorless smile that sent chills down the spine.

"If you don’t believe me, I have a recording of the young master’s own words," Amanda interjected calmly, pulling out her phone. "I recorded our call."

The moment the recording played, Alexander’s face twisted in horror. He lunged at Amanda, snatching the phone and smashing it to the ground.

"Breaking it won’t help," Amanda said coolly, smoothing her hair. "I have plenty of backups. Should I upload them online and let the public decide?"

Her words struck Henry and Emily like a knife. Their faces darkened with fury, their eyes promising Amanda a slow, painful death. Lin Zhengyou and Liang Meng, however, barely concealed their glee.

Alexander completely lost control. He seized Amanda by the throat, his face contorted with rage. "You bitch! How dare you scheme against me? I’ll kill you!"

Amanda’s face turned blue as she gasped for air, yet no one moved to help. Lin Zhengyou wrung his hands in distress but froze under Emily’s sharp command.

William watched coldly, only stepping in when Amanda was on the verge of passing out. He gripped Alexander’s wrist. "Brother, are you planning to commit murder in front of everyone?"

Alexander ignored him, tightening his grip. Amanda’s lips began turning purple.

"Young master, if Amanda dies, you’ll—" Lin Zhengyou stammered fearfully.

"Silence!" Emily snapped. "That wretch deserves to die!"

Just as Amanda was about to lose consciousness, William twisted Alexander’s arm with brutal force. Alexander cried out in pain and released her.

Amanda collapsed to the floor, coughing violently as she clutched her throat. Alexander shook his sore wrist, then swung a fist at William.

William dodged effortlessly, seizing Alexander’s arm with a cold laugh. "Instead of throwing a tantrum, brother, you should be thinking about how to clean up this mess."

"Enough!" Henry finally roared, slamming his hand on the table. His face darkened as he turned to William. "Issue a statement immediately to call off the engagement. I’ll handle the rest."

With that, he stormed out. Emily rushed to shield Alexander, barking at the butler, "Call the doctor! Now!"
###Chapter 216

The studio lights cast a focused glow on Emily Smith's profile. From dusk till midnight, she immersed herself in voicing a game character, oblivious to the storm brewing outside.

William Johnson's car pulled up right on time. Through the window, he watched Emily emerge, his phone screen still illuminated with the breaking scandal about the Johnson family. He pressed his lips together and remained silent.

"What's got you so absorbed?" William turned the steering wheel, catching Emily's suddenly rigid posture in his peripheral vision.

On her phone screen, Mia Harris's looping GIF made Emily's fingers tremble. The explicit images twisted her stomach into knots.

"The Johnsons are in trouble," she murmured, her voice hoarse and unfamiliar.

William chuckled. "Two brothers sharing a woman—now that's scandalous."

Neon lights flickered across Emily's face through the window. She thought of William's ever-smiling eyes, now undoubtedly dimmed.

At the red light, William turned abruptly. "Do you think he'll still marry her?"

"Does it matter?" Emily locked her phone. "I'm leaving BestTech in two weeks."

William's grip on the wheel loosened. He reached for her icy fingers. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have—"

"We ended long ago." Emily cut him off with a flawless smile. "The moment he slid that ring onto Amanda Lin's finger."

No one saw the glimmer of tears in her eyes under the cover of night.

At dawn, William's private jet pierced the clouds. Standing before the gym's floor-to-ceiling windows, he hung up on Henry Johnson, sweat dripping down his jawline.

"Chart a course to Switzerland," he told Zhang Xiao'an behind him, his voice eerily calm.

The stock market's opening bell tolled like a funeral knell. WorldDing's shares plummeted, dragging BestTech's screens into the red. Yet the office was unnervingly quiet—every employee had received William's email sent in the early hours.

"Word is Vice President Johnson flew to Switzerland," Lily White whispered. "Honestly, that woman should've—"

Emily's fingers paused over the keyboard. "Matters of the heart are unpredictable."

A notification popped up in the corner of her screen. William's profile picture stood out, followed by three simple words:

Wait for me.
###Chapter 217

Emily Smith stared at her phone screen, her finger hovering midair.

A message from William Johnson sat quietly in the chatbox—an English document. Before she could open it, the message was recalled.

"Sorry, wrong person."

Just four simple words, yet they made her heart skip a beat.

She set the phone aside and returned to the contract in front of her. But the dense clauses suddenly felt foreign, every letter dancing before her eyes.

In a Swiss sanatorium, William gazed at his phone. The snow-capped Alps outside cast a glow on his sharp profile, deepening the shadows of his eyes.

His slender fingers tapped the screen again, sending another message.

When her phone vibrated, Emily nearly knocked over her coffee. She took a deep breath and opened the lengthy text.

"Could you please..."

The polite phrasing was nothing like the William she remembered. When had the once-arrogant man learned to say "please" and "thank you"?

She lost herself in the screen until her computer's auto-lock chime snapped her back.

Knock knock—

Director Li was reviewing quarterly reports when his office door opened. Seeing Emily at the threshold, he looked surprised.

"Vice President Johnson said you didn’t answer his call," Emily relayed, her voice eerily calm.

Director Li checked his phone, finding no missed calls. Still, he nodded. "I’ll call him back right away."

Night deepened in Switzerland.

William stood in the hospital corridor, phone pressed to his ear. When Director Li mentioned "Emily," the tension in his jaw finally eased.

After hanging up, he sent one last message.

"Thank you."

Three simple words, yet they seemed to drain him completely.

A soft sound came from the room. The nurse called gently, "Mr. Johnson is awake."

He pocketed his phone. By the time he turned around, the warmth in his eyes had vanished, replaced by the cool composure of the Johnson family heir.
###Chapter 218

"Uncle."

William pushed open the hospital room door and saw Henry struggling to rise from the bed. He quickly stepped forward, steadying the older man's frail shoulders with firm hands.

Chemotherapy had ravaged Henry's once-strong frame, leaving him gaunt and fragile. Leaning on William's support, he stood with effort. "Walk with me," he murmured.

"Should I get the wheelchair?" William frowned.

Henry waved him off. "Not yet."

William chuckled softly. "You'll always be the legend of the business world to me."

Their eyes met in quiet understanding as they moved toward the exit.

The elite Swiss sanatorium nestled at the foot of the Alps offered air so pure it cleansed the soul. Yet no medical marvel could halt death's approach.

Henry had long since moved past denial into acceptance. Perhaps fate balanced scales—granting unparalleled professional success while claiming health and longevity.

"What will you do about Amanda and Alexander?"

Beneath dappled sunlight filtering through leaves, Henry's pale face turned serious as they settled on a garden bench.

William had anticipated this conversation. His lips quirked wryly. "I'll follow your guidance."

To him, Henry was more than family—he was mentor and father figure combined.

"End the engagement." Henry exhaled. "Stop punishing yourself."

William lifted his gaze. After a weighted silence, he nodded.

"On one condition," Henry added.

"Name it."

——

BestTech's stock plummeted for four consecutive days.

Daniel's hair grayed from stress, yet he dared not act rashly. William's silence felt like walking on embers.

Meanwhile, William seemed detached from the world—phone silenced, wholly focused on accompanying Henry in Switzerland. Until dawn on the fifth day, when his statement finally broke: the engagement with Amanda Lin was terminated. They would remain friends.

The internet erupted.

Netizens hailed it as "true love's triumph"—how could anyone stay civil after such betrayal? Ten minutes later, Amanda's response detonated like a bomb:

She thanked William's generosity, confessing Alexander was her true love. Their engagement had only been revenge.

Every carefully crafted phrase implied: William had been the desperate pursuer.

The web instantly crowned her "Queen of Manipulators," flooding William's mentions with demands for retaliation. Yet BestTech maintained radio silence.

That afternoon, Alexander was forced into a press conference. A leaked recording left him no choice but to admit the affair—and pledge marriage to Amanda.

The cybersphere exploded anew.
###Chapter 219

The internet exploded with reactions.

Comments were sharply divided.

Half cheered, saying the scumbag and his shameless mistress deserved each other—better they stay locked together than ruin other people's lives.

The other half directed their fury at Amanda Lin, firing off vicious insults like machine-gun rounds.

With the press conference over, the farce finally came to an end.

After all the twists and turns, Amanda and the Lin family emerged as the biggest winners.

Who cared if their reputation was in tatters?

The internet's memory was shorter than a goldfish's. In a few days, new scandals would overshadow this one.

And Amanda Lin? She was about to become the rightful young madam of the Johnson family.

The entire Lin household must be laughing in their dreams. Who would've thought the worst scandal would fulfill their greatest ambition?

But greed knows no bounds. There would come a day when even tears wouldn't save her.

For Emily Smith, time passed both slowly and quickly.

In the blink of an eye, it was her last day at BestTech.

A full month had passed since Vice President Johnson approved her resignation. They hadn't seen each other since.

Apart from that mistaken text apology and his request to notify Director Lee, there had been no contact between them.

This was good.

She could leave quietly at last.

Perhaps William Johnson would never bother her again.

That was exactly what she wanted.

Since it was her final day, Emily didn't have to wait until the end of her shift. After packing her things, she could leave early.

At noon, she treated her entire team to lunch.

Before heading out, she specifically told Michael Thompson, "Boss, if you try to pay this time, I'll pretend I don't know you the next time we meet."

Michael laughed and raised his hands in surrender. "Fine, fine. I won't fight you for the bill. It'd be embarrassing if you ignored me later."

They went to One Taste Restaurant and reserved a private room.

Everyone was reluctant to see Emily go, but they were happy for her new opportunities.

Just as they raised their tea cups in a toast to her bright future, the door suddenly swung open.

Seven or eight waiters filed in, carrying the restaurant's most expensive signature dishes and two bottles of premium red wine worth six figures each.

The entire table froze.

"Did you get the wrong room? We didn't order these," Lily White said, bewildered.

The manager smiled warmly. "This is a special gift from Mr. Johnson to Miss Emily Smith."

Mr. Johnson? Miss Smith?

Everyone exchanged glances before turning to Emily in unison.

Emily's heartbeat spiked. Her fingers unconsciously tightened around the hem of her clothes.

Only she and Michael knew who this "Mr. Johnson" was.

"Could it be Vice President Johnson?" a colleague suddenly realized.

Michael glanced at Emily and smoothly defused the tension. "Possibly. After all, Vice President Johnson and Emily's cousin were classmates. It's natural for him to show some consideration."

He eyed the wine the waiters were about to open. "But let's not uncork that. We still have work this afternoon."

"Mr. Johnson said everyone gets the afternoon off. Please enjoy," the manager added.

"Where is he?" Emily abruptly stood up.

"He just left, I believe."

Before the manager finished speaking, Emily was already rushing out of the room.
###Chapter 220

Emily's high heels clicked urgently against the marble floor as she rushed out of the restaurant.

The elevator doors were sliding shut.

"Wait!" She thrust her hand into the sensor zone, forcing the metal doors open.

William stood at the center of the elevator, his sharp shoulders accentuated by the black suit. A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes before being swallowed by dark intensity.

"Give me the bill." Emily panted, fingers flying across her phone screen. "I'll transfer the money now."

David beside them felt the air pressure plummet.

William suddenly let out a cold laugh and slammed the close button with long fingers.

"Ding—"

Emily stepped into the elevator just in time. The confined space filled with the faint scent of cedar, mingling with the citrusy fragrance from her hair.

"Vice President Johnson." She stubbornly held up her phone. "I don't like owing favors."

William's eyes darkened. He leaned in abruptly, cornering her. His warm breath brushed her ear. "Are you sure you want to settle things this clearly with me?"

The elevator began descending.

David awkwardly turned his face away.

"Yes." Emily met his gaze, her lashes casting delicate shadows under the overhead light. "We're already even."

As the doors slid open, a flash of pink hurled itself inside.

"William!" Olivia wrapped herself around his neck like an octopus. "I came to pick you up!"

Emily retreated half a step, her back pressing against the cold elevator wall.

Olivia finally noticed her presence, her saccharine smile freezing. "What are you doing here?"

"Miss Davis." David intervened smoothly.

Emily silently pressed the close button. In the final second before the doors shut, she heard William's indifferent voice. "She followed me here."

The elevator's ascent made Emily grip her handbag tighter.

Back at the table, Michael was adding food to her plate. "Why the rush? The food's getting cold."

"Ran into someone I know." She forced a smile, her gaze flickering to the window—William was being dragged toward the parking lot by Olivia.

Her phone buzzed.

[10 AM tomorrow. My office.] The sender read "William Johnson."

Emily stared at the message until the screen went dark.

"Try the lobster." Michael's voice pulled her back. "I saved it for you."

She picked up her chopsticks, noticing her fingers trembling slightly.

Meanwhile, in the underground garage, Olivia yelped. "William, you're hurting me!"

He loosened his grip on her wrist, his gaze icy. "Olivia Davis, don't test my patience."

"I don't care!" Olivia rubbed her wrist, tears welling. "You're single now. I'm moving in with you!"

William yanked open the car door without looking back. "Go ahead and try."

As the engine roared, Olivia stomped her foot in frustration. She pulled out her phone and dialed. "Brother! William was mean to me again!"

A weary sigh came through the line. "Olivia, enough is enough."
###Chapter 221

Olivia Davis had always been spoiled rotten.

Her family doted on her endlessly, molding her into someone who feared nothing.

But when it came to cunning schemes, she was sorely lacking.

This time, someone must have guided her to release Alexander Johnson and Amanda Lin's scandalous video to all media outlets simultaneously.

The tactic of "safety in numbers" was brilliantly executed.

No matter how powerful the Johnson family was, they couldn't possibly take on every media outlet at once.

And the only ones who could have given her this idea were the Davises.

After all, during the last incident at the Johnson residence, Sophia Song had taken Amanda Lin's side, humiliating Olivia in public.

This was the Davis family's way of avenging her.

"Hehe—" Olivia lifted her chin smugly at William Johnson's words. "Of course. My parents and brother adore me the most."

William's lips curved slightly. "I have work to attend to."

He withdrew his arm and turned to leave.

"Wait for me!" Olivia hurried after him.

William sidestepped her. "Don't interfere with my work."

Olivia stopped in her tracks, sulking.

This time, she would keep a close eye on William—no other woman would get the chance to steal him away.

......

Emily Smith returned to the restaurant to find the bill had already been settled.

After a brief hesitation, she sent William a WeChat message: [Thank you.]

No reply came.

The private room remained lively.

The two bottles of premium liquor sat untouched.

Back at the office, Emily handed the bottles to Michael Thompson. "Save them for the next gathering."

Michael took them, his knuckles whitening slightly. "We'll open them when you return."

"Okay," she agreed with a smile.

He lowered his head to hide his emotions. "There's a meeting soon. I won't see you off."

He feared he might not be able to stop himself from asking her to stay.

"Mm." Emily nodded firmly. "Thank you, boss."

Michael patted her shoulder before turning to gather everyone for the meeting.

The farewell hug made Emily's eyes sting.

When the conference room door closed, the tears finally spilled over.

For over half a year, her colleagues had treated her like family.

If not for William...

She took a deep breath, quickly packed her belongings, and left carefully prepared gifts on each of their desks.

As she stepped out of BestTech Tower, she paused to look back.

This towering "Sky City" held too many memories.

The subway station swarmed with people.

Clutching her cardboard box, Emily merged into the crowd.

On the 67th floor, William stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, watching her figure grow smaller in the distance.

His chest felt hollow.

Was he really willing to just let her walk away?
###Chapter 222

On her first day after leaving BestTech Group, Emily Smith stretched by the floor-to-ceiling window of Mia Harris's apartment. Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting a golden glow around her.

She pulled out her phone and dialed her Grasshopper Audiobook editor, Yinyin.

"Yinyin, I'm ready to take on a new book."

A delighted squeal came through the phone. "Oh my god! My golden goose finally has time again!"

Emily chuckled. She should've realized sooner—why give up earning opportunities just because William Johnson was the company's vice president? Her voice was genuinely popular, and her fans' love was real.

Yinyin worked quickly, sending over a list of a dozen high-quality titles to choose from. Emily settled on a historical political drama about a lowly palace maid who rises to become empress—right up her alley.

By evening, the kitchen was filled with mouthwatering aromas. Tied in an apron, Emily moved deftly around the stove, her spatula flipping as eight perfectly plated dishes took shape.

"Babe, you're amazing!" Mia held up her phone, snapping pictures frantically. "You could open a private dining business with skills like this!"

Daniel Chen helped set the table, and the three raised their glasses in a toast.

"To Emily's newfound freedom!" Mia declared loudly.

The clink of crystal glasses rang clear. Emily smiled softly. She'd set herself a new goal: earning a million a month. It sounded impossible, but she believed hard work would get her there.

Mia immediately posted the spread on social media, with such exaggerated captions that Emily shook her head.

A notification chimed.

"Who is it?" Emily asked casually.

Mia glanced at her screen. "That playboy George Taylor." Her fingers flew across the keyboard, completely missing Emily's sudden stiffness.

Meanwhile, in a private room at an upscale club...

"Holy shit! Emily can cook?" Ethan Zheng gaped at his phone. "She could be a professional chef!"

George smacked the back of his head. "Keep your dirty thoughts to yourself."

The door swung open as William strode in, his suit jacket draped over his arm, tie loosened, exuding lazy elegance.

"What's all the excitement about?" he asked idly.

After a pause, George handed him the phone. William's gaze dropped to the nine-grid photos—those hands were unmistakable. The final close-up of three overlapping glasses made his eyes turn icy.

"Any plans tonight?" William's voice was deceptively calm. "Invite Mia along."

George understood instantly, pulling out his phone. "I'll arrange it."

William downed his drink in one go, slamming the glass onto the table with a sharp crack.

He was curious to see just how high Emily could fly without his protection.
###Chapter 223

In the luxurious apartment complex of Splendor Heights, Mia Harris's residence buzzed with quiet activity.

Daniel Chen wolfed down his dinner before rushing off to the television station. A late-night talk show awaited his hosting duties.

Mia hovered near the kitchen doorway, peeking in until Emily Smith playfully nudged her away with damp hands.

"Stop causing trouble," Emily chuckled, shaking her head. "I still remember the three plates you broke last time you tried washing dishes."

Mia pouted and wandered into the living room. When Emily finally emerged, drying her hands, Mia suddenly pounced from behind, resting her chin on Emily's shoulder.

"Taking you somewhere fun tonight," Mia whispered, eyes twinkling. "Way more exciting than staying home to write."

Emily opened her mouth to refuse, but Mia covered it with her palm. "Just humor me. This new project's been killing me lately."

Under her best friend's pleading gaze, Emily sighed. "Fine. But we're back by midnight."

Mia whooped with delight and dragged her toward the walk-in closet.

Half an hour later, Mia's crimson sports car pulled up before an elegant courtyard. Red lanterns glowed between dark tiles, their light illuminating the bold calligraphy above the gate: "Serenity House."

George Taylor waved at them from beside a stone lion statue.

"You?" Emily blinked in surprise.

George's smile turned mysterious. "The real surprise is inside."

They followed winding paths through bamboo groves and trickling streams, laughter growing louder with each step. Pushing open carved wooden doors, they entered a warmly lit space where well-dressed guests mingled in small groups.

Ethan Zheng dominated a card table, while Ryan Song conversed by the floor-to-ceiling windows, wineglass in hand. The crowd nodded in greeting as the women entered.

Emily's gaze swept the room. Just as she relaxed, familiar footsteps sounded behind her.

"Looking for me?"

William Johnson's voice brushed against her ear, his breath warm against her neck. Emily stiffened, whirling around so abruptly she nearly collided with his chest.

Mia gasped. "How did you—"

George quickly tugged her arm, shooting her a warning look.

William stood with one hand in his pocket, the other jingling car keys. His intense stare pinned Emily in place. "Not happy to see me?"

Her fingers tightened around her purse strap, nails digging into her palms. "Vice President Johnson must be joking."

"I never joke." In full view of everyone, William suddenly seized her hand. "Especially with you."

A chorus of shocked inhales rippled through the room. Ethan's cards slipped from his fingers. Ryan's wine sloshed over his glass rim.

Emily yanked her hand back, cheeks burning. "Have some decency."

William chuckled lowly before addressing the stunned crowd. "Mind if I borrow the tea station?"

The young woman steeping tea scrambled aside. With effortless grace, William settled onto the cushion, his long fingers arranging the tea set like a practiced ritual.

"Sit." He glanced up at Emily's frozen form and patted the space beside him.

Mia tugged Emily's sleeve. "Maybe we should—"

"No need." Drawing a deep breath, Emily straightened her spine and took the seat opposite him at the low table. "Since we're here, no point ruining everyone's mood."

The corner of William's mouth lifted as he slid a freshly poured cup toward her. In the white porcelain, amber tea leaves shimmered under the overhead lights, casting golden flecks across the surface.

"Try it," he murmured. "Your favorite—Phoenix Oolong."
###Chapter 224

Emily lowered her gaze to the steaming cup of black tea before her, fingertips tracing the rim. She remembered her preference for black tea, but she hadn't expected William to recall it.

The private room was warm, the heating turned up high, yet it couldn't dispel the chill in her chest.

"Miss Smith, care for a taste?" George broke the silence with a perfectly measured smile.

The tea shimmered like amber under the soft lighting. She took a sip, the sweetness of longan blooming on her tongue.

"Good tea," she remarked flatly.

The corner of William's lips lifted as he continued pouring tea for the others. The usually arrogant heirs now accepted their cups with both hands, as if receiving a royal decree.

"How about a game?" George suggested suddenly.

Emily frowned, but before she could refuse, William's deep voice cut in. "Sure."

The game started simply—counting frog legs. When it was William's turn, his slender fingers idly tapped the teapot as he murmured, "Plop."

The sound brushed against eardrums like a feather. The women in the room flushed without realizing it.

The first to falter was a slick-haired playboy. Choosing truth, he boasted, "Five in one day."

Emily sipped her tea, but from the corner of her eye, she caught William staring. His gaze was so tangible it made her skin prickle.

The game continued. A woman in a low-cut dress lost and picked dare. She swayed toward Ethan Zheng, only to be coldly rejected.

"Pay your dues," someone teased.

Without hesitation, she stripped down to her lingerie, chest thrust forward proudly. Emily noted how the woman kept glancing at William and smirked inwardly.

When it was Mia's turn, the question was blunt. "How old were you your first time?"

"Haven't had one yet," Mia answered, drawing whistles. George's eyes visibly brightened.

Emily lifted her cup, letting the steam veil her faint frown. Suddenly, she wondered—what would William choose if he lost?

The thought vanished as quickly as it came. She shouldn't be curious about him at all.
###Chapter 225

By the sixth round of the game, George Taylor unexpectedly miscounted the frog legs.

He had initially chosen a dare, but upon hearing the indecent request, he immediately switched to truth.

"Who do you want to sleep with the most?" someone teased with a smirk.

George's gaze lingered on Mia Harris's face for a moment before he suddenly leaned in and whispered in her ear, "Can I say it's you?"

Mia's face instantly flushed like a ripe apple.

The private room erupted in cheers. The usually bold and carefree Mia now wished she could vanish into thin air. Thankfully, George quickly silenced the crowd.

The game continued. In the seventh round, William Johnson surprisingly miscounted.

"Vice President Johnson, truth or dare?" Everyone stared at him eagerly.

William's eyes locked onto Emily Smith, his lips curling slightly. "Dare."

"I'm going to the restroom," Emily abruptly stood and walked out.

She had barely reached the door when a strong hand gripped her wrist. The next second, she tumbled into a familiar embrace.

Before she could react, his palm cradled the back of her head. His chiseled face loomed closer, and his warm lips pressed against hers.

The room fell dead silent.

Emily's eyes widened. Only when she felt the teasing flick of his tongue did she shove him away with force.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the slap cut through the quiet like a knife.

William didn't even flinch, taking the hit squarely.

"William Johnson, learn some respect," Emily spat coldly before storming out without looking back.

Mia grabbed both their purses and hurried after her.

William remained rooted in place, his tongue pressing against his stinging cheek. A low chuckle escaped him—one laced with unsettling satisfaction, leaving everyone stunned.

"If anyone breathes a word about what happened today..." George's warning glare swept across the room before he quickly followed William.

Emily stopped at the end of the hallway, waiting for Mia.

"I'm so sorry, sweetie. I had no idea he'd be here," Mia said, guilt written all over her face.

Emily shook her head. "It's not your fault. When he wants to see me, he'll find a thousand ways."

Mia stomped her foot in frustration. "That bastard!"

Emily patted her hand. "Let's go."

As they drove away, neither noticed the black Maybach lurking in the shadows. The tinted window rolled up, concealing those dark, fathomless eyes.
###Chapter 226

At 6:30 a.m., Emily Smith's internal clock woke her right on time.

A sliver of light peeked through the curtains. She reached for her phone on the nightstand—the screen showed twenty minutes left before her alarm.

Her new partner at Grasshopper Audiobook was accommodating, scheduling recording sessions before noon. BestTech had also adjusted her schedule, moving meetings from evenings to 3 p.m.

This way, she could always make it to the hospital by dusk to visit her sister.

Her fingers brushed over the calendar. William Johnson's promised foreign specialist was now thirty-seven days overdue. She closed her notebook softly, the metal clasp clicking shut.

The scent of frying eggs drifted from the kitchen. Daniel Chen stood by the stove in a checkered apron, flipping bacon as golden edges crisped around a sunny-side-up egg.

"I thought we agreed I'd sleep in?" Emily leaned against the doorframe, morning light dancing on her lashes.

Daniel didn't turn around. "The nutritionist said fasting over ten hours harms your stomach." His apron strings hung loose at his waist as he turned. "Want to try the new blueberry jam?"

At the supermarket, Emily compared expiration dates on two yogurt brands. Her phone buzzed—Daniel had sent a photo of bumper-to-bumper traffic on the overpass, a sea of red taillights.

The checkout line crawled. Grocery bags dug into her palms, leaving red marks. As she stepped through the automatic doors, the evening breeze lifted strands of hair at her temples.

Inside a Rolls-Royce, William loosened his tie. The cityscape blurred past the window until a familiar figure caught his eye.

A grocery bag split open. Oranges tumbled across the pavement. As Emily knelt to gather them, polished black dress shoes stopped beside a rolling navel orange.
###Chapter 227

"Pull over." William Johnson spoke abruptly.

Sam Wilson was surprised but quickly turned the steering wheel. Following William's gaze, he immediately spotted Emily Smith ahead, carrying two heavy shopping bags.

The car had barely stopped when William pushed the door open.

Just as he stepped out, a familiar figure was already striding toward Emily.

It was Daniel Chen.

Daniel took the shopping bags from Emily's hands, holding them all in his right. With his left, he gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Emily looked up at him, her eyes crinkling with a sweet smile.

William narrowed his eyes, a sharp pang tightening in his chest. He remembered how Emily used to smile at him like that—her eyes sparkling like stars, so bright it was impossible to look away.

After exchanging a few words, Daniel carried the bags in one hand and held Emily's hand with the other, leading her toward a car nearby. William's gaze lingered on her slender figure until their car disappeared into the traffic.

He pressed his tongue against the roof of his mouth and turned back to his car.

"Has Professor Schievink's itinerary been confirmed?" William leaned back in his seat, eyes closed.

From the passenger seat, Zhang Xiao'an had witnessed everything. He sighed inwardly—this was the first time he'd ever felt sorry for his boss.

"10:45 AM the day after tomorrow at Jinzhou International Airport," Zhang replied promptly.

To secure the renowned American neurosurgeon, William had not only donated hundreds of millions in research equipment but also waited over a month.

"You and Professor Johnson will handle the airport reception," William opened his eyes. "Grace Lee will arrange accommodations."

"Understood."

......

Mia Harris wasn't home tonight, so Emily and Daniel cooked together at his apartment.

They worked seamlessly, preparing three dishes and a soup in under an hour.

After dinner, Daniel cleared the table while Emily sat in the living room reviewing materials for her graduate school entrance exams. Daniel fully supported her decision—he himself had pursued his master's in the UK before joining the broadcasting center and was now transitioning to on-screen work.

Daniel walked over with a fruit platter, picking up a strawberry and offering it to Emily. She took a bite, and he naturally ate the rest.

The gesture made Emily slightly uneasy. Since Daniel's return from his business trip, despite their honesty with each other, the unchangeable fact between them still felt like a thorn. The most intimate they'd been was when he lightly kissed her forehead.

"I should head up now," Emily closed her book and stood.

Daniel caught her wrist. "Emily."

She paused, meeting his gaze.

"You're still bothered about me and Sophia Song..." His fingers brushed over the back of her hand, his voice low.
###Chapter 228

"It's not what you think." Emily Smith quickly interrupted Daniel Chen before he could finish his sentence, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt. "Daniel, we agreed—let's pretend that never happened."

"Are you sure?" His gaze burned into her.

"Yes." She nodded firmly.

"Emily..." Daniel reached out, his thumb gently stroking her cheek. "I swear I won't hurt you again."

Her lashes fluttered as she forced a smile. "I believe you."

His breath drew closer. Emily closed her eyes but tensed the moment their lips touched. Instinctively, she tried to push him away but stopped halfway, freezing like a girl experiencing her first kiss.

Daniel, however, was lost in the moment. He cradled the back of her head, his tongue parting her lips with relentless determination. Emily forced herself to respond, her mind flashing through every kindness he'd ever shown her.

As their breaths mingled, she suddenly found herself pressed into the couch. Daniel hovered above her, his eyes dark with desire. "Is this okay?"

His hand slid beneath her shirt. Emily shuddered violently, her palms pressing against his chest. "Daniel, I—"

When the kiss broke, Daniel went still. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, their ragged breaths loud in the silence.

Guilt prickled through Emily's fingertips. Why was she so comfortable with William Johnson, yet so hesitant with Daniel?

"It's fine." Daniel abruptly stood, turning his back to her. "I can wait."

The bathroom door clicked shut, and Emily exhaled in relief.

Late that night, she dreamed of a man with blurred features but sensations so vivid they terrified her. She woke to damp sheets.

Flustered, she changed the bedding and showered, but the tangled memories refused to wash away. Desperate, she grabbed the novel she'd carefully chosen—one with almost no intimate scenes.

At breakfast, Daniel acted as if nothing had happened. As he cleared the dishes, her phone rang from the bedroom.

Emily pushed open the ajar door but froze when she spotted the half-open drawer while reaching for her phone. A box of opened condoms lay inside.

Without thinking, she counted them.

Eight. All untouched.

"Emily?"

Daniel's voice startled her so badly she nearly jumped. When their eyes met, her cheeks burned. "I—I was just—"

"Just spares." He quickly took her hand. "In case."

Emily shoved the phone into his grasp and fled the room.
###Chapter 229

Daniel Chen spent a long time on the phone in the bedroom. His voice was hushed. Emily Smith continued washing the dishes he'd left unfinished in the kitchen, deliberately not listening.

When he finally emerged, his expression was terrifyingly dark.

At six in the evening, Emily finished her voice-over work and stepped out of the Leap Building. She was about to head to the hospital to visit her sister when her phone suddenly rang.

It was an unknown number.

"I'm Daniel's mother," came the icy voice on the other end. "At the New Brocade Hall. The same private room as last time. I want to see you."

Before Emily could respond, Mrs. Chen added, "Daniel will be there too. Don't bother contacting him."

"Alright."

Emily hung up and took a cab straight there.

The moment she pushed open the private room door, she froze.

Aside from Mr. and Mrs. Chen, there were three others—a middle-aged couple and a young woman.

"Uncle, Auntie," Emily greeted softly.

The trio's gazes raked over her like knives.

"So you're Emily Smith?" The young woman, Sophia Song, smirked disdainfully. "You are pretty. No wonder Daniel can't bring himself to break up with you."

"Sophia!" Mr. Song snapped.

"Miss Smith, have a seat," Mr. Chen said, his tone still relatively mild.

Emily shook her head. "That won't be necessary. Please say what you need to."

Mrs. Song scoffed and glanced at Mrs. Chen.

Mrs. Chen's face darkened. "This is Sophia Song. Our families have been close for generations. Daniel and Sophia grew up together."

Emily listened quietly.

"We called you here today to discuss Daniel and Sophia's marriage," Mrs. Chen enunciated each word. "Sophia is pregnant with Daniel's child. He must marry her."

The words hit Emily like a sledgehammer.

Her legs nearly gave out beneath her.

"Fifty thousand isn't enough?" Mrs. Chen sneered. "That's all you're worth."

Sophia cut in, "Considering how well you've served Daniel, I'll add another fifty."

"Sophia Song!"

A furious roar came from the doorway.

Daniel stormed in and immediately shielded Emily behind him. His eyes were bloodshot, his voice trembling. "You've gone too far."

He turned and pulled Emily close. "Let's go."

But Emily stood rooted to the spot, unmoving.

"Try walking out that door!" Mrs. Chen slammed her hands on the table and stood. "If you leave today, neither of you will have a peaceful life in this country!"

Daniel stiffened.

Slowly, he turned back. His red-rimmed eyes were filled with anguish. "Mom, don't push me."
###Chapter 230

"Mom, don't push me." Daniel Chen's voice was dangerously low.

Mrs. Chen let out a cold laugh, her well-manicured fingers tapping sharply on the table. "Who's pushing whom here? You made your choices—now take responsibility!"

"I'll take responsibility for the child," Daniel said, his gaze unwavering. "But marrying Sophia Song is out of the question."

"You're ruining the Chen family!" Mrs. Chen stood abruptly, her crimson nails pointing accusingly at Emily Smith. "All for this woman?"

Emily's fingers trembled slightly under the table.

"Miss Smith," Mrs. Chen turned to her, voice shrill, "you claim to love him—is this how you show it?"

"Enough!" Daniel slammed his fist on the table, rattling the dishes.

He took a deep breath, his voice rough. "I'm the one who can't live without her."

Sophia's eyes suddenly welled with tears. "Daniel, the child needs a father—"

"Shut up!" Daniel's glare was icy. "You don’t deserve to be a mother."

Mr. Song set down his teacup with deliberate calm. "Young man, think carefully about the consequences."

Only then did Emily recognize him—the powerful governor of W Province.

"Daniel, let's go," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Without hesitation, Daniel took her hand and strode out.

The car was suffocatingly silent. Emily stared at the blur of city lights outside, her nails digging into her palms.

When they pulled into the underground garage, she finally spoke. "We need to talk."

Daniel's hand paused on the ignition. "Not here. At home."

"Let's break up." Emily turned to him, forcing a faint smile. "Please."

"Never!" He gripped her shoulders tightly. "I'll protect you and Xiaoyi."

"How?" Emily gave a bitter laugh. "How will you stand against the Songs? Will you gamble your parents' futures?"

Daniel's throat moved, but no words came.

"I'm not worth it." Emily looked away. "The truth is, I don’t even like you that much."

"You're lying." His voice shook.

"Know why I never slept with you?" Emily suddenly smiled. "Because I was thinking of someone else."

Daniel's face paled instantly.

"Last night, I dreamed of him." Her voice was soft. "It was William Johnson."

The air turned to ice.

Daniel's tears hit the steering wheel, scattering like shattered glass.
###Chapter 231

The morning light crept in, but Daniel Chen didn't appear as usual. Emily Smith curled up under the blankets, her throat raw as if scraped by sandpaper. Every swallow sent sharp pain through her.

She forced herself up, only to be hit by a sudden cramp in her abdomen. When she pulled back the covers, a dark red stain bloomed across the sheets. Her period had arrived a full week early, worsening her already miserable state.

Painkillers rolled in her palm before she tossed them back. The recording equipment sat untouched on the desk—today's work would have to wait. She sent a leave notice to the studio and grabbed a novel.

Sunlight streamed through the window, yet she shivered. The words on the page blurred as the painkillers dragged her toward sleep. When her phone rang, she nearly tumbled off the couch.

"Big Boss" flashed on the screen. She squinted, sluggish, and swiped to answer.

"Hello?" Her voice was hoarse.

A pause. Then, "Emily?" The familiar tone jolted her awake. She hung up immediately, fingers trembling as she blocked the number again.

William Johnson stared at the ended call, his knuckles whitening. He redialed, only to be met with an automated rejection.

"Find her. Now." He threw his phone aside, his expression dark.

Sam Wilson reported swiftly, "Miss Smith hasn't left Sky City all day."

William grabbed his coat and strode out. The elevator numbers climbed, his frown deepening. The fingerprint lock beeped softly, revealing an unsettling silence inside.

The master bedroom was tidy. The guest room empty. The balcony curtains swayed in the breeze. Not even a cup of warm water waited in the kitchen.

"Emily!" His voice sharpened.

At that moment, Emily sat on the heated bidet, the warm water easing her cramps. She thought she imagined the sound of the door unlocking—until his call pierced through.

She startled to her feet. The water stopped abruptly. Fumbling with her clothes, her fingers shook against the doorknob. The mirror reflected her pale face and trembling lips.

Footsteps drew closer.
###Chapter 232

"Thud!"

A muffled sound.

The door slammed hard into Emily Smith's forehead. She cried out in pain, her body swaying uncontrollably backward.

Instinctively, she reached out to grab something, but her fingers closed around empty air.

Just as she was about to hit the floor, a warm, strong hand clamped around her wrist.

William Johnson yanked her forward, stepping in to pull her firmly into his arms.

Before Emily could steady her racing heart, he had already scooped her up and strode out of the bathroom.

"Let me go!" she snarled hoarsely, struggling.

William looked down at her, his gaze icy. His voice simmered with suppressed fury. "I thought you were dying. Seems you're still full of energy."

She looked terrible. Her face was ghostly pale, her lips cracked as if scorched by the sun. What infuriated him most was her voice—so ragged it was barely recognizable.

And yet, she had dared to hang up on him. Blocked his number.

She was practically begging for trouble.

"My life is none of your business!" Emily rasped, fighting with all her strength.

William scoffed and carried her toward the exit.

Her struggles were feeble in his arms—she couldn't even overpower a chicken.

"Where are you taking me? Put me down!" Frustration and anger sharpened her tone when her resistance proved useless.

"What do you think?" he ground out between clenched teeth, stepping out of the apartment.

Sam Wilson, waiting outside, swiftly closed the door and hurried to press the elevator button.

Emily's voice cracked with panic. "It's just my period! I don't need a hospital!"

William glanced down at her and sneered. "You're not just on your period. You've got a fever frying your brain."

Trembling with rage, she balled her fists and pounded his chest. "Put me down! Now!"

He watched her coldly, as if observing a farce.

"Ding—"

The elevator doors slid open.

William carried her inside, Sam following closely behind and pressing the button for the underground garage.

"I won't go to the hospital! Cough... cough..." Emily's shouting triggered a violent coughing fit.

The elevator stopped at the next floor.

As the doors opened, Daniel Chen stood frozen in shock, rooted to the spot.

Emily's coughing ceased abruptly.

She thrashed wildly, only to worsen her coughing.

William shot Daniel a frosty glare before looking away.

Sam pressed the close button.

The doors sealed shut, cutting off the three of them from each other's sight.

Less than thirty seconds later, the elevator reached the garage.

William carried her toward the black Rolls-Royce.

Sam rushed ahead to open the rear door.

Curled up in the back seat, Emily covered her mouth as she coughed violently.

A bottle of opened water appeared in front of her.

She turned her face away, continuing to cough against the window.

William's temper flared at her stubbornness.

He took a large gulp of water, then abruptly dragged her against him.

One hand cradled the back of her head as he crushed his lips to hers.

Forcing the water into her mouth.

Emily fought desperately.
###Chapter 233

Emily Smith struggled desperately.

Her resistance was like an ant trying to shake a tree against William Johnson's strength.

She clenched her teeth tightly, refusing the water he tried to force into her mouth.

But the itch in her throat triggered an uncontrollable cough.

The moment her lips parted, William pried them open and poured water down her throat.

Emily coughed violently, the liquid invading her windpipe.

Her body trembled as she choked, water splashing everywhere—a few droplets landing on William's face.

He remained unmoved, watching her cough until it turned ragged and painful before finally releasing his grip.

His knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists, his expression darkening dangerously.

Emily's coughing fit nearly suffocated her before abruptly stopping.

Gasping for air, she curled up against the car door like a fish out of water.

The fury in William's eyes gradually softened into concern.

He reached out to touch her pale face but hesitated mid-air.

She looked as fragile as fine glass now.

"Stop the car!" Emily hissed through clenched lashes.

"Do you even know where I'm taking you?" William asked.

"I don't need a hospital," she insisted stubbornly.

William replied calmly, "Then I suppose you won't be attending Professor Schievink's consultation either?"

Emily's breath hitched.

Professor Schievink—the world's top neurosurgeon.

Her eyes flew open as she turned to William.

"You... really got Professor Schievink?" Her voice trembled with disbelief.

William met her gaze in silence.

Emily's nose stung, and she looked away toward the window.

She knew he wasn't lying.

The thought of her sister finally getting help sent a surge of relief through her.

"Did breaking up with Daniel Chen upset you this much?" William misinterpreted the redness in her eyes.

Emily didn't correct him.

After a long pause, she turned back and said sincerely, "Thank you, William."

The formality in her tone displeased him.

But seeing how weak she was, he held back his irritation.

Leaning back, he closed his eyes.

Emily glanced down at herself—wearing a sweatshirt, sleep pants, and bare feet.

"Can I go home and change first?" she asked softly.

William slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sweeping over her.

Emily met his scrutiny without flinching.

He shut his eyes again without responding.

She didn't press further.

Walking barefoot wouldn't be so bad—the weather wasn't cold anyway.

But she was overthinking it.
###Chapter 234
The car came to a smooth stop in front of the VIP ward building at the downtown hospital.

Emily Smith was about to push the door open when William Johnson swiftly rounded the vehicle from the other side. Just as her feet were about to touch the ground, he bent down and scooped her up in his arms.

"William!" She struggled, pounding her fists against his chest.

The man tightened his grip and glanced down at her with narrowed eyes. "One more move, and I'll have Professor Schievink return to his country immediately."

Emily froze instantly.

Inside the elevator, she stared at the changing floor numbers, acutely aware of the warmth radiating from his chest. His scent of cedarwood mixed with faint tobacco made her hold her breath unconsciously.

In the hospital room, her younger sister lay quietly on the bed. William set Emily down on the sofa before turning to instruct his assistant to summon the doctor.

"Check her throat," William ordered with a slight tilt of his chin when the doctor entered.

Emily looked up in surprise, meeting his deep gaze. She pressed her lips together but ultimately didn't protest.

After a thorough examination, the doctor concluded, "Severe vocal cord inflammation caused by overuse and emotional suppression."

William's eyes lingered on her pale face for a moment. Caregiver Amy Green handed Emily a pair of cotton slippers, to which she murmured her thanks.

"When will Professor Schievink arrive?" Emily asked eagerly.

"That depends on your behavior," William replied coldly. "Today's performance was unsatisfactory. We'll discuss it another time."

Emily clenched her fists, suppressing her anger. "Thank you for your concern. You may go now."

A humorless chuckle escaped him. "Emily, your skill at burning bridges has improved."

Ignoring him, she turned and sat by her sister's bedside. Her slender fingers expertly massaged the girl's stiff muscles as she spoke in soft, soothing tones.

William leaned back on the sofa, his gaze never leaving her. The setting sun's glow through the window cast a golden halo around her, making even her hair shimmer.

The sudden ring of his phone shattered the moment. When he returned after taking the call, he found Emily asleep with her head resting on the bed. Her lashes cast delicate shadows under her eyes, accentuating her fragility.

He carefully gathered her in his arms as if cradling a priceless treasure.

When she awoke, the room was dark. Emily sat up abruptly, recognizing the glittering night view of Jinzhou Bay through the familiar floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Awake?"

The deep voice came from the corner. William emerged from the shadows, his suit jacket removed and tie hanging loosely around his neck.

"Why did you bring me here?" She threw off the covers, ready to get up.

"Do you want your sister to wake up?" He remained motionless. "Be my girlfriend."

Emily froze, staring at him in disbelief. Moonlight streamed through the window, casting shifting shadows across his sharply defined features.

The words "my girlfriend" echoed unnaturally loud in the silent room.
###Chapter 235

After Amanda's betrayal left him devastated, now he wants her back as a substitute?

This time, he's generous enough to offer her a title.

Hah.

Emily lowered her gaze with a faint smile, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"William, I'm done with threats," she whispered, her voice feather-light. "Can you just let me go?"

Last night's threats from Daniel's parents and Sophia's parents still haunted her.

Now it was his turn tonight.

She hated it.

Hated her own weakness.

Hated that she didn’t even have the right to fight back.

William frowned, as if catching himself, then said, "Eat first."

She was starving.

But right now, provoking him was the last thing she wanted.

"I need to wash my face," she said, rising and heading to the bathroom.

"Use warm water," he reminded her.

Inside the bathroom, she froze.

Her toothbrush, cup, shampoo—everything was exactly where she’d left it.

A set of men’s toiletries sat beside hers.

Even more absurd, the half-used sanitary napkin was still in its place.

Months had passed, yet everything was spotless.

She shook her head, forcing herself not to dwell on it.

When she returned to the living room, Susan was setting the table.

The sight of Emily emerging from the bedroom stunned Susan into stillness.

"Susan, you may leave," William said coldly.

Emily silently took her seat at the table.

This spot used to be hers alone.

Had Amanda sat here before?

A sudden flash of memory—Amanda clinging to William, clothes disheveled—

"Start with the porridge."

A bowl of pork liver and lean meat congee was pushed toward her.

She ate without pause, finishing three bowls.

William piled her plate high with dishes, but she only touched what she served herself.

Watching her eat so intently, the corner of his lips lifted.

Images flooded his mind—

The dining room. The kitchen. The living room. The balcony.

Every corner bore traces of them.

He set down his chopsticks, his gaze burning into her.

For now, he could do nothing.

But in his eyes, he had already claimed her a thousand times over.
###Chapter 236

Emily Smith lowered her head, focusing on cutting the steak on her plate. The clinking of silverware against porcelain filled the air. The gaze from across the table burned too intensely—so nakedly predatory it made her fingers tighten around the knife.

She abruptly looked up and met William Johnson's deep, ink-black eyes. Her heart skipped a beat, her throat constricting.

Suppressing her erratic breathing, Emily continued eating as if nothing had happened. Only when her stomach felt full did she gracefully set down her utensils.

"Thank you for the meal." She dabbed her lips with a napkin before standing, the hem of her dress sweeping in a graceful arc. "I'll be leaving now."

The sharp click of her heels against the marble floor echoed urgently. Then, William's low voice reached her from behind. "Emily, this time I mean it."

Her steps faltered almost imperceptibly.

"I'll wait for your answer."

Clutching her handbag, Emily pushed through the restaurant's glass door without looking back. The night breeze brushed against her flushed ears.

Sam Wilson respectfully opened the car door for her. "Miss Smith, please."

She didn't refuse. After all, walking from Jinzhou Bay to Sky City would mean crossing three streets.

The next morning, Emily's throat had finally stopped swelling. Her phone rang abruptly, the hospital's number flashing on the screen.

"A consultation at ten?" Her voice trembled slightly with excitement. "I'll be there on time."

In the hospital corridor, her fingers shook as she shook hands with Professor Schievink. When she described her sister's condition in flawless American English, the elderly professor raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Have you lived in the States?"

"No, I just graduated from Jinzhou University's English department." She smiled faintly and shook her head.

The consultation room was packed. Emily sat in a corner, occasionally jotting down notes or listening intently. When asked about her sister's medical history, her concise and precise answers drew sidelong glances from the attending doctors.

Suddenly, a chill ran down her spine. Emily turned her head and met William's scorching gaze. Flustered, she looked away, her pen leaving a small ink blot on the paper.

The consultation lasted until dusk. Only when the meeting adjourned did the others notice William's presence, and muffled gasps rippled through the room.

"Miss Smith," Professor Schievink suddenly took her hand and winked playfully, "your boyfriend donated over a hundred million dollars in research equipment just to get me here."

Emily froze. The number hit her like a hammer, leaving her dizzy.

Suppressed exclamations rose around her. Mechanically, she turned to William, but he was already engaged in a casual conversation with the professor, as if he'd merely commented on the weather.

The surgical plan was finalized, though the exact date would depend on her sister's health indicators.

Emily fled back to the hospital room. Before long, familiar footsteps paused outside the door. Staring at her sister's pale face, she didn't dare turn around.

The air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and something else—something indescribable.
###Chapter 237

Emily Smith gazed out the window at the passing scenery, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt. Professor Schievink's treatment plan was finally confirmed—her sister would be saved.

But the cost...

"A hundred million dollars," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

William Johnson sat across from her, his long fingers tapping lightly on his knee. "No need to repay it," he suddenly said.

Emily's head snapped up, meeting his deep, unreadable gaze.

"Just be my girlfriend," he said, the corner of his lips lifting. But there was a hint of seriousness in his eyes.

"Is this a transaction?" Her voice trembled slightly.

William shook his head. "No." He paused. "A request."

Silence settled briefly in the car. Emily lowered her lashes, shadows falling across her face. "Thank you," she finally said.

"Thank me?" William chuckled. "Then cook me dinner."

Emily blinked at him in surprise.

"Consider it your gratitude," he added, his eyes holding a quiet expectation.

"Alright," she agreed with a nod.

As the car pulled into the supermarket parking lot, Emily was still mentally planning the menu. William suddenly spoke up. "Can I make requests?"

She hesitated. "Sure."

He listed eight dishes—each one a delicacy Mia Harris had flaunted on her social media. Emily pressed her lips together. "Isn't that too much?"

"Not at all." A mischievous glint flickered in his eyes.

At the supermarket entrance, Emily stopped William before he could step out. "I'll go alone."

"Afraid of being photographed?" He raised a brow.

"Yes," she admitted honestly. "I don’t want to trend."

With a resigned sigh, William settled back into his seat, watching her slender figure disappear through the automatic doors.

In the seafood section, Emily struggled to hold onto a thrashing grouper. Suddenly, a warm, familiar hand covered hers.

"Let me." His voice was low beside her ear.

She turned, barely recognizing him. William had discarded his tie, his shirt casually untucked beneath his jacket. A baseball cap and sunglasses obscured most of his face, making him look like a trendy street-style guy.

"Just let the staff handle it," she said, pulling her hand back and heading toward the meat section.

William watched her walk away, his lips curving unconsciously. He picked up the cleaned fish and followed, finding her already selecting ribs and black-bone chicken.

The shopping cart filled without either of them noticing. William trailed behind her quietly, watching the focused curve of her profile as she picked vegetables. A strange sense of contentment welled up inside him.

At checkout, he reached for his wallet, but Emily was faster—her payment QR code already displayed. "I'm paying," she said firmly.

William laughed and put his card away. As they stepped outside, he suddenly took her hand.

"People are watching," he murmured, his warm breath brushing her ear.

Emily tried to pull away, but his grip tightened. She looked up, meeting his amused gaze—and her heartbeat stuttered.
###Chapter 238

Emily's heart skipped a beat as she instinctively glanced around.

Several pairs of curious eyes were indeed fixed on them.

She immediately stilled, allowing William to keep holding her hand.

Once inside the car, Emily pressed her lips together and refused to respond no matter what William said.

Yet the hand he had held burned with lingering warmth.

William watched her, amusement dancing in his eyes.

Back at Sky Mansion, William followed her into the kitchen with grocery bags.

"Need help?" he asked, removing his sunglasses.

Emily crouched to organize the ingredients without looking up. "No."

"Idle hands make light work," he said, kneeling beside her.

"No—" A dull thud cut her off.

She looked up just as her forehead collided with his chin.

The impact made her gasp in pain, her skin already flushing red.

"Let me see." William reached for her forehead, concern tightening his features.

Emily dodged his touch. "Just leave."

"A little massage will help," he insisted, leaning closer.

"Your chin is like granite," she retreated. "What if we collide again?"

William chuckled lowly, a smirk playing on his lips. "You think only my chin is hard?"

Emily froze, then flushed crimson.

"William," she said stiffly, "do you want dinner or not?"

"I do," he answered, his tone layered with meaning.

"Then get out," she turned away. "Or you can cook instead."

"Fine. Call if you need me." Satisfied with teasing her enough, he finally left.

From the semi-open kitchen, Emily could feel the weight of his gaze.

Only when his phone rang did William step onto the balcony.

The doorbell chimed just as Emily finished prepping ingredients.

William was already striding toward the entrance.

"Emily, we—" Daniel Chen's voice cut off abruptly.

"She's busy," William said coolly. "You can talk to me."

Emily emerged, greeting him distantly. "Daniel."

Seeing her in an apron, Daniel's face drained of color.

"If there's nothing else..." William slid an arm around her waist, preparing to shut the door.

The moment it closed, Emily shoved him away.

She shot him a glare before storming back to the kitchen.

William followed, laughter rumbling in his chest.

Outside, Daniel stood frozen as if struck by lightning.

......

Two hours later, seven dishes and a soup adorned the dining table.

While Emily fetched utensils, William discreetly photographed each dish.

"Eat," she said, slamming the chopsticks in front of him.

Her voice bristled with irritation.

William didn't touch his food. "Why did you break up with Daniel?"
###Chapter 239

"Why did you break up with Daniel Chen?" William Johnson suddenly asked.

Emily Smith's chopsticks paused midair for a second.

She swallowed her food slowly before lifting her gaze to meet his. "That's my private business."

Then she lowered her head and continued eating.

William narrowed his eyes, pressing his tongue against his cheek before suddenly smiling. "Your sister's treatment is also private business, but I won't ignore it."

The words hung in the air like a blunt knife slowly slicing through silence.

Emily's chopsticks froze.

She understood the implication—without him, her sister would never wake up.

"His parents looked down on me," she set down her chopsticks, her tone as calm as if discussing the weather. "Those two documents and the card last time were from his mother. There was five hundred thousand on it."

The amount made William's brow twitch.

He studied her. This twenty-two-year-old girl was unnervingly composed.

"Just because of that?"

"Isn't that enough?" Emily countered.

Even the Chens despised her, let alone the Johnsons. So-called girlfriends were just glorified flings.

William suddenly laughed. In just a few months, she had matured—clear-eyed but not jaded.

"The food's getting cold," she reminded him.

William scooped a spoonful of black chicken soup. The rich, sweet flavor spread across his tongue.

"That five hundred thousand and Mrs. Chen's investigation into you had nothing to do with Amanda Lin," he explained.

Emily nodded. "Then what about David Brown? She was the one who got him released, wasn't she?"

William's chopsticks stilled midair.

"It was her," he admitted before continuing to eat.

Emily's eyes reddened instantly. He knew Amanda was behind it, yet hadn't even uttered a word of reproach.

She lowered her head and shoveled rice into her mouth, not wanting him to see her composure crack.

The sound of the door unlocking shattered the silence.

"Sweetie, I'm home!" Mia Harris' voice rang from the entryway.

When she spotted the man's broad-shouldered silhouette at the dining table, her first thought was Daniel Chen. But that unmistakable frame—

"Holy shit!" Mia's eyes widened.

"Hey, Mia," Emily stood to greet her. "Perfect timing for dinner."

Mia pointed at William, mouthing, What's he doing here?

"He brought specialists to evaluate Lily's condition," Emily handed her slippers.

Mia exhaled in relief before shooting a questioning glance about whether she downstairs knew. Getting a confirming nod, she plastered on a bright smile and strode to the dining table.

"Good evening, Vice President Johnson!" She deliberately emphasized the title. "Welcome to my and Emily's home."

William set down his bowl and chopsticks, tilting his chin at her. "Sit."

His demeanor made it seem like he owned the place.
###Chapter 240

Mia Harris beamed with crescent-shaped eyes as she pulled out a chair and sat down. "Then I won't hold back!"

Emily Smith hurried from the entryway to the kitchen, fetching bowls and chopsticks to serve Mia some soup.

The moment the bowl was placed in front of Mia, she blinked eagerly and said, "Emily, I'd like to eat first."

"Alright, I'll get you some rice." Emily turned to leave.

"Don’t you have legs?" William Johnson's icy voice cut in abruptly.

Mia jolted and immediately jumped up. "Right, right! I'll do it myself!" She pushed Emily back into her seat and dashed into the kitchen.

Emily sat down, her gaze landing on the empty bowl across from her. "Need more rice?"
Before he could answer, she added, "Get it yourself."

William raised an eyebrow.

She learned fast.

The corner of his lips curled. "I'll have more vegetables."

Mia returned with her rice, initially a bit reserved. But seeing Emily completely ignore William while focusing on serving her food and chatting, Mia suddenly realized—this was her home!

William should be the uncomfortable one here.

With that thought, Mia relaxed instantly, chatting and eating with Emily. The topic somehow shifted to her ridiculous boss.

"You know what? Today she called a colleague a pig in front of everyone just because the color of a spreadsheet was wrong!" Mia puffed her cheeks in anger. "What’s the difference between bright yellow and orange-yellow anyway?"

Emily nodded. "That’s really excessive."

William ate leisurely, listening to the girls vent.

"Yesterday was even worse—she made a colleague cry!" Mia grew more animated. "If she dared do that to me, I’d slap her on the spot!"

"The most disgusting part? She threatened a male colleague with a promotion to go on a date with her!" Mia nearly slammed the table.

Emily gasped. "What did he say?"

"He’s planning to quit." Mia sighed.

"No need."

William spoke up suddenly.

Both girls turned to look at him.

"What do you mean, Vice President Johnson?" Mia’s eyes sparkled.

"You’ll have a new boss tomorrow." His tone was indifferent.

"What about the current one?"

"Gone."

"So cool!" Mia jumped up. "We have to toast to that!"

She rushed off to grab alcohol.

Emily massaged her temples.

Once the drinking started, there was no stopping. Mia soon slumped over the table, drunk.

Emily struggled to carry her back to her room. When she returned, she found William had moved to the sofa, his hand covering his eyes, motionless.

Glancing at the messy table, she decided to clean up first.

Half an hour later.

The kitchen was spotless, but William remained in the same position.

Was he asleep?

Emily checked the time and frowned. She had no intention of letting him stay the night.

Walking over to the sofa, she studied him for a few seconds before reaching for his wrist. "William, it’s time to—"

"Ah!"
###Chapter 241

"Ah!"

Before Emily Smith could finish speaking, her wrist was suddenly seized by a strong grip.

She stumbled forward, caught off guard.

The next second, her cheek collided with William Johnson's firm chest. Worse, the hand he held was pressed directly against a certain sensitive part of him.

The sensation beneath her palm changed instantly.

She jerked her hand back as if electrocuted, struggling to pull away.

"Hiss—"

William sucked in a sharp breath, his voice hoarse. "You'll break it."

She hastily moved her hand, but the abrupt motion only pressed her closer against him. His arm tightened around her waist, locking her in place.

"William Johnson!"

"Dinner tonight," he murmured with a low chuckle, his alcohol-laced breath hot against her ear, "was very much to my taste."

A shiver ran down Emily's spine, electric tingles spreading through her.

"Let me go," she gritted out.

His arm didn't budge.

"Keep moving," his voice dropped even lower, "and I won't be able to hold back."

She turned her head to glare at him, meeting eyes dark with smoldering fire. Her flushed face was clearly reflected in his pupils.

"You've finished eating. You should leave," she forced out, feigning composure.

William's Adam's apple bobbed as he laughed, restrained.

"Have you thought about it?" he suddenly asked.

"About what?"

"Being my girlfriend."

Emily averted her face. "Impossible."

"You did fine before."

"Before?" She scoffed. "I was just your plaything."

William's gaze turned icy in an instant, and he released her.

Emily immediately sprang away, striding toward the bedroom without looking back.

The sound of the door closing echoed behind her.

Leaning against the doorframe, her legs trembled weakly.

......

After her voice recovered, Emily returned to the recording studio.

News came from the hospital—her sister's surgery plan was finalized. But Professor Schievink presented a dilemma: they needed a new type of medical device not yet available in the country.

"Two options," the professor adjusted his glasses. "Buy the equipment, or have the surgery in the U.S."

"How much does the equipment cost?"

"Over six million dollars."

Emily's fingertips turned cold.

"And if we go to the U.S.?"

"There are risks," the professor stated bluntly. "Changes in intracranial pressure during the flight could displace the blood clot."

She clenched the medical records. "Give me two days to decide."

Leaving the hospital, she numbly boarded a bus.

When she finally snapped out of her daze, the towering BestTech Building loomed outside the window.
###Chapter 242
The autumn night wind carried a chill as Emily Smith tugged her coat collar tighter. The dim yellow light of the bus stop stretched her shadow long and thin.

She looked across the street. The glass facade of Sky City reflected starlight like a crystal palace. At this hour, William Johnson was probably still working overtime.

She immediately dismissed the thought. A self-deprecating smile tugged at her lips.

Hadn't she decided to end that arrangement? Why was she still thinking about him? Expecting him to fork over another six million dollars? Since when had Emily Smith become so shameless?

The bus arrival announcement startled her. Emily hurried across the crosswalk and swiped her card to board.

Around the corner, a black Maybach glided forward.

"Sir, it's Miss Smith," Sam Wilson noted the slender figure boarding the bus.

Documents slipped from long fingers. William looked up just as Emily took a window seat. Through the glass, he saw her faintly furrowed brow.

"Follow it."

The bus lumbered along. Emily pressed her forehead against the cool window, her mind filled with her sister's surgical options. The American procedure was too risky, but domestic hospitals lacked the necessary equipment...

The Maybach maintained a five-meter distance. The rear window lowered slightly as William's gaze pierced the darkness, landing on her lightly bitten lower lip.

"Check her schedule today," he ordered, fingers tracing his wristwatch.

Twenty minutes later, they reached Shengshi Longyuan Station.

Emily froze the moment she stepped off the bus. A familiar Rolls-Royce Phantom waited silently under the plane trees.

The door opened. Polished dress shoes crunched through fallen leaves. William leaned against the car, his tie loosened, clearly fresh from a business dinner.

"Does BestTech Group need janitors now?" He raised an eyebrow.

Emily gripped her backpack strap. "I missed my stop."

"Afraid of flying?" he asked abruptly.

Her head snapped up, meeting his fathomless gaze.

"The equipment arrives tomorrow." He brushed nonexistent dust from her hair. "Central Hospital will form a special team."

"The money—"

"Consider it an investment in medical advancement." His low laugh carried the rich scent of whiskey. "After all—"

"My period's almost over," Emily blurted out. She stared at the third button of his shirt. "I can... anytime..."

She fled before finishing.

William watched her stumbling retreat, his eyes darkening. His knuckles whitened.

The elevator mirror reflected Emily's flushed face. She'd actually said that out loud... Her nails dug into her palms.

"Unit 2803 has excellent ventilation..." A realtor's pitch drifted into the elevator. Emily's breath caught.

That was Daniel Chen's apartment.

So he'd known all along... An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her heart. As the doors closed, she spotted the familiar blue-gray access card in the agent's hand.

The sweet aroma of yam cakes filled her apartment. Emily packed freshly baked cakes into an insulated container, her fingers trembling slightly.
###Chapter 243

Emily Smith stood outside Daniel Chen's apartment, her trembling finger hovering over the doorbell. The warm taro cakes in her arms still steamed, their aroma cutting through the cold hallway air.

The door opened faster than she expected.

Daniel's haggard face made her heart clench. The dark circles under his eyes and the stubble on his chin spoke volumes about his recent suffering.

"Daniel," she heard her own voice shake.

His pupils contracted sharply. His Adam's apple bobbed before he managed to speak. "Emily..."

"I made your favorite taro cakes." She extended the food container, the ceramic edges still warm from the kitchen.

When Daniel took it, his fingers accidentally brushed against the back of her hand. The brief contact froze them both.

"Take care." Emily spoke first, turning away as a tear splashed onto the stair railing.

Behind her, the container hit the floor with a dull thud. She didn't look back, but Daniel's choked sob echoed through the hallway.

Three days later, the hospital called to move up the surgery date. Emily was recording an emotional scene in the studio when she hung up, only then noticing her palms were drenched in sweat.

On the morning of the surgery, she braided her sister's hair into a pretty plait. The little girl bit her lip but didn't cry when the nurse shaved her head.

"Big sis, will you take me to the amusement park when I'm better?"

Emily squeezed her sister's hand and nodded, her throat too tight to speak.

Just as the gurney was about to enter the operating room, an unknown caller shattered the tense silence.

"Surely Miss Smith isn't too scared to come?" Sophia Song's voice dripped with condescending amusement through the phone.

In the café, Sophia's diamond ring glittered harshly under the sunlight. She stirred her coffee leisurely, but her gaze was razor-sharp.

"I heard your sister's surgery is today?" Sophia said suddenly. "What a coincidence—Daniel and I set our wedding for next month."

Emily's nails dug into her palms. The wall clock showed the surgery had already been underway for fifteen minutes.

"Congratulations." She stood. "If there's nothing else—"

"In such a hurry?" Sophia grabbed her wrist. "Daniel said your taro cakes are delicious. Won't you teach me how to make them?"

The operating room lights flashed red in Emily's mind. She yanked her hand free and bolted, Sophia's knowing laughter chasing after her.

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly. Emily stumbled to the operating room doors just as the surgeon emerged.

"Miss Smith," the doctor removed his mask, "the surgery was a success."

Her legs gave out as she collapsed to the floor, tears finally breaking free. Her phone buzzed again in her pocket—William Johnson's name lit up the screen.
###Chapter 244

Fang Silin's gaze swept over Emily Smith with undisguised disdain, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Miss Smith certainly knows how to make an entrance."

Emily lifted her eyes calmly. "Do you need something, Miss Fang?"

"I heard..." Fang Silin abruptly changed tack. "My mother-in-law mentioned you used to be kept by several wealthy heirs."

Emily's expression remained unchanged, a faint smile playing at her lips as she offered no response.

"Daniel and I grew up together." Fang Silin arched a brow. "Back in high school, he said he'd only marry a virgin." She paused meaningfully. "You don't even meet the basic requirements. He's just playing with you. If he hasn't broken up with you, it's not because he likes you—he just hates being controlled by his parents."

Emily stayed silent.

"Daniel is returning to W City with us tomorrow." Fang Silin took an elegant sip of coffee. "He'll never come back to Jinzhou again."

Emily glanced toward the operating room, her tone cooling. "Are you finished, Miss Fang?"

"How dare you act superior with me?" Fang Silin slammed her coffee cup down, eyes sharp. "As women, I know exactly what you're thinking. Daniel will soon be my husband. If you know what's good for you, stay out of his sight forever. Otherwise—"

"Understood." Emily nodded.

Fang Silin scoffed and tossed an invitation from her bag. "Our wedding is on the 13th next month. I'll cover your flight and hotel."

Emily looked down at the invitation and chuckled softly. "If you want me gone, why bother with this?"

"Afraid of humiliation?" Fang Silin smirked triumphantly.

The café door suddenly swung open. A tall, imposing figure stepped in, backlit by the afternoon sun.

The empty weekday café fell into silence. The man's impeccably tailored suit accentuated his perfect physique, every step exuding innate nobility.

Fang Silin's gaze locked onto him instantly.

When he turned toward them, she shot to her feet, voice trembling. "Vice President Johnson... Are you here for me?"

Emily, still staring at the invitation, looked up in surprise.

William Johnson?!

She scrambled to stand, only to be pulled into a warm, firm embrace. "Emily." His voice was deep and tender. "Your sister's in surgery, and you're here entertaining strangers?"

Emily?

Fang Silin froze as if struck by lightning. Emily was equally stunned.

"Vice President Johnson..." Fang Silin's voice quavered. "Don't you remember me?"
###Chapter 245

William finally lifted his gaze to glance at the woman, his brow furrowing slightly before his expression softened as he turned back to Emily.

"Sweetheart, who is this?"

The term of endearment sent a tremor through Emily's heart.

She pressed her lips into a faint smile, her eyes briefly flickering over the woman.

"Daniel's fiancée, Miss Sophia Song. She came to deliver a wedding invitation."

"Ah, Mr. Chen's fiancée." William nodded politely, his gaze cool and distant as he regarded Sophia.

"Since Mr. Chen has looked after Emily before, we’ll certainly attend the wedding."

Understanding his intent, Emily flashed him a radiant smile and picked up the invitation.

"Lily's surgery is about to start. Let's go."

"Alright." William wrapped an arm around her waist as they turned to leave.

"Vice President Johnson!" Sophia called out urgently. "I'm—"

Without looking back, William guided Emily away with long strides.

Only after settling into the car did Emily finally exhale in relief.

"Thank you."

"This wasn't an act." His gaze burned into her.

Her breath hitched, and she averted her eyes.

"Please take me to the hospital."

"Drive," William instructed Sam.

When the car stopped in front of the surgical wing, Emily thanked him and hurried out.

At the elevator, William followed.

"Is there something else?" she asked.

"Kicking down the ladder after crossing the river," he muttered, his tone aggrieved.

The elevator doors opened, and they stepped in one after the other.

The red light above the operating room was already lit.

"Aunt Amy, how is she?" Emily asked the caregiver.

"They just went in. Don’t worry," Aunt Amy reassured her.

Emily sat on the bench, and William took the seat beside her.

"Don’t you have anything better to do?" She didn’t look at him.

Leaning his head back against the wall, he turned to study her.

"Being with you today is my priority."

The surgery dragged on. Emily pulled out her phone to review some recordings.

At some point, William dozed off, his head slipping onto her shoulder.

The moment his lips brushed her skin, her ears burned.

"Will—"

"Let him rest," Sam whispered. "He hasn’t slept properly in two months."

Emily glanced at his exhausted face and couldn’t bring herself to push him away.

She straightened her posture, letting him settle more comfortably.

Time passed, and her shoulder grew numb.

But she remained still, unwilling to disturb his sleep.
###Chapter 246
The operating room lights remained on as time ticked by.

Emily Smith sat on the bench, bearing the weight of William Johnson's head on her shoulder. His breathing was steady and deep, clearly fast asleep.

Her back began aching, the left side of her body long gone numb from the pressure. Yet she maintained the same position, afraid to disturb his slumber.

Sam Wilson sat across from them, surprise evident in his gaze. He'd never seen William sleep so soundly in a hospital, let alone for Emily to endure it this long.

The operating room doors suddenly swung open.

Emily's eyes brightened, instinctively starting to rise. But she quickly remembered the weight on her shoulder and turned a pleading look toward Sam.

Understanding immediately, Sam stepped forward to take her place.

The moment William's head touched Sam's shoulder, his eyes flew open.

"What happened?" His voice was hoarse, brows furrowing.

Emily didn't answer, hurrying toward the doctor instead.

"The surgery went smoothly. Your sister is stable," the doctor said with a smile.

Emily exhaled in relief. "How much longer?"

"About three to four hours. With Professor Schievink handling it, you needn't worry." The doctor departed quickly.

Footsteps approached from behind.

"Let's eat." William stood behind her, voice low.

"That's unnecessary." Emily turned. "You can return to work now."

William's gaze fell on the reddened skin of her neck, his eyes darkening. The unnatural flush from prolonged pressure stood out starkly against her pale complexion.

"If you don't eat, neither will I," he insisted stubbornly.

Emily averted her face, massaging her sore neck and shoulders.

When William reached out to help, she dodged his touch.

"Sir, New York is calling," Sam interjected, handing over a phone.

William took the call and stepped aside. His fluent English echoed down the hallway as he addressed what sounded like an urgent matter.

Emily caught fragments like "press conference moved up" but forced herself not to listen.

As she sat back down, William finished the call.

"You have urgent business. You should go," she repeated.

William studied her, the corner of his mouth lifting in a bitter smile. "Do you really hate seeing me this much?"

Emily remained silent, her gaze fixed on the operating room doors.
###Chapter 247

Emily glanced at him but remained silent.

"Distant water can't quench present thirst. I'll stay with you," he insisted.

She pressed her lips together.

Silence stretched between them.

William's brows gradually knitted together, his face paling. He occasionally pressed a hand to his stomach, his knuckles turning white.

Sam couldn't take it anymore and stepped forward. "Boss, is your stomach acting up again? You haven't eaten anything this morning."

Emily turned her head at the words.

"Sam," William warned sharply.

Sam immediately fell silent.

"There's a noodle shop across from the hospital," Emily said suddenly.

"Together," he replied instantly.

She stood and walked toward the elevator without confirming. The corner of William's mouth lifted as he strode after her with his long legs.

Outside the surgical building, Emily suddenly stopped.

"Changed your mind?" He raised a brow.

"Let's drive," she said, avoiding his gaze.

Understanding flashed in William's eyes as he opened the car door for her.

The car headed toward "Seven Flavors," the private restaurant she often visited with Mia.

"Afraid of being seen?" William broke the silence.

"There's nothing between us," she said, staring straight ahead. "No need for misunderstandings."

His Adam's apple bobbed.

This wild rose's thorns were sharper than he'd imagined.

"Have you thought about it?" He changed the subject.

"I have," she said calmly.

William's heart sank.

"I'm not suited to be your girlfriend," she turned to look at him. "We're from different worlds."

"How?" he pressed.

Emily gazed out the window. "What you can do with a snap of your fingers might be out of my reach forever."

"My world is open to you anytime."

She shook her head. "I can't afford the admission ticket."

His eyes darkened. "You won't even try?"

"If you need a physical relationship," she met his gaze, "I can oblige until you find someone new."

The temperature in the car plummeted.

"Is that all we are to you?" His voice tightened.

Emily considered it seriously. "What else?"

"Pull over," William ordered coldly.

Tires screeched against the pavement.

"Get out," he commanded.

Emily pushed the door open smoothly but paused before closing it. "See? This is inequality. You say 'go,' and I have to go."

The door slammed shut.

William watched her retreating back, straight and unyielding, then suddenly chuckled low.

Sam peeked at him through the rearview mirror, clicking his tongue inwardly.

This girl was ruthless.
###Chapter 248

The moment the operating room lights dimmed, Emily Smith's nails dug deep into her palms.

At 4:23 PM, the surgery doors finally swung open.

Professor Schievink removed his mask, beads of sweat still glistening on his forehead. "The surgery was a success," he said in English tinged with a German accent. "With the new treatment plan, we expect significant improvement within six months."

Emily's tears broke free like a dam. As she bowed, droplets splashed onto the polished floor tiles, leaving tiny wet stains.

Professor Johnson steadied her trembling shoulders. "Emily, your sister has an incredible will to survive."

It wasn't until 9:30 PM, after confirming her sister's stable vitals, that Emily dragged her exhausted body back to Sky City Apartments.

In the elevator, she collided with movers hauling furniture into unit 2803. A brand-new leather sofa brushed against her coat, leaving an almost imperceptible crease.

She stared blankly at the elevator buttons. Daniel Chen had only moved out two weeks ago, yet this home already had a new owner.

The smug smile of Sophia Song flashed in her mind. Emily pulled out the gilded invitation from her bag—Daniel's smile in the photo looked stiff, clearly photoshopped.

"Be happy," she whispered to the empty air, her fingers tracing a faint mark along the invitation's edge.

The next day in the recording studio, Ethan He handed her a thermos as she massaged her temples.

"Throat sore?" he asked, leaning closer, the faint scent of cedarwood clinging to him.

Emily shook her head. Unscrewing the lid, she found warm honey citron tea inside. Ethan's canine tooth glinted under the lights. "Secret recipe," he said.

As they wrapped up that afternoon, Ethan suddenly stopped her. "There's an audition opportunity." He waved his phone. "Lead female role for Stellar Fantasia. Want to meet the producer now?"

Emily's eyes lit up. It was this year's most anticipated animated film.

In the private dining room, producer Leo Lin studied her for five full seconds. "Unique vocal tone," he remarked, sliding a script across the table. "Try this crying scene."

Emily took a deep breath. The moment her first syllable fell, the room grew so quiet she could hear the hum of the air conditioner.

"You're perfect," Leo applauded, and only then did Emily notice her palms were drenched in sweat.

Under the table, Ethan's knee brushed against hers. The sparkle in his eyes outshone the neon lights outside the window.

"Three PM tomorrow," Leo handed her a business card, "come straight to our studio to record the demo."

Night wind lifted Emily's skirt as they exited the restaurant. Ethan suddenly said, "When you delivered those lines, you reminded me of Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday."

Emily gazed at the distant office tower lights—William Johnson's office was somewhere in that direction. Her grip tightened on her bag strap.

"Need a ride?" Ethan opened his sports car door.

"No," she stepped back, "the subway's more convenient."

He didn't insist, but as she turned away, he called out, "See you tomorrow!" His voice pierced the night, startling sparrows from the roadside.

Emily didn't look back, only raised her hand in a small wave. The subway tunnel wind scattered her lifted hair like black silk flowing under the lights.
###Chapter 249

Emily Smith stared at the script in her hands, her fingertips lightly tracing the edge of the paper. The air conditioning in Flying Fish Culture's recording studio was set too high, yet her palms felt warm.

"Ready?" Ethan He handed her a glass of water, his voice hushed.

She nodded and flipped to the marked page. The lines she'd received just half an hour ago were already memorized.

The sound engineer gave a signal.

"I thought I'd never see you again." Emily's voice suddenly shifted, trembling slightly but laced with defiance.

The director's eyes lit up.

Her improvised English translation flowed more naturally than the original. When the recording ended, the producer couldn't help but applaud.

"Miss Smith, your performance was stunning." The producer handed her a business card. "We'll get back to you soon."

As she stepped out of the building, the sunset painted the sky. Ethan suggested celebrating, and she didn't refuse.

Neon lights from the street food stalls glared brightly. Ethan shared amusing anecdotes from the voice-acting world, making her laugh uncontrollably. A few drops of iced plum juice splashed onto the tablecloth when their glasses clinked, leaving dark stains.

Her phone vibrated. The caller ID made her smile falter.

"What is it?" She moved to a quieter corner.

Silence lingered on the other end for a few seconds.

"What are you doing?" William Johnson's voice came through the line, deeper than usual.

The aroma of grilled skewers wafted over. Ethan waved a lamb skewer at her, and irritation prickled under her skin.

"I'm having dinner with a friend," she heard herself say. "If there's nothing important, I'll hang up now."

Laughter erupted behind her. Whatever Ethan said had the neighboring table in stitches.

The line remained silent. Emily stared at a crack on the ground, counted to three, and ended the call.

When she returned to the table, Ethan was peeling crayfish. His plastic gloves were slick with red oil, but his movements were deft.

"Work call?" he asked without looking up.

Emily hummed in response and placed her phone face-down.

Meanwhile, in the penthouse of Jinzhou Bay, William glared at the darkened screen, his knuckles white.

The floor-to-ceiling windows reflected his stormy expression. The city lights sprawled beneath him, but their glow couldn't penetrate the icy room.

He dialed Sam Wilson's number, his voice sharp as frost. "Find out who she's eating with."

The video arrived quickly. The sight of Emily throwing her head back in laughter made his eyes sting. When the bespectacled man leaned in to whisper in her ear, William hurled his phone onto the sofa.

A sharp pain twisted in his gut. He remembered the last time at the hospital—Emily had looked at him with the same detached gaze.

Sam called again. "Boss, his name is Ethan He. He's in the same industry. Aside from the audition, Miss Smith hasn't met anyone else these past few days."

William scoffed. The way Ethan handed Emily a napkin in the footage reeked of ulterior motives.

"Keep watching," he ground out through clenched teeth. "Especially that Ethan He."

Outside, lightning split the sky. The summer storm arrived sudden and fierce, raindrops hammering against the glass like the dial tone of a call abruptly cut off.
###Chapter 250

Sam's report took only fifteen minutes.

Every detail of Emily Smith's recent movements was documented.
This included every person she had interacted with.

When the name "Ethan" kept reappearing, William Johnson's knuckles tightened unconsciously.
Veins snaked across the back of his hand.

So her rejection had been so firm because she already had options.

The realization made his chest tighten.

He stood abruptly.
The black leather sofa screeched against the floor.

Under the dressing room lights, he yanked on a leather jacket with rough movements.

The roar of an engine split the night.

The neon sign of a street food stall glowed brightly in the darkness.

Emily was picking up a piece of perfectly grilled squid when Ethan handed her a napkin.

"The secret sauce here is amazing," Ethan said with a smile, his gaze lingering on the sauce at the corner of her lips.

Just as Emily was about to wipe her mouth, the surrounding chatter quieted slightly.

A shadow fell over her.

She looked up, and her chopsticks clattered onto the table.

William stood behind her, one hand in his pocket, his cap pulled low.
But it couldn't hide the sharp line of his jaw.

Ethan's eyes darted between them.

"And this is...?"

William had already pulled out a plastic chair and sat down.
His long legs looked cramped in the small space.

He removed his sunglasses, revealing those unmistakable peach-blossom eyes.

"She didn't mention me?" William arched a brow, his tone carrying a dangerous intimacy.

The tips of Emily's ears turned red instantly.

Ethan's pupils constricted.
That face, often seen in financial magazines, was now right in front of him.

"V-Vice President Johnson?"

Ignoring his shock, William picked up Emily's used spoon.
He scooped up a mouthful of the now-cold seafood congee.

"Not bad," he said slowly, chewing while locking eyes with Ethan.
"Though the timing could be better."

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

"I'm Emily's..." William deliberately drew out the pause, watching Emily's tense profile.
"...suitor."

The last word landed lightly, like a boulder crashing into still water.

Emily whipped her head around to glare at him.

Ethan's smile froze.

"Seems I came at the wrong time." William suddenly stood, pulling a few bills from his wallet and pressing them onto the table.
"My treat."

He leaned down and whispered something in Emily's ear.
Her lashes trembled violently.

By the time Ethan regained his composure, William's figure had already disappeared into the crowd.
Emily's fingertips were unconsciously rubbing her earlobe.

It was red as if about to bleed.
###Chapter 251

"Mr. Johnson, Emily and I have plans later. Maybe you should leave first?" William turned to Ethan with a faint smile.

The dismissal was obvious. Ethan wasn’t stupid. He stood up politely. "Sure. Enjoy your meal. We’ll catch up another time."

He waved at Emily. She forced a smile as she watched him leave.

The moment Ethan disappeared, her smile vanished. She glared at William. "How did you find me here?"

William leisurely took off his sunglasses and tucked them into his jacket pocket. "Just passing by."

Emily didn’t believe a word. But she didn’t bother pressing him—he always had a way of tracking her down.

"I’m done. I’m leaving." She moved to stand.

William caught her wrist. He’d learned his lesson—forcing her would only push her further away.

"Emily," he softened his voice, sounding almost pitiful, "I haven’t eaten all day. Stay with me?"

She frowned.

"The congee’s cold. I’ll get you a fresh bowl." She finally relented.

William’s eyes lit up, his lips curving into a boyish grin. "Okay."

That smile made her heart skip. She pulled her hand free and went to find the owner.

Knowing his stomach was sensitive, she ordered a warm pork congee and a few skewers of the house specialty.

The dim lighting hid William’s identity, but the owner sensed they were important guests. The food arrived quickly.

Emily sterilized a new set of bowls and chopsticks with hot water and served him a steaming portion.

"I’ll just use yours." He reached for her used utensils.

She slapped his hand away and pushed the bowl toward him. Unfazed, William picked up her spoon and started eating.

"This place is nice," he said between bites. "Bring me here again?"

Emily stayed silent.

"Still mad?" He looked up. "Just tell me what’s bothering you. I won’t lose my temper."

He finished the bowl and held it out for more. With a sigh, she refilled it.

When the skewers arrived, William took a bite and nodded. "Not bad. But not as good as your cooking."

Emily turned her face away.

"Want some?" He offered her half a beef skewer.

"I’m full." She leaned back.

William didn’t insist. He took a sip from her teacup and kept eating.

Emily’s eyes widened. How could he—

The food disappeared quickly. William stood to pay, but Emily stopped him. "It’s taken care of. Let’s go."

She walked out. William caught up in a few strides and took her hand.

She tried to pull free, but he held tight. Not wanting to cause a scene, she gave in.

The street was packed with cars. William’s was clearly parked far away. They walked hand in hand for a while.

"Where’s your car?" Emily finally asked.

William rubbed his nose. "No parking. Sam drove it back."

Emily: "..."

They reached a bus stop. She stopped. "I’ll take the bus."

She tried to pull away again.

"Emily." His grip tightened, his voice rough. "Give me one more chance."

She looked up—but all she saw was her own reflection in his sunglasses.
###Chapter 252

"William Johnson, thank you for helping me with Sophia Song last time." Emily Smith pulled her hand away and took a step back. "But tonight you ruined my plans. We're even now."

"Why can Ethan pursue you, but I can't?" William's voice turned icy.

Here we go again.

Emily's expression darkened as she struggled against his grip. "Let go."

Instead, William tightened his hold and yanked her into his arms.

"Emily," his voice softened suddenly, "I can't stand seeing you smile at others while giving me the cold shoulder."

Her struggles paused.

"It hurts more than being stabbed." He looked down at her with sincere eyes.

The nickname made her ears burn. She turned her face away. "Don't call me that."

"What should I call you then?"

"My name."

William frowned. "Then how am I any different from everyone else?"

Emily had no reply.

In the distance, a bus approached. She seized the chance to break free. "The bus is here."

William released her but grabbed her hand, pulling her quickly toward the stop.

As they boarded, Emily smoothly pulled up the mobile payment code on her phone.

"How do you do this?" William leaned in to ask.

She gave him a look as if he were an alien.

"Give me your phone." She held out her hand.

William handed it over with a smile. "The passcode is your birthday."

Her fingers trembled slightly.

She unlocked it swiftly, pulled up the payment code in seconds, and shoved the phone back into his hand before heading straight for the back of the bus.

William followed closely and sat beside her, reaching for her hand again.

This time, Emily dodged.

"William," she stared out the window, "we're really not suited for each other."

"How would we know without trying?" His gaze burned into her.

"Social compatibility isn't just a saying." Her voice was barely above a whisper. "I can't reach the heights of Vice President Johnson."

William remembered Sam's report about what happened at the restaurant that day.

The private room door hadn't been fully closed. The waitstaff heard everything.

She always knew when to cut her losses.

She wouldn't subject herself to that humiliation a second time.
###Chapter 253

William Johnson's fingertips gently traced the back of Emily Smith's hand, his deep eyes shimmering with starlight. "Emily," his voice was low and tender, "you don't have to look up to my world. Let me fall into your galaxy instead."

You don't have to look up...
Fall into your galaxy...

Emily stared blankly at the man standing so close to her. Sunlight streamed through the car window, casting a golden halo around his profile, blurring the line between dream and reality.

...

In the end, she didn’t agree to William’s request.

Memories flashed through her mind like a revolving lantern—his cold silhouette in the rain that night, the humiliating moments when she was treated as a mere substitute. Each one was a thorn piercing her heart.

A man’s sweet words were the most deceptive. She refused to believe William had suddenly changed. It was only because he couldn’t get what he wanted that he remembered her—his backup option.

No matter how beautiful the dream, she had to wake up eventually. The deeper she fell, the harder the landing would be.

That night, her dreams were unusually vivid. She dreamed of William pressing her against a floor-to-ceiling window, his kisses searing her skin with unbearable heat.

When she woke, the other side of the bed was empty. Blushing, she changed the sheets and rushed to the bathroom, dousing herself in cold water to extinguish the lingering warmth.

The reflection in the mirror showed her dazed eyes. She pinched her arm hard—why couldn’t she stop thinking about him, even when she knew better?

The most ridiculous part? Last night, she had offered to be his lover—only to be rejected. The same man who once couldn’t get enough of her now acted all high and mighty.

Ding— A notification from her phone snapped her out of her thoughts. It was a scheduling notice from Leap Dubbing Studio.

Inside the recording booth, the scent of overly sweet honey pomelo tea wafted from the cup handed to her by He Ye. His gaze today was particularly intense, lingering on her in a way that made her skin prickle.

"That man yesterday… was that really William Johnson?" He Ye finally blurted out during a break.

Emily’s fingers stilled. She could have denied it, but considering future encounters, she gave a slight nod. "Yes."

"Holy—" He Ye nearly knocked over his water cup in excitement. "How do you know him? Is he chasing you?"

"Alumni," she answered curtly, unwilling to elaborate.

But He Ye was undeterred. "Big-shot celebrities really have sharp eyes, huh?"

Emily forced a smile and excused herself to prepare for the next recording.

As they wrapped up in the evening, He Ye suddenly caught up to her. "Let’s grab dinner with your boyfriend! My treat."

"I don’t have a boyfriend," she reflexively countered.

"William Johnson," He Ye waggled his eyebrows. "It’s only a matter of time, right?"

At that moment, the elevator doors slid open. Emily looked up—and collided with a pair of amused eyes.

The CEO of Leap was mid-sentence, but William’s gaze was locked onto her. Seeing her deliberately avoid eye contact, the man narrowed his eyes dangerously.

"Emily," he murmured, the affectionate nickname rolling off his tongue, "pretending not to know me?"

The sudden intimacy made the CEO abruptly stop talking, his shocked eyes darting to the girl outside the elevator.
###Chapter 254

The elevator doors slid open, freezing Mr. Yan's expression mid-smile.

"Mr. Johnson? Mr. Yan?" He Ye was the first to react, flashing a bright grin. "What a coincidence!"

His gaze shifted to Emily Smith, winking playfully. "Emily, did Mr. Johnson come specifically to pick you up after work?"

Emily pressed her lips together, silent.

"Exactly." William Johnson admitted without hesitation, extending a slender hand toward her. His voice softened impossibly. "Sweetheart, come here."

That elegant hand remained stubbornly outstretched before the elevator doors.

"You two know each other?" Mr. Yan finally found his voice, his smile strained.

William arched a brow, tone definitive. "I'm pursuing her."

Mr. Yan inhaled sharply, immediately gesturing obsequiously toward Emily. "Emily, please—I wouldn't dare keep you waiting."

Emily sidestepped William's hand, striding quickly into the elevator.

The next instant, warm fingers enveloped her cool ones without permission.

He Ye tactfully positioned himself beside Mr. Yan.

"Since you're here, Mr. Johnson, why not join us for dinner?" Mr. Yan rubbed his hands together eagerly. "Emily and He Ye are both available."

William's gaze never left Emily's face. "What do you think, sweetheart?"

Emily glared at him.

"Sorry, I have plans tonight." Her refusal was icy.

"Another time then." William conceded smoothly.

Mr. Yan chuckled. "With Emily around, there'll be plenty of opportunities."

The elevator reached the lobby. William led Emily out of the building, trailed by Mr. Yan and He Ye until they watched the pair enter the black Maybach.

The moment the car door closed, Emily shook off his hand.

"Angry?" William leaned closer, studying her expression.

"William Johnson," Emily met his eyes directly. "Your pursuit is your business, but must the entire company know?"

William blinked, then nodded earnestly. "My oversight. I'll be more discreet."

"And," Emily turned her face away. "Stop using me as an excuse to visit the office."

Amusement flickered in William's eyes. "Understood. Tomorrow I'll come just for you."

Emily whipped her head back. "..."

"Hungry? What would you like to eat?" He reached for her hand again.

This time she didn't pull away, though her tone remained cool. "I'm visiting Amy at the hospital."

"I'll go with you."

"No need." She frowned. "Go eat."

William tightened his grip, pausing. "What's wrong?"

Emily drew a deep breath. "We shouldn't be serious. If it's just physical needs, keep it casual like before. No commitments necessary."

"Sweetheart..." William's eyes instantly softened, resembling a wounded puppy.

The stark contrast to his usual commanding CEO demeanor made Emily avert her gaze.
###Chapter 255

"I don't need a title, William." My fingers clenched the hem of my shirt, my voice barely above a whisper. "What you've done for my sister—I'll spend my whole life repaying you."

Being his nameless, status-less lover was the safest shield. Those women who coveted William, those lofty members of the Johnson family—none of them would bother targeting an insignificant mistress.

The only reason Daniel Chen's parents and Sophia's family had spared me and my family was because Daniel had compromised. But what about the Johnsons? What about Olivia Davis?

The memory of being drugged at the bar was still fresh in my mind. Olivia's ruthless methods were something I couldn't handle.

William's expression darkened instantly. His lips pressed into a thin line, his jaw tightening into a sharp, forbidding angle.

"Head to Central Hospital," he suddenly ordered.

Sam immediately turned the steering wheel.

"Wait!" I grabbed the armrest, panic flaring. "Let's eat first."

William's stomach couldn't handle hunger. That knowledge made me relent instantly.

"What do you want?" His brow lifted slightly, a glint of triumph flashing in his eyes.

"Your choice."

"One Taste." He didn't hesitate.

My fingers twitched. That place—filled with humiliating memories.

The elevator took us straight to the top floor. The familiar hallway, the same private room door. When the manager pushed open the gilded doors, my blood ran cold.

"Let go!" I struggled violently, my nails digging into the back of William's hand.

The room was eerily silent. The chandelier's refracted light stung my eyes, and the flood of degrading memories nearly drowned me.

"Emily." William yanked me into his arms, his warm palm pressing against the nape of my neck. "What are you afraid of?"

"You know damn well!" My voice trembled. "Bringing me here—do you want me to relive the humiliation?"

"Yes. I did it on purpose." He gripped my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze. "But I want you to remember—from now on, no one will lay a finger on you again."

His breath brushed my lashes, cool with the faint scent of mint.

"Those who hurt you—" His thumb traced my lips, his eyes churning with something dark and terrifying. "I'll make them pay a hundred times over."

I stared at him, stunned. This man—who had once pushed me into the abyss—now looked at me with an obsession and tenderness I'd never seen before.

A self-deprecating smile curled my lips. How pathetic. I was falling for him all over again.
###Chapter 256

Emily looked up into William's eyes, her voice trembling slightly. "William, wasn't it you who hurt me the most?"

"I was wrong." His fingertips gently brushed her cheek. "Emily, I regret it."

His hand slid to the back of her head as he leaned down to kiss the tip of her nose. "Give me a chance to make it right. I swear I'll never hurt you again."

Emily froze.

She never expected to hear the word "regret" from him.

"Come back to me." His voice held a pleading tone she'd never heard before.

"Why?" She turned her face away. "Is it because of my body? Or—"

"Yes, I want you." William admitted without hesitation. His thumb traced the side of her neck as he kissed her nose again. "But I want you more. These past few months, just thinking about you made my skin burn."

Emily frowned, unable to believe her ears.

"Emily..." Seeing her disbelief, William gave a bitter smile. He stepped closer, his voice rough. "Can you feel it? How much I need you?"

Emily jerked back. "William!"

He caught her waist. "That's right, I'm a bastard." His lips curled self-deprecatingly. "Forgive this bastard, won't you?"

She shook her head instinctively.

It wasn't that she couldn't forgive him—she was just stunned by this brutally honest version of William.

"If you just want my body, you can have it now." She said stubbornly.

William went still.

"You really..." He released her, stepping back with a wry laugh. "Are heartless."

With that, he turned and stormed out of the private room.

"William!" Emily chased after him, only to see him disappear into the men's restroom. She paused for a second before realization dawned. A laugh escaped her.

Just then, the restaurant manager arrived with servers to deliver their food. Seeing the empty room, he asked, "Ma'am, shall we serve the dishes now?"

"Go ahead." Emily returned to her seat.

The food was laid out, but William still hadn't returned. She waited quietly, not touching her chopsticks.

Fifteen minutes later, William finally reappeared. His shoulders visibly relaxed when he saw her still sitting there.

"Let's eat." Emily picked up her chopsticks casually.

"Emily." William sat beside her and took her hand, his eyes blazing.

"Hmm?"

"I was scared just now." His gaze locked onto hers.

"Of what?"

"That you'd leave."

Emily glanced at him. "The food's getting cold."

"You waited for me?" His lips curved up.

She shifted uncomfortably under his stare. "If you're not eating, I'm leaving."

"I'll eat!" He hastily grabbed his chopsticks, shoving the nearest dish into his mouth before deftly peeling a shrimp and holding it to her lips.

Emily dodged. "Eat it yourself."

"I washed my hands." He insisted. "Smell them if you don't believe me."

With no choice, she opened her mouth and accepted it. This version of William today was like a different person—one she couldn't handle.

She kept her head down, focusing on her meal, not daring to look at him again.
###Chapter 257

William Johnson's dinner was a meticulously orchestrated performance.

He deliberately cut his steak into a heart shape and drew a smiley face on the napkin with red wine. Emily Smith ate her salad expressionlessly, ignoring his childish antics.

The hospital corridor lights stretched their shadows long and thin.

The door to Amy's room was slightly ajar, the steady beeping of the heart monitor faintly audible. When they entered, Nurse Green was wiping Amy's hands and immediately stood upon seeing them.

"Mr. Johnson, Miss Smith."

Emily's gaze settled on her sister's face. Amy's eyelashes cast delicate shadows under the light, her lips no longer as pale as before. Emily reached out and took her sister's hand, the warmth sending a tremor through her chest.

"Her temperature is normal now?"

Nurse Green nodded with a smile. "Since last week. The doctor says it's a good sign."

Emily glanced toward William by the window. The man was flipping casually through the medical records. Sensing her gaze, he looked up and arched a brow.

"Thank you for your hard work, Nurse Green," Emily said, withdrawing her hand. "The medical expenses—"

"Paid through the end of the year," William closed the file. "Including the upgrade to the private suite."

Emily's grip tightened on the bed rail. The cold metal seeped into her palm as she suddenly noticed how much more spacious the room was—now with an imported ventilator in the corner.

"I'll pick you up in half an hour." William checked his watch and turned to leave.

As the door clicked shut, Nurse Green hesitated. "Emily, actually, Mr. Johnson—"

"I know." Emily cut her off, gently smoothing her sister's hair. "He's always been good at winning people over."

The car ride back was thick with cologne and silence.

Emily rolled down the window, letting the night wind tangle through her hair. Without warning, she turned to William. "Let's go to the hotel."

His fingers paused on his loosened tie.

"So eager?" His low chuckle carried no warmth, his eyes icy.

Emily swung a leg over his lap. The motion was so familiar that William instinctively steadied her waist. Her silk shirt rode up slightly, revealing a sliver of pale skin.

"One last time, and we're even." She leaned down and nipped at his throat.

William seized the back of her head. The kiss was punishing, the taste of blood mingling with the wine on his tongue. Emily recognized the flavor—he'd deliberately used her glass at dinner.

When his hand slid beneath her shirt, she shuddered. Her body, untouched for so long, betrayed her instantly, every inch of skin crying out for more. Just as she arched into him, William pulled away.

"See?" His thumb swiped across her damp lips, his voice rough. "Your body is far more honest than your mouth."

Emily realized her fists were clenched in his shirt. She jerked back, but William pinned her wrists to the leather seat.

"Beg," he breathed against her ear. "And I'll give you what you want."
###Chapter 258

Emily Smith jolted back to awareness, her cheeks burning. She turned her face away to evade his lips. "William Johnson, either take me or get off."

"Don't miss me at all?" His kisses trailed along her neck, warm breath ghosting over her skin.

Emily clenched the seatbelt, eyes shut tight. "No."

"Sure?" His fingers tugged at her collar.

"Sure." Her voice trembled.

William suddenly pulled back, studying her with amusement. When nothing happened after a long moment, Emily cracked open an eye—only to meet his laughing gaze.

"Liar." He leaned in closer. "You missed me desperately."

Flustered, Emily yanked her clothes straight. "Stop the car!"

"Sweetheart—"

"Let me out!" She slammed the partition button. Sam Wilson caught the silent cue in the rearview mirror and pulled over.

The door slammed shut hard enough to rattle the windows. Emily hailed a cab and sped off, but the black Maybach shadowed her relentlessly in the rearview mirror.

At Sky City's elevator, the doors were about to close when a hand shot through. Emily stumbled back as William stepped in calmly. She mashed the close-door button like he was the devil himself.

The keypad beeped an error. Emily's shaking fingers botched the code three times. Finally inside, she threw three deadbolts and slid down the door, collapsing to the floor.

The doorbell rang like a death knell.

Under the shower's scalding spray, Emily buried her face in her hands. Water sluiced over her burning ears. The mirror reflected swollen lips and faint red marks on her collarbone.

William's WeChat notifications chimed incessantly through the water. The latest read: The code's 0214. Want me to prove it?

Outside, Mia Harris rounded the hallway humming, nearly colliding with a tall figure leaning against the wall.

"V-Vice President Johnson?" Her boba tea almost slipped. "Why aren't you inside?"

"Waiting for my Emily." He waved his phone. "She's showering."

Mia's eyes widened. Fumbling with the fingerprint lock, she yanked the door open eagerly. "Please come in! Emily... showers really fast!"

The moment William crossed the threshold, the bathroom door clicked open. Emily froze in her robe, a droplet from her hair splattering onto the marble tiles.
###Chapter 259

Emily Smith stepped out of the shower, a towel wrapped around her body.

Her damp hair dripped water down her back.

She looked up and met William Johnson's burning gaze.

His eyes traced every inch of her exposed skin like embers. The towel barely covered her thighs. Droplets slid from her collarbone into the shadowed valley between her breasts. The crimson love marks stood out vividly against her flushed skin, like red blossoms on snow.

"Sweetheart, are you allergic to something?" Mia Harris's shocked voice rang from the doorway.

Emily whirled around and bolted for the bedroom. But William pinned her against the door the moment it clicked shut. His palm seared into her waist.

"Mia's in the living room—" She clutched the towel tighter.

William nuzzled her wet hair aside with his nose. "What do adults need to hide?" Before she could answer, he captured her lower lip between his teeth.

This time, Emily didn't respond. She counted the cracks on the ceiling until his ragged breathing made him release her.

"Let's go to a hotel." She pressed a hand against his chest. "Not here."

His Adam's apple bobbed. Suddenly, he buried his face in her shoulder and sucked hard. The sharp pain made her shiver, but his muffled laughter followed. "You're cruel."

When the door opened, Mia stood there munching chips, her eyes darting to Emily's swollen lips. "Need me to disappear for two hours?"

"He asked me to be his girlfriend." Emily grabbed her pajamas.

Mia's chips scattered across the floor. "And you said no?"

"Yeah."

"Why?"

Emily gazed at the neon lights outside. The window reflected the fresh bite mark on her neck. "A hundred million dollars is too steep for sincerity."
###Chapter 260

Mia snatched the towel from Emily's hands, roughly drying her damp hair. "Are you stupid? Why didn't you say yes?"

"It's not appropriate." Emily lowered her lashes. "My father is still in prison."

Mia's hand paused. She scoffed and tossed the towel aside. "True. Dating someone like William Johnson would be a disaster waiting to happen."

"Do you think I..." Emily bit her lower lip, her voice fading.

"If you like him, go for it!" Mia slapped her back. "You've already slept together. Who cares if it lasts? Enjoy it while you can!"

Emily stumbled from the force of the slap.

"Life's short, got it?" Mia gripped her shoulders. "Imagine being eighty and regretting never sleeping with the guy of your dreams. That's real tragedy."

Emily burst into laughter.

...

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains. Emily stretched, surprised she'd slept so well.

Today was her visit to Grasshopper Audiobook. She applied flawless makeup and dressed in professional attire. At 8:30, her editor Yin texted that the driver was on his way.

After nearly an hour, her phone finally rang.

"Miss Smith, I'm at the gate." The driver's voice was icy.

A black Mercedes idled by the curb. As Emily opened the door, an odd perfume scent hit her.

"Are you a Grasshopper employee?" she asked cautiously.

The driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "I just drive."

The car suddenly turned onto an unfamiliar road. Emily's pulse quickened. "Is this the wrong way?"

"Picking up another anchor," the driver replied curtly.

Emily discreetly texted Yin. No response.

When the car entered a hotel's underground garage, her finger hovered over the emergency contact button.

"Why are we going underground—"

The driver suddenly pulled out a spray bottle.

"Pssht—"

William's voice came through her phone. "Emily?"

"Hel—" Her vision blurred. The phone slipped to the floor with a dull thud.
###Chapter 261

"Emily!" William Johnson shot up from his office chair, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the phone. The faint cry for help that had abruptly cut off on the other end made his blood run cold.

"Sam!" he barked, his voice laced with terrifying frost.

Three minutes later, Sam Wilson pushed open the door with a grave expression. "Mr. Johnson, the men protecting Miss Emily were in a car accident on Jiangming Road."

William's eyes darkened instantly. The pen in his hand snapped with a sharp crack. "Investigate!"

Surveillance footage showed a black Mercedes vanishing around the corner of Chongming Road. The tech team quickly traced the license plate—a reception vehicle from Grasshopper Audiobook. But the real driver was currently hospitalized, his skull bruised from a blunt force trauma.

"Where has Alexander Johnson been lately?" William loosened his tie, his eyes churning with violent undercurrents.

On the plush carpet of the presidential suite, Emily Smith struggled to push herself up on trembling arms. The lingering dizziness from the sedative blurred her vision. She dug her nails into her palms, fighting to stay conscious.

The door suddenly swung open.

Alexander Johnson strolled in, leisurely rolling up his shirt sleeves. His polished shoes made no sound on the carpet. When he leaned down, his cologne overwhelmed her senses. Emily jerked her head away as he reached for her.

"Did William never teach you manners?" Alexander gripped her chin, his thumb brushing her quivering lips. "It's not too late to beg for mercy."

Emily bit her tongue hard, the metallic tang of blood sharpening her focus. "If you dare touch me—"

"Shh." His icy finger pressed against her lips before he suddenly yanked her toward the bathroom. Under the rushing faucet, he forced her head toward the mirror. "Take a good look. How long do you think you can last?"

The reflection showed a ghostly pale girl, her soaked shirt clinging to her skin. Alexander suddenly chuckled and released her, turning to dial a number. "Little brother, your stray kitten is with me..."
###Chapter 262

Emily's pupils constricted violently.

Her hands pressed desperately against Alexander's chest, fingertips trembling uncontrollably.

"Don't..." Her voice was barely a whisper, her body limp as if drained of all bones, sinking into the mattress.

Alexander chuckled darkly, effortlessly lifting and tossing her onto the bed.

He leaned over her, arms caging her in, his gaze roaming hungrily over her face.

"Mr. Johnson..." Emily shook her head weakly, too drained to even lift a hand.

Darkness crept at the edges of her vision, consciousness slipping away like the tide.

"Don't what?" Alexander traced her pale cheek with his thumb. "I gave you a chance."

His fingers slithered like vipers, gliding from her forehead to her chin.

Emily shuddered violently, teeth chattering.

"Please..." She barely managed a breathy plea. "Let me go..."

"Let you go?" Alexander suddenly gripped her chin. "Who told you to get involved with William again?"

His eyes darkened with fury. "I hate him most of all."

Emily squeezed her eyes shut in despair.

Tears rolled down her temples, soaking into her hair.

"Don't be afraid." Alexander's hand trailed lower. "I'll make you happy."

He licked his lips. "I'll be gentler than William."

He began unbuttoning his shirt, one slow, deliberate button at a time.

Emily gasped like a stranded fish, mouth opening soundlessly.

Fear and the drugs rendered her mute, leaving her helpless as his shadow loomed over her.

"No one will interrupt us this time." Alexander unbuckled his belt. "Enjoy it."

As he leaned down, Emily turned her face away, tears soaking the pillow.

"Relax." Alexander gripped her shoulders, yanking at the zipper of her black velvet dress.

The fabric gave a faint ripping sound.

BANG!

The door crashed open with a deafening slam.

Alexander whipped his head around.

Thundering footsteps approached.

Fumbling with his pants, he barely had time to stand before a powerful kick sent him flying.

William stormed in, eyes blazing crimson.

Another brutal kick landed on Alexander's ribs.

"Ah!" Alexander curled into a fetal position. "Have you lost your mind? I'm your brother!"

William grabbed him by the collar, fist swinging with a sharp whistle of air.

Veins bulged at his temples as he spat through gritted teeth, "You don't deserve that title."
###Chapter 263

William's fury burned through the air like wildfire.

His fists clenched until his knuckles turned white, the sound of cracking joints echoing in the room.

"Get out!" William roared, delivering a brutal kick to Alexander's chest.

Alexander was sent flying, his body slamming against the doorframe with a sickening thud.

"Sam!" William barked.

Sam immediately pushed the door open.

Without a word, he hauled Alexander up and dragged him out, closing the door softly behind him.

William rushed to the bed in three quick strides.

"Emily..."

His voice trembled as he carefully turned her over.

Tears clung to Emily's lashes, her gaze unfocused as she looked up at him.

"What did he do to you?" William's voice was thick with restrained rage.

Her fingers shook as they clutched his sleeve.

"Hos...pital..." she managed to whisper.

William's eyes swept over her flushed cheeks and dazed expression—and instantly understood.

"You don't need a hospital." He gently cupped her burning face. "I'll help you."

Emily's pupils dilated slightly, her lips trembling as she tried to refuse.

But the drug had taken full effect.

The moment William's lips met hers, the last shred of her resistance shattered.

His familiar scent enveloped her, igniting a primal need for more.

She kissed him back desperately, her fingers twisting into his shirt.

William's breathing grew ragged.

He could hold back no longer, crushing her against him.

......

The fading sunlight spilled across the tangled sheets.

Exhausted, Emily lay draped over William's chest, too spent to even lift a finger.

He pressed a satisfied kiss to her hair.

"You were breathtaking today," he murmured, voice thick with contentment.

Emily kept her eyes closed, pretending to sleep—but her heart skipped a beat.

She knew the truth.

The second half hadn't been the drug's doing at all.

She craved William's touch, reveled in their closeness.

This was a feeling she'd never had for anyone else.

"I'm sorry I was late." William traced her cheek lightly. "But Alexander will pay for this."

"He's your brother," Emily finally whispered, her voice hoarse.

William lifted her face, his gaze burning.

"Yes, he's my brother." His words were deliberate. "But you're mine. Touching you is a death wish."

Emily slowly opened her eyes.

Those three words—"you're mine"—struck her heart like a hammer.
###Chapter 264

Their eyes met, and William's lips found hers again.

His kiss was gentle yet intoxicating, sending tremors through her heart.

"Emily, won't you be my girlfriend now?" His voice was husky, laced with tender persuasion.

Emily gazed into his deep eyes and suddenly asked, "Did you know I was in danger because of that phone call?"

She hadn't held out hope for that faint, indistinct cry for help.

Yet at her most desperate moment, he had appeared like a savior.

Once or twice might have been coincidence.

But every time she fell into darkness, he pulled her back.

This was more than just gratitude.

She realized with startling clarity—she had fallen in love with this man.

"How did you find me with just one word?" she whispered.

William cradled her face, his thumb brushing her flushed skin. "Emily, I've had people protecting you all along."

Her pupils contracted slightly.

All those unexplained incidents suddenly made sense.

"Why?" Her voice trembled.

He kissed her lightly. "Too many people want to harm you. How could I not worry?"

Her heart skipped a beat.

He had been guarding her in the shadows all this time.

"Do you do this for other women too?"

"No," he said firmly. "Only you."

Only her.

The truth hardly mattered anymore.

Mia was right—life was too short to deny oneself happiness.

"William, I can be with you," she met his gaze steadily, "but I don't need the title of girlfriend."

"If you ever grow tired of me, or decide to marry someone else, just say the word. I'll leave quietly."

"Emily..."

"Do you promise?" she pressed stubbornly.

William studied her for a long moment before finally nodding. "Alright."

He knew she still didn't fully trust him.

But that title—he would place it upon her himself.

This kiss lingered, only breaking when she gasped for air.

"Let's get you cleaned up first, then eat something?" He stroked her crimson cheeks.

Emily nodded wearily.

The warm bathwater soothed her aching muscles.

As William's hands glided over her smooth skin, his desire stirred again.

Suddenly, Emily wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him first.

His breath hitched, control nearly slipping.

"Does it hurt?" she teased with a sly smile. "You can keep going."

He pinched her nose playfully. "You're already swollen. Doesn't it hurt?"

"In the water... it feels different," she murmured, ears burning.

"Really?" His voice turned gravelly.
###Chapter 265

"Really?" William narrowed his eyes, his fingertips tracing slow circles at her waist.

Emily didn't respond. Instead, she leaned forward, closing the distance between them.

William's Adam's apple bobbed as a low groan escaped his throat. He dipped his head, nipping at her collarbone, his voice rough. "Emily, you're such a temptress..."

Her slender arms wound around his neck as she laughed softly. "Then you must be... the devil himself."

"A temptress and a devil—a match made in heaven." His chuckle was dark, his movements growing even more tender.

The warm water enveloped them, and Emily felt as though she might melt entirely.

"Emily." William suddenly stilled, his thumb brushing over her lips. "Why didn't you let Daniel touch you?"

Her eyes flew open. "How did you know?"

He smirked. "Every inch of you bears my mark. Of course I'd know."

Her ears burned as she turned her face away. "He didn't want to."

"Liar." William caught her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "If he truly didn't want to, why would he have slept with Sophia—"

"You investigated him?" Emily frowned.

William neither confirmed nor denied it, only tightening his grip. "He wasn't drunk that night. A man who's truly drunk can't perform."

Emily bit her lip, silent.

"He'd been holding back for so long, and Sophia threw herself at him..." His whisper was hot against her ear.

"It's my fault. If I had—"

Before she could finish, William crushed his lips to hers, swallowing her words.

......

After dinner, William carried a drowsy Emily to the car.

"There's a villa by Divine Lake. Should we move there?" He stroked her hair gently.

Half-asleep, she murmured, "Why move?"

"Because... other women have lived at Jinzhou Bay." His tone was pointed.

"Amanda?" Her eyes fluttered open. "She didn't mind that I lived there. Why should I care?"

William chuckled. "But she stayed in the master bedroom."

"So what?" Emily nestled deeper into his arms. "The sheets have been changed anyway."

He tightened his hold, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. "But I want you in the master bedroom."
###Chapter 266

Emily Smith looked up at him, her eyes glinting with mischief. "How about... we change the mattress in the master bedroom?"

William Johnson's breath hitched.

Without hesitation, he pulled out his phone and dialed Song Yan.

"Replace the master bedroom mattress immediately."

When William carried the sleeping Emily back to the apartment, he ran into Song Yan directing workers to remove the old mattress.

"Mr. Johnson!" Song Yan hurried forward but froze when she saw who was in his arms.

William pressed a finger to his lips.

Song Yan's gaze locked onto Emily. Even with her face buried against his chest, she recognized her instantly.

Her nails dug into her palms.

"The new mattress has been installed," she forced out with a professional smile, though her voice trembled.

William didn't even glance at her as he carried Emily straight to the master bedroom.

Emily was deep asleep. He carefully removed her outerwear and tucked her in.

Then he turned to the medicine cabinet, searching for ointment.

After washing and disinfecting his hands, he lifted the corner of the blanket.

The moment his fingers brushed the reddened skin, Emily whimpered awake.

"Don't move." He leaned down and kissed her until her breathing grew unsteady before pulling back. "I'm applying medicine."

Too drowsy to open her eyes, Emily mumbled in response.

When the ointment touched her skin, she tensed, her toes curling.

"Be good, it'll be over soon." His touch gentled.

By the time he returned from washing his hands, Emily was asleep again.

His phone vibrated abruptly.

The word "Father" on the screen made his gaze turn icy.

He declined the call, left a note, and quietly closed the door behind him.

In the VIP hospital room, Alexander Johnson groaned in pain.

"That bastard!" He Zhaoyue trembled with rage. "He's trying to kill him!"

Shen Huaiqing's expression darkened. "What exactly happened?"

"What could I have done?" Alexander's face twisted. "He's a rabid dog!"

He Zhaoyue shot to her feet. "Shen Huaiqing! If you don't rein him in, I'll be the next one lying here!"

Shen Huaiqing stared at the flickering numbers on the monitor, silent as a statue.
###Chapter 267

"He's only acting so high and mighty because Uncle Henry backs him up." Alexander Johnson rubbed his bruised lip, his voice dripping with venom. "Just wait till Uncle dies. Let's see how long he can keep this act up."

"You insolent brat!" Charles Johnson slammed his hand on the table, making the teacup rattle. "Are you cursing your own uncle now?"

The Johnson family's empire had been built on the unity between the two brothers. If anything happened to Henry Johnson, it would be like losing an arm.

"That's not what I meant." Alexander scoffed. "I'm just worried Uncle will leave all his assets to William. Can you imagine how insufferable he'll become then?"

Sophia Song immediately chimed in, "Charles, we can't ignore this." She'd had the same concern but never dared voice it.

Just as Charles was about to erupt, the butler's voice came from outside. "Vice President Johnson is here."

Their faces paled instantly.

William Johnson strode into the hospital room with measured steps. His gaze swept over Alexander on the bed before briefly landing on Charles and Sophia. Before he could speak, Sophia shrieked, "William! Have you no respect for family rules? How dare you beat your elder brother like this? Are you even fit to bear the Johnson name?"

William ignored her, turning to Charles instead.

"Why did you resort to such violence?" Charles demanded.

William remained silent, simply calling out, "Sam."

Sam Wilson entered, dragging a bloodied man—the driver who had kidnapped Emily Smith that morning.

"What is this?" Sophia wrinkled her nose in disgust.

The driver collapsed to his knees, trembling. "It was... the young master... He ordered me to kidnap Miss Smith... drug her... and deliver her to his bed..."

"Emily Smith?" Charles narrowed his eyes. "Who is she?"

"My girlfriend." William finally spoke, each word sharp as a blade.

"Girlfriend?" Charles pressed. "What's her family background?"

William smirked. "Father, you're missing the point."

"She's just the daughter of some white-collar criminal. A plaything at best." Alexander sneered. "She should be honored I even noticed her—"

"William!"

In a flash, William was at the bedside. Sophia screamed and threw herself over her son.

"Could there be some misunderstanding?" Charles tried to defuse the tension.

William took a stack of photos from Sam and hurled them onto the coffee table. The images scattered—each one a graphic shot of Alexander with different women in compromising positions.

Charles and Sophia turned ashen.

"William!" Alexander roared, struggling to sit up before wincing in pain. "You dare spy on me?"

"This is just the tip of the iceberg." William's lips curled dangerously. "Imagine if these photos were leaked to every major media outlet..."

"You wouldn't!" Alexander's eyes bulged with rage.

William gave him one last chilling look before turning to leave. Sam followed close behind, their footsteps echoing down the hallway.
###Chapter 268

The night was deep, and the apartment in Jinzhou Bay was enveloped in silence.

William Johnson pushed the door open to find only a dim wall lamp illuminating the bedroom. Emily Smith lay curled under the blankets, her breathing even and steady. Her long, dark hair spilled across the pillow, contrasting sharply with her snow-white skin.

He stood by the bed, watching her for a long moment. The exhaustion in his eyes gradually softened into tenderness. Slipping off his suit jacket, he lifted the corner of the blanket and slid in beside her, carefully pulling her into his arms.

"Mmm..." Emily instinctively nuzzled closer, her lashes fluttering as she cracked open one sleepy eye. "You're back?"

"Did I wake you?" He pressed a kiss to her forehead.

She shook her head, a sweet smile tugging at her lips before she drifted back to sleep. William tightened his embrace, burying his face in her hair, breathing in her familiar scent as he closed his eyes.

When morning light filtered through the curtains, Emily fumbled for her phone and squinted at the screen—9:30 AM.

She shifted slightly, trying to ease out of his arms. But the moment she moved, his grip around her waist tightened.

"Stop it..." she murmured in protest, only to freeze when she turned and felt something hot pressing against her through his thin shirt.

William chuckled darkly, rolling her beneath him and capturing her lips in a deep, lingering kiss. He didn’t let up until she was breathless.

"Don’t like it?" His voice was rough as his fingers traced her flushed cheek.

Emily turned her face away. "We should get to work."

"Don’t want to." He nuzzled her neck like a spoiled child. "Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"Come back to BestTech?" He lifted his head, his gaze intense.

Emily shook her head firmly. "No."

"Double your salary?"

"No."

"Then..." He lowered his voice, whispering something in her ear that made the tips of them burn red. She swatted at him. "William!"

Laughing, he caught her hand. "Think about it?"

"I like my current job better," she said seriously. "And..."

"And what?"

"And dealing with you is too hard on my back." She blinked innocently.

William stared for a second before growling and tickling her mercilessly. They tumbled across the bed, laughing, only to end up tangled together again.

"Ow—" Emily suddenly winced, sucking in a sharp breath.

He stilled immediately, his forehead pressed to hers, breathing heavily. "Bear with it?"

"You think this is something I can just bear?" She gave him a helpless look, taking in his flushed face.

With a long sigh, William flopped onto his back, staring blankly at the ceiling. "What did I do to deserve this..."

Emily giggled and leaned over to kiss his chin. "Be good. I’ll make it up to you tonight."

His eyes lit up, but before he could respond, his phone rang. The moment he saw the caller ID, his expression darkened.

"What’s wrong?" She instantly noticed the change.

William ruffled her hair and sat up to answer. "Nothing. Just work."

But Emily clearly saw the shadow that flickered in his eyes as he turned away.
###Chapter 269

The first light of dawn filtered through the curtains as Emily Smith finally slipped free from William Johnson's embrace.

Her bare feet touched the cold marble floor.

She darted into the guest bathroom like a startled rabbit.

The warm water cascaded over her skin, but it couldn't wash away the lingering traces of last night's intimacy.

The walk-in closet in the master bedroom stood empty.

The dress she had worn yesterday had vanished without a trace—not even a scrap of fabric remained.

"Looking for this?"

William leaned against the doorframe, swirling a cup of black coffee.

The morning light gilded his silhouette, but it couldn't mask the darkness swirling in his eyes.

She tightened the towel around herself and took a wary step back.

On the dining table, the fried eggs still sizzled in the pan.

Suddenly, William set down his coffee and closed the distance between them in three quick strides.

He pinned her against the kitchen counter.

The cold marble dug into the small of her back, while his body burned against hers.

"Wear my shirt."

It wasn't a request.

When Emily appeared in the dining room drowning in his oversized white shirt, the milk glass trembled in her hand.

The hem barely grazed the tops of her thighs, and the tantalizing glimpses of skin made William's throat tighten.

The doorbell rang at that exact moment.

Eight luxury boutique attendants filed in, their arms laden with shopping bags piled high like a small mountain.

Olivia Davis stood at the front, her nails digging into her palms.

She saw the marks on the girl's neck.

She saw the tenderness in William's eyes as he rolled up the sleeves for her.

The walk-in closet became a sea of luxury.

Emily crouched among the piles of price tags when strong arms wrapped around her from behind, the scent of sandalwood enveloping her.

"These..." She clutched the tag of a silk nightgown, her voice strained. "Don't buy them anymore."

William's lips brushed her ear, leaving no room for argument. "You deserve the best."

The car's air freshener diffused the crisp scent of cedar.

Emily watched the cityscape blur past the window before suddenly turning to him. "I don't want to move."

The brakes screeched.

William's fingers drummed against the steering wheel before he chuckled darkly.

"Then you'd better remind Mia Harris..." He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "...to ring the doorbell next time."

The seatbelt clicked open.

Emily flushed crimson and covered his mouth. "I'll move!"

Sunlight streamed through the sunroof, casting their tangled shadows across the leather seats.

In the distance, the glass facades of office towers glittered like scattered diamonds.
###Chapter 270

"Fine!" Before William could finish speaking, Emily reached up to cover his mouth. "I'll move."

This man always knew how to unravel her composure.

The corner of William's lips curved as he took her hand and pressed a kiss to her fingers. "Good girl."

Emily turned her face away.

Back at the Grand Heights apartment, Emily opened the closet and began packing her things.

"Need help?" William leaned against the doorframe.

"No." She didn't look up. "Just stay where you are."

He arched a brow, watching her move briskly around the room.

There weren't many clothes—most had been bought by him. She only took a few frequently worn pieces, leaving the rest neatly hanging.

Makeup and recording equipment took up most of the suitcase.

"That's it?" William asked as she zipped it shut.

"Yes." She nodded. "I'll come back if I need anything else."

He took the suitcase and led her out of the apartment by the hand.

In the car, Emily checked the time. "You should go to the office first. Sam can take me back."

"Just call me Sam," the driver quickly interjected from the front seat.

Emily smiled faintly.

At the entrance of BestTech Tower, William hesitated before getting out.

"Come up with me?" His fingers traced circles on her wrist.

"No." She pulled her hand back. "It'll distract you from work."

"I can't focus without you." He leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear.

The tips of Emily's ears flushed pink. "I have a recording session at Leap Studios this afternoon."

William suddenly pulled out his wallet and slid a black card into her palm.

"Use it however you want."

She pushed it back. "I have my own money."

William narrowed his eyes, then cupped the back of her neck and kissed her.

The kiss carried a hint of punishment, only breaking when her breathing grew uneven.

"Sam will arrange security to follow you." His thumb brushed her slightly swollen lips. "Let me know before you go out."

Emily nodded. "Understood."

She exhaled as she watched him enter the building, then turned to Sam. "Let's go."

Her reflection in the window showed flushed cheeks.
###Chapter 271

The secretary's office outside the 67th-floor executive suite of Jinzhou Bay No.1 buzzed with activity.

The elevator doors slid open with a crisp ding.

Grace Lee looked up to see William Johnson striding out, his lips curved in a faint, satisfied smile. The air of triumph around him left the entire secretarial staff momentarily stunned.

"Good morning, sir," Grace said, hastily rising to her feet.

William gave a slight nod. "Come in."

Inside the office, he flipped open a file. "Transfer the Jinzhou Bay No.1 apartment under Emily Smith's name."

Grace's pupils contracted. That was a luxury property worth hundreds of millions.

"Problem?" William arched a brow.

"I'll handle it immediately." She lowered her head and retreated, nearly colliding with the glass door on her way out.

Soon, James Wilson was summoned.

"Any updates from Flying Fish?" William asked without looking up.

"The results will be out today."

William tapped his fingers lightly on the desk. "If she's selected, arrange a meeting with Flying Fish's CEO."

James understood instantly. This was about acquiring the entire company.

Emily had just finished packing when her phone rang.

"Lunch?" William's voice came through the receiver.

"I'm not hungry," she declined quickly.

A low chuckle sounded on the other end. "But I am."

The last word was deliberately emphasized, making Emily's ears burn. "I'm going out."

"Where?"

"Business." She hung up decisively.

At 2 PM, a black Toyota van pulled up punctually downstairs. Bodyguard Ethan's sharp, hawk-like eyes scanned the surroundings as he opened the door for her.

The spacious interior smelled faintly of leather. Emily ran her fingers over the armrest, warmth blooming in her chest.

At Flying Fish's recording studio, CEO Yan had been waiting anxiously.

"Is the temperature comfortable, Miss Smith?"
"Would you prefer a different chair?" He hovered behind her like a shadow.

Emily sighed, rubbing her temples. "Mr. Yan, treat me like any other voice actor."

He wiped his brow. "Just let me know if you need anything."

He'd seen firsthand how protective William could be. If this VIP suffered even the slightest inconvenience at Flying Fish, his career would be over.
###Chapter 272

At 6:15 PM, Emily Smith removed her headphones and rubbed her stiff neck.

The hallway outside the recording studio was dimly lit. She pulled out her phone, the screen displaying six missed calls—four from the same landline number, and two from her friend Ethan He, a producer at Flying Fish Productions.

As her finger hovered over the screen, the landline number flashed again.

"Hello, this is Flying Fish Animation," a professionally cheerful voice greeted her. "Congratulations, Miss Smith. You've been selected to voice the second lead role in Rolly's Wonderful Journey."

Emily tightened her grip on the phone, her knuckles turning white. "You mean... the fox?"

"Yes. Can you come in tomorrow at 10 AM to sign the contract?"

By the time she hung up, her palm was damp with sweat. Ethan leaned against the wall nearby, forcing a smile.

"Congratulations," he said, his voice strained. "I knew you could do it."

Emily noticed the dark circles under his eyes. "What about your audition—"

"Rejected." He shrugged. "They found a better fit for Rolly."

Of course, he wouldn't mention that the decision had been personally vetoed by William Johnson. That man scowled if Ethan even got within three meters of Emily.

As the elevator descended, Emily flipped through the script. Through the rearview mirror, her driver James saw her curl up in the seat, her eyelids gradually drooping.

The black sedan glided silently into the underground garage of BestTech Tower.

On the 67th floor, in the executive office, William raised a hand, cutting off the finance director's report. "That's all for today."

The elevator numbers descended steadily. The garage lights cast a cold white glow as his polished shoes clicked against the concrete floor.

Michael Thompson stepped out of the employee elevator just in time to see William duck into a sedan. As the door closed, he caught a glimpse of a familiar profile.

"Emily... Smith?"

The car's interior was warm. Emily felt herself being lifted, the crisp scent of cedar enveloping her. Blinking groggily, her gaze landed on William's throat, mere inches from her face.

"Awake?" His amused voice came from above.

Before she could respond, his lips met hers. By the time Emily fully registered what was happening, her fingers were already clutching the front of his shirt.
###Chapter 273

Neon lights flickered across Emily Smith's face through the car window.

William Johnson's fingertips traced her collarbone, sending shivers down her spine. She instinctively grabbed his wandering hand, only for him to intertwine their fingers.

"Stop it," she whispered, glancing toward the front seat where James sat.

The privacy partition slid down silently, enclosing them in an intimate space.

William's breath scorched her neck. "I missed you."

Those three words made her heart skip. She bit her lower lip as his burning lips trailed across her skin.

"Ouch..." she whimpered.

He paused, lifting his head to reveal smoldering desire in his eyes. A low chuckle escaped him. "Then let's try somewhere else."

His fingers tilted her chin up as he kissed her fiercely. Emily melted into the sudden passion, her fingers clutching his shirt.

"Seems like..." William pulled back slightly, his gaze dropping to her chest. "They've gotten bigger?"

"Stop talking nonsense!" She smacked his arm in embarrassment.

Inside the private dining room, William peeled shrimp with meticulous care. Translucent morsels piled up in her bowl.

"Eat more." He wiped his fingers. "You're too thin."

Emily chewed slowly when loud voices erupted outside.

"William!" David Brown swaggered in with his entourage, eyes raking over Emily. "And who's this..."

The air turned glacial.

William rose slowly, shielding Emily behind him. "Get out."

That single phrase drained David's face of color. Remembering his last encounter with the police, he retreated hastily.

On the drive back, Emily stared blankly at passing scenery.

"Penny for your thoughts?" William twirled a lock of her hair.

She shook her head, but he cupped her chin. "Keeping secrets from me now?"

The hospital corridor reeked of antiseptic. Emily massaged her sister's arm while recounting recent events in a soft voice.

Leaning against the doorframe, William's eyes narrowed—he distinctly saw the girl's fingers twitch.

"Emily." He spoke abruptly on their way out. "What are your plans after Annie wakes up?"

She looked up from her phone. The screen's glow illuminated the fleeting uncertainty in her eyes.
###Chapter 274

Emily Smith looked up, meeting William Johnson's deep gaze.

She hadn't considered the living arrangements for her sister's recovery.

Their grandmother used to take care of her.

Now that she was gone, the responsibility fell on Emily.

She had originally planned to pursue graduate studies.

Jinzhou University was a good choice.

But she longed to explore the world beyond.

"She needs round-the-clock care," she murmured.

William set down the documents and took her hand.

"We can hire professional caregivers," he said, stroking her fingertips.

Emily nodded.

Money could solve most problems.

With her current income, hiring two specialists wouldn't be an issue.

The only problem was housing.

Years ago, their grandmother sold their home to pay for her sister's special education.

They had been renting ever since.

"After she's discharged, she can stay at the Lakeside Villa," William suddenly suggested.

Emily's head snapped up.

"The environment there is ideal for recovery," he added.

Live with him?

Her eyes widened.

"As for your father," William continued, "I can arrange for his early release."

Emily's breath hitched.

Her father still had seven years left on his sentence.

If William could help...

"Then you can pursue your dreams," he said, squeezing her hand.

Her eyes grew warm.

"Don't be so good to me," she whispered, lowering her head.

William lifted her chin.

"Why not?" he asked, leaning closer.

"I might grow dependent," she turned away.

"Are you still thinking of leaving me?" His grip tightened as he turned her face back.

Emily fell silent.

"Everything I have is yours," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

Her heartbeat quickened.

"I'll go with you next time you visit him," he said abruptly.

"No need," she instinctively refused.

"Are you ashamed of me?" His eyes narrowed.

"It's too sudden," she explained softly.

"Your father will accept me," he said, tilting her chin. "After that, I'll arrange for his sentence reduction."

"Really?" She still couldn't believe it.

"You doubt me?" He raised a brow.

"I don't want to burden you," she admitted.

William smiled.

"Leave it to me," he said before capturing her lips in a kiss.
###Chapter 275

William Johnson stepped into the Jinzhou Bay apartment just as his phone rang. He gestured to Emily Smith before heading straight to the living room to handle business. Understanding his signal, Emily tiptoed into the master bedroom.

The spacious apartment became two separate worlds. Low English murmurs drifted from the living room while only the soft rustle of turning pages could be heard in the bedroom.

The video conference lasted until late at night. When William finally closed his laptop, his watch showed nearly midnight. Rubbing his throbbing temples, he eased open the bedroom door with deliberate quietness.

The warm glow of the bedside lamp created an island of light around the desk. Emily slept with her head pillowed on one arm, strands of hair spilling across the open calculus textbook. The scratch paper was covered with dense equations like marching ants, the final problem repeatedly erased and rewritten but never reaching a satisfactory solution.

William's eyes softened. He picked up the fountain pen and wrote the solution with fluid strokes. Before the ink could dry, he bent down and scooped her into his arms.

"Finished your meeting?" Emily nuzzled against his chest, her voice sweet and drowsy like cotton candy. Her half-opened almond eyes reflected the lamplight like starry lakes.

That unconscious movement ignited something. William's Adam's apple bobbed as he laid her on the bed, his fingers already undoing the first button. "Mm," his kiss landed behind her ear, "Were you waiting for me?"

Emily made a vague sound of agreement but jolted awake when her pajama slipped off one shoulder. "William..." She caught his wandering hand, her voice trembling, "I'm sleepy..."

"Sleep then." He nipped at her collarbone, his palm branding her waist, "I'll do my thing."

Her protests shattered into fragments. When Emily arched her back, she heard his breathless chuckle: "My little Emily clearly wants this too." Blushing furiously, she tried to cover his mouth but found herself flipped over instead.

Steam filled the bathroom in the early hours. As William towel-dried her hair, Emily suddenly hooked her finger with his. "Next time..." she murmured sleepily, barely coherent, "Finish solving the problem first..."

Morning light filtered through the sheer curtains to an empty bed. Rubbing her eyes, Emily sat up just as William walked in. His workout shirt clung to his heaving chest, sweat rolling down his chiseled jawline.

"Gym?" She instinctively shrank back, but he caught her wrist and pulled her to the edge. The mingled scents of mint body wash and sweat enveloped her as he delivered a punishing kiss. "Now who's complaining?" he teased when they finally broke apart.

Emily punched his shoulder. "How are you so energetic after staying up late?"

"Because..." William suddenly hoisted her over his shoulder and strode toward the bathroom, "Someone didn't let me exert myself last night." The mirror reflected her instantly flushed face and his triumphant grin.
###Chapter 276

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the dining room. Emily Smith sipped her coffee quietly while William Johnson flipped through the morning paper across from her.

"I'm heading to work." William set down the newspaper and pressed a kiss to her forehead.

Emily nodded, watching him leave before rising to head to Flying Fish Productions for a voice-acting contract negotiation.

The elevator lobby of Flying Fish Tower buzzed with activity. Just as Emily pressed the button, the elevator doors dinged open.

A slender woman in sunglasses stepped out, trailed by an assistant carrying her bag. The woman moved briskly, nearly colliding with Emily.

Emily sidestepped and only then recognized her—Mia Harris, the once-glamorous A-list actress who hadn't been seen in public for ages.

Mia was shockingly thin now. Her loose blouse barely concealed her protruding shoulder blades, and even the sunglasses couldn't hide her haggard face.

She brushed past Emily but suddenly thrust out a hand to stop the elevator doors from closing.

"You're... Lucy?" Mia removed her sunglasses, her face lighting up with recognition.

Emily gave a slight nod. "I'm Emily Smith."

"Perfect!" Mia grabbed her hand excitedly. "What a coincidence! Could I treat you to coffee?"

Emily subtly withdrew her hand. "I'm sorry, I have an appointment today."

"That's fine, I can wait." Mia leaned in urgently. "Lucy, I heard William is acquiring Flying Fish?"

Emily's heart skipped a beat. An acquisition? Since when?

Mia lowered her voice. "Could you put in a good word for me with Mr. Johnson? Ask him to sign me?" She added conspiratorially, "I know he likes your type."

Emily frowned slightly.

"Don't misunderstand!" Mia hurried to explain. "Back in W City, William only spent time with me because his older brother asked him to. Nothing ever happened between us."

The elevator reached its destination. Emily offered a polite smile. "Miss Harris, I'm not close with Mr. Johnson. You should contact him directly."

As she stepped out, a Flying Fish staff member greeted her warmly and led her to a meeting room, serving her tea.

Once the door closed, Emily immediately dialed William's number.

In the BestTech Group conference room, the presenting executive paused mid-sentence. Everyone watched as William picked up his phone, his lips curving into an uncharacteristically tender smile.

"Sweetheart," he murmured, stepping toward the window, his voice impossibly soft.

Executives exchanged glances, wondering who was on the other end.

"Are you busy?" Emily asked.

"Not at all." William gazed out at the cityscape. "Missing me?"

A chorus of coughs erupted around the conference table.
###Chapter 277

"Not busy." William's lips curved slightly, his voice deep and tender. "Miss me?"

"Flying Fish approached me for their new film. Was that your doing?" Emily got straight to the point.

A soft chuckle came through the line. "Emily, when did you start underestimating yourself?"

"Then why did you acquire Flying Fish?"

"For you." His answer was crisp and clear.

Her fingers trembled slightly around the phone. His magnetic voice, like a feather brushing against her heart, made her breath hitch.

"Flying Fish chose you because you're exceptional. I bought it simply to ensure you'd never face injustice." Hearing her silence, he added, "You don’t need to worry."

"I don’t need it." She took a deep breath. "The respect I want, I’ll earn with my own ability."

"Emily—"

"Don’t make me feel like I owe you too much." She cut him off. "More than I could ever repay."

William laughed softly. "Alright, as you wish. I’ll reassess this investment."

She gave a quiet "Mm" before saying, "I’m hanging up."

The dial tone echoed sharply in the conference room. William pocketed his phone and turned to find every executive staring at him in stunned silence.

"Did I interrupt the meeting?" He raised a brow.

"No, not at all!" They waved their hands hastily.

William returned to his seat. "I’ll be more mindful next time."

The executives exchanged glances, not daring to breathe too loudly.

The contract signing with Flying Fish went smoothly.

Except the offered rate was nearly half the market standard. Emily skimmed the terms, her fingers lightly tracing the paper.

"Standard rate for newcomers," the staff explained. "Once you have a portfolio, negotiations will be easier."

She signed without hesitation. Right now, opportunity mattered more than money.

As she stepped out of the building, hurried footsteps sounded behind her.

"Miss Smith, wait!" The contract supervisor rushed out, beads of sweat on his forehead. "We’ve reconsidered. Could we redo the contract?"

Emily frowned. "What do you mean?"

"The compensation... We’d like to adjust it to the standard for top-tier voice actors." He offered an apologetic smile. "What do you think?"

Studying his nervous expression, realization dawned on her.

"No need." She tucked the contract into her bag. "The original terms are fine."

Turning away, she pulled out her phone, her thumb hovering over William’s number. In the end, she didn’t dial.

The setting sun stretched her shadow long behind her.
###Chapter 278

When Emily Smith signed the new contract with Flying Fish, the old one was shredded into pieces right before her eyes. She watched the confetti-like scraps flutter through the air, a faint smile playing on her lips.

There was no need to guess why Flying Fish had changed their stance so abruptly—it had to be William Johnson's doing. She unlocked her phone, her finger hovering over his contact for a moment before she locked the screen again.

She'd ask him when he got back.

At 6:15 in the evening, her phone buzzed. William's deep voice came through the receiver: "I have a business dinner tonight. Want to come with me?"

"No." Emily was putting yogurt into the fridge. "Remember to eat something before you drink."

A low chuckle sounded from the other end. "So concerned about me? Why not supervise in person?"

"Let Mr. Zhang keep an eye on you." She deliberately hardened her tone. "I'm hanging up."

"Em—" William suddenly softened his voice, sounding like an abandoned puppy. "You don't even care about me."

Her fingers stilled.

"I'll make you a midnight snack when you get back," she heard herself relent.

"What will you make?" he pressed.

"Whatever you want."

"You."

The call ended abruptly. Emily stared at the darkened screen, her ears burning.

Mia Harris was waiting for her at the Japanese restaurant. The moment they met, Mia pinched her chin and examined her face. "What kind of love potion did William give you? You're glowing—"

"Look who's talking." Emily swatted her hand away.

Mia leaned in, whispering, "Seriously, what's it like sleeping with William?"

Emily nearly choked on her wasabi.

When she returned to Jinzhou Bay, the apartment was empty. She opened the fridge to find it bare. She dialed the housekeeper. "Ms. Song, could you send up some groceries?"

Ten minutes later, Song Yan stood at the door with two large bags of fresh ingredients, her demeanor unusually deferential. "Would you like me to put them away for you?"

"No need." Emily took the bags, noting the woman's curious gaze.

Just as she finished organizing the groceries, a commotion sounded at the entrance. She turned to see Sam Wilson and Zhang Xiao'an supporting a tipsy William inside—Sam was holding a giant pink teddy bear, while Zhang carried a massive bouquet of red roses. The scene looked like something out of a wedding.

"He's drunk—"

"Em!"

William suddenly broke free from their hold, snatched the teddy bear, and lunged at her. Emily had no time to dodge before she was knocked backward.

But the expected pain never came.

She sank into a sea of soft fur as rose petals rained down around her. William's warm breath brushed against her neck as he murmured, "Got you."
###Chapter 279

Her heart skipped a beat as she stumbled backward.

The expected pain never came. Instead, she landed on something soft.

Turning her head, she saw a giant teddy bear had been placed behind her.

Sam Wilson and David Zhang paled, rushing forward too late to help.

William Johnson was already pinning Emily Smith beneath him, nuzzling into her neck. The two men exchanged awkward glances before turning away.

"Miss Smith, the roses from Mr. Johnson are here. Please rest well." David hastily placed the bouquet down and dragged Sam out, closing the door behind them.

"William!" Emily gasped for air, shoving at his chest. "Get off me!"

"Emily," he murmured, unmoving. "Do you like the bear and flowers I bought you?"

"Yes, yes!" She answered distractedly, still struggling.

William suddenly lifted his head, cradling her face. His dazed eyes burned intensely. "Do you prefer the gifts... or me?"

"You, obviously." The answer came without thought.

He grinned like a child begging for candy. "Why?"

Emily nearly rolled her eyes.

Was this really the ruthless business tycoon she knew?

"Because you give me presents."

"What if I didn't?" He pressed. "Would you still like me?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because you're handsome, have a great body, and you're really good at..." She froze, feeling something hard press against her thigh.

A memory flashed—William once said truly drunk men couldn't get erect.

"William," she sneered. "Having fun pretending to be drunk?"

The man above her stilled.

When he looked up again, his eyes were terrifyingly clear, without a trace of intoxication.

"Emily," he chuckled darkly. "You promised to take care of me." His lips captured hers before she could respond.

......

Later, wrapped in a bathrobe, Emily asked, "Hungry?"

"Starving." William stretched lazily, thoroughly satisfied.

In the kitchen, Emily prepared oysters. Plump and juicy this season, they were perfect for garlic roasting.

She expertly mixed the sauce as the oven dinged.

William entered after a phone call, watching her sprinkle scallions over the oysters. The sizzle of hot oil released an aromatic cloud.

"Trying to replenish my energy?" He embraced her from behind, whispering in her ear. "Was my performance unsatisfactory earlier?"

Emily's hand jerked, nearly spilling the oil.
###Chapter 280

Legend has it that oysters are highly nourishing, especially these seasonal wild ones—plump, succulent, and presumably even more potent.

"Have them all. Let's see how effective they are," Emily said with a soft chuckle, pressing her lips together.

William leaned in and kissed her cheek. "Good things should always be shared with my Emily."

He pulled out his phone, snapped a quick photo of the plate of oysters, and sent it to the group chat titled "Share the Joy, Leave the Drama." The group only had four members: William, George Taylor, Ethan Zheng, and James Wilson.

The moment the photo was sent, the chat exploded with messages.

William, however, exited the group without another word and tossed his phone aside, focusing entirely on the "kidney-nourishing feast" Emily had prepared for him.

The simplest cooking method had yielded the most exquisite flavor. The grilled oysters were tender and buttery, melting in his mouth.

William took one bite and immediately gave a thumbs-up. "Your cooking keeps getting better, Emily."

He picked up a second oyster, blew on it to cool it down, ate half, and held the remaining half to Emily's lips. "Try it. It's incredibly fresh."

Emily wasn't hungry, but she couldn't resist the temptation and parted her lips. The rich, savory taste bloomed on her tongue.

And so, bite by bite, the two of them polished off the entire plate of oysters, along with a large bottle of soda.

"I'm stuffed," Emily murmured, rubbing her slightly rounded belly.

William pulled her onto his lap, his warm hand gently massaging her stomach as he kissed her chin. "Need some exercise to help digest?"

Emily wrapped her arms around his neck, burying her face in the crook of his shoulder as she shook her head repeatedly.

"Don't want to test the effects?" His low, husky voice brushed against her ear. "I feel even more energized than before."

Emily's face flushed crimson.

"Tomorrow," she said, feigning escape. "I still have work to do."

William's long arm snaked around her waist, pulling her back against him. He caught her wrist and guided her hand beneath his robe.

"Emily," he murmured against her neck, inhaling her scent. "Feel that?"

Beneath the robe, there was nothing. Emily's fingers trembled, a tingling sensation spreading through her body.

"William..." Her voice quivered.

"Hmm?" He gripped her waist and lifted her onto the dining table, leaning down to capture her lips. "Want to test the effects now?"

Emily shuddered, managing only a faint "Mmm" in response.

......

In the early hours of the morning, Emily drifted in and out of sleep but still managed to ask, "Did you arrange for Flying Fish to suddenly amend the contract?"

William, thoroughly satisfied, held her close, his fingers tracing the nape of her neck. "Zhang Xiao'an happened to mention you during the signing call."

"Mmm." Eyes still closed, she murmured, "Are you still acquiring Flying Fish?"

"Of course." His tone was firm. "The web series and short drama market has huge potential. We need to seize the opportunity."

Emily gave a soft hum before sinking back into sleep.

......

While brushing their teeth the next morning, William wrapped his arms around Emily from behind, an electric toothbrush in one hand as he stared at their reflection in the mirror, his grin impossible to hide.

Emily met his gaze in the mirror, equal parts flustered and annoyed, and nudged him with her hip. "Go brush on your side."

Their spacious bathroom had dual sinks.

"Tsk—" William turned off his toothbrush. "Keep moving like that, and we'll have a problem."

Emily: "..."

"Emily," he nuzzled her ear, his voice low and coaxing. "Those oysters yesterday were amazing. Bring me lunch at the office today, okay?"

Emily finished brushing and shot him a look. "BestTech's cafeteria is perfectly fine."

"Nothing compares to your cooking." He leaned in, toothpaste foam still in his mouth, trying to kiss her.

Emily barely dodged in time.

"Then hire a chef who suits your taste," she said helplessly.
###Chapter 281

"Then find a chef who suits your taste." She pressed her lips together in a faint smile.

William Johnson gazed at Emily Smith's reflection in the mirror, her hands covered in foam. His eyes crinkled with amusement. "Hiring someone now would mean missing lunch."

"Do you only enjoy meals when I deliver them?" She arched a brow.

He nuzzled against her neck. "You spoil me the most, Emily."

She sighed in resignation.

"Fine, I'll bring it later." She calculated the time. "Can you wait?"

"For you? As long as it takes." His grin was boyish, like a child who'd just gotten candy.

At 8:45 AM, William finally left.

The moment the door closed, Emily exhaled deeply. She opened her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard. Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting scattered specks of light on the desk.

By 12:30 PM, she shut the laptop. Soon, the clatter of pots and pans echoed from the kitchen.

Cooking came effortlessly when she was in high spirits. Sliced beef with green peppers sizzled in the wok, while glazed shrimp shimmered temptingly. A final ladle of egg drop soup filled the kitchen with its rich aroma.

As she packed the meal into an insulated container, her lips curved upward. Who knew delivering food to someone could feel this unexpectedly satisfying?

1:30 PM. A silver Lexus glided into BestTech's underground garage. Emily scanned the area, ensuring no familiar faces were around before grabbing the food container and heading to the elevator.

Ding—

The elevator doors opened to reveal the entire secretarial staff looking up in unison. Grace Lee's expression darkened as she hurried forward.

"Emily?" Her gaze dropped to the pink insulated box.

"Is he in?" Emily smiled.

The sharp click of heels against marble suddenly rang out. Olivia Davis strode from the direction of the CEO's office, her red dress flaring like flames.

"Still trying to win favors after quitting?" Olivia's eyes locked onto the food container, her hand already reaching to snatch it.

Emily sidestepped. "Miss Davis, mind your manners."

"You dare talk back to me?" Olivia's eyes blazed, her nails digging into her palms.

Grace opened her mouth to intervene but was cut off by a sharp command.

"Hand it over!" Olivia advanced again.

Emily met her gaze evenly. "This is my personal property."

She turned to leave but was yanked back violently. Olivia raised her hand—the container teetered, about to spill—

"Olivia!"

William's voice sliced through the air like ice. He strode down the hallway, the hem of his suit jacket flaring with each step.

Olivia smirked, tightening her grip. The lid of the container popped open slightly, splashing hot broth onto Emily's hand. A red welt bloomed instantly.
###Chapter 282

Slap!

Olivia Davis's palm sliced through the air with a sharp whistle.

But it was intercepted mid-swing by a large, well-defined hand.

William Johnson's grip was ironclad. A red mark bloomed instantly around Olivia's wrist.

"Ah—!" She shrieked in pain.

Emily Smith watched Olivia's contorted expression and frowned slightly.

This had just escalated into full-blown enmity.

"William!" Olivia cried, her voice trembling. "You're hurting me!"

His gaze was glacial. "Let go."

Olivia's eyes widened in disbelief. "You want me to let go first?"

Her nails dug into Emily's arm, nearly breaking skin.

Emily remained calm, allowing herself to be held.

"What is she to you?" Olivia sneered. "I, Olivia Davis, can bully whoever I want!"

The air around William turned frigid. "Touch what's mine, and I'll return it tenfold."

"Yours?" Olivia's voice pitched higher.

Emily froze.

"William Johnson!" Olivia's eyes reddened. "Say that again!"

"Emily Smith is my girlfriend." His words were deliberate. "Lay a finger on her again, and I won't hold back."

Olivia shoved Emily away violently.

Emily staggered backward but was caught firmly by William.

"Are you okay?" he murmured.

She shook her head.

"You bitch!" Olivia screeched, lunging forward.

William raised a hand and pushed.

Thud!

Olivia landed hard on the floor.

Grace Lee and the others held their breaths, not daring to make a sound.

"William Johnson!" Olivia pointed at them, her voice shaking. "For this slut—"

"Enough." His voice cut like ice. "Grace."

"Y-yes!" Grace jolted to attention.

"Escort her out." William wrapped an arm around Emily and turned away. "She's banned from BestTech permanently."

The office door clicked shut, muffling Olivia's wails.

"I'm sorry." William gently brushed Emily's shoulder. "I didn't expect her to show up."

Emily shook her head. "It was bound to happen."

She hesitated. "Miss Davis seems to..."

"Jealous?" He chuckled.

Emily rolled her eyes. "I meant, wasn't that too harsh?"

"Too late now." He pinched her cheek playfully. "How about you think of ways to make it up to me?"
###Chapter 283

William chuckled softly, a hint of helplessness flashing in his eyes. "It's already done. What now?"

Emily's gaze drifted to the dining table in the nearby lounge area. Exquisite meal boxes were neatly arranged, filled with an array of delicacies.

"Have you eaten?" she asked quietly.

William followed her line of sight. "Olivia brought those. I didn't touch them."

Olivia had lingered in his office for over an hour, pouting and pleading, but William hadn't taken a single bite.

His reason was simple—he wasn't hungry.

After finally sending her away, she had run into Emily.

They had grown up together. Olivia had always protected him, and he treated her like a younger sister.

If she hadn't insulted Emily, he wouldn't have turned on her.

For Emily, he was willing to defy not just Olivia, but the entire Davis family.

Emily studied the untouched feast.

"Eat what I brought," she said simply, carrying her insulated lunchbox to the conference area.

William took it and pulled her close as they sat down together.

A simple meal of three dishes and soup, yet it made William's mouth water.

"Take your time. I should go," Emily said, handing him chopsticks as she started to rise.

William caught her wrist. "Stay until I finish."

The pleading look in his eyes softened her resolve, and she sat back down.

He picked up a slice of beef and held it to her lips. "Try it?"

"I already ate," she declined.

"Next time, we'll eat together," he suggested.

Emily pressed her lips together in a faint smile but didn't respond.

Noticing her subdued mood, William ate quietly.

When it was time to leave, he insisted on walking her downstairs.

In the elevator, his arm tightened around her waist. "Worried about Olivia?"

Emily nodded. "And Lily."

Lily was defenseless in the hospital. If Olivia wanted to harm her...

"I'll assign someone to protect her," William murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

The promise eased some of Emily's tension.

After seeing her off, William immediately pulled up the surveillance footage from the secretary's office and sent it to Vincent Davis.

The young head of the Davis family called soon after.

"Did Olivia bother you again?" Vincent's tone was polite and composed.

"As long as she treats the person I care about with respect, I'll still consider her a sister," William said by the window, his voice sincere.

A light laugh came through the phone. "You must really care about this girl."

"I do. Very much," he answered without hesitation.

"I see," Vincent replied smoothly. "I'll keep Olivia in check."

"Thank you."

"The apology should be mine," Vincent shifted gears. "I hope you'll tolerate her for my sake."

William's brow furrowed slightly. "That depends on what she does."

Vincent chuckled and steered the conversation toward business matters.
###Chapter 284

As dusk settled over the city, Emily Smith had just stepped out of the BestTech Group building when her phone lit up with a call from William Johnson.

"The meeting will run until eight," his deep voice came through the receiver. "Go to the hospital and stay with your sister first."

"I'll wait for you at BestTech," she tapped her fingers lightly against the steering wheel. "It's on the way."

A soft chuckle sounded from the other end. "Text me when you arrive."

The silver-gray Bentley came to a stop in front of the hospital entrance just as Emily removed her earbuds. The window reflected the tall silhouette of a man, and when she instinctively glanced up, she met his amused gaze.

Caught staring, she quickly masked her embarrassment with a polite smile. The man responded with an even warmer expression, forcing her to nod in acknowledgment once more.

Inside the elevator, the sharp crack of a lollipop breaking echoed loudly. Amidst a little boy's tantrum, Emily subtly shifted half a step to the side. George Taylor's assistant stood in the corner with a bouquet, his eyes darting between his boss and the striking young woman.

"Mommy, fix it!" The boy suddenly flailed his arms and bumped into Emily.

Stumbling forward, she nearly fell—until a firm grip steadied her. She looked up in surprise, meeting George's smiling eyes behind his glasses.

"Thank you," she murmured, quickly releasing the grip she had on his suit sleeve.

As he withdrew his arm, the cufflink glinted subtly in her vision. "Be careful," he said with a slight nod before turning away, the hem of his coat sweeping gracefully behind him.

Emily remained rooted in place until his tall figure disappeared around the corridor. The sterile scent of disinfectant lingered in the air, but her thoughts drifted back to the faint trace of a ring mark she had glimpsed on his left hand.
###Chapter 285

The underground parking garage was dimly lit. Emily Smith stared blankly at the concrete pillars flashing past the car window. William Johnson's face lingered in her mind, but she couldn't recall where she'd seen him before.

As the car turned the final corner, a familiar white sedan approached from the opposite direction. Michael Thompson's car.

Emily instinctively shrank back into her seat. Even though she knew he couldn't see her, her heart skipped a beat. She remembered how William had shielded her in front of everyone earlier, declaring her as his "girlfriend" with unwavering certainty.

"It'll spread eventually..." she murmured to herself, her fingers tapping lightly on her phone screen. Maybe next time she came to the office, she should bring some pastries for her former colleagues.

Once the car parked, she sent William a message: I'm here.

In the conference room, William's phone screen lit up. A glance at it made the corners of his lips lift unconsciously. The executive giving the presentation noticed and brightened his tone.

"Let's take a five-minute break," William announced, standing up and leaving a room full of bewildered executives.

This was the third time this week. Ever since he'd gotten a new girlfriend, Mr. Johnson had changed completely. His usual stern expression during meetings was now frequently softened by smiles. Even when projects went wrong, he handled them with calm composure.

The elevator ride to the garage took less than two minutes. William yanked open the car door, immediately pulling Emily into a fierce kiss. It was urgent and rough, as if making up for what they'd missed at lunch.

"How's Mia today?" he finally asked, releasing her and brushing his thumb over her slightly swollen lips.

Emily caught her breath. "Much better than yesterday."

"Good." He wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "What do you want for dinner?"

"Let's eat at home."

William suddenly remembered something. "Are you free Friday night? A new hot spring resort just opened in Jiuting. They invited us for a soft opening." Seeing her hesitation, he added, "Mia Harris is going too."

Emily's eyes lit up. "Then I'll need to ask for leave from Feiyue."

"Why bother asking?" William pinched her nose. "The boss is right in front of you."

By the time they returned to Jinzhou Bay, it was already dark. Emily had expected to order takeout, but instead, she watched as William rolled up his sleeves and headed to the kitchen.

"You're cooking?" Her eyes widened in surprise.

William pulled her into his arms, resting his chin on the top of her head. "You cooked lunch. My turn for dinner. Fair exchange."

Laughing, Emily slipped away and retreated to her room to look something up. Half an hour later, the aroma of food wafted through the air. She tiptoed to the kitchen doorway and saw William intently searing a steak.

His white shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing his well-defined forearms. The sizzling sound from the pan filled the kitchen, the scent of butter and rosemary mingling in the air. His profile looked especially striking under the light, even the shadow cast by his lashes was perfect.

Emily leaned against the doorframe, lost in thought. How could Amanda Lin have ever let go of a man like this?
###Chapter 286

The sizzling steak released an enticing aroma. William Johnson's slender fingers held a spoon as he drizzled melted butter evenly over the surface.

Emily Smith was drawn by the fragrance and tiptoed toward the kitchen.

Just as she was about to wrap her arms around his waist from behind, William turned sharply and pulled her into his embrace.

"Hungry?" He lowered his head and pressed a kiss to her forehead.

"The smell alone made me hungry." Emily tilted her face up, her eyes brimming with laughter.

"Go get the plates." He released her.

As Emily turned to fetch the utensils, William had already plated the pasta, drizzling it with the pre-made tomato beef sauce and sprinkling fresh green thyme over it.

The dining table was set with two steaks, pasta, and a colorful salad. Simple Western dishes became exquisite under his hands.

William uncorked a bottle of Lafite, the deep red wine swirling in the glass.

He carefully cut the steak on his own plate and exchanged it with Emily's.

Watching his thoughtful gesture, Emily suddenly thought of Amanda Lin. How could such a perfect man ever let her go?

The thought made the smile on her lips fade.

"What's wrong?" William immediately noticed the shift in her mood.

Emily forced a smile. "I didn't know you were such a good cook."

He took her hand, his gaze intense. "You can tell me if something's bothering you."

Emily took a sip of the wine. "I just feel sorry for Amanda..."

"Jealous?" William chuckled.

She didn’t answer, instead spearing a piece of salad with her fork.

"My relationship with Amanda isn’t what you think," William said, swirling his glass.

Emily looked up in surprise. "What do you mean?"

"You thought I loved her?" he countered.

"That’s what everyone says."

"No." William shook his head. "Pursuing her had another purpose. Marriage wasn’t my choice either."

Emily’s eyes widened. "Someone forced you?"

"Call it voluntary, but it wasn’t out of affection." He fed her a piece of steak. "At most, there was a brief attraction."

The answer only deepened Emily’s confusion.

"Want to know the truth?" William raised his glass.

Without hesitation, she drank.

"In a few days, I’ll take you to Switzerland to meet my uncle," he said, gazing at her. "Then you’ll understand."

At the mention of Henry Johnson, William’s eyes darkened.

"Chairman Shen, he..." Emily asked cautiously.

"His condition isn’t optimistic," he replied tersely.

Emily tactfully didn’t press further. Unnoticed, half the bottle of wine had been emptied. Her cheeks flushed pink, her gaze growing hazy.

William watched her slightly intoxicated state, a shadow of deeper meaning flickering in his eyes.
###Chapter 287

William had always been a man of restraint.

He rarely got drunk. In his memory, there were only two exceptions. Once at seventeen, when he ended up in a bloody brawl with street thugs. The other time was recently, drowning his sorrows over Emily.

"Sweetheart, one more sip." William swirled the wine glass, his gaze lingering on her flushed cheeks.

Emily was already dazed, shaking her head weakly. "No more... I think I'm drunk..."

He pulled her onto his lap, fingertips tracing her burning earlobe. "Then let me feed you?"

She draped herself over him like a lazy cat. "No... I want to sleep..."

William chuckled, tilting his head back to take a sip before capturing her lips in a deep kiss.

That kiss was the spark that ignited everything.

Drunk Emily was impossibly pliant, melting into him until he was utterly lost.

When morning light filtered through the curtains, Emily could barely lift a finger. Despite the haze of alcohol, fragments of their reckless night played vividly in her mind.

She opened her eyes, cheeks burning again.

"Awake?" William had been up for a while but refused to let her go.

Emily glared at him. "You did that on purpose last night."

He kissed her, grinning. "Drunk you was irresistible."

"..." She held up three fingers.

William caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "Hmm?"

"Punishment." She kept a straight face. "No touching for the next three nights."

"That long?" He frowned.

"Or make it a week?"

He surrendered instantly. "Three nights it is." Then he leaned in, whispering against her ear, "But... you can touch me. I won't resist..."

Emily: "..."

This man was hopeless.

———

After her afternoon recording session, William's car was already waiting downstairs.

They headed straight to Phoenix Mountain in Tongcheng, where George's newly developed hot spring resort hadn't officially opened yet. This was a private invitation.

By the time they arrived, it was nearly nine. Mia was lounging bored in the lobby and pounced on Emily the moment she saw her.

"I was about to leave," Mia complained. "Those two girls are practically conjoined twins."

Emily blinked. "I'll sleep with you tonight."

"Huh?" Mia glanced warily at William. "Why?"

Before Emily could answer, the others approached. Ethan was with Rachel, while Ryan had Vivian in tow—all unfamiliar faces.

The courtyard was alive with the crackle of charcoal, skewered meats sizzling on the grill. Emily sat between William and Mia, completely oblivious to Rachel secretly aiming her phone at them.

An hour later, Rachel abruptly excused herself. Not long after, William also stood and walked away.
###Chapter 288

Xu Ran excused herself to the restroom but slipped into the villa's living room instead.

She curled up on the leather sofa, animatedly video-calling Olivia Davis. "Liv, you wouldn't believe it. That Emily Smith is shameless beyond words. Dressed like some streetwalker, throwing herself at Vice President Johnson—"

A tall figure suddenly reflected on her phone screen.

Xu Ran jerked her head up. Her hand trembled when she met William Johnson's icy gaze, and her phone clattered onto the sofa.

"V-Vice President Johnson..." She scrambled to her feet, face pale.

William picked up the phone leisurely, glancing at the ongoing call. A dangerous smirk curled his lips. "Go on."

Xu Ran fumbled to end the call, voice shaking. "Miss Davis made me—"

"Good footage." He tossed the phone back to her. "Make sure to capture more intimate shots of Emily and me."

As he walked away, Xu Ran's legs gave out. She collapsed onto the floor, her back drenched in cold sweat.

Late at night, Emily tiptoed into Mia Harris's room, hugging a pillow. The click of the lock echoed sharply.

William rubbed his temples, listening to the laughter next door.

The blue glow of his laptop illuminated his face as the video conference dragged on until 2 AM. When he finally shut it off, he glanced at the untouched door and sighed.

The bedside clock read 3 AM. William still lay awake.

Then—a faint twist of the doorknob.

He shut his eyes instantly, lips quirking. This little minx couldn't resist after all.

A shadowy figure crept in.

The intruder confirmed William was alone under the dim phone light, breathing growing ragged.

The rustle of clothes being shed pierced the silence.

Just as cold skin was about to touch the sheets—William's eyes flew open. His leg shot out in a swift sweep.

"Ah—!"

A heavy thud. A woman's terrified shriek.

The bedside lamp flicked on, illuminating Xu Ran's naked, trembling form on the floor.
###Chapter 289

The bedside lamp clicked on with a sharp snap.

William Johnson bolted upright, his piercing gaze sweeping toward the foot of the bed.

Olivia Davis!

How did she get in here?

A naked figure writhed in pain on the carpet, her bare skin glaring under the harsh light. William yanked the blanket off the bed and flung it over her without mercy.

"William..." Olivia gasped, clutching her stomach. "Take me to the hospital..."

His kick had landed squarely in her abdomen with brutal force. Tears streaked through her smudged makeup as she whimpered.

William shrugged on his robe, staring down at her with icy disdain. Before he could speak, the door burst open.

"William!"

Emily Smith rushed in, panic-stricken, with Mia Harris trailing behind in confusion.

Both women froze at the sight before them.

"Uh..." Mia forced a laugh. "I'll just... go back to bed. Call me if you need anything, babe!" She vanished in a flash.

"Emily." William strode forward and pulled her into his arms.

Emily's brow furrowed as she took in Olivia's disheveled state on the floor. "What happened?"

"Susan tipped her off." William shot Olivia a cold glance. "She snuck in while you were gone. I thought it was—"

"It hurts..." Olivia's moan cut him off, her face ghostly pale.

"Did you two..." Emily hesitated.

"I didn't touch her." William's voice was steel.

Emily nodded, then looked at Olivia's agonized form. "We should get her to the hospital."

She was the Davis family's prized daughter. No one could afford the consequences if something happened to her.

"Help her get dressed." William turned away. "I'll wait outside."

———

At 3 a.m., the emergency room blazed with sterile white light.

William watched indifferently as Olivia curled up in the backseat, making no move to assist. When Emily reached out, Olivia shoved her away violently.

"Leave her." William pulled Emily close. "I'll call for a stretcher."

Medical staff wheeled over a gurney, forcing Olivia to crawl out on her own. She trembled with pain but clung to the last shreds of her dignity.

The diagnosis was shocking—a ruptured liver with internal bleeding.

"Emergency surgery is required," the doctor adjusted his glasses.

William dialed James Wilson's number.

"Will the Davis family..." Emily fretted.

"Don't worry." William pressed a kiss to her hair. "They're reasonable people."

Emily gave a quiet hum.

"Emily." William cupped her face. "This isn't your fault."

His gaze burned with intensity. "Some people insist on digging their own graves. No one can stop them."

"I hope she learns her lesson." Emily managed a weak smile.

William held her tighter. Under the night sky, their shadows merged into one, as if nothing could ever pull them apart.
###Chapter 290

The arrival of Lucas Davis sent a jolt through Emily Smith's chest.

His face bore an uncanny resemblance to Olivia's, instantly revealing everything.

So this was the eldest son of the Davis family.

She suddenly recalled their chance encounter—his meaningful smile and unexpected assistance now made perfect sense.

"William, Miss Smith." Lucas approached swiftly, his brow furrowed with concern. "How's Olivia?"

William Johnson's expression remained icy. "Let the doctor explain."

The physician appeared promptly, detailing Olivia's injuries. At the words "liver rupture," Lucas's face darkened.

"She sneaked into my bed when Emily wasn't there," William said coldly. "Fortunately, I noticed in time."

Lucas drew a sharp breath. "My oversight."

"If it happens again—" William left the threat hanging but unmistakable.

Lucas nodded in silent acknowledgment.

Dawn was breaking when they finally returned to the mountain villa.

After a quick wash, William pulled Emily into his arms and drifted into sleep.

They woke well past noon.

Following lunch, William suggested hiking to Hongfa Temple.

"Let me grab my phone," Emily said, hurrying upstairs.

On the second floor, Grace Lee's shrill voice cut through the air. "How does she deserve such luck?"

"By being shameless," Emma Clark sneered. "Why else would Vice President Johnson dote on her?"

"No respectable family would accept a woman like her."

"Amanda Lin will come back for William eventually..."

Emily froze mid-step.

"Emily?" William's voice suddenly came from behind her.

She snapped back to reality. "Just a leg cramp."

The upstairs chatter died instantly.

Without a word, William swept her into his arms and carried her to the lounge.

"Which foot?" He knelt on one knee.

Emily smiled and stood. "It's fine now. I'll get my phone."

They set out under perfect sunshine.

The trail grew steep halfway up the mountain.

After four hundred steps, Emily's legs began trembling.

"I'll carry you," William offered.

She shook her head stubbornly.

Another hundred steps later, she collapsed onto the stone stairs, gasping.

"You go ahead. I'll wait here."
###Chapter 291

William Johnson wore sunglasses and a baseball cap pulled low over his forehead, dressed in casual attire.

He pushed his sunglasses down slightly, revealing his deep-set eyes with amusement dancing in them. "Do you want a piggyback ride or to be carried?"

Emily Smith glanced around at the bustling crowd of tourists and muttered under her breath, "Is there a third option?"

William adjusted his sunglasses and, without another word, scooped her up into his arms.

"Put me down!" Emily gasped, though her arms instinctively wrapped around his neck.

He pressed a quick kiss to her lips. "Carrying my girlfriend is perfectly natural."

Nearby, a couple witnessed the scene. The girl tugged at her boyfriend's sleeve. "Why can't you be like that?"

The boyfriend glanced at Emily's slender figure and scoffed, "Maybe if you weren't so heavy."

"What's that supposed to mean?" the girl snapped.

Nestled in William's arms, Emily watched the argument fade into the distance and sighed. "You caused trouble again."

She playfully nipped at his neck.

"Ow—" William feigned pain, then whispered in her ear, "Save it for tonight. I'm all yours."

Emily's ears burned red.

William carried her effortlessly through the crowd, drawing curious glances. Fortunately, their disguises worked—no one recognized them.

At the temple entrance atop the mountain, Emily wriggled free.

"Legs still weak?" William teased, leaning in.

Emily shot him a glare. "This is a sacred place. Behave."

He chuckled. "I didn't say anything. You're the one—"

She ignored him and strode toward the temple.

It was a weekend, and worshippers streamed in and out. After touring the main hall, William led her straight to the back courtyard.

"What are we doing here?" Emily asked.

"Meeting the abbot," William replied with a mysterious smile.

He had already made a generous donation. The abbot welcomed them warmly, serving tea before suggesting they draw fortune sticks.

Emily hesitated but thought of William's uncle and nodded.

They knelt devoutly before the Buddha—William praying for his uncle, Emily for her sister.

Yet both drew ominous fortunes.

The abbot sighed. "Fate is unchangeable."

Undeterred, William drew another stick—this time for love.

The inscription read:
"Peach and plum trees bloom in spring,
Yet storms come swift, their beauty fleeting."

His expression darkened as he quickly shoved the stick back into the holder.

Emily reached for it, but he pulled her into an embrace.
###Chapter 292

Emily Smith stood on tiptoe, trying to read the fortune slip in William Johnson's hand.

William abruptly shoved the paper back into the bamboo cylinder.

She opened her mouth to speak but swallowed her questions when she saw the sudden darkness in his expression.

The temple abbot glimpsed the fortune's content and was about to offer comfort when William coldly excused himself.

Their planned vegetarian meal was canceled.

On the mountain path, William's brow remained furrowed.

"William," Emily gently tugged his sleeve. "You already have so much. You can't expect Buddha to grant your every wish."

He suddenly laughed, pinching the tip of her nose. "Are you comforting me or trying to provoke me?"

"See? You're smiling." She stopped walking, gazing into his eyes. "That means it worked."

"Emily..." William abruptly pulled her into a tight embrace, his grip almost painful. His voice muffled against her hair: "You won't leave me, right?"

Her heart trembled. Without hesitation, she answered: "I'll always be here whenever you need me."

In this moment, William seemed like a child afraid of abandonment, making her chest ache. He buried his face in her neck, whispering: "If you dare run away, I'll chase you to the ends of the earth and drag you back."

Emily could only laugh helplessly.

"Hungry?" He suddenly released her, changing topics abruptly.

"A little." She admitted honestly. She hadn't eaten much at noon, and evening had already fallen.

William magically produced a green apple lollipop. "Something to tide you over."

"Where did you get this?" She accepted it in surprise.

"Mia gave it to me." He smiled, unwrapping the candy.

Emily popped the lollipop in her mouth and started walking, only to be swept up into his arms. "I can walk by myself," she protested.

"Save your energy," he murmured in her ear. "You'll need it tonight."

When they returned to the villa, everyone had been waiting for some time. Emily noticed Vivian Lu and Olivia Davis were absent.

"Them?" Mia scoffed. "Their mouths were too foul, so I kicked them out."

Apparently, when Mia returned that afternoon, she'd overheard the two gossiping behind Emily's back again and nearly came to blows.

"Don't mind people like that, sis," Ethan Zheng apologized. "They think their family status makes them superior."

Daniel Chen agreed: "Yeah sis, don't let them ruin your mood."

Emily smiled and nodded. "I didn't pay them any mind at all."

Under the table, William squeezed her hand. He knew she must have heard those nasty comments when she went upstairs earlier. He'd planned to deal with those two upon returning, but now he'd need another approach.
###Chapter 293

The night fell, and the warm glow of the villa's lights reflected on the snow-covered ground.

The group didn't disperse until past ten, retreating to their respective rooms. William Johnson wrapped an arm around Emily Smith's waist, whispering in her ear, "Our hot spring is waiting."

As they pushed open the door, warmth enveloped them. Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, the misty hot spring shimmered under the moonlight.

"I'll go change into my swimsuit," Emily said, slipping into the walk-in closet.

Her fingers had just brushed the clasp of her swimsuit when a scorching body pressed against her from behind. William stood there in nothing but black boxer briefs, his sculpted muscles illuminated by the soft light.

"Don't bother," he murmured against her earlobe, his voice rough. "You'll just take it off later anyway."

Emily turned to press a hand against his chest. "We'll catch a cold if we go in like this."

"Not if we keep moving," he chuckled, pinning her against the closet door, his fingers tracing the delicate wings of her shoulder blades.

The mirror reflected their entwined figures. Emily's nails left faint red marks down his back, like plum blossoms blooming in the snow.

By the time they stumbled toward the hot spring, the water was already rippling in gentle waves. William scooped her up, water droplets splashing against Emily's flushed cheeks.

"I thought we were here to soak?" she gasped.

William nipped at her collarbone with a low laugh. "Consider this a warm-up."

As the warm water rose to her chest, Emily sighed in contentment. But then William suddenly turned her around, pressing her against the edge of the pool.

"What are you doing?" she asked warily over her shoulder.

His hands settled on her waist. "I heard massages are more effective in hot springs."

The water swayed with his movements, Emily's fingers gripping the smooth stones lining the pool. Under the moonlight, their silhouettes flickered in the rising steam.

Later, Emily was carried back to bed, half-asleep. She faintly heard William murmur in her ear, "We're visiting your father tomorrow. You need at least eight hours of rest."

At breakfast the next morning, Mia Harris eyed Emily's radiant complexion and clicked her tongue. "That hot spring works better than cosmetic treatments."

On the way down the mountain, Emily dozed against the car window. William draped his coat over her, his fingers lightly brushing the diamond ring on her finger.

The prison gates gleamed coldly under the sunlight. Emily took a deep breath and tightened her grip on William's hand.
###Chapter 294

The drive from Phoenix Mountain to the prison was much shorter than from Jinzhou City, taking only an hour.

The black sedan rolled to a stop outside the prison gates. Emily Smith gazed at the towering walls through the window, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress.

"Maybe... you should wait outside?" she suddenly suggested.

William Johnson paused mid-motion, his hand hovering over the door handle. He turned to her with a raised brow. "Afraid your father won't approve of me as his son-in-law?"

The word "son-in-law" sent a tremor through Emily's chest. She stared at William's sharp profile, sunlight casting golden flecks across his lashes through the window.

"Are you serious?" she whispered.

A smirk curved his lips as his thumb brushed over her chilled fingertips. "Don't worry. I'll make sure he likes me."

Remembering his promise to help reduce her father's sentence, Emily finally nodded.

The visitation corridor remained damp and cold. Each step Emily took felt leaden, the shadows from the barred windows like invisible shackles.

"This will be the last time you walk this path," William suddenly said, tightening his grip on her hand. His warm palm radiated reassurance.

Mark Smith was already waiting in the visitation room. His dull eyes brightened instantly at the sight of his daughter. "Emily!"

"Dad." She hurried forward but choked up at the sight of his graying temples.

Mark's gaze, however, shifted to the tall figure behind her. When he recognized the face, his pupils constricted sharply. "William... Johnson?"

"Hello, sir." William stepped forward with respectful deference that couldn't mask his innate elegance. "I'm Emily's boyfriend."

The air froze for a beat. Mark's fingers trembled slightly. "You're the VP of..."

"That's right," William acknowledged calmly. "I used to visit the company with my uncle when I was younger. We've met a few times."

Mark's expression shifted through several emotions before settling into a sigh. "How did you two..."

"Fate." William suddenly lifted Emily's hand and pressed a kiss to her palm, his eyes overflowing with tenderness. "Meant to be."

Emily's ears burned, but she didn't pull away.

"Emily has been exceptional at BestTech," William said earnestly. "Our feelings grew over time."

Mark studied his daughter's flushed cheeks, hesitating before finally asking, "Does the Johnson family... know?"

"It doesn't matter," William stated firmly. "No one will separate us."

Silence filled the visitation room. Emily discreetly pinched William's palm and changed the subject to updates about her sister.

Half an hour later, William leaned close to her ear. "Let me speak with your father alone?"

Understanding, Emily rose. Her father's worried gaze made her heart ache. She gave him a small, reassuring shake of her head and a comforting smile.

As the metal door closed behind her, she caught William's low voice: "Sir, about your sentence reduction..."
###Chapter 295

"Uncle, now that Emily's not here, we can talk properly." William Johnson got straight to the point after Emily Smith left.

Henry Johnson looked puzzled. "What do you want to say?"

"Eight years have passed. Don't you feel even a shred of guilt toward Emily and her sister?" William met his gaze directly.

Henry's expression darkened instantly.

"I failed not just them, but also my mother," he said, his voice choked. "I couldn't even see her before she passed."

"Why did you take the blame for Yang Yi?" William asked abruptly.

Henry's head snapped up, shock flashing across his face.

"She was my wife. The mother of my children," he answered quietly after a long pause.

"Do you know what she did afterward?" William scoffed. "She ran off with her lover, using the embezzled money you took the fall for."

Henry's fists clenched tighter.

"After you were imprisoned, she took everything—even the money for your daughters' tuition," William continued. "Emily started working in high school. Later, she nearly sold her blood to pay for her sister's medical bills."

Tears splashed onto the table as Henry's knuckles turned white.

"I've arranged for your release in a month," William said, shifting the topic.

"What?" Henry couldn't believe his ears.

"I want Emily to have an easier life from now on," William said firmly. "You'll be a good father."

Back at the apartment in Jinzhou Bay, William's phone suddenly rang.

The words "Baby" on the screen stood out sharply.

Emily turned to leave, but he pulled her back into his arms.

"Are you mad?" He kissed her forehead lightly.

"Who is this?" she asked, feigning innocence.

"Amanda Lin saved the number," he said with a smile, hanging up and deleting all contact information in front of her.

Just as he finished, another unknown number called.

"Answer it," Emily said.

On the other end, Amanda's mother sobbed hysterically. "Young Master Johnson, please help! The eldest young master is trying to kill Amanda!"

William frowned deeply.

"Go," Emily said before he could speak, making the decision for him.

He gave her a long look, pressed a kiss to her forehead, and said, "Wait for me."

Emily nodded with a smile, watching him leave.
###Chapter 296

The night was deep, the clock long past midnight. Emily Smith curled up on one side of the bed, her eyelids heavy as they closed. In the early hours of the morning, she finally succumbed to exhaustion and fell into a deep sleep.

In her drowsy state, the mattress dipped slightly. A chill crept up her back as William Johnson's arm encircled her waist. His chest carried the coolness of the night breeze, yet it brought her an inexplicable sense of comfort.

"How's Amanda Lin?" she murmured, half-asleep.

"Just out of danger." His lips brushed her earlobe, his voice low.

Emily's drowsiness faded instantly. The words Susan Miller and Grace Lee had spoken at the resort were true? The situation was even worse than the rumors suggested.

She wanted to press for details, but William whispered, "Sleep."

"Mm." She closed her eyes and said no more.

Images of Amanda Lin orchestrating David Brown's malicious schemes flashed through her mind. Those plots that had nearly destroyed her still sent a chill down her spine. Karma would come—it was only a matter of time.

......

Monday morning, sunlight filtered through the gaps in the curtains. Emily got ready to head to Grasshopper Audiobook.

"I'll drive you," William said, adjusting his tie as he stepped out of the walk-in closet.

"It's not on your way," she replied with a smile. "Don't miss your meeting."

In front of the Grasshopper building, Emily had just stepped out of the car when a woman in sunglasses rushed toward her. A.J. swiftly moved to block her path, forming a protective barrier.

"Lucy! It's me!" The woman removed her sunglasses, revealing the unmistakable smile of Mia Harris. "Just five minutes, I promise."

The coffee shop sign across the street glinted in the sunlight. Emily glanced at the bystanders holding up their phones and said softly, "Get in the car."

Mia's eyes lit up as she quickly slipped inside.

The moment the door closed, she pulled a velvet jewelry box from her bag. "This diamond bracelet would look perfect on you." The lid snapped open, the dazzling sparkle nearly blinding.

Emily didn't reach for it. "Get to the point, Miss Harris."

"I heard Mr. Johnson acquired Grasshopper?" Mia leaned in. "Could you put in a good word for me? I guarantee I can make the company a fortune."

"Sorry." Emily's reply was firm.

Mia's smile froze. "Really? That's how you treat me?" Her voice turned sharp. "I'm a top-tier star!"

"I have work to do." Emily reached for the door handle.

"Aren't you afraid I'll expose your relationship?" Mia suddenly hissed, her tone threatening.

Emily paused. She turned, a faint smile curling her lips. "Go ahead."

The door slammed shut, cutting off Mia's stunned expression. A.J. immediately fell into step beside Emily, escorting her into the Grasshopper building. Sunlight reflected off the glass façade, casting a brilliant glow.
###Chapter 297

Emily Smith stepped out of the Leap Recording Studio and shivered as a cold wind hit her. She tightened the collar of her coat and glanced at the familiar black Maybach parked by the curb.

The car door slid open silently, revealing the tall figure of William Johnson. He pulled her inside in one swift motion, his heated kiss descending before she could react. Emily found herself pressed against the seat, her senses filled with his crisp cedar scent.

"Stop..." She pushed against him, but he caught her wrists. Only when they were both breathless did William finally release her, though clearly reluctant.

Emily curled up in his arms like a startled rabbit. She knew this man's wicked tendencies too well, fearing he might take things further in the confined space.

"Scared?" William chuckled lowly, casually picking up a document to flip through. Emily peeked and saw pages filled with English text.

"This isn't BestTech's file, is it?" she asked offhandedly.

William pinched her soft cheek. "Clever."

Emily didn’t bother pressing further, struggling to sit up. "Let me go."

"Uncomfortable?" He adjusted his posture with mock seriousness. "Better now?"

Frustrated, Emily gave up resisting and pulled out her phone to study her script. Despite her 168cm height, she looked almost petite in his embrace. The two of them—one reading documents, the other scrolling through her phone—created an oddly harmonious scene.

Outside the window, the scenery grew increasingly bustling. Emily looked up. "Where are we going?"

William closed the file and kissed her cheek. "To try on dresses and jewelry."

"What do I need those for?" She laughed. Luxury items felt worlds away from her life.

"Daniel Chen's wedding this Friday. Forgot?" He tapped her nose.

Emily froze. She had forgotten—and couldn’t fathom why William remembered so clearly.

"You’re really going?"

"Of course." He raised a brow. "A man keeps his word."

Emily was speechless. He was the one who had accepted on her behalf.

"Next weekend is Old Master Lu's 80th birthday. You’re coming with me." He idly played with her fingers.

"Olivia Davis’s grandfather?" Emily’s eyes widened.

When William nodded, her face fell instantly. "I don’t want to go."

"Then I’ll cancel too," he said lightly.

Emily seethed.

The car stopped in front of a high-end boutique. Though it was only 7 p.m., the store had already been cleared out. The manager’s overwhelming enthusiasm as he praised Emily from head to toe made her toes curl in embarrassment. Only William’s presence kept her from bolting.

In the VIP room, ten couture gowns were displayed in a row. Emily pointed at two—a soft pink and a pale lavender.

"Try them all?" William suggested.

"Two are enough."

"What if one gets dirty? These can’t be washed."

Emily was stunned. The world of the wealthy was beyond her—a dress worth millions, yet disposable.

"Four at most," she conceded, selecting two more understated options.

In the fitting room, Emily studied her reflection. Even the most conservative cut couldn’t hide her curves. By the fourth dress, William’s gaze had darkened considerably.

It struck him then—how many covetous eyes would be drawn to her at the Lu family banquet.

Ten jewelry sets were presented next. Emily shook her head, exasperated. "Wearing these would make me feel ridiculous."

"You’ll get used to it," he said, ruffling her hair.

"Am I not pretty enough without them?" she retorted.

William laughed, utterly disarmed.
###Chapter 298

The staff exchanged glances, disbelief evident in their eyes.

Could any woman truly resist the allure of jewelry? Especially when gifted by the man she loved.

Miss Smith was... different.

"Emily," William Johnson murmured, holding her slender fingers, his voice low. "Jewels aren't just adornments. They're symbols of status. The Queen's scepter, Elizabeth Taylor's diamonds—all priceless treasures."

Emily placed the necklace back into its velvet box, shaking her head as her hair swayed gently. "Too flashy. I'm not used to it."

William's Adam's apple bobbed.

It struck him then—the woman he loved was even more stubborn than he was.

......

In the end, Emily only chose four gowns and refused to touch any jewelry. But William secretly purchased all ten gowns along with their matching sets.

These were surprises he'd carefully selected.

Now he saw it clearly—his Emily was truly one of a kind.

After dinner, they visited the hospital. The girl's complexion looked better than before. As Emily massaged her, a single tear slipped from the child's eye.

"She can hear! She really can!" Emily threw herself into William's arms, her voice trembling.

William caught her, infected by her rare burst of joy. On the way back, she chattered excitedly about plans for the girl's future, her eyes sparkling like stars.

Only William knew—the ominous temple fortune weighed on his heart like a stone.

Years ago, after his aunt's accident, he'd drawn the same ill-fated slip.

A week later, she was gone.

......

The next day, William took her somewhere special.

When the car stopped in front of the familiar old neighborhood, Emily's fingers tightened around her seatbelt.

"Let's go up," William said, leading her upstairs.

This was the apartment where she'd grown up. Forced to sell it eight years ago when prices were low, the value had since skyrocketed.

Sunlight danced through dust motes in the empty rooms. Emily could almost see her grandmother bustling in the kitchen, her sister playing in the living room.

When the keys dropped into her palm, her tears fell onto William's hand.

"We'll renovate it for your father's return," he whispered, kissing away her tears.

Emily buried her face in his chest, her voice muffled. "Thank you."

William ruffled her hair. "Silly girl."

......

With the apartment secured, Emily added a new task to her daily routine—designing their future home. The team William recommended was professional, saving her much effort.

He transferred fifty million into her account with just three words: "Spend it freely."

Emily stared at the message for a long time but didn't return the money.

If they were committed to this relationship, why draw lines? Yet she still budgeted carefully—some habits were ingrained.

Friday was Daniel Chen's wedding. On Thursday night, a tearful call came from Sophia Song. "Emily, you must come tomorrow."

After hanging up, Emily stood by the window, moonlight stretching her shadow long across the floor.
###Chapter 299

Emily Smith hung up the phone, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Sophia Song's voice lingered in her ears. That once-arrogant woman was now humbly begging her to attend the wedding. It was too strange.

"What's on your mind?"

William Johnson approached, carrying the fresh scent of his shower. He lifted her from the couch, his warm hand resting against her waist, dispelling some of the chill.

Emily looked up at him and recounted Sophia's unusual behavior in detail.

"Afraid she's up to something?" William chuckled, pressing a light kiss to her lips.

"She has no reason to beg me," Emily frowned. "Unless—"

"Then let's go see," William cut off her train of thought. "I'll be with you."

...

The next morning, they finished packing and prepared to leave for the airport.

As the elevator doors opened, William's phone rang.

Emily caught a glimpse of the unsaved number, her heart skipping a beat. It was Amanda Lin's mother calling.

William's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly as he let the ringtone echo through the empty garage.

When the phone rang a second time, Emily took her coat from him. "Answer it."

She slipped into the car, watching through the window as William stood in the cold wind, his back to her as he took the call.

The conversation ended quickly. William opened the car door and grasped her hand. "I need to handle something."

"Go," she replied without hesitation, not even asking how long he'd be gone.

William cupped her face and pressed a kiss to her forehead. "I'll be back soon."

She watched his car pull out of the garage, her fingers tightening around the hem of her coat.

In the VIP lounge, the boarding announcement played for the third time.

Emily stared at her phone screen. William's number remained unanswered. The last message still read, "Wait for me," sent two hours ago.

"Miss Smith, it's time to board," Aji reminded her.

As the plane's doors were about to close, Emily cast one last glance toward the entrance.

The empty jet bridge reflected under the stark white lights, mirroring the hollowness in her chest.

The sound of the cabin door sealing shut was especially sharp. Emily reclined her seat and closed her eyes.

Her lashes cast faint shadows beneath her eyes, trembling slightly with the roar of the engines.
###Chapter 300

Alexander Johnson's assault had left Amanda Lin clinging to life in the ICU. Emily Smith stood outside the ward, gazing through the glass at her paper-white face. The woman who once basked in glory as the future Mrs. Johnson now relied on machines to breathe.

"The doctor says she might not make it through tonight," the nurse whispered.

Emily's grip tightened on her purse strap. She remembered the nationally televised engagement party three months ago—Alexander's arm around Amanda's waist, declaring under flashing cameras that he'd found his soulmate. Now it was clear: just an elaborate PR stunt.

Her phone vibrated. Twenty-three missed calls from William Johnson glared on the screen. She powered it off and turned toward the elevators.

The Jinzhou sunlight stabbed at her eyes. Bodyguard Ji followed three steps behind like a shadow.

"Take me to the mall," she told the driver.

The presidential suite still carried William's scent. A note in his flamboyant handwriting lay on the nightstand: Wait for me. She crumpled it into the trash.

The mall buzzed with shoppers. Emily paused outside a noodle shop.

"Let's eat here," she said to Ji.

The way the northern man slurped noodles reminded her of William—that same ruthless intensity in every motion. A drop of broth stained Ji's cuff. When Emily handed him a tissue, she noticed the scar on his wrist.

"Afghanistan," he explained, following her gaze. "Shrapnel."

Suddenly she recalled the similar mark below William's collarbone. He'd claimed it was from falling off a horse as a boy. Now she wondered which woman had really left that souvenir.

A crystal swan glittered under boutique lights. The salesgirl gushed about its limited edition status—only 99 pairs worldwide. Swiping her card, Emily remembered Daniel Chen taking her to the recording studio for the first time. His faded jeans, his declaration that her voice was heaven-sent.

Obsidian cufflinks rested on velvet like William's eyes. Her fingers twitched toward them before retreating. "For your boyfriend?" the clerk smiled. "These symbolize 'eternal devotion.'"

Emily turned away. The display window reflected her red-rimmed eyes. Ji followed silently, the elegantly wrapped gift box in hand.

Night had fallen when they returned to the hotel. Emily watched city lights flicker to life beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. Her phone spun in her palm—still powered off.

The bedside phone rang. A Mr. Johnson waited in the lobby.

Hanging up, Emily dug out the diamond ring hidden in her suitcase for six months. William had slipped it onto her finger atop a Swiss alp, swearing it outshone the stars over the Alps.

Now she placed it inside the wedding gift box meant for Daniel.
