###Chapter 1 Here's The Divorce Agreement
Inside the CEO's office of the Todd Group, Jonny Todd slid a set of papers across the desk toward Eleanor Todd. "Here's the divorce agreement. Go through it, and if everything looks fine, sign your name."



Eleanor's eyes lingered on the papers, shadowed with emotions she kept hidden. "Do we truly have to end our marriage?"


At her words, Jonny arched his brows, amusement flickering in his tone. "What else were you hoping for? Our marriage only existed to make my grandmother happy."


While speaking, he reached for the hand of the woman at his side, his voice softening. "And now that Lainey has returned, I need to restore her place and give her the respect she deserves."  Eleanor slowly raised her head, her gaze falling on the woman who had always lived in her husband's heart-Lainey Gilbert. Lainey was Jonny's childhood friend and ex-girlfriend. Three years earlier, the Todd family and the Gilbert family had planned an engagement for Jonny and Lainey.
But before the engagement ceremony could happen,Jonny was in a car crash that left his legs broken,with doctors warning he might never walk again.
Once the news reached the Gilberts, they abruptly canceled the arrangement and sent Lainey overseas.Yet even with their callous rejection, Jonny never erased Lainey from his heart.

With her sudden return, he was impatient to dissolve his marriage with Eleanor and welcome Lainey as his wife.
Lainey stood in a light white dress, dimples flashing as she smiled, looking every bit like a fragile bloom in full beauty. She carried a beauty that was hard to deny.
It made perfect sense that Jonny had clung to her image all these years.
When Eleanor said nothing, Lainey faced her with apparent sincerity. "Mrs. Todd, Jonny and I share real love. I hope you'll give us your blessing."
Yet how could love be genuine when she had abandoned him the moment he was crippled, only to return once he recovered?
A dry laugh slipped from Eleanor as her eyes shifted toward Jonny. "A divorce is fine. But after what I've done for your family all those three years, I won't leave empty-handed.I expect fair compensation."
Because Sallie Todd had once helped her in the orphanage, Eleanor had agreed without hesitation when the old woman asked her to marry her grandson, Jonny.
Since then, she had poured herself into the role of a loyal wife.
She had even grown a faint affection for him while watching his efforts to stand on his own again.
But despite her devotion, three years had done nothing to soften his heart.
Letting go now was the only path left.
Still, her part in pushing the Todd Group to its successful listing was no small matter.
She would not allow her hard work to vanish without acknowledgment.
Jonny laughed under his breath as he lit a cigarette,his features sharpening in the haze of smoke. "Don't worry. Sign the papers, and you'll have $70 million along with a riverside villa."
Although Eleanor meant little to him, he couldn't ignore the fact that she had stayed by his side while his legs were useless. That was enough to settle the debt between them. "I'll give you two days to think. If you want anything more..." he began.
"There's no need." Eleanor lifted the pen with steady grace and signed her name. "By tomorrow morning,I'll move out and leave the place open for you and Miss Gilbert."
Jonny felt a spark of satisfaction at her decisiveness.Even he could not deny that Eleanor had been the model wife. She was beautiful, compliant, and skilled at keeping the household in order.
Yet to him, her nature was unbearably bland. She lived like a machine, going through tasks without spirit or surprise. Dull, unchanging, and without spark. She could never stir his desire.
What he longed for was a partner who understood him, someone who could stand at his side through every storm. In his mind, only Lainey fit that role.
Jonny gathered up the contract and had it delivered to the court, ready to offer Eleanor a few courteous  words, but Lainey leaned close and gave his sleeve a small tug.
"Jonny, I was thinking... I really like that villa too,"Lainey said.
###Chapter 2 Are You Out Of Your Mind
"Hmm?" Jonny lifted his brows with mild surprise,studying Lainey curiously.
Hardly ever did Lainey ask anything of him. She had always carried herself as though she were above the material concerns, distant and untouchable.
Catching his reaction, Lainey raised her eyes with a faint, shy look. "Didn't you once tell me that the villa had the perfect surroundings and could serve as our future home after marriage?"
Memories of their past sweetness softened him,and without much thought, Jonny nodded.that's what you want, then consider it yours."
Eleanor observed their sickening harmony,her lips curling into a mocking smirk. "Jonny, only moments ago you promised me that house. Now you hand it over to her. Doesn't that strike you as shameless?"  Her words caught him off guard.
During their three years together, she had always been quiet and yielding, never daring to speak to him in such a tone.
His forehead creased, his voice edged with irritation."It's only one villa. I own plenty of properties. Pick whichever you want, and I'll transfer it to you."
Lainey, sensing his displeasure, quickly added, "Mrs.Todd, if you'll let me take the villa, I'll add another $10 million to your compensation."
Eleanor's gaze swept over her with contempt. "Miss Gilbert, are you joking? That villa alone is worth at least $60 million on the market. Do you really think $10 million can buy it from me?"
The color drained from Lainey's face, and she turned toward Jonny with wounded eyes. "Jonny, that's not what I meant."
Unmoved by her performance, Eleanor interjected sharply, "If you want that villa so badly, I won't refuse outright. But the price is this-Jonny must exchange it for ten percent of the Todd Group's shares."
"What?!" Lainey's voice rose in disbelief. "Mrs. Todd,are you insane?"
The Todd Group was publicly listed, and ten percent of its stock was worth over one hundred million.
Eleanor's demand was outrageous, and everyone in the room knew it.
Jonny's face turned grim at once. "Eleanor, don't test my patience."
Unfazed,Eleanor met his glare. "Either give me the shares or the villa, Jonny. The decision is yours."
The air thickened with sudden tension.
Sensing the hostility mounting,Lainey tightened her hold on Jonny's arm and begged softly, "Jonny forget it. I don't need that villa anymore. Wherever we live, as long as I'm beside you, I'll be content."
Those words calmed Jonny, and the severity in his face eased somewhat.
He turned back to Eleanor with a cold look. "The villa is yours then."
Knowing she had secured her rightful claim, Eleanor lost interest in further argument and started to walk away.
But Lainey's voice rang out behind her. "Mrs. Todd!"When Eleanor turned, she found Lainey smiling sweetly. "Thank you for looking after Jonny during these years. From now on, I'll make sure to learn how to be his wife properly," Lainey said.
Though the tone sounded gentle, every syllable carried a challenge.
Eleanor regarded her quietly, then burst out with sudden laughter.
Striding back to the desk, she grabbed Jonny's untouched cup of coffee and flung it straight over both of them. "Ah!" Lainey screamed as the hot liquid splattered across her white dress, staining it badly and leaving her disheveled.
Jonny's tailored suit was soaked as well, and fury twisted his face. "Eleanor! Are you out of your mind?"
She set the empty cup back onto the table with deliberate calm, her smile sharp. "My mistake. I just caught sight of something repulsive and couldn't hold back."
Without sparing them another glance, she walked out with steady steps, leaving the two of them in their disgrace.
###Chapter 3 Isn't That Eleanor Over There!
The moment Eleanor walked out of the Todd Group headquarters, her phone buzzed with a message from her closest friend, Lillian Brooks.


"It's my birthday today. I know you probably can't come,but I just wanted to remind you. Honestly, I don't know what kind of spell that jerk Jonny has on you. You've cut yourself off from everyone for his sake."


With little thought, Eleanor sent back a reply. "Give me the address."


For a beat there was silence, and then her screen lit up with a text.


"What the hell? What's happening?"


Eleanor's fingers moved with calm precision. "I've signed the divorce agreement." "Oh my God, you finally broke free of that lovesick title. Stay put. I'm coming to you right away!" A sleek maroon convertible sped on the highway.
Behind the wheel, Lillian tipped her sunglasses down and gave Eleanor a playful whistle. "Eleanor, since you're finally out of that nightmare, we're celebrating at Velvet Club tonight. We're going to have fun."
Eleanor leaned lazily against the seat, her voice quiet."Alright."
Lillian's curiosity got the better of her. "So what pushed you to finally cut ties? Let me guess-Lainey's back, isn't she?"
A faint smile touched Eleanor's lips."Congratulations. You guessed it."
Lillian slid her sunglasses off and remarked with a smirk, "Back then, Lainey ran off the moment he ended up in a wheelchair, and now that she's returned, he's chasing after her like some lovesick fool. Do you think Jonny damaged more than his legs in that car crash?"


"Hard to say."


"And you, wasting three whole years tied to that useless man," Lillian continued. "Good thing there weren't any kids, or the divorce would've been a nightmare."


A quiet laugh escaped Eleanor. "There was never a chance of that. He and I never even shared a bed."


"What?!" Lillian almost lost hold of the steering wheel. "You're telling me you were married for three years and never slept together?!"


Eleanor's beauty was undeniable. If that was true,then was Jonny incapable?


"He was keeping himself pure for Lainey." Just mentioning the two of them made Eleanor's stomach twist."Enough about him. Can you drop me off so l can change first?"


"Of course!" <###Chapter 3 Isn't That Eleanor Over There!         +120 Points at most
By eight that evening, the Velvet Club was in full swing. It was Elepdon's largest entertainment venue,a gathering place for the city's wealthy and powerful,where extravagance ruled and a single bottle of wine could cost hundreds of thousands.
Lillian's eyes sparkled as she glanced at Eleanor."Now this is the Eleanor I remember!"
That night, Eleanor's figure was wrapped in a sleek red dress that traced every curve. With loose waves tumbling over her shoulders and crimson lips to match, she was a vision that drew every eye.
Once Eleanor was seated, Lillian gave her shoulder a quick squeeze. "Stay here. I'll track down some top-shelf wine."

"Alright."
Eleanor's allure was undeniable; even as she sat still beneath the lights, her presence drew the eyes of countless men in an instant.
Out of nowhere, a man with blond hair swaggered up, flashing her a greasy smile. "Hey, beautiful.Sitting alone must be boring. How about sharing a drink with me?"


Across the club, Jonny stepped inside accompanied by his younger sister, Emma Todd.


From a nearby booth, Lainey lifted her hand in greeting, her smile poised. "Jonny, Emma, over here."


Emma hurried over, her face glowing with excitement. "Lainey, I'm so happy you're back. I've missed you so much!"


"I've missed you too." The reply was warm, but Lainey's eyes never strayed from Jonny.


She was just about to draw him in with another gesture when Emma's voice rang out in surprise."Jonny, isn't that Eleanor over there?!"


Jonny's head turned toward the direction Emma pointed.


Under the shifting lights, a striking figure rested on a barstool, her long legs revealed beneath the hem of her skirt, elegant and mesmerizing.
###Chapter 4 Leave Me Alone
Had he not recognized that familiar face, Jonny never would have guessed the woman before him was the plain wife he had grown so tired of.
Eleanor seemed caught in the unwanted attention of a man,her cold expression giving her feelings away.
"Look at her, pretending to be a saint at home,and now she's acting wild the moment you split up. What a shameless slut!" Emma, who had always despised her,sneered.
In the past, she had said worse in front of Jonny without consequence. This time, though,heat surged through him like fire.
"Enough! Watch your mouth!" he snapped at his sister.
Emma's lips twisted in a pout at the unexpected rebuke. <###Chapter 4 Leave Me Alone                +120 Points af most Lainey laid a gentle hand on Emma's back, her eyes sly as she fanned the flames. "Jonny, don't you find it suspicious? She's changed already... mnaybe she's already warming up to someone new?"
Jonny's stare grew heavier, his silence darker than words.
"Why so cold, gorgeous? Maybe a kiss will warm you up," the blond man teased, circling Eleanor like a predator who smelled blood.
Eleanor's brow creased with disgust. "Leave me alone."
"Oh, I like my women with fight in them. The feistier,the better. Come on, let me show you a good time."His hand lunged brazenly toward her chest.
A cold laugh slipped from Eleanor's lips as she snatched up an expensive bottle of red wine and smashed it hard against his head.
The bottle shattered on impact, drenching the blond man's face in wine. "Are you fucking kidding me!" he yelled, smearing the liquid off his skin. "You crazy bitch! Do you have any idea who I am? I'm from the Murphy family.Tonight you'll be begging beneath me, I swear!"


The entire club froze, eyes snapping toward the chaos, eager to see how it would end.


Up on the third floor, behind a wide glass window,Ryland Brooks leaned back with narrowed eyes,amusement flickering across his face."Look at that-Brice Murphy really loves hearing himself talk,throwing around his family name like it means something."


Within Elepdon's upper circles, Brice was a nobody compared to the man seated across from Ryland-Nolan Stewart, heir to the Stewart family and head of Stewart Group.


"Nolan, you've been staring at that woman for a long time. Don't tell me she caught your interest?" Ryland continued.


Lazily swirling the wine in his glass, Nolan let his gaze linger on the woman draped in bright red."Yeah, she's really... interesting." Ryland's brow arched in surprise. "That's unexpected. No woman has ever managed to draw your attention before."
He recalled faintly that the woman might even be a friend of his sister's.
Meanwhile, Brice, the blond man downstairs, had lost all composure, his rage threatening to ignite the room.
Jonny's face darkened as he sat brooding, then he suddenly rose to his feet.
Lainey's eyes widened in shock. "Wait, Jonny, are you actually going to step in for Eleanor?"
"Have you lost your mind, Jonny? That woman brought this on herself by flirting with Brice.Why would you stick your neck out?" Emma said.
"She was my wife for three years. I won't stand here and pretend I don't know her," Jonny retorted, seizing a convenient justification for his actions.


"But-" Emma started, but she faltered as two imposing figures descended the staircase.


All eyes immediately shifted toward them, and the noise in the club died in an instant when people realized it was Nolan and Ryland.


Brice caught sight of them, and all arrogance drained from his face. He scrambled forward, practically bowing. "Mr. Stewart, Mr. Brooks, I had no idea you'd be here tonight!"


His tone fawned as he continued, plastering on a fake smile, "Allow me to cover the bill this evening.Please, enjoy yourselves."


Nolan dismissed him without so much as a glance,his gaze cutting past the crowd to settle firmly on Eleanor.
###Chapter 5 It's Ex-wife,Actually





Ryland's smile carried softness, yet his gaze stayed as cold as ice. "Funny, Brice. You didn't look so meek when you were picking on my friend a moment ago,did you?"


"Your... your friend?" Brice turned his head toward Eleanor with disbelief before dropping to his knees,pleading, "Mr. Brooks, I was out of line! I swear I had no idea she was close to you. I'd never dare touch her if I had known. It was foolish of me. Please, give me another chance, I swear I'll never repeat it."


He kept lowering his head over and over, begging like a man desperate to save himself.


At last, Ryland waved him off with clear contempt."Fine. You're lucky I'm in a good mood today, so I'll let it go. Now get out of my sight."


"Thank you, Mr. Brooks." Brice stumbled toward the door, nearly falling as he bolted from the club.  Lillian came rushing in just as he disappeared, her face tight with worry. "Eleanor, are you hurt?"


Eleanor shook her head and replied, "No, I'm alright."


Relief swept over Lillian, and she turned toward her brother. "Ryland, thank heavens you showed up. We really owe you."


Ryland chuckled softly as he patted her hair. "What matters to you matters to me. You don't need to thank me."


Eleanor dipped her head politely. "Thank you, Mr.Brooks."



"You don't have to be formal with me. You spilled plenty of wine. Go wash it off before it dries."


"Okay." Eleanor got up and headed for the restroom,though midway she crossed paths with Jonny, who had Lainey by his side.


Lainey greeted her with a bright smile. "Miss Warren,what a lovely surprise." Eleanor acknowledged her with the faintest nod,making no effort to continue the exchange.
The silence left Lainey stiff and uneasy. She turned to Jonny with a wounded expression. "Jonny, did I upset Miss Warren somehow?"
A deep frown formed on Jonny's face. "She's trying to greet you, and you can't even respond properly?"
Eleanor tilted her head, unimpressed. "Since when were we so close?"

"Don't get upset with Miss Warren on my account,"Lainey said quickly, clutching Jonny's hand with feigned gentleness.

What nonsense.

Eleanor decided it wasn't worth another word and turned to go, but Jonny's irritated voice cut through the noise. "If you're trying to draw me in, you don't need to humiliate yourself. My heart belongs to Lainey. No matter how much you try, it's pointless."
That was all she needed to confirm he had  completely lost touch with reality.
Her eyes lifted to his, calm but sharp. "I didn't step foot in this place for your sake. I came to enjoy myself. And let me remind you-we're divorced.You don't get to lecture me anymore."
The chill in her tone left Jonny restless. He couldn't grasp how the gentle, compliant woman he once married had turned into someone so unyielding.
"Miss Warren, how can you speak like that? Jonny only means well," Lainey interjected quickly, trying to defend Jonny.
Eleanor's gaze swept over them, full of disdain."Please. You're just a cheating husband and a shameless homewrecker. Do either of you really have the right to stand before me as ifyou're proud of it?Step aside. I have no time for nonsense."
With heels striking the floor like sharp notes, Eleanor swept past them, her crimson dress flowing around her like a rose in full bloom. Jonny's fists clenched as he stared after her, his chest burning. How had he lived all this time without realizing she carried such fire on her tongue?


Lainey reached for his hand and said softly, "Don't let her get under your skin, Jonny. Come back inside with me. Emma is waiting."


His expression darkened, yet he gave no reply.


While she had been overseas, he missed her every day. Yet now, with her right beside him, her presence felt strangely empty. Perhaps Eleanor's defiance had clouded his mind.



Together they turned and walked away.


Inside the private room, Ryland observed it all through the wide glass window. "I never imagined she was Jonny's wife. That makes things rather amusing."


sex-wife,actually," Nolan corrected firmly.

###Chapter 6 Any Progress With The Soul Surgeon
Ryland raised his brows in shock. "Nolan, don't tell me you're actually serious about Eleanor?"
No one could deny Eleanor's beauty, but Nolan was never short of women to choose from. Why waste his time on someone already divorced?
Nolan avoided giving a straight answer and instead asked, "Do you remember the woman I mentioned-the one who gambled against me over the Usepsall project?"
"How could I forget? Wait... you mean it was her?"
"Exactly." Nolan set his glass down with a faint curl at the corner of his mouth. "She's clever and knows how to hide her true self."

Ryland let out a low whistle, intrigued by the revelation  In all his years, Nolan had suffered defeat only once,and that defeat had come from Eleanor.
Fate, it seemed, had a cruel sense of humor.
"What about Fannie? Any progress with the Soul Surgeon?"
The moment those words left his lips, Nolan's expression hardened. "Word is, the Soul Surgeon has an obsession with antiques. In two weeks, David Gill will host an exclusive exchange. If luck favors us, we might find her there."
Ryland exhaled heavily. "Then that's our only option."


Lillian didn't escort Eleanor back to her villa until it was past midnight.
Morning light had barely touched the curtains when Eleanor's phone rang with a call from the Todd family's estate.
Sallie, Jonny's grandmother, was shocked when she learned about the divorce. She wanted Eleanor to join the family for a meal.


Throughout the three years Eleanor had been married, Sallie had shown her genuine affection.


Even after the divorce, Eleanor couldn't bring herself to disappoint the old woman.


By five o'clock, she stepped into the Todd family's residence right on time.


Vickie Todd, Jonny's mother, looked her up and down with disdain. "So Emma was right after all. That whole image of you being a proper wife was nothing but an act. Underneath, you're just a seductress."


"That's enough, Vickie! I invited her here to share a meal, not to listen to your insults!" Sallie snapped,her tone sharp with disapproval. She waved Eleanor closer. "Come here,dear."


Eleanor settled beside Sallie, who greeted her with a smile full of warmth.


"My dear, you've gotten thinner again in just a few days. Still, you look wonderful today. That lively style suits you. Young people should shine."
"Thank you, Sallie." Eleanor studied her closely.
you still drinking the herbal concoction I prepared for you?"
"Yes, I have, and it's worked wonders. I finally sleep without trouble."
Vickie gave a derisive laugh. "As if a country girl could treat insomnia. She might have slipped sleeping pills in the concoction. Of course anyone would sleep after that."
Sallie snapped, her voice sharp, "Enough! Don't belittle her like that. Eleanor gave three years of her life to this family. When your son was broken and helpless, she nursed him with devotion no one else could match. Women like her are rare treasures!"
Vickie's face twisted, but she had no words left to throw back. Bitterness burned in her chest as she kept quiet. "Don't lether sharp words trouble you. To me, you will always be the true granddaughter-in-law of this family. None of those shameless women outside will ever take your place."



"Grandma, that's unfair!" Jonny's voice rang out as he entered with Lainey clinging to his arm. "The only woman I've ever loved is Lainey."



"And what of it?" Sallie's glare landed on Lainey like a blow. "When you were laid up in bed, she couldn't stomach the sight of you crippled and fled overseas without hesitation. What love is there in a woman who abandons so easily?"


Lainey's lips trembled, and tears rimmed her eyes."Sallie, you don't understand. My family forced me to leave back then."



"Don't waste your excuses on me. You might fool Jonny, but you'll never fool me. I can see who you really are, crysal clear." Sallie's frail body shook from the effort of her outburst, and soon she was coughing violently. Eleanor immediately reached over and patted her back. "Sallie, don't push yourself too hard. Please stay calm, for your own sake."


When her breathing finally steadied, Sallie clasped Eleanor's hand with affection. "My dear, rest assured. As long as I live, no one in this house will dare mistreat you."


Gratitude welled in Eleanor's chest, yet she had no wish to keep hiding behind Sallie's protection. "Sallie,I was the one who asked for the divorce. I was done with a marriage that existed in name only. My feelings for Jonny are gone, and dragging it on any further would only be torture for us both."

###Chapter 7 | Abandoned Your Trust

Jonny's expression clouded over the moment Eleanor's words sank in.
"Eleanor, are you absolutely sure about this?" Sallie asked, her voice carrying a last trace of hope.
"I am," Eleanor answered with quiet conviction.
"In that case, I won't try to stop you," Sallie said softly.
She knew what a bad marriage meant to a woman. "If this is your choice, dear, then you have my full support."
"I appreciate that, Sallie."
"You don't have to force yourself to stay for dinner tonight. With Jonny and Lainey here, the meal will taste bitter. I'll invite you back another day, just the two of us." Moved by Salie's kindness, Eleanor nodded. "Alright, I'll come another time."
Rising to her feet, she turned her back on Jonny without hesitation and left the Todd family's estate with her head held high.
Determined to cut every last tie with Jonny,Eleanor made up her mind to settle matters completely.
Later that day, she called Lillian and asked her to connect with a real estate agent.
It didn't take long before Lillian showed up.
After inspecting the property, she asked with surprise, "This place is in such a prime spot. Are you sure you really want to let it go?"
"Keeping it feels like keeping bad luck. I'd rather sell it and move on," Eleanor responded.
"You're right about that. I'll handle everything, so you don't have to worry." Eleanor placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of her. "I appreciate it, Lillian."


"Don't mention it. It's what we do for friends," Lillian said as she sank into the sofa. "By the way, Mr. Gill is hosting an antique exhibition in two weeks. Want to come?"



Eleanor hesitated, uncertain. "I'm not sure he'd even want to see me again."



"You're overthinking." Lillian looped her arm around Eleanor's shoulders. "You're his only apprentice. Of course he wants to see you."


David Gill wasn't only a respected name in the antique collection industry. He was also the chosen heir of Mystic Glen's medical skills.


Every successor of Mystic Glen took just one student in their lifetime. David had chosen Eleanor.


Eleanor never failed David's expectations, mastering the refined craft of special tool therapy with extraordinary precision. To keep her identity hidden, she treated every patient behind a mask.


Whispers spread among the public, and with no real name to use, they began to call her the Soul Surgeon.


Her talent could have earned her recognition across the medical world, yet she chose to bury it and live as Jonny's dutiful wife for three long years.


The memory of David's defeated look before her marriage still haunted her, and guilt weighed heavily on her heart.



Lillian reached out to steady her. "Stop blaming yourself. I'll be by your side when the time comes."


"Okay."


Two weeks slipped away.


The highly anticipated antique exhibition opened with grandeur.


Crowds filled the venue, including the wealthy elite who cared little for antiques but wanted to bask in the spectacle.
Outside the lounge reserved for honored guests,
Eleanor faltered briefly before lifting her hand to knock.

"Come in."

At the sound, the door creaked open.
Seated by the window in his wheelchair, David faced away. In three years, his hair had grown strikingly silver.
"It's far too noisy outside. I'll step out when the intermission starts." Believing it was an attendant, he spoke without looking back.
Drawing in a steadying breath, Eleanor whispered,"Mr.Gill."
The old man froze, then slowly turned. His eyes widened."Eleanor?!"

"Yes, it's me." Eleanor crossed the room toward him. "I owe you an apology. After all your years of teaching, I abandoned your trust."


David gave a slow shake of his head. "No need to apologize. This is your life, and you deserve to make your own choices."


"I'm here now. This time, I'll carry forward the medical legacy you entrusted to me-as the Soul Surgeon."


"And will your husband stand behind such a decision?"
###Chapter 8 Say Sorry To Emma Right Now





"I'm divorced, and I refuse to lose myself in another man's shadow," Eleanor said.


"That's better." David's dislike of Jonny had always been clear, and he had never thought that marriage would last.



Still, he knew people often needed hardship before they could truly groW.


Now he was convinced this ordeal would forge Eleanor into someone unshakable.



Once her conversaion with David had reached its end,Eleanor didn't linger in the lounge.


Making her way toward the exhibition hall, she suddenly crossed paths with Emma.


The instant Emma spotted her, her face twisted with scorn. "So Lillian Brooks has made you bold.Are you really so desperate to win Jonny back that you'd chase him all the way here?"
"Watch what you say."
"Don't act innocent. I remember how you bowed to Jonny's every whim. You'll never fool me."
Eleanor recognized Emma's stupidity and chose not to waste energy. "Step aside."
"Absolutely not. I'm warning you, stay away from Jonny. The only woman fit to be my sister-in-law is Lainey!" Emma's shrill tone carried through the hall,quickly drawing a crowd.
Desperate to humiliate her further, Emma raised her voice. "Three years of marriage, and you couldn't even give him a child. Just look at yourself-plain,broke, and worthless. Do you honestly think you can measure up to Lainey?"
Eleanor's lips curved faintly as she replied, "If you're so worried about children, maybe have Jonny see a  doctor. The problem lies with him, not me." Those words struck like a whip, and Emma lost all composure. "How dare you insult Jonny! I'll teach you a lesson right here!"
Spoiled by the Todd family, Emma had never cared about when or where she threw her tantrums.
As Emma lunged forward, Eleanor shifted lightly to the side, letting Emma stumble past and collide straight into the exhibition stand.
A deafening crash followed as a priceless vase toppled with its glass case and shattered across the marble floor.
For a heartbeat, the room froze. Security guards,guests, and staff all stared in stunned silence.
Jonny appeared first, pushing through the crowd with urgency. "What's going on here?"
"She shoved me!" Emma wasted no time, pointing at Eleanor. "She kept insulting me, then pushed me straight into the display!" <###Chapter 8 Say Sorry To Emma Right Now       +120 Points at most Jonny's glare snapped to Eleanor, his voice rising with anger. "It's bad enough you cause trouble everywhere else, but how dare you create a scene here? Say sorry to Emma right now."
It dawned on Eleanor then just how foolish she had been to once admire him. "So you just believe every word she spits out? Use your head,Jonny."
"Eleanor!" Jonny's face burned with humiliation."What has happened to you? How could you become   _"
Suddenly, applause rippled through the hall,cutting
Jonny's rantshort.
From the VIP section, Nolan emerged with Ryland at
his side.The murmurs among the crowd died instantly,

replaced with tense silence.Nolan, the man who dominated Elepdon's business
world,had arrived.
No one in the room dared to cross someone of his  standing.

"Who would've thought an exhibition could turn into such a performance? Truly unexpected," Nolan remarked.

At the sight of him, Jonny straightened at once and bowed his head politely. "Mr. Stewart."
###Chapter 9 Maybe You'll Have Better Luck Behind Bars
Nolan brushed past without a word, his steps halting only when he reached the glinting shards that littered the floor.
Ryland strolled up beside him, smirking as he looked down. "That piece was a real treasure-a rare antique, famous for its craftsmanship. Mr.Gill jumped through hoops to bring it here from overseas. What a shame to see it end up like this."
His voice carried a hint of regret, but the amusement in his eyes betrayed him.
Emma, who had only glimpsed Nolan once before,had secretly built up a fantasy of becoming his bride.
Now, with Nolan standing before her again, she wasted no time feigning innocence. "Blame Eleanor for this mess. Anyway, she's been getting pretty close to the Brooks girl. With their help, replacing one broken vase is nothing-she could probably fill the whole hall with new ones."


Eleanor had always found Emma's shamelessness impressive, but today's performance was a new record.



Without so much as a change in expression, Nolan turned to Eleanor, who had yet to speak a word."Miss Warren, do you really have nothing to say for yourself?"


Situations like this called for evidence, not empty words.


Eleanor held Nolan's gaze, steady and calm. "The exhibition hall is under surveillance. Checking the security footage will clear everything up."


Emma's face drained of color, and she nearly stumbled in panic. Of all things, she had not counted on the security cameras.


Ryland leaned back with a lazy shrug, his tone almost gentle. "I wouldn't be so sure, Miss Warren. This spot's a blind spot. Odds are the cameras didn't catch a thing."



A rush of relief washed over Emma. With no video evidence, she could spin any story she wanted.


Determined to make Eleanor pay, she put on her most curious expression. "Does anyone here know antiques? I'd love to hear what that vase was really worth."



An ensemble of collectors stepped forward,their voices ringing with authority. "Word is, Mr. Gill shelled out $1.5 billion at an auction overseas.Honestly, that vase was supposed to worth even more."



One point five billion. The number hit like a thunderclap. Even for the Brooks family, that kind of cash wasn't just lying around.



With an air of triumph, Emma shot Eleanor a smug look. "Did you catch that? We're talking $1.5 billion.Hope you've got a miracle up your sleeve. If you can't pay, we'll let the police handle you-maybe you'll have better luck behind bars."
While others expected her to crumble, Eleanor stood tall, completely unfazed by the threats.
Nolan watched her, eyes narrowed, silently wondering how she would manage to get out of this.
Jonny, growing more agitated by the second, shifted his weight.
He hated the thought of his ex-wife facing charges,but that sum was outrageous-even for him.
Every eye in the room stayed fixed on Eleanor,waiting for her to break or plead. Instead, she calmly lifted her phone and hit play on a voice recording.
The room filled with Emma's own sneering words."Three years of marriage, and you couldn't even give him a child. Just look at yourself-plain,broke, and worthless. Do you honestly think you can measure up to Lainey?"
Panic flared in Emma's eyes. She lunged for Eleanor's phone, but Nolan stepped in front of her,cutting off her attempt.


With a cold smirk, Nolan turned to Jonny. "Is this how your family raises your sister,Jonny?"


Jonny's jaw tightened as he yanked Emma back and snapped, "Enough, Emma. You've gone too far."


Never in her life had Emma seen Jonny glare at her with so much anger. She shrank behind him,suddenly small and shaken.


Eleanor let the recording play on.


Her own voice rang out. "If you're so worried about children, maybe have Jonny see a doctor. The problem lies with him, not me."


Emma's furious voice followed. "How dare you insult Jonny! I'll teach you a lesson right here!"
###Chapter 10 Jonny, Did You Seriously Just Hit Me
A heavy silence swept over the room as every eye dropped to Jonny's lower body.


Who could have guessed that the mighty Todd Group's CEO would get exposed for bedroom troubles in front of everyone?



A stifled laugh slipped from Ryland before he could help himseIf. "Sorry. That just caught me off guard."


Rage twisted Jonny's features as he clenched his teeth so hard it looked painful. If he had ever imagined Eleanor would humiliate him like this, he would have dealt with her differently from the start.


Once the recording ended, Eleanor slipped her phone back into her pocket. "I trust this clears up the whole antique fiasco. I had nothing to do with it."


Nolan's lips twitched with clear approval. "No question about it."


Ryland chimed in, summing it up with a cheerful tone. "So, Miss Todd was the one who broke the vase. I guess that means Mr. Todd will have to foot the bill for the whole 1.5 billion."


Jonny opened his mouth to protest, but the evidence -and the numbers-were ironclad. There was nothing left to say.


1.5 billion. A price tag like that was enough to make Todd Group's bottom line bleed.


Dread pounded in Jonny's head as he pictured the fallout.


With a polite sweep of his arm, Ryland turned to the crowd. "Well, the matter's settled. No need to hang around here. Go enjoy the rest of the exhibition."


That was all it took for everyone to scatter,grateful for the excuse to leave the tension behind.


Nolan headed toward Eleanor, his gaze sharpening as he noticed a thin smear of blood on her ankle. "Miss Warren, you're bleeding. Don't you think you should look after that?"
Eleanor glanced down and spotted the crimson streak.
She realized it must have been a stray shard from the shattered vase.
The wound wasn't serious, but the blood made it look worse than it was.

"Thanks for pointing it out, Mr. Stewart.I'll handle it soon," she responded.

"There's a first aid kit in the VIP lounge," Nolan offered. "Feel free to use whatever you need."

"Thank you. I appreciateit,"Eleanor said, her tone calm but sincere.

Summer heat always brought worries about infections, especially with an open cut.

Eleanor never liked making a scene. She gave a quick nod and turned to make her way to the VIP lounge. The moment she tried to walk, her knees wobbled,and she lurched forward unexpectedly.


Jonny started to reach out, but someone else was faster.


Nolan's hand shot out, steadying her before she could fall. Noticing the fresh blood staining her ankle,he didn't hesitate-he simply scooped her up in his arms.



His hold was close and unashamed, drawing a low whistle from Ryland.



Nolan pulled something like this right in front of Eleanor's ex-husband-typical of his bold style!


Surprised, Eleanor struggled in his grasp. "Mr.Stewart,please let me down."


"Miss Warren, with an injury like that, walking's out of the question. Besides, no one wants blood spoiling a day like this for Mr. Gill-he's superstitious enough as it is."



Collectors could be a quirky bunch; a drop of blood  on a lucky day might send them spiraling.


Giving in,Eleanor stopped protesting and allowed herself to be carried toward the lounge.


Ryland took the cue and wandered off to handle the cleanup, not wanting to intrude.


Meanwhile, Jonny glared daggers at Nolan's retreating back, jealousy boiling in his eyes.


Emma, not letting up, leaned in and hissed. "Since when did that shameless witch get so close to Mr.Stewart?"



Her bitterness flared. "Mom always said Eleanor was a gold-digger. Now that she's out of our family, she's already leeching onto someone new."


A sudden, sharp slap rang out.


Stunned, Emma reeled, holding her cheek with wide eyes.


"Jonny, did you seriously just hit me?" she gasped,disbelief etched across her face. "You really slapped me just to defend that shameless bitch?"
###Chapter 11| Can Take Care Of It Myself

Jonny stiffened when he heard Emma's words, his face losing its calm.


He turned his eyes away and muttered under his breath, "Cut the act, Emma. Don't stir up drama in front of Mr. Stewart, or you'll drag our family into a disaster we can't handle. Understand?"



This time, the mess Emma created had reached an outrageous one and a half billion. That figure was enough to crush half of the Todd Group overnight.


Emma's jaw tightened as she bit back her anger."Eleanor is a seductress. She flirts-"


Jonny's voice exploded before she could finish."said shut it!"



The sudden rage in his tone made Emma flinch. Her shoulders drew in as tears welled up, spilling over in  helpless sobs.


Jonny's fists curled at his sides, his eyes narrowing on the place where Eleanor and Nolan had vanished.



It made no sense.



Nolan was too influential to waste his attention on Eleanor, who was ordinary, bland, and nothng more than a divorced country woman.



The only reason he stepped in must have been to avoid ruining David's mnood.


That explanation settled in Jonny's mind, giving him a bitter sort of relief.


Jonny yanked Emma by the wrist and steered her into a dim corner. His voice dropped low and sharp as he warned, "Keep your mouth shut tonight, or don't expect a single cent from me next month."


Emma's sobbing stopped in an instant. She blinked at him, stunned by the threat.


In the end, she swallowed her words and stayed silent.



At the same time, Nolan, with Eleanor in his arms,entered the VIP lounge.


Ryland hurried after them with a medical kit tucked against his side.


A curious gleam lit his eyes. He wanted to see more,yet he tried hard not to make it obvious, which gave him a strangely funny air.


The kit was set neatly on the coffee table.


"I'll give you two some space." With that, he darted out of the room.


Eleanor stared at the closed door, uneasy with the way he had phrased it.


Something about his tone didn't sound right.


Before she could dwell on it, a sharp pain jolted through her ankle.


"Ah!" Eleanor let out a sharp breath and immediately glanced down at her ankle.
 <###Chapter 11| Can Take Care Of It Myself        +120 Points at most By the time she noticed, Nolan was already crouched before her, pressing a cotton swab soaked in alcohol gently against the scrape.

The sting faded into a cool rush, soothing the ache while leaving behind a strange tingling sensation.

Focused entirely on his task, Nolan bent his head with quiet concentration.
Light streamed across his face, carving shadows along the edges of his strong profile. Even his lashes flickered faintly with every movement.

He was so close, his features felt almost unreal-striking in a way that made Jonny seem forgettable,unfairly breathtaking, as though he had stepped out of a dream.
For a fleeting second, Eleanor lost herself, her heart skipping out of rhythm.

Without breaking the rhythm of his hands, Nolan lifted his  gaze ever so slightly, catching the way she stared. Enjoying the view?" His words rolled out low and smooth as he teased her in that calm voice of his.
Heat rushed to Eleanor's face, the sudden blush making her feel like she had just been caught misbehaving.
Snapping herself back to the moment, she glanced around nervously, her cheeks still tinged with pink.
She reached out quickly, snatching the cotton swab from his hand to change the subject. "Mr. Stewart,this is nothing serious. I can take care of it myself."
Nolan's eyes narrowed slightly, a faint curve forming at the edge of his mouth.
Instead of arguing, he released his grip and let her handle it.
His stare, however, didn't move away, holding a glimmer of intrigue.
The weight of his attention unsettled her. His presence alone carried a pressure that was hard to ignore Summoning her courage, she finally looked up and asked with uncertainty, "Mr. Stewart, do you really have the time to stand here and watch me?"


After all, the head of Stewart Group wasn't someone expected to linger over such a trivial matter.
###Chapter 12 It Really Was Luck





A quiet laugh slipped from Nolan, his eyes carrying a shadowed depth that gave nothing away.



"Not really. I just happened to see you and got curious about what kind of tricks you'd pull next."



Tricks? The word made Eleanor's hand freeze mid-motion.



When she lifted her gaze, she met his stare head-on,a look so sharp it felt like he could peel away every secret she carried.



Her thoughts veered unexpectedly to that day three years ago, when she had gone head-to-head with him for the Todd Group. By some stroke of luck, she had pulled through, securing the vital Usepsall project.



The memory stirred up a storm inside her. Back then, she had been so naive, burning herself out for Jonny, nearly letting her true identity slip in the process.


Now, the memory almost felt absurd.


After wrestling with the thought, she finally blurted out, "I shouldn't have done that back then. I owe you an apology."


No matter what, she had played her hand with tricks that ended up costing him dearly.


At her words, Nolan's brows lifted ever so slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing his features.


Leaning closer, he closed the gap until his breath brushed the shell of her ear, low and deliberate.


Eleanor's body tensed, and she instinctively tried to pull back, only to realize the sofa behind her left her nowhere to go.


Nolan spoke in a velvet tone, rich with suggestion."An apology's not enough. What I want to know is how you managed to shake the market so badly in one night."


People on the outside saw Eleanor as nothing more than a gentle beauty, someone decorative but harmless.



Yet here she was, a woman who had once crippled Stewart Group's stock with alarming precision.


That was no feat an ordinary socialite could pull off.


His words sent her pulse racing, pounding so hard it felt impossible to hide.



Dropping her gaze, she worked faster with the bandages, eager to finish.



"It really was luck," she muttered. "And if the Usepsall project still interests you, taking it back would be nothing for someone with your abilities.My ties to Jonny are gone, and whatever happens to the Todd Group isn't my concern anymore."



Amusement flickered in Nolan's eyes, and the corner of his mouth curved into a deeper, knowing smile. Nolan shifted casually, stretching out against the sofa as though he owned the space.


"Taking it back?" His tone carried a low amusement,eyes glinting with interest. "I have to admit, the idea is tempting."


There was no mistaking it-this woman was far from the meek figure most assumed her to be.


She hadn't been years ago, and now, after breaking free from her marriage, her edges had only grown sharper.


The challenge only made her more intriguing to him.


He would take back the Usepsall project, that much was certain, but doing so in a way that entertained him sounded far more appealing.


Eleanor had just begun to relax when a polite voice sounded beyond the lounge door.


"Mr. Stewart, the intermission has begun. Mr. Gill requests the presence of all esteemed guests in the exhibition hall." Relief slipped from her in a quiet breath.


There was no denying Nolan's perception-his gaze alone felt like it could strip her of every guarded secret.



If this conversation had gone on much longer, she feared she might have revealed far too much.


"After you, Mr. Stewart," Eleanor said quickly, rising to her feet and making for the door before he could respond.


Her haste betrayed her. Painripped through her ankle, throwing her off balance and sending her body lurching forward.


In the blink of an eye, she would have hit the floor-if not for the sudden grip that caugt her around the waist. Strong arms steadied her, drawing her firmly into a solid embrace.


The clean, woody scent of pine drifted over her,wrapping around her senses as much as his hold did.
###Chapter 13 What's He Like





Eleanor's cheeks flared crimson, the color spreading up to the tips of her ears.


Snapping herself out of it, she pulled back quickly from Nolan's hold, forcing space between them.


The faint trace of his warmth still clung stubbornly to her fingers.


"Thank you, Mr. Stewart. I'll be on my way now."Without waiting for his reply, she turned and rushed out the door.


But the second she crossed the threshold, she collided hard with someone.



"Ouch!" Lillian shouted, rubbing at her forehead before blinking in surprise.


Of all people, it was her best friend.


Eleanor stood there flushed bright red, her eyes darting away, her breath uneven.


Lillian's expression lit up instantly, her curiosity bubbling over.


She hooked an arm around Eleanor's, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Alright, out with it! Who's the guy you've been hiding from me? Don't tell me you've gone and found yourself a new man already. Since when?"



She pressed on, "Give me the details-what's he like? Is he some young heartthrob, or are you chasing after another older one this time? Either way, I get first say. I'm not letting you fall for another disaster like Jonny again."



From behind Eleanor, a tall shadow stretched forward as Nolan stepped into view.



His expression remained unreadable, his eyes gliding past Lillian before locking firmly on Eleanor.



Lillian's mischievous grin froze midair, then began to crumble piece by piece. She blinked hard, her mind racing	
Impossible!	
How on earth had Eleanor ended up tangled with Nolan of all people?
And judging by the tension in the air, it wasn't just casual-they looked like two people caught in the middle of something... something way too intimate.
When had Eleanor's taste taken such a dramatic turn?
Nolan was the kind of man whose face alone could send a room spinning into chaos.

Yet Ryland had sworn to her that Nolan was the coldest, most untouchable man in Elepdon-someone who wore bachelorhood like armor and had zero patience for romance.

Nolan was supposed to be like a star one admired from afar, dazzling and unreachable.

No, this couldn't be happening. Eleanor had just escaped one disaster of a marriage -the last thing she needed was to get caught up with another man who spelled nothing but trouble.



Meanwhile, Eleanor desperately searched for a way to shut down Lillian's runaway imagination before it could spill from her mouth.


Eleanor waved her hands frantically, desperate to explain that nothing had happened. Whatever Lillian thought she saw, her relationship with Nolan was perfectly innocent.


But the panic in Eleanor's eyes only deepened Lillian's suspicions.


Before Lillian could launch into another round of questioning, Eleanor grabbed her hand and tugged her away in haste. "Lillian, it's late already. We need to get to the exhibit hall before Mr. Gill starts wondering where we are."


Nearly stumbling, Lillian allowed herself to be dragged along. Behind them, Nolan stayed exactly where he was,lips curling into the faintest amused smile.



This sly woman-every time she shed another layer of that careful disguise, she revealed something far more intriguing.



The exhibit hall was already buzzing, the excitement lingering long after David's appearance.


When the crowd finally began to scatter, Lillian seized her chance and circled right back to the topic she refused to drop.


"Eleanor, quit dodging. Confess and I'll go easy on you. Deny it and I'll drag it out of you. You and Mr.Stewart, locked in a room, and you came out blushing red like a schoolgirl? Don't tell me the two of you were just talking," Lillian said.


Eleanor's head spun under the assault of questions,her thoughts scrambling for a way out.



How was she supposed to explain that Nolan had simply helped treat her wound? Or that when she stumbled, he caught her to keep her from falling?


She knew better. Any honest explanation would only fuel Lillian's wild imagination-and turn a harmless moment into a story far more scandalous.
###Chapter 14 And If You Lose

While Eleanor struggled to find the right words, a neatly dressed staff member approached.
"Ms. Brooks, Mr. Brooks is waiting for you just ahead.Please come with me," the staff member said as he bowed to Lillian.
Lillian clicked her tongue in irritation, muttering under her breath, "Out of all moments, Ryland chooses now to appear. He really knows how to ruin the fun."
Her complaints aside, she trailed after the staff member without further fuss.
Eleanor exhaled deeply, a wave of relief washing over her.
Finally,silence.
With her mind settling, she turned her full attention to the gallery, taking the time to study the pieces carefully.


Her steps slowed as her gaze fell upon a painting titled Roses in Bloom by Rafael Turner.


Rafael, the most celebrated court painter of the last century, was known for works so rare they were deemed priceless.


The painting's composition certainly held alure,yet something about the canvas didn't sit right.


Eleanor's brows knitted as she flagged down a nearby staff member. "This piece seems suspicious.You should notify Mr. Gill immediately and have it taken down."



She couldn't allow David's exhibition to be tarnished by even a hint of forgery.


The staff member's expression darkened at her words. "Madam, that kind of accusation is reckless.Every itemdisplayed here has been authenticated."


Though he recognized her connection to Nolan, that didn't mean he would tolerate anyone questioning David's collection-or worse, making trouble.


Eleanor parted her lips to explain, but a derisive voice cut her off.



"An orphan like you dares to question an ancient masterpiece? Please. You're only here to cause a scene!" The voice, dripping with venom, belonged to Emma.



She had slipped away the moment Jonny's attention faltered, and by chance, she stumbled straight into this confrontation.



With a sneer, she shifted her glare to the staff member. "And you call this security? How can you let someone like her even set foot inside? What kind of standards does this gallery have?"


Earlier, Eleanor had made a fool of her. Now, Emma saw her chance to return the humiliation.


The staff member, already leaning against Eleanor,found courage in Emma's words. His hand shot out,aiming to seize her arm. Eleanor's gaze turned icy as she slid back a step,cool and measured.



His grip caught nothing but air. Overreaching, the man stumbled forward, nearly losing his balance in front of everyone.



Emma's expression twisted in disgust.



Pathetic.



He couldn't even handle one woman.



Emma wasn't about to waste the chance handed to her.



She lifted her chin and raised her voice so the crowd could hear. "Look at you-living off my brother-and now you dare to disrupt Mr. Gill's exhibition? Do you even realize who Mr. Gill is? And yet you've got the nerve to call his painting a forgery!"



Her sharp tone drew immediate attention, heads turning from every direction.



"That lady can't be serious. She's far too young to make such bold accusations."


"This is a joint show hosted by David Gill and Dyer Curtis. Everything here has been verified-there's no way an error slipped through."


"Pretty face, sure... but probably just some bored socialite desperate for attention."




···


The voices reached Eleanor, her brow twitching with irritation.



Emma really was hopeless. To spar with someone that foolish would only drag her down.


Eleanor decided she wasn't worth the breath.



The crowd was already watching, so backing down wasn't an option. If this was a stage, then Eleanor would decide how the play unfolded.


Her eyes turned cold as she fixed them on Emma's smug expression. "Emma, since you're so certain of yourself, why don't we settle this with a bet?" The sudden challenge made Emma falter.


What game was this woman playing?


Where did she find such nerve?


Could she really know something?


No. Impossible.


An orphan with no pedigree couldn't possibly understand antiques, much less paintings of this caliber.


This had to be a bluff-some desperate trick to scare her.


And besides, this was David and Dyer's exhibition.No chance anything here was fake.


Convinced of her own reasoning, Emma lifted her chin proudly. "A bet it is! Do you think I'm scared? If you lose, you'll apologize publicly-three times-and leave this gallery for good!"


She wanted nothing more than to see Eleanor humiliated, driven out with her reputation in ruins. But Eleanor's composure didn't crack. Her voice was cool and steady as she retorted, "And if you lose?"
###Chapter 15 You've Just Sealed Your Fate,Eleanor
Emma blinked at Eleanor's comeback, caught off guard for just a moment.
Lose? The idea seemed absurd. But with so many eyes on her, retreat wasn't an option.
Grinding her teeth, she puffed herself up and announced loudly, "Fine! If I lose, I'll apologize to you in front of everyone. And more than that-I'll cover the cost of every guest's minor purchases tonight. All of them, on me!"
Gasps rippled through the onlookers, their eyes gleaming with sudden interest.
Each individual purchase might have been capped at a hundred thousand, but taken together, the total could easily skyrocket into a staggering sum. The Todd girl was indeed rolling in money. Eleanor arched a brow, amused by Emma's recklessness. With the faintest smirk tugging at her lips, she answered coolly, "Deal."


Wasting no time, she motioned toward the staff member who had argued with her earlier.


"Open the case," she instructed.


The man hesitated only briefly before producing a key and unlocking the display. If Emma was willing to shoulder the consequences, why should he be the one to worry?


From her bag, Eleanor took out a pair of immaculate silk gloves, slipping them on with practiced ease.


After sliding the gloves snugly onto her hands,Eleanor reached into the display case with deliberate care, lifting Roses in Bloom under the unblinking stares of the onlookers.


She took a closer look at the painting, and a faint crease formed between her brows.


Her suspicion deepened-it wasn't linen canvas. To confirm, she took off one of her gloves and touched the canvas.


A wave of gasps broke through the hall. Was she insane? Who dared touch a Rafael Turner piece so boldly?


Emma's jaw dropped at first, but her shock quickly twisted into smug delight. "You've just sealed your fate, Eleanor," she sneered. "That painting is worth $2 billion. You couldn't afford it. And don't even think about crawling to Jonny for help. Our family doesn't bankroll fools who overreach."


Eleanor didn't flinch. Her gaze cut to Emma for a brief moment before sweeping past her to address the watching crowd.


"You might want to reconsider your words," Eleanor said evenly. "Anyone familiar with Rafael Turner knows he swore by linen canvas. The line canvas is famous for its strength and ability to withstand wear and tear. Its smooth surface allows for detailed brushwork. But this piece? The surface is rough, the weave loose. It's definitely not linen canvas."  The audience instinctively leaned closer, eyes narrowing to study the canvas for themselves.


Sure enough, the surface looked coarse.


Everyone knew-even the most celebrated painters-reserved linen canvas for their creations.


The thought of Rafael, a man of such stature, using cheap canvas for a masterpiece was laughable.


Emma's smug expression faltered as she caught the murmurs, but she quickly forced herself into composure.


"Perhaps Rafael was struck with sudden inspiration,"she insisted, lifting her chin. "Maybe he grabbed whatever canvas was within reach. Genius doesn't wait for perfect tools."



Eleanor gave Emma a look so dismissive it was as if she were humoring a child. Then, with calm authority she addressed the crowd instead.



"Historical records show that Rafael's wife adored green roses, and he painted countless masterpieces  of them for her. Yet look closely: this work depicts a red rose. More importantly, see the date inscribed in the corner? According to every biography, Rafael's wife had already passed away by then. He was so consumed with grief that he never painted roses again. He laid down his brush forever."


At her words, the crowd surged closer, necks straining to catch a glimpse of the small inscription in the corner.



Those standing nearest squinted, then straightened in shock.



"She's right-it's there!"


"The date doesn't line up at all!"
 
###Chapter 16 Do You Have No Dignity At All
Emma's stomach dropped, panic flickering in her eyes.



How could this be happening?



The piece had been authenticated by multiple experts-it couldn't be a forgery!


Shoving aside anyone in her way, she stormed toward Eleanor, her voice rising. "You must have stolen the real one! Otherwise, how would you know the exact details and call them out so quickly?"



But before her accusation could land, a booming laugh rolled across the gallery. "That's quite the sharp eye you've got, Eleanor!"


Every head turned toward the sound. Standing a short distance away was David himself, a broad smile stretching across his face. With a hand stroking his beard, he regarded Eleanor with playful admiration. "Truth be told, I've grown tired of the usual, predictable exhibitions. So l planted this forgery as a little test-a bit of fun for tonight.I never imagined you'd spot it so quickly."


His revelation sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.


So this had been David's doing all along.


Given his reputation for being unpredictable and eccentric, perhaps it wasn't so surprising he would stage such a stunt.


The audience accepted David's words without hesitation, nodding along as if the matter was settled.



But Dyer wasn't about to let David enjoy the spotlight alone. He scoffed loudly, his tone laced with mockery. "Hah! Just admit it, old man-you got duped by a forgery and now you're scrambling for a cover story. Lucky for you, Eleanor's got a sharper eye than you. Imagine if a buyer had spotted it after the sale-your so-called reputation would've gone up in smoke!"



David's face flushed crimson, his beard practically bristling in outrage. "You decrepit relic! You've got one foot in the grave and still wag that venomous tongue!"


Then, in a sudden shift, he turned to Eleanor with an exaggerated pout, almost childlike. "Eleanor, you saw it-this wrinkled fraud is smearing my name. You'd better stand up for me!"


Dyer bristled in return, jabbing a finger in David's direction. "Don't let that old goat fool you, Eleanor!He's as stubborn as a mule and never admits when he's beaten!"



Eleanor couldn't help the small smile tugging at her lips as she watched the two of them bicker like quarrelsome schoolboys rather than the venerable masters they were.


Some things about her teachers, she realized, would never change. Meanwhile, the spectators were left reeling.


The sight was baffling-two of the most legendary figures in the antiques world, sparring so familiarly with each other, and all while treating Eleanor with such casual warmth.


From the way they addressed her, it was obvious this connection ran deep.


Emma stood frozen, her mind reeling.


How could someone like Eleanor-a woman with nothing but an orphanage to her name-possibly be on such familiar terms with Dyer and David, two titans whose word alone could shift the antiques world?



Even her family struggled to get an audience with them.Unless...


Her eyes suddenly widened as the thought struck her. She jabbed a finger at Eleanor, spitting venom.


"You shameless slut! My brother just tossed you aside, and now you're already crawling into Mr. Gill's bed? Do you have no dignity at all?" Emma said.
A heavy silence swallowed the room.
Gasps rippled through the crowd-Emma really dared to say such a thing?
Everyone here knew the truth: David and Dyer weren't just respected; they were living legends in the antiques circle, men revered like walking archives of history.
To throw mud at David so brazenly... was Emma fearless, or simply brainless?
Eleanor lifted her chin, her gaze slicing through Emma with quiet contempt. "Emma, you never fail to prove just how stupid you are."
The insult hit, and Emma snapped. "Who are you calling stupid?" she yelled, face flushed with outrage.
But Eleanor didn't give her the satisfaction of a pause.Her lips curled faintly as she added, "Perhaps you've forgotten-our little wager from earlier still stands, doesn't it?"
###Chapter 17 Finish What You Started
Emma dropped her gaze, her lips pressed tight.


The thought of bowing her head to Eleanor-an orphan raised in obscurity-burned hotter than fire.


She was from the influential Todd family. If she actually apologized in front of this crowd, her reputation in the socialite circle would be obliterated.


Death itself felt kinder.


Her thoughts spun wildly, scrambling for escape.Then, in a sudden act of desperation, her knees buckled and she let herself collapse backward.



But Eleanor had seen it coming. She shifted a single step aside, and let Emma fall without interference.


Her body smacked the cold marble floor.


Gasps broke through the silence. The crowd stared,stunned by the spectacle. Eleanor's lashes lowered, her eyes cool as she took in Emma's trembling lashes and the faint, deliberate flutter of breath. A smirk tugged at her lips-such a cheap little trick, so predictable it was almost boring.


Turning to the staff member frozen nearby, she spoke evenly, her tone edged with authority. "Emma was quite clear earlier-she promised to cover every minor expense for today's gala. Don't just stand there. Start drafting the invoices. Our guests shouldn't have to wait on the Todd family's generosity."


The staff member, rattled by the string of commotions, didn't dare delay another second.


"Right away, ma'am!" he replied, hurrying off to begin tallying invoices.


Several minor families, who had scraped their way into the event through favors and connections,could hardly contain their excitement. They darted eagerly toward the displays, searching for pieces priced under a hundred thousand, grinning as if they had just struck gold. Meanwhile, Emma lay sprawled on the icy marble,feigning her swoon. But Eleanor's pointed words cut so deep she nearly fainted for real.


Her fists clenched so hard that her nails pierced her own skin, sharp pain barely containing the rage boiling inside her.


This bitch!



How dared Eleanor humiliate her like this in front of everyone?


She would make sure Eleanor paid dearly-she would see to it that Eleanor's life turned into a waking nightmare.


From the crowd, Jonny's conflicted eyes lingered on Eleanor.



Bathed in the glow of the chandeliers, she stood poised and serene, her calm elegance radiating like light itself. Her presence drew every gaze,leaving onlookers momentarily breathless.


When had she become this striking? No-"striking" wasn't even the right word. It was something more,something intangible, an aura that couldn't be denied.



Jonny's chest tightened. Was this truly the same Eleanor who once cowered, docile and submissive under his shadow?



And how in the world had she learned to analyze ancient paintings with such precision?



Impossible.



She had grown up in obscurity, without access to teachers or resources.


Convincing himself, Jonny scoffed inwardly. This must have been nothing more than blind luck-an accidental flash of insight.


That had to be it. Clinging to that thought, he forced himself to relax.



Across the hall, Nolan's eyes followed Eleanor with quiet intensity. His lips curved faintly, the ghost o a smirk tugging at them.



This woman-such a sly little thing.


When she played at innocence, she looked soft,almost harmless. But the moment her real edge surfaced, she became something else entirely-clever, sharp, almost dangerous.


The contrast only made her more compelling.


As if she had sensed his gaze, Eleanor's eyes shifted toward Nolan and collided directly with his.


For an instant, the world seemed to still. Her pulse stumbled, beating wildly as though it might burst through her chest.


Heat crept into her cheeks, and she tore her gaze away, flustered, as if his stare had stripped her bare in front of everyone.



One look from him carried a weight that made breathing difficult. The fleeting moment passed, swallowed by the hum of the exhibition.


Soon after, the event wound to a smooth close without further incident.


Later, in the quiet of the VIP lounge, Nolan pressed his fingers to his temples, his eyes narrowing slightly as he shifted his focus to Ryland. "Have you found anything on the Soul Surgeon?"


Ryland's brow tightened, his expression shadowed by unease.


"I ran a covert sweep," he responded slowly. "On the surface, nothing stands out. But..."


His words faltered, caught between caution and duty.


Nolan tilted his head, his gaze steady, his tone calm yet carrying command. "Finish what you started."
###Chapter 18 Your Sister's Condition Has Deteriorated

Ryland leaned back with a teasing grin. "Aside from Miss Warren dazzling everyone today... Tell me,Nolan,are you actually interested in her?"
Nolan's eyes snapped to him, cold and cutting, a look sharp enough to silence the room.
The grin slid right off Ryland's face. He rubbed his nose awkwardly, realizing he had gone too far.
He hadn't asked out of malice.
Eleanor might be lovely, yes, but she was still a divorced woman. The Stewarts were a dynasty, and someone like her slipping into their world sounded impossible.
Nolan was his oldest friend, and he couldn't help but worry Nolan would get dragged into something messy. But under that piercing stare, his throat tightened,and his courage drained away. He raised both hands in surrender. "Alright, I'll shut up. Forget | said anything. I'll head out before you freeze me to death."


With that, he bolted for the door, retreating like a man who had just escaped an execution.


The room had barely settled into silence when the door opened again, and Erick Wright, Nolan's assistant, entered briskly. His face was grave, his tone clipped.


"Mr.Stewart, news just came from the hospital. Your sister's condition has deteriorated. None of the prescribed treatments are working anymore," Erick said.



Nolan's hand clenched around the coffee cup, the quiet crack of pressure filling the room. "I don't care what it costs-track down the Soul Surgeon and force an entry into the Underground Network."


He lowered the cup onto the table, lids closing for a fleeting moment. When his eyes opened again, they were cold steel. "And another thing-tell the hospital to pull every string, use the finest medication, the best equipment. Fannie must be watched every second. If they fail her...they might as well burn their doors shut."



The weight of his words made Erick's spine lock tight, a sheen of cold sweat breaking across his brow."Yes,Mr.Stewart. I'll see to it immediately."


At the Todd family's villa, Emma burst through the doors like a storm.



Her designer bag crashed onto the sofa, and she practically shook with rage.


That bitch Eleanor!


She had shamed her in public, cost her a fortune,and made her a laughingstock!


And worst of all, Jonny had defended that tramp! Did he actually fall for her? Impossible!


Emma's thoughts shifted furiously. Lainey. Yes, she  needed Lainey.


Together, they could crush Eleanor before she wormed her way any further into their world. She couldn't-she wouldn't-let Eleanor win.


Just as Emma was about to storm upstairs, the front door opened and a familiar silhouette stepped inside.


"Lainey!" Emma rushed forward, her voice shrill with grievance."You won't believe what happened today.That wretched Eleanor-she humiliated me in front of everyone! And Jonny-he actually hit me because of her! He's never laid a hand on me before!"


At Emma's words, Lainey's eyes glimmered, though her hands tightened into fists behind her back where no one could see.



Of course, she knew about David's antique exhibition. It was the grand event of the season, the kind of gathering where connections were forged and reputations polished.


Naturally, she had thought Jonny would escort her-  after all, she wNas supposed to be his girlfriend now.


But the phone never rang.


Instead, whispers drifted through the city, then a ruckus at the Todd family's villa drew her here.


And once again, the root of the chaos was Eleanor.


That bitch was like a ghost that refused to stay buried-an orphan from nowhere daring to stand tall in David's hall, even managing to shake both Jonny and Emma.


Beneath the surface, Lainey's resentment twisted sharper, but on her lips bloomed a gentle, practiced smile. "Emma, you've really been wronged tonight."


Lainey reached out, patting Emma's hand with practiced tenderness as she guided her back into the villa. "Jonny lived with Eleanor for three years, Emma.Old habits don't vanish overnight."



Emma's face twisted with frustration. "Lainey, you're too soft! What's so special about that cunt anyway?First she bewitched Grandma, and now even Jonny  looks like he's under her spell!"


Her voice cracked with fury as she stamped her foot against the floor, the sound echoing through the hall. ###Chapter 19 We Should End This





While Emma and Lainey spoke, footsteps echoed from the foyer.


Jonny walked in, shoulders heavy with fatigue, his tie loosened and expression drained.



The instant Emma caught sight of him, she gave a loud, indignant huff, spun on her heel, and stormed upstairs without so much as a glance back.



Lainey forced her envy down, smoothing her features into softness as she stepped toward him. "Jonny...you're back."


His eyes lifted, hazy and distracted, and for a fleeting moment, Eleanor's smile seemed to flash across Lainey's face.



Damn it. He clenched his jaw, shaking his head sharply. Was he losing his mind, imagining that woman in front of him? "Lainey." His voice was clipped, dismissive. "It's late.I'll have the driver take you home."


The words cut clean, leaving no room for argument.


Her practiced smile faltered, the corners trembling before she forced them back into place.


Her nails dug into her palms. Since when had Jonny ever turned her away like this?


Emma's accusation earlier rang in her ears-was Jonny really falling for Eleanor?



Impossible. That woman had nothing-no pedigree,no power,no status.


And yet...what if he was?


No. She couldn't sit idly by and risk losing everything.





Men's affections were fickle.



What lasted was control-wealth, power, security.


That was what she had to seize, now more than ever. Tears suddenly wwelled in Lainey's eyes as she slipped her hand from his. Her voice trembled,though her words were measured. "Jonny... it's alright. I don't need the driver. I only came tonight to say goodbye."



Turning on her heel, she let her shoulders quiver faintly, the image of a woman too choked with grief to explain herself any further.


The haze in Jonny's mind shattered instantly. Panic cut through his exhaustion, and he stepped forward,his chest tightening. "Lainey, what's going on? Tell me."



Slowly, she pivoted back, catching his gaze at the precise moment his worry peaked.



Her eyes clung to him with deliberate sorrow, heavy with reluctant affection. "Jonny... we should end this.My family can't afford to wait any longer. Our business has been struggling, and my father's alreadly speaking with a foreign partner. He wants me to marry into their family." Her voice broke at the edges, yet her delivery was flawless. "I'm sorry. I can't disobey my father... or turn my back on my family."


Jonny froze, then unraveled.



He seized her with both arms, clutching her as though sheer force could bind her to him forever."No, Lainey. Don't say that. We've fought too hard to be together. I won't lose you now."


To him, she was perfection itself-the woman he had longed for, the one he believed he couldn't live without. Letting her go felt impossible.


In that desperation, a reckless promise burst from him. "The Usepsall project is vast, Lainey. Tomorrow,I'll transfer forty percent of the distribution rights directly into your hands. Once you control that share,your father won't dare pressure you again. For the Todd Group's sake, he'll have no choice but to support us."



A flicker of triumph sparked in her eyes before she quickly dimmed it, replacing victory with feigned doubt. "Jonny...are you sure you can do that?"


He gripped her hand with fierce conviction. "I'd give you everything if it meant keeping you by my side.Nothing-no one-will come between us this time."


Her expression melted into relief, a delicate smile breaking through her tears. She buried herself against his chest, voice trembling with delight."Jonny...I knew you wouldn't fail me. I knew you were the only one who truly cared."


Eleanor had wasted three long years wearing the title of Jonny's wife, and what did she walk away with?Nothing but scraps and humiliation.


Lainey smirked to herself. She wouldn't be that foolish. A little sweetness here, a touch of vulnerability there, and Jonny was already placing the world at her feet.


The desired seat of Jonny's wife? That was hers for the taking. And when the time was right, the entire Todd Group would follow. 
###Chapter 20 Add This Site Too





It seemed Lainey's mention of splitting up had touched a raw nerve.


The following morning, Jonny arrived at the company with Laineyand immediately called the executives together.


"From this moment on, Lainey Gilbert is my secretary. She'll oversee every decision concerning the Usepsall project. Her words carry the same weight as mine. Clear?" Jonny declared.


The executives nodded in unison without hesitation."Understood, Mr. Todd."


After all, everyone knew Lainey was the one Jonny treasured most.


No one would dare slight her.


Once he saw everything settled, Jonny lightly touched the top of Lainey's head. "I've got a meeting to attend, so I'll head out. Someone will take you around the company in the meantime. There's a new restaurant nearby everyone's talking about. I'll bring you there for lunch."



Lainey lowered her gaze with a bashful smile and murmured,"Okay, Jonny."


Jonny had clearly fallen under her charm.


Even if her position came through personal ties,Jonny's influence guaranteed that every executive showed Lainey the highest respect.


Allard Moss, the head of Planning Department,promptly handed her a file. "Lainey, these are the proposed demolition sites for the Usepsall project.Take a look. If everything checks out, I'll pass them along to the shareholders."



Lainey accepted the folder and skimmed through the pages without much thought.


But as she was about to shut it, her eyes froze on two words: "Hope House."


Wasn't that the orphanage where Eleanor had grown up?


Before coming back to the country, Lainey had already done her research.


The idea crossed her mind, and she pointed carelessly. "Add this site too. It's close to Ravenswood River, and riverside housing could be developed there."


Allard traced her gesture and frowned in disapproval.


He knew the location carried almost no commercial worth, and tearing it down would be nothing but trouble.



"Lainey, about this site-"


Before he finished, Lainey cut him off. "Allard, are you forgetting what Jonny said?"


Her voice sounded calm, but there was an edge in it that warned him not to push further. Allard didn't dare argue. He nodded quickly and bent slightly. "Yes, I'll handle it right away."


As he rushed off, Lainey's smile grew wider.


She wondered if Eleanor would appreciate the little "gift" she had prepared. Compete with her? How foolish.



Once the document arrived at Stewart Group, Erick intercepted it without delay.


He hurried it straight to the president's office. "Mr.Stewart, the Todd Group has just released their Usepsall project plan."


Nolan leaned back in his leather chair,barely glancing up at the words. "Put it down."


His fingers drummed a steady rhythm against the desk. "Anything from the Underground Network?"


Erick set the file on the desk where it belonged,but he didn't move away.


"Nothing yet." He hesitated before adding,"Mr. Stewart, one of the proposed sites in Todd Group's plan is the Hope House. Should I-"


Nolan stopped tapping and slowly turned his head toward him.



He reached for the folder and studied it with sharp focus.


Three years earlier, Stewart Group had invested heavily in the Usepsall project, only for Eleanor to snatch it away at the final stage.


Nolan hadn't pulled his money back, choosing instead to use it as a way to measure Eleanor's ability.


But Eleanor was shrewd, rarely leaving any weak points.


Now that Hope House was listed for demolition, he was eager to see how she would handle it.


With that thought, he placed the document back on the desk, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "Get in touch with Eleanor. Remind her she still owes me a favor from the last exhibition."
###Chapter 21 Pull Out Every Bit Of Our Investment
Erick caught the faint curve of a smile tugging at Nolan's lips.



He kept hearing Ryland's whispers in the back of his mind, unable to shake them off.


Was it possible? Could it be that the unshakable Nolan was actually falling in love? Snapping back to reality,Erick quickly responded, "I'm on it, sir."


By chance, the place chosen for their meeting happened to be a newly opened restaurant Jonny had mentioned.



The refined sign above the entrance caught Eleanor's eye, leaving her puzzled.


Why would Nolan invite her without warning?


Still, she remembered how he had rescued her from  embarrassment at David's exhibition.



Since she owed him for that,paying the debt felt only fair.


Holding onto that reminder, she straightened herself and stepped inside.


Nolan was waiting by the window when she entered the restaurant.



He wore a plain white shirt with the sleeves loosely rolled, and there was a quiet elegance about him that stood apart from the lively chaos surrounding him.


She approached with quiet poise. "Mr. Stewart, with everything on your schedule, you still find time to have me here for this meal?"



Her voice drew Nolan's gaze upward, his eyes carrying a flicker of interest.


A subtle, unreadable smile formed as his dark eyes lingered on her.


Erick received a brief glance from him, one loaded with unspoken meaning.


Catching the signal, Erick pulled a file from his briefcase and presented it with formal respect.



Curious, Eleanor extended her hand and opened the file.



Her face immediately clouded over.



Hope House?



Why would Todd Group target such a place?



The land was isolated and held little commercial promise,while relocation costs would be staggering.



Jonny would never come up with something this shortsighted.



She understood Jonny better than anyone.


To Jonny, nothing mattered more than money and prestige.


Tearing down an orphanage offered no real gain, only the risk of branding him as cruel and merciless. That very morning, Todd Group's internal networks exploded with chatter: Lainey had appeared out of nowhere, installed as Jonny's personal secretary, and placed in charge of the entire Usepsall project.


There was no doubt that Lainey had been the one behind this!


Still, what puzzled her was Nolan's effort to make sure she knew.


With that thought pressing her, Eleanor asked him outright.


Nolan's fingers slid idly along the edge of his glass,his tone calm and smooth. "I simply value our connection, Miss Warren. And if you require assistance..."



Before he could continue, Eleanor snapped the folder shut, interrupting him. "I appreciate it, Mr. Stewart,but I'll have to refuse your offer."


After all, every businessman had his own motives.


It was impossible for her to accept that Nolan's  motives were purely generous.


Hearing her answer, Nolan made no attempt to argue.


Setting his glass aside, he drummed his fingers on the table and spoke in a measured tone. "You've been informed, Miss Warren. Handle it however you like. It's getting late-I'll head out now."


He got up from his seat and made his way out without another word.



Following after him, Erick could hardly hide his confusion.


All that trouble for a quick conversation with Eleanor -was that really the point?


After they exited the restaurant, Nolan handed down more orders. "Assign someone to watch her. Tell me the moment she makes a move. And for the Todd Group-pull out every bit of our investment."


Erick could foresee the fallout the Todd Group was about to face. "Understood,Mr.Stewart." Out of everyone they could have challenged,the Todd Group chose the very person who had caught Nolan's attention. It was clear their days of standing strong were numbered.
###Chapter 22 Why Don't You Ask Your Girlfriend,Jonny

When Nolan and Erick disappeared, Eleanor took her time standing up.
She wandered toward the restaurant entrance, only to find herself face to face with a figure she recognized all too well.
Jonny, of all people.
Could this day get any worse?
Ugh.Why did it have to be him here of all places?
He had already spotted Nolan's car outside, but seeingEleanor now sent a wave of old resentment crashing over him.
His jaw tightened, and his voice was harsh. "What's wrong, Eleanor? Still upset your payout wasn't big enough? Honestly, you waste no time moving on. Shameless,as always."


Eleanor roller her eyes, and fixed him with a flat stare. "Jonny, we're divorced."


The message came across loud and clear. It was none of his concern!


She stepped forward, deliberately closing the distance, her gaze cutting past him to settle on Lainey. Then she glanced back with a sly grin. "You know, Jonny, I never imagined you'd do something like that. Tearing down an orphanage? Looks like you've lost more than your sense of decency this time."



Confusion clouded his features. "What are you talking about?"


WVith a laugh that was anything but friendly, Eleanor shook her head and brushed by him.


Just as she passed, she let her words linger in the air."Why don't you ask your girlfriend, Jonny? Maybe she'll clear things up for you." Eleanor didn't wait for a response. She slid into her car, started the engine, and left him in the dust.


Frustration boiling over, Jonny turned and kicked the flower bed, muttering curses under his breath.


He wracked his brain. Since when was an orphanage part of the Usepsall project? Was Eleanor just making things up?


He shot Lainey a look, ready to demand answers,but his phone buzzed with an urgent call.


"Mr. Todd, there's a problem! Stewart Group has just pulled its investment!"


Jonny nearly dropped his phone. "Come again? What did you just say?"


A shaky voice spilled through the phone. "They called our whole leadership incompetent. They're saying we greenlit tearing down an orphanage.They think we're heartless and out of our depth."


Jonny clenched his phone so hard it nearly snapped in two. Stewart Group's money was the backbone of the entire Usepsall deal. If they backed out now,every cent spent would be gone for good.


"Who in their right mind slipped an orphanage into the demolition list?" Jonny snapped.


Allard could feel Jonny's anger even through the line,and fear gripped him completely.


"l-it was Lainey, Mr. Todd. You once told me that whatever she said came directly from you, so I didn't have the courage to oppose her!" Allard replied.


Jonny turned on Lainey in a flash, grabbing the front of her shirt.



With red-rimmed eyes, he glared at her. "I put my trust in you, Lainey, and this is what you do? I get that you have issues with Eleanor, but risking the company's future-was that worth it?"


Lainey never imagined that the Stewart Group would respond with such intensity.


She always thought the orphanage was just one  possible site, nothing anyone would lose sleep over.


That reasoning stayed locked away, though.


Tears pricked the corners of her eyes as she clung to Jonny's sleeve, her voice a soft whimper. "Jonny,I swear I had no idea the orphanage mattered to Miss Warren. It's right by the Ravenswood River, and building villas there seemed like smart business. I'm so sorry. If I've put you in a tough spot, I'll step down and take the blame."


Her words faded into a hush. She looked small and broken.



A wave of regret crashed over Jonny.


How could Lainey have known about Eleanor's ties to the place?


Lainey was sweet,never the scheming type.


Maybe his own stress made him lash out.


Remorse showed plainly on his face as he drew her into his arms, murmuring an apology. "I lost my head, Lainey. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I'm just under a lot of pressure."



Lainey let herself be held, peeking up at him with a gentle, forgiving smile. "It's okay, Jonny. I understand how hard things are for you."
###Chapter 23 You'll Pay Dearly For It





Neither Jonny nor Lainey had the stomach to sit down for a meal after what had happened.


Once Jonny dropped Lainey at her place, he drove straight back to the company on his own.


Allard had been pacing near the doors, nerves stretched tight. The moment Jonny appeared, he rushed forward. "Mr. Todd, it's bad. Word's out that the Stewart Group has pulled their investment. The shareholders are packed into the conference room,and they're demanding answers from you right now!"


Frustration flared across Jonny's face.



Those self-serving old men had enjoyed their steady dividends for years without complaint, and now, at the first sign of trouble, they wanted blood.



He swore that once new investments were secured,he would throw every last one of them out. He swallowed his temper and moved toward the elevator, forcing himself to stay composed.


Allard trailed him with a heavy sigh, unable to stop comparing the past to the present.


Back when Eleanor was in charge, the board never dared to act like this.


Since Lainey's arrival, however, chaos had followed at every turn.


When they reached the top floor, Jonny shoved the conference room doors open with a violent kick.


A hush swept through the shareholders. Unease flickered in their eyes.



Was Jonny about to take the fight directly to them?


Colby Rayne, leaning heavily on his cane, stepped to the front with a glare that cut across the room. "The Stewart Group has pulled out, and word is it happened because of Lainey. Don't you think we're owed an explanation,Jonny?" That single accusation broke the restraint of the others.


"That's right! Without Stewart Group, the Usepsall project is finished!"


"Why would you let someone so inexperienced take such a critical role? Lainey is nothing compared to Eleanor. Bring Eleanor back before everything collapses!"



Heat surged through Jonny's temples, and he clenched his jaw so tight it hurt.


Eleanor might have been reliable in the past, but she was stuck in the old ways.


Lainey, at least, had the courage to act, even if she had stumbled this time.


"Shut it! All of you!" Jonny's voice cracked like a whip. "You think you can talk big now, but when the site reports were sent out, not one of you bothered to lift a finger. And the moment things go wrong,you dump the blame on me? On Lainey?" He swept his gaze through the crowd. "Tell me-are you defending Eleanor out of loyalty, or because she was keeping you warm in your beds?"


The venom in Jonny's voice left the room reeling.



Dark expressions swept across the faces of the shareholders.



With a man like him steering the ship, collapse seemed inevitable.



None of them were related to Lainey-why should they shoulder the fallout of her mistakes?



And with nearly half the decision-making power in her hands, what chance did anyone have of stopping her?



Colby slammed the end of his cane against the polished floor, a bitter laugh escaping him. "Forget Lainey for a moment. But Eleanor? How dare you drag her name through the dirt? She graduated at the top of her class with two degrees-finance and clinical medicine-from Northbridge University. Without her work, the Todd Group wouldn't even exist today."


Locking eyes with Jonny, he continued, "Jonny,gratitude matters. If you keep throwing away gold for scraps, mark my words-you'll pay dearly for it."


Spinning on his heel, he stormed out of the room,his cane striking hard with every step.


The remaining shareholders filed out in silence,muttering under their breath, some shaking their heads, others sighing in disgust.


What had once been a room buzzing with voices and clashing opinions now echoed with nothing but emptiness.


Jonny dropped heavily into the chair, his thoughts spinning out of control.


Eleanor... from Northbridge University? With two degrees, no less? The claim sounded absurd.


Northbridge was one of the most elite schooIs in the country, and its graduates were often snatched up  with offers worth millions.


How could Eleanor, an orphan with nothing to her name,possibly measure up to that standard?


Questions clawed at him. When had she ever been involved in the company?


In his memory, she had been tied to the house-washing clothes, cooking meals, caring for his grandmother. She had hardly stepped foot into the office. So how had Colby twisted reality into believing she was the secret force behind Todd Group's rise?



The longer he mulled it over, the sharper the crease on his forehead grew.
###Chapter 24 Lainey Should Live Here With You
From the shadows of the room, Allard stepped forward with hesitation. "Mr. Todd, you've never paid much attention to Eleanor, so it makes sense you wouldn't know. The truth is, your grandmother arranged all of this behind the scenes. Over the years, Eleanor has given everything to this company,and we've all seen the effort she put in."


Upon hearing this, Jonny almost laughed.


To him,Eeanor wasn't some tireless worker.


She was an opportunist chasing money and recognition.


She built herself on lies. What real skill could she possibly offer?


The company would survive just fine without her. Driven by that thought, Jonny fixed his gaze on Allard. "Get me in front of the Stewart Group's investment manager. I'll handle the negotiations myself."


"Right away, Mr. Todd!" Allard hurried out, but not long after, he returned with his head low and shoulders heavy. "Sir, they refused to budge. No matter what I said, they wouldn't reconsider. I don't think there's any chance left."



Fury surged through Jonny as his fists tightened.


If the Stewart Group wanted to pull out, so be it. He would secure another investor.


The Usepsall project was a treasure waiting to be claimed, and he refused to believe there wasn't another company eager to profit from it.


Allard was waved off with little concern, and Jonny strode back into his office.


Every effort he made to salvage the situation ended the same way. He humbled himself, reached out to one firm after another, yet not a single company dared to back him.



Each response carried the same excuse-they couldn't afford to offend the Stewart Group.


Defeat pressed down on him as he collapsed onto the sofa, his temples throbbing with anger.


For years, the Todd Group had run smoothly, and it always seemed to trace back to the time he married Eleanor.



Could it really have been her doing all along?


The very idea made him scoff.


No way.


Eleanor was nothing more than a plain, uninspiring wife. What did she know about running a corporation?


It had to be pure luck, nothing more.


Agitated, Jonny yanked at his tie, then stormed out to head home. The moment he stepped through the door,Lainey appeared in his path. "Why are you here?" he asked,his tone sharp.


Even though he understood she had acted with good intentions, Jonny couldn't forget the humiliation he had suffered that day. The memory still stung, and his words came out sharper than he meant.


Clutching her dress tightly, Lainey wondered if his coldness was because of Eleanor.



Men,she thought bitterly, could never be trusted.


Luckily, she had already laid the groundwork. Vickie knew of her desire to move in and eventually marry Jonny.



Once she secured her place as his wife, the Todd fortune would naturally fall into her hands.


Then she wouldn't need to bend over backwards to keep him happy.


She put on a sorrowful expression for Vickie's benefit. "Vickie, it feels like Jonny doesn't want me here.I should go and visit you another day."


She made a move to walk away.


Jonny hadn't told her to leave, and confusion flickered across his face. Just as he opened his mouth,Vickie cut him off.


"Jonny, you're exhausted from carrying the company every day. You deserve someone gentle and considerate by your side," she said warmly. "Lainey should live here with you. You're still young, and it's only natural to build your feelings together."


Her smile broadened, pride in her tone."You wasted three years shackled to that thankless country woman Eleanor.Now that she's out of the picture, it's time to give Lainey the place she deserves. I'll speak to her father tomorrow and finalize your wedding date."



The Gilbert family couldn't compare to the Todds in power, but Lainey had grown up under Vickie's watchful eye. Her beauty and her gentle manner pleased Vickie, who had already decided she was the  right woman for Jonny.


Emma, brimming with excitement, clasped Lainey's hand. "This is wonderful! You're finally going to be my sister-in-law. I've been waiting for this forever!"


Emma had despised Eleanor from the beginning,and in her mind Lainey was the perfect fit for her brother.


Jonny's gaze shifted from his mother to his sister,then landed on Lainey. Something gnawed at him.


Was she deliberately pressing for marriage?


That didn't sound like her.


She was supposed to be gentle, sincere, incapable of scheming.


She must really care for him if she wanted to stay by his side.


As he was reassured by the thought, his voice lost its edge. "Lainey, forgive me. I've been on edge with work, and I didn't mean to sound harsh. I'm glad you're here. Moving in is fine, but the wedding will  have to wait. The company demands too much of me right now."


Patience had always been Lainey's strength.


Sliding her arm around his, she leaned against him with a soft smile. "Jonny, you don't need to apologize. I'm the one who's been selfish, bothering you when you're exhausted."


Her tenderness chipped away at his defenses.


He drew her into his arms and brushed a kiss against her hair. "You're amazing, Lainey."


From the corner of the room, Vickie and Emma exchanged knowing glances before quietly slipping away to their bedrooms.


The moment Lainey settled into the Todd household,Eleanor would be nothing but a memory. The thought filled them with quiet satisfaction.
###Chapter 25 | thought you'd left us behind
Word of the Stewart Group pulling their investment from the Todd Group didn't reach Eleanor until days later, when Lillian's text appeared on her screen.


Scanning the message, Eleanor arched a brow.


Without Stewart Group's money, the Todd Group would be strapped for cash, and that meant the orphanage would no longer be under threat.


Could Nolan have had a hand in this? Always meddling, always forcing her to feel indebted.


She hated the idea of owing him anything.


Control was something she preferred to keep in her own hands


Determined, she scrolled through her contacts until her finger hovered over a number she hadn't called in  years. This time, she hit dial. The line connected in seconds.
On the other end, a choked voice burst out with emotion. "Boss! You're finally reaching out! It's been three years-I thought you'd left us behind."
That voice belonged to someone she knew all too well.
A faint smile touched her lips, but her words were clipped and direct. "I need you to secure a piece of land in Elepdon. It doesn't matter if it's remote, as long as it's quiet and nowhere near the Usepsall project. Then set up a company in Vladena under the trademark Enigma. The paperwork will list you as the legal representative. My name must stay completely off the records."
One instruction after another spilled from her lips,and the person on the line was so overwhelmed with excitement that their voice shook. "Boss, are you back in the game? That's incredible! For three years I've been forced to sell your designs to other firms, and every time it felt like betrayal. Now we can finally rise again."
The moment she ended the call, Eleanor let out a quiet breath of relief.
Securing land meant she could shield the orphanage from future threats.
For now, Nolan's interference had bought her time,but she knew Lainey wouldn't stop scheming.
Once the land was in her hands, the orphanage could be moved whenever needed, safe from the shadow of the Usepsall project.
The funding for construction would flow directly from Enigma,giving the children a stable future.
Better stil, all traces of the plan would lead back to her apprentice, keeping her own name safely hidden.It was the perfect move.
Compared to that, Lainey's shallow games looked like the tantrums of a child. Only a fool like Jonny would put Lainey on a pedestal and call her priceless.


And as if her thoughts had conjured him,her phone lit up with his name.


Ugh.


Why couldn't Jonny just leave her alone?


With an annoyed swipe, Eleanor accepted the call."Spit it out. What are you bothering me for this time?"


Hearing her voice sent a thrill racing through Jonny.To him, it was proof that she still couldn't resist him.No matter how coldly she tried to cut him off,one call from him and she came running.


That smugness bled into his words. "Eleanor,Lainey's already living with me now, so stop dreaming about being my wife. But if you swallow your pride and come back, I'll still take you in."


Maybe it was because Lainey was too simple-minded, but ever since she moved in, the house felt like a circus.


Eleanor, raised in an orphanage, had been better at managing the homne.


Lainey was easygoing, though. She wouldn't make a fuss about sharing.


The idea of juggling two women at once thrilled Jonny, and his voice grew more animated. "I can tell you still want me. If you play nice, I might even think about giving you a child. Doesn't that sound good?"


Eleanor nearly gagged.


What on earth was wrong with him?


Had Lainey's nonsense rubbed off on him?


The words were so vile they made her skin crawl.


She opened her mouth to speak, but Jonny beat her to it. "Lumina Hotel. Room 888. Meet me there,and we'll straighten things out. If you show up, I'lI even pretend your little affair never happened."


The thought of Eleanor with another man made his blood boil.


She might have been his ex-wife, but in his mind,she still belonged to him.


Every word dripped with entitlement, and Eleanor caught the hidden meaning instantly. Her thumb hovered over the hang-up button, but instead of ending the call, she shifted course.


"Fine," she replied flatly, and without giving him the chance to reply, she disconnected.


If Jonny wanted to make her sick, she would gladly return the favor.


Amused by the idea, she fired off a quick message to her apprentice. "Lumina Hotel. Room 888. Give my ex-husband a surprise he won't forget."


In a twisted way, it was almost an act of kindness.At least, Jonny would have his physical needs  satisfied.
###Chapter 26 You Shouldn't Stay Up For Me Tonight
Jonny had no clue about the surprise Eleanor was preparing for him.


He reached for the suit jacket draped neatly on the chair, then rose to his feet to leave.


Noticing his movements, Lainey quickly pushed herself up from the sofa. "Jonny, where are you off to?"



A slight pause followed before Jonny spoke with a perfectly straight face. "Something urgent came up at the office. I have to go back and deal with it. You shouldn't stay up for me tonight."


The idea of an emergency that required him to stay out all night didn't make sense.


Suspicion flickered in Lainey's eyes, and she was ready to confront him, but he slipped out the door  before she could say anything.


Sinking down onto the sofa, she absentmindedly twisted the hem of her shirt between her fingers.A feeling of unease settled over her.


Jonny never behaved this way. Unless...


As soon as that possibility crept into her mind,Lainey's fingernails pressed hard into her palms.


She could not let that be true. If it was, she might just kill him herself. There was no way she was letting go of the Todd legacy.


Thirty minutes ticked by before Jonny arrived outside Room 888 at the Lumina Hotel.



A rush of excitement buzzed through him from head to toe.



That image of Eleanor from the club, lookingSO inviting, stayed vivid in his thoughts.


Three years had passed, and he had almost lost control more than once. Now, Jonny actually wished  he hadn't held back all this time.



Tonight, nothing would stop him from finally having what he wanted with her.



Thinking about it, Jonny could hardly keep his cool while pushing open the hotel room door.


A faint shape could be seen on the bed. Curves and bare skin were outlined by the thin, suggestive fabric she wore.



Jonny couldn't help feeling amazed that someone he thought was so boring could turn out to be this bold.


Missing out for three years really stung now that he saw what she had to offer.


He moved closer, only for an unusual, thick perfume to catch him off guard.



It took less than a minute before his head started spinning and the world around him became a blur.


Sounds turned fuzzy, and he barely recognized a voice speaking nearby.  Coherent thought quickly faded, leaving him overwhelmed by instinct and want.


Sunrise found Jonny waking with a sense of satisfaction.


The sheets next to him were cold, and Eleanor was nowhere to be found.


Puzzled, Jonny wondered what kind of stunt she was pulling now.


Flashes of last night flickered in his mind, and though everything felt cloudy, he remembered having a great time.


If this was her new tactic, he figured he might keep her around for a while, at least until he grew tired of her and could toss her aside without a second thought.


Right then, his phone buzzed unexpectedly with a new message.


As he tapped the screen, Jonny's hand shook so badly he almost dropped the phone. Confusion  swept over him. Since when had he ended up in bed with a lifelike doll?


Still reeling, he stared at the screen as another message appeared. "How do you like my surprise,dear ex-husband?"


He froze in disbelief. Could it be that Eleanor had never been there last night, and he had actually spent the night with a realistic doll?


The truth hit Jonny, and panic scattered his thoughts.


He lurched out of bed, grabbed the phone, and called the front desk. "Show me last night's hallway footage from outside Room 888.Right away."


"Of course, Mr. Todd."


Authority had its perks. Jonny might not control the whole city, but as CEO, his requests always got top priority at the Lumina Hotel.


Only a few minutes passed before the footage arrived in his inbox.  Jonny scrolled quickly, his nerves fraying as he scanned every second. There was no sign of Eleanor anywhere.


Instead, what he saw was a cleaner with a covered cart, entering before he ever showed up.


That had to be when the doll was delivered.


Embarrassment and fury boiled inside Jonny.


He cursed Eleanor for tricking him so easily, and the possibility of leaked photos made his skin crawl.


As the CEO of Todd Group, he could never live this down if the story got out.


Gripping his phone so tightly his knuckles turned white, Jonny could hardly contain his rage.


He hammered out a message. "Eleanor, erase every picture. Come here now, or you'll regret crossing me!"



He then sent it.


An angry red exclamation mark flashed on the screen  a moment later.


Fury almost made him snap his phone in half.


Had she really blocked him?


For three years, that woman had chased after him,and now she shut him out completely?


Admitting the truth to himself, Jonny knew he felt rattled.



Yet what he did not realize was that things could,and would,get even worse.


Nothing he had experienced so far compared to the humiliation waiting for him next.
###Chapter 27 You Should Keep Your Distance
No one in Elepdon's high society held as much influence as Nolan. His network of contacts stretched wider than anyone else's.



Only a few minutes after Jonny watched the security video,one of Nolan's sources brought him the news.


Impressed and amused, Nolan considered how bold the move had been.


Pulling off such a stunt took real nerve.


Jonny must be out of his mind if he still planned to chase after Eleanor.



Clearly,Jonny needed to be taught a lesson.


Nolan gave a quiet order. "Tell the shareholders to put the squeeze on Jonny. We need to keep him busy." By doing this, Nolan ensured Jonny would be too occupied to bother Eleanor anymore.


"Understood, Mr. Stewart," Erick repliedright away before stepping out.


Left by himself, Nolan quickly sent Eleanor a message, curiosity clear in his tone. "That was quite a spectacle. I enjoyed every minute."


Meanwhile, Eleanor sat at the bar, staring at the message with mixed feelings.


Nolan's reputation for gathering secrets was no exaggeration.


Still, he seemed to have far too much time on his hands.



Why was he so invested in her life?


Was this interest personal, or did he have another motive?


She was inclined to believe the latter.


She wasn't narcissistic. A handful of encounters with Nolan hardly counted as anything meaningful between them.


No matter how she thought about it, Eleanor saw nothing in herself that would catch Nolan's attention.


The whole thing was a puzzle.


Curiosity got the best of Lillian when she noticed Eleanor staring off into space.


Glancing at the screen, Lillian let out a dramatic gasp. "Since when did you and Mr. Stewart getSO close? Girl, you're playing with fire. That's not a man you want to get involved with!"


Without wanting to leave her friend confused,Eleanor went ahead and explained what Jonny had pulled off.


Every word made Lillian angrier, her cheeks flushed bright red as she slammed her foot down on the little table in front of them.



"What a dirtbag! How can people like him keep popping up? Why does he always have to mess up your peace?" Lillian seethed.


A long sigh followed her outburst, but then Lillian's eyes grew wide with a new realization. "Hold up. How did Nolan get the scoop so fast? Don't tell me he's been tracking your every move!"


Worry crept into her voice. "That's a scary thought,Eleanor! Never mind how handsome Nolan is or how everyone calls him the catch of the city. You should keep your distance. People say he can't... you know."


That reputation for keeping to himself? In Lillian's mind, it was just his way of hiding his so-called problem.


As the last word left her lips, Lillian gave it an extra flourish,and Eleanor nearly spit out her drink.


Eleanor could not believe that rumor.



If anything, Nolan never struck her as someone with that kind of secret.


Before Lillian could launch into another rant, Eleanor chimed in, "Calm down. There's nothing going on between me and him. We've hardly talked at all. He probably just stumbled on something and decided to send that message."


The words finally got Lillian to quiet down, but the more she mulled it over, the weirder the situation seemed.



No explanation made sense.


Why would someone as busy as Nolan, a man at the top of Elepdon's business world, waste time poking into Eleanor's affairs?


As questions piled up in her mind, Lillian glanced at Eleanor's steady face and bit her tongue.


Best to let it go.


If she kept asking, maybe Eleanor would start thinking about Nolan for real.


Absolutely not!


It would be wiser if nothing was said about it.


Men only caused headaches anyway! Still, Lillian was never one to keep her worries bottled up.


Later, once she got home, she let it all out to Ryland.


Since Ryland and Nolan were friends, maybe he could step in.


Ryland noticed the frustration written all over Lillian's face and gave her a gentle pat on the head. "That's enough. Stop fussing. Nolan's choices aren't for us to question. If he does have a crush on your friend,there's really nothing we can do."


He added, "With the difference in their social standing, even if they did like each other, being together would be nearly impossible."


Lillian's temper flared. "Hold on, what's that supposed to mean? You obviously don't know Eleanor.She's..."



She was Enigma!


Her mouth snapped shut just before she blurted out too much, determined not to reveal Eleanor's secret. She pressed her teeth against her lip in defiance."Regardless of what you think, Eleanor is wonderful,and you have no right to speak of her that way. Tell Nolan he had better forget about entertaining any thoughts of Eleanor."


If Nolan truly ended up with Eleanor, wouldn't that mean she would be trapped in a lifetime of loneliness beside a man who could never satisfy her? The thought alone felt unbearably cruel.


Ryland picked up on his sister's stubbornness right away and raised his hands in defeat. "Alright, alright,your friend is the best. Satisfied? I've got things to take care of, so I'm out of here."


With those words, he hurried off.


Arguing with women was always a losing game.


If he couldn't win the battle, he might as well make a quick retreat!
###Chapter 28 Make Her Stay!





Jonny didn't see his problem as serious, but the irritation it caused was undeniable.


He had waited for days, expecting Eleanor to eventually cave.


Given their past, he was even prepared to let everything slide if she simply returned to the Todd household and resumed her role there.


But no matter how much time passed, she stayed silent.


Another message was sent, and once again the only reply was that mocking little exclamation mark.


Fury burned hot enough that he nearly hurled his phone across the room, when suddenly the ringtone shattered the quiet.


Hope surged instantly. He convinced himself Eleanor had finally come around, that she was ready to apologize and plead with him.


Snatching up the phone, he answered without hesitation. "Eleanor? Finally realized your mistake?Well, it's too late for regrets now. I'm warning you-be ready for me tonight. Wash up and wait, or you can forget about me forgiving you."


A pause lingered on the line, heavy with hesitation.


At last, Allard's guarded voice broke through. "Mr.Todd, it's me. Mr. Rayne and the other shareholders... they're all talking about pulling out their investments. What should we do?"


Jonny shot up from the sofa, rage flaring like fire.


Damn it!



Those decrepit cowards!


They actually had the nerve to bring up withdrawing now?



He would love to see how they thought they would survive without the Todd Group backing them.


The company was already listed, the road ahead nothing but clear skies.


If they were foolish enough to walk away, they would only be throwing away effortless pofits.


Unless they had all gone mad, they would be crawling back before long.



Jonny snatched a jacket with a storm cloud hanging over his face and made straight for the door.


The moment he yanked it open, he nearly collided with Lainey, who stepped out from the kitchen.


"Jonny, I made this soup for you. I've been working on it all afternoon. Will you please taste it?" Her hands trembled slightly as she offered the bowl, her eyes searching his.



One glance at her only deepened his irritation.


If not for her, would the company be staring down this disaster? Since moving in, she had been more of a nuisance than anything-poking into his schedule, meddling where she didn't belong.


He was long past tired of it.


He started to push past her, but then he caught the shimmer of tears forming in her eyes.


For a second, he faltered.


She had been the woman he once swore he loved.


Maybe he could humor her,just this once.


With clear reluctance, Jonny reached out and accepted the bowl.


The heat seeped into his palms, and the fragrance rising from it was at least tolerable.


He blew across the surface, then forced down a cautious sip.


The taste hit him like a slap.


Greasy and flat-there wasn't a hint of seasoning, not even the faintest flavor to mask the mess.


It felt as though Lainey had dumped unwashed ingredients straight into boiling water and called it soup.


The memory of Eleanor's soups-rich, fragrant, and layered with care-only made this concoction seem even more pitiful.


Drained of patience, Jonny let his frustration spill out. "From now on, leave the cooking to the servants.You've already stirred up enough trouble. The shareholders are restless because of you, and I've got bigger things to handle."


Without another glance, he brushed past her and stepped out the door.


Never before had his words to her cut this deep.


Lainey's eyes blurred with tears as she turned toward Vickie in the living room. Her voice cracked as she sobbed, "Vickie, it's my fault... I shouldn't even be here.Maybe I should just leave." Her shoulders trembled, her whole figure carrying the weight of grievance.


Vickie, caught off guard by Jonny's sudden cruelty,sat frozen.



She couldn't reconcile this coldness with her son who had once doted on Lainey. Could it be...he had already set his sights on someone new?


Before Vickie could sort out her thoughts, Emma shot up from the sofa in alarm.



Emma said, "Lainey, you can't leave! If you walk away now, that shameless Eleanor will swoop right back in to steal Jonny!"



Turning to Vickie, she said, "Mom, say something-make her stay!"



The moment Eleanor's name was spoken, Vickie's hesitation vanished.



To her, Eleanor was a stain that clung no matter how hard she tried to wash it away. Compared to that nuisance, Lainey seemed far more acceptable.



Vickie hurried forward and clasped Lainey's hand.Her voice softened as she muttered,"DDon't let Jonny's temper scare you. He's just stressed from work, that's all. He doesn't mean to be cruel. You've got me on your side, so stay here and be at ease.Once the company calms down, you and Jonny can finaly marry."



A flicker of satisfaction flashed across Lainey's eyes,though she quickly masked it beneath a meek expression.



She lowered her head and leaned against Vickie with a practiced gentleness. "Vickie, you're too good to me. When I marry into this family, I'Il devote myself to treating you with respect and care."


She knew well enough how men were-always chasing the new while neglecting the old.


But with Vickie in her corner, she had nothing to fear.The title of Jonny's wife was already within her grasp.
###Chapter 29 The Plan Is Workable.


Jonny stepped into the Todd Group headquarters looking worn down, his jaw shadowed with unshaven stubble.

Several sleepless nights had left him drained, dark circles etched heavily beneath his eyes.

HHis suit jacket hung limply over one arm, his tie was nowhere to be seen, and the open collar of his shirt made his entire appearance seem ragged and burdened.

Employees trickling out after work caught sight of him and quickly lowered their heads, slipping past in silence as though afraid of provoking his temper.

Rather than head straight to the conference room, Jonny made his way into his private office.

He sank heavily into the leather chair, eyes shutting in helpless frustration.

"Allard, how's the assignment I gave you coming along?" he asked without opening them.

The rejection from the Stewart Group and several other major firms had forced Jonny to shift to a different approach.

This time, his strategy was to draw smaller companies into the fold.

Though these firms could contribute only limited amounts, mere tens of millions each, together their backing might be enough to breathe life into the Usepsall project.

By offering them attractive incentives, the Todd Group could still make the deal worthwhile.

Allard, waiting patiently at his side, responded quickly, "Mr. Todd, the plan is workable. More than ten small firms have already expressed interest. Still, the terms of cooperation will need your approval. I've arranged for you to meet with them tomorrow at three o'clock at the Lumina Hotel."

At last, Jonny reacted. His bloodshot eyes opened slowly, and he gave a weary nod of acknowledgment.

Finally, a sliver of good news had arrived. As long as money kept moving, the Todd Group still had a chance to survive.

Jonny was just beginning to ease his tension when he caught sight of Allard lingering with an uneasy look.

"What is it? Out with it," Jonny insisted.

At the sharp prompt, Allard's shoulders stiffened.

He cleared his throat, struggling to line up his words before speaking.

The issue could have been trivial, but his gut told him it was anything but.

Mustering his nerve, he delivered the message. "Enigma's assistant announced this morning that they're preparing to establish a firm named Enigma Group in Vladena and have already begun reaching out for bids."

The meaning was clear-those smaller investment firms might turn away from the Todd Group and throw their support behind Enigma Group instead.

A deep frown carved across Jonny's face.

Enigma? The name sparked a vague memory, tied to whispers of an elusive figure in the design world.

Within the industry, Enigma's reputation ranked at the very top, yet nobody knew whether this talent was man or woman,young or old.

The only detail anyone knew about this designer was the name-Enigma.

Once a year, without fail, Enigma released exactly ten designs. They were fixed drafts, never revised or altered.

Their distinct style and visionary concepts turned each piece into a masterpiece, drawing in fashion elites around the globe who were willing to pay staggering prices.

But hadn't Enigma only been selling design sketches these last three years? Why suddenly take the leap into forming a company?

Even so, Jonny felt little concern.

Exceptional talent in design did not mean the same in business.

A brand-new enterprise could hardly compare to the Todd Group, which was already listed.

Besides, he had given enough incentives in the Usepsall project.

Unless those company leaders had taken leave of their senses, they would know where their best choice lay.

With that thought, the darkness clouding his expression lifted. He gave Allard a brisk directive. "Clear out those old men in the conference room. Tell them funding is already secured. If they want to dump their shares or back out, let them. They can't use that to pressure me. And if they want to stay on as shareholders of the Todd Group, they'd better fall in line." Though unease twisted in his gut, Allard bowed quickly. "Understood, Mr. Todd."
###Chapter 30 Should We Consider Investing


The unrest shaking Jonny's shareholders hadn't happened naturally-it had been carefully seeded by Nolan working behind the curtain.

In the end, whether those shares were dumped or held tightly, the choice was Nolan's to make.

His long fingers drummed lightly on the table before he turned to Erick and spoke in a low command."Buy out half of the shareholders. Leave the rest where they are. I'll need them to keep making noise inside the Todd Group."

Chaos within the company was a weapon he intended to use again.

And there was the personal angle-Jonny had once been Eleanor's husband.

That tie alone guaranteed Nolan would never truly let Jonny walk free of his shadlow.

How far the storm went would depend entirely on Jonny's own moves. If he kept blundering, he would be digging his own grave.

Once Erick left to handle the task, Nolan did what he always did-he reached for his phone and sent Eleanor a message. "I may have a gift for you soon."

The power to flip control of the Todd Group like it was nothing more than a chess piece-that was a gift with real weight.

If Jonny ever dared to push Eleanor past her limit, Nolan would hand those very shares to her without a second thought.

Of course, he didn't put any of that in writing.

Mystery was part of his armor, and he wore it well.

On the other end, Eleanor stared at the message, puzzled by its meaning. Her pen stilled on the page, and she absently pressed the tip against her lip.

Nolan, she decided, had far too much time on his hands, and with that thought dismissed, she bent over her sketch again.

With the launch of Enigma Group so close, she needed designs that could turn heads and pull in investors.

Without those funds, making a bold move would be impossible.

So what mattered now? The work in front of her, not some man.

By the next day, Nolan still hadn't received a reply from Eleanor.

Yet irritation never crossed his face.

Patience, after all, was part of the game. In time, he would succeed in peeling back every layer of Eleanor until her true self was laid bare.

The very idea tugged a smile to his lips, one he struggled to suppress.

Ryland, standing nearby, shuddered. "Nolan, for God's sake, stop smiling like that. It's creepy!"

Seeing a man with a reputation for cold indifference suddenly wearing a tender smile was enough to send chills down anyone's spine.

Nolan shot Ryland a cold look. "Too much free time? I've got a project in some remote corner of the map you might want to handle..."

"Hold it, stop right there!" Ryland cut inimmediately, waving his hands. "I was only joking!"

Nolan's words made his scalp prickle.

Who in their right mind would want to work in some remote corner of the map?

Certainly not the CEO of Brooks Group.

Only Nolan kept insisting those far-flung sites were worth attention, trying to rope him into going.

No chance-he wasn't taking the bait. "Actually, I just remembered I've got urgent business," Ryland blurted, backing toward the door. "I'll leave you to your smiling. Enjoy."

As Ryland slipped out, Erick returned and stopped before Nolan. "Mr. Stewart, everything's been taken care of. But there's one matter that needs your decision. Enigma Group in Vladena has just sent us their proposal.Should we consider investing?"

The Stewart Group's investment team was known for its precision and skill.

Ordinarily, no project reached Nolan's desk until it had gone through their full evaluation.

But Enigma Group wasn't an ordinary case. Its reputation alone gave it weight.

The risk was clear-by the time the usual assessments were finished, Enigma Group might no longer need outside capital.

Letting such a profitable opportunity slip away would be a mistake Stewart Group couldn't afford.

On top of that, Enigma Group stood as a direct rival to the Todd Group.

If Stewart Group poured money into Enigma Group, the announcement itself could shake Todd Group's foundation before the real fight even began.

Erick leaned on that final point, making sure it landed.

Nolan's gaze sharpened, a faint gleam of amusement breaking through his cool exterior. "Invest. And don't stop there-secure the position of largest shareholder."

He wanted to see if Jonny would have the strength left to keep pestering Eleanor once the tide turned.

And with that, Eleanor would end up owing him another debt-whether she realized it or not.
###Chapter 31| Just Live Off Allowances
With Stewart Group backing them and their own prestige already established, it was almost inevitable that investors would pour into Enigma Group.
Barely two days later, the company made headlines with a bold announcement-its grand launch would include exclusive counters opening in three major cities.
When opening day arrived, Vladena practically overflowed with socialites and celebrities who had flown in from everywhere, joined by a handful of international stars.

This was, after all, Enigma's stage to shine.
For the elite in attendance, even catching the company's attention meant securing access to their coveted designs.
And to be seen in an Enigma gown was a guarantee of success-spotlights would follow them without effort.Naturally, any star who could clear their schedule was present.

But to everyone's surprise, the mysterious Enigma was absent from the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Across town, in a private room of an upscale club in Vladena, Lillian scrolled lazily through the coverage on her tablet. Her playful eyes flicked up and landed on Eleanor, who sat sipping coffee as if none of it concerned her.

Leaning closer with a grin, Lillian teased,"Imagine if they found out the real Enigma was sitting right here.Do you think they'd storm the club just to catch a glimpse of you?"
Typical Lillian-always joking,always stirring.
Eleanor didn't bother with a reply. Instead, she plucked a slice of watermelon from the plate and neatly popped it into Lillian's talkative mouth.
Lillian, her cheeks bulging with watermelon, let out a muffled laugh before dropping back onto the sofa. "Eleanor, I heard ever since the Stewart Group invested, investors have been pulling out of Todd Group and pouring their money into Enigma Group instead. Even some of Todd's oldest shareholders jumped ship. Can you imagine Jonny's face when he found out?"
Eleanor lifted her cup with calm fingers, blew gently across the surface, and answered without a flicker of emotion, "Probably. He's always been far too arrogant for his own good."
That kind of response was exactly what Lillian had expected.
Eleanor didn't care about Todd Group anymore.
The thought of it made Lillian snicker, her eyes shining with mischief. "It's hilarious, really. If Jonny ever realizes that you're Enigma, he'll lose his mind!"

Lose his mind was putting it lightly-he would tear himself apart with regret.
Todd Group was crumbling. Projects were stalled, cash flow was drying up, and their stock price was in free fall.

Bankruptcy was circling closer every day.
To Lillian, it was nothing less than poetic justice for the way he had tossed Eleanor aside.
Eleanor only tilted her lips into the faintest smile, offering no reply.
Their eyes met and they shared a quiet understanding. They raised their cups in a soft, unspoken toast.

After a few sips, Lillian suddenly set her glass down with a sharp clap, smacked her forehead, and bounced to her feet.
"Wait a second, Eleanor-that's not fair at all! Starting a company sounds like the most fun in the world, and you didn't even invite me?" She took a quick step closer, casped her hands together with exaggerated pleading, and blinked up at her.,tell me honestly-do I have any chance of becoming a shareholder in your company now?"
Eleanor arched a brow, clearly entertained by Lillian's dramatics.tiny company is suddenly worthy of your grand interest?" Lillian flopped back into her seat, but this time her voice lost its playful lilt, carrying a thread of sincerity. "Of course it is. My brother's the one running Brooks Group. I just live off allowances. I've always dreamed of having something of my own... but, well-"

Business had never been her strength.

She had tried more than once to start something, but every effort ended in collapse, leaving her with nothing but the reputation of a carefree socialite.

Unlike her, Eleanor's career only seemed to climb higher.

And with Lillian speaking so openly, Eleanor saw no reason to push her away. A small smile touched her lips."Fine, fine. Consider it done."
###Chapter 32 We Are Enemies!
Inside Todd Group's office, Jonny glared down at the empty investor list Allard had delivered.
Rage boiled over, and in one violent sweep Jonny sent everything on his desk crashing to the floor.
"That damn Enigma! From this day on, we are enemies!"
His fury only grew as his thoughts spiraled.
Those spineless investors-switching sides at the last second.
All because of Enigma.
How could they value some faceless designer above Todd Group's legacy?
The very idea was absurd!
Jonny's chest rose and fell in uneven bursts, his face darkening as his fists clenched so hard the sound of his bones straining filled the office.
Was the entire world plotting against him?
No-he would never accept that.
He would not lose. Not like this.

In a sudden motion, he turned to Allard, his eyes wild with resolve. "Send word immediately-we're willing to give up half of the agency rights for the Usepsall project. Anyone serious about negotiating can come to the table."
It was a desperate gamble, but he convinced himself it was enough. With bait like that, someone had to bite.The Usepsall project was hailed as one of Elepdon's brightest prospects in years. Even a fragment of it could raise a modest company to the level of a public listing. With bait that tempting, investors were bound to circle.

"But..." Allard hesitated, his words dragging before he forced them out. "You already promised forty percent of the agency rights to Lainey..."

Jonny's voice sliced through the air before he could finish. "Take it back."

Nothing outweighed the survival of Todd Group. Not even Lainey. He would smooth things over with her later, one way or another.

Allard, sensing the finality in his tone, gave a quick nod.

Jonny's personal matters weren't his concern.

All he wanted was for Todd Group to endure a little longer-long enough for him to reach retirement without disaster looming over his head.

The situation looked grim.

At the current pace, Todd Group might not survive another six months.

What value did the Usepsall project hold if the company collapsed before it bore fruit?

Without Eleanor, the fall of Todd Group felt inevitable.

Lainey brought nothing to the table, and Jonny himself was stumbling blindly. The sharpest directors had already cashed out their shares and walked away.

Allard could only sigh-better to take things one day at a time.

Even with a sliver of hope, Jonny's mood stayed dark.

He slumped into his chair, pressing his fingers to his temples as if he could knead away the pressure building in his skull.

In his haze, he caught the faint sight of steam rising from a bowl of soup placed neatly on the desk.

In front of it, Eleanor's face appeared, her usually steady eyes soft wvith quiet admiration. Jonny blinked hard, straining to see her more clearly.
But in the next instant, both the bowl and Eleanor's figure vanished like smoke, leaving only the empty desk.What was wrong with him? Why did Eleanor keep invading his thoughts when he least expected it?
With a harsh shake of his head, Jonny tried to drive her image away, as though erasing her could steady him again.
Still,Colby's words echoed like a curse he couldn't silence.
Was it possible Todd Group truly couldn't survive without Eleanor?
The thought sounded ridiculous.
And yet, he couldn't deny the truth. When she was by his side, no matter what storm hit the company, they had always managed to pull through at the last possible moment.
With Eleanor's steady hand, the company stayed afloat, and his personal life ran like clockwork. Everything was in order, leaving him free of worry.
A knot tightened in his chest, strange and unwelcome.
Enough,he told himself-there was no use dwelling on the past.
The only thing that mattered now was shoring up the company.
Once that was done, he could go to Eleanor.
She had adored him for years, lowering herself time and again.
She wouldn't simply turn cold overnight.
He only needed to reach out, tosoften his tone, to make amends.
Eleanor's anger now? He dismissed it as jealousy. Of course she would be upset-he was living with Lainey.
But wasn't that proof of how much she still cared? He convinced himself it would take little more than gentle coaxing to draw Eleanor back.
###Chapter 33 Hope House Will Always Be Your Home


Had Eleanor been able to hear Jonny's thoughts, her hand would have flown across his face without a second's hesitation.

Such bloated self-importance was enough to make anyone sick.

Right now, Eleanor's heart was set only on the orphanage, leaving no room for any news about Jonny.

Hope House stood in the heart of the old district, its walls chipped and faded, yet steeped in the kind of memories time could never erase.

Eleanor knew every creak of its doors, every worn step on the stone path. She pushed her way inside, her arms laden with bags filled with fruit and toys.

The moment her figure appeared, a wave of excited voices broke out. Small feet pounded against the floor as the children rushed toward her like a tide:

"Eleanor,you came back!"

"Eleanor, what surprises did you bring us today?"

"Are we playing puzzles again? You promised last time!"

She crouched down with a smile, her hand reaching out to ruffle their little heads one by one. "Of course l will."

Her words sent them squealing with delight. In an instant, they scattered, eager to dig out the puzzles and games they had prepared for her return.

From inside the building, the sound of laughter drew out the old director. Myah Sutton stepped into the doorway,her weathered face softening. "You've come home, my dear."

Her voice wrapped around Eleanor like a thread, tugging her straight back into the tender days of her own childhood. For as long as Eleanor could remember, Myah had been a steady presence in her life-the gentlest soul in a world that had often felt unkind.
Marriage had never been part of Myah's story, and though her hair had long since turned silver, she chose to remain at Hope House, devoting her days to the children who needed her most.
In Eleanor's heart, this selfless woman had long ago taken the place of a mother.
Hope House wasn't just a shelter-it was where her memories began, the only place she truly called home.
Swallowing the lump rising in her throat, Eleanor forced her lips intoa bright smile as she stepped closer."Yes, I've come back."
Myah opened her arms and pulled her into a gentle embrace, her voice tender and steady. "These past three years must have been hard on you. But listen to me-whenever the world feels heavy, you come back here.Hope House will always be your home."

From the moment Eleanor was little, her maturity had cut deep into Myah's heart, a child far too sensible for her age.
She knew bits and pieces about Eleanor's struggles with the Todd family and prayed silently that the girl wouldn't have to carry more pain.

Eleanor's nose stung, her eyes brimming despite her effort to hold steady.

With a trembling smile, she managed to say, "Myah, I'm alright. Truly. You don't have to worry about me. Tell me-how have you been? The same as always?"

Eleanor had already made up her mind-Myah had carried enough worry for her over the years. She refused to add more weight to those shoulders. Whatever had hurt her belonged to the past.

At Eleanor's words, Myah chuckled softly, giving her lower back a playful pat. "Just the usual aches of an old woman, nothing that will stop me. Now hurry along-the kitchen made your favorite dish today."

Lifting the fruit she carried, Eleanor winked mischievously. "You go ahead. I'll wash these in the backyard
first. Otherwise, those little troublemakers will pounce on me before I even step inside."  Their laughter mingled in the air before they parted ways. Eleanor carried the basket to the backyard, rolled up her sleeves with practiced ease, and set the fruit under the faucet, the water sparkling in the afternoon sun.
Out of the corner of her eye, movement caught her attention-a girl, no older than sixteen, crouched near the wall with a much younger child at her side. Both seemed preoccupied, heads bent low over something unseen.

The older one's face was unfamiliar. Eleanor was certain she hadn't seen her during her last visit.
So, she thought, this must be a new arrival.
Once the fruit was rinsed clean, Eleanor walked toward them, her tone gentle."Hey, it's too hot out here.Why don't you two go inside and play? Be careful, or you'll end up with heatstroke."
The older girl lifted her head at last.

Her face was startlingly pale, drained of color in a way that seemed unnatural.
A flicker of unease stirred in Eleanor's chest-something wasn't right about that complexion.
The girl wavered unsteadily, her legs trembling as she tried to push herself upright. She gestured weakly toward the scattered sticks and torn scraps of colored paper at her feet.
"Don't worry. I'm alright. The kite snapped, and I was just helping my little friend mend it. We'll have it flying again soon," she replied.

Her words carried reassurance, but her body betrayed her. Each attempt to steady herself only made the swaying more obvious.

Then, without warning, her knees buckled. She lost her balance.
###Chapter 34 Fannie And Nolan Are Really Kind!


Eleanor's eyes sharpened as she lunged forward, managing to catch the woman before her fragile body hit the ground. The weight in her arms was shockingly light.

How could anyone be this thin?

The younger child standing nearby let out a frightened gasp and hurried over. "Fannie! Fannie, talk to me!Are you hurt?"

There was no time to reassure her. Eleanor focused on Fannie Stewart, scanning her condition with practiced urgency.

Well... Something was clearly off with the girl's health.

But worrying about long-term issues could wait. For now, Eleanor needed to wake her and keep the oxygen flowing.

If she didn't act quickly, the damage could be permanent.

Acting without hesitation, she pulled a silver from her kit and pressed it against Fannie's thumb.

Within moments, Fannie's eyelids fluttered and life slowly returned to her face.

Eleanor slipped the tool away and released a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. "Hey, you're awake.How do you feel? You shouldn't be out here in this condition. Come inside with me."

She bent down, ready to help Fannie to her feet, when a tall shadow closed the distance toward them.

"Fannie!"

It was Nolan!

Eleanor stiffened at once, her body tense as if she had been caught doing something wrong. Every part of her wanted to retreat. Foints demost Her instincts warned her to keep her distance.

Only then did it hit her-the frail woman in her arms was none other than his sister.

It made sense. No one else could stir that level of panic in Nolan, and no other woman around that age came to mind.

"I'fl let you take care of her, Mr. Stewart." Eleanor spoke calmly, guiding the younger child's hand as she prepared to leave.

Nolan's brows tightened, and his piercing stare locked onto her.

Even in that fleeting moment, he had noticed. That skillful maneuver hadn't come from an amateur.Eleanor possessed real medical training.
His thoughts flickered back to David's recent exhibition. Whispers had spread that the legendary Soul Surgeon would appear.

But when the event ended, the only unforgettable figure had been Eleanor, dazzling and mysterious-and the Soul Surgeon had remained unseen.
Doctors from all over the world had spent years trying to treat Fannie, yet none of them could find a cure.Now, with a single intervention, Eleanor had managed to save her life.
That alone made Nolan's instincts flare. Nothing about this seemed ordinary.
He cut across her path before she could slip away. "Hold on. Since when do you know medicine, Miss Warren?"

Eleanor froze in place.
Turning back slowly, she forced a light smile. "Come on, Mr. Stewart, surely you've heard.I graduated from Northbridge University with two majors. One of them was clinical medicine, and I do hold a medical license."She wasn't lying-every word of that was true.
The diploma bore Northbridge University's seal, and the license was official. Nolan's eyes narrowed, sharp and unrelenting, though he chose silence over argument.

Before he could press further, Fannie's soft voice broke in. "Miss Warren, thank you for helping me. My brother was just scared for me. He didn't mean to sound harsh."

Eleanor wanted to believe Fannie, but Nolan's penetrating stare told another story. His gaze searched her face as if peeling back layers she hadn't intended to reveal, and it was far more unsettling than she cared to admit.

She bit back her frustration. Picking a fight with him was out of the question, but keeping her distance should still be possible.

Even so, why on earth was Nolan showing up at Hope House with his sister?

The child in her arms tugged gently at her sleeve and spoke in a bright tone. "Eleanor, you've got it wrong.Fannie and Nolan are really kind! Nolan's been bringing us gifts for years, and Myah always says he's nice."

Eleanor nearly laughed at the absurdity of it.

Was this some kind of joke?

Nolan, the ruthless powerhouse who dominated the business world with no mercy, was the same man these children praised as generous and good-hearted?
###Chapter 35 You Actually Calling Me


By the look on Eleanor's face, Nolan already knew what was running through her mind.

He lowered himself in front of the child and said in a teasing tone, "Sweetheart, thank you for stepping in for me. Otherwise, someone might've thought the worst of me."

Eleanor pressed her lips tight and stayed silent.

That sharp tongue of his never failed.

Everyone, carrying their own thoughts, walked Fannie back to the house just as dinner was about to be served.

Myah had made sure to save them a table while the rest of the seats were already full.

Once the fruit had been handed out, Eleanor sat beside Nolan.

The day had clearly turned against her, since running into him felt like pure bad luck.

She swore she would ask Myah about his visits before showing up next time.

Still, life rarely went the way she planned.

While they ate, Fannie looked at Eleanor with eager eyes. "Eleanor, can I come with you to the orphanage next time?"

She absolutely adored Eleanor.

Because of her poor health since childhood, she had grown up with very few friends.

Even as a Stewart, she could always sense disdain behind people's smiles.

Eleanor, however, was unlike the rest. Just earlier,she had seen it for herself-those eyes held only kindness,  never judgment. Worried Eleanor might turn her down, Fannie quickly caught her hand and shook it eagerly. "Please,Eleanor.Say yes!"

As she met a gazé as puré as a child's, Eleanor found it hard to turn her away.

Eventually Eleanor gave in. "Alright."

Nolan arched his brows, cutting in smoothly."Fannie, you're not in the best shape. I'll come along next time too."

His eyes then shifted upward, fastening on Eleanor as if she had suddenly become far too obedient. "You don't object, do you,Miss Warren?"

It sounded less like a question and more like a decision already made.

For Fannie's sake, Eleanor swallowed her pride and chose to endure.

The very idea of seeing Nolan's cold expression week after week sent prickles across her scalp.

She forced a stiff smile and replied, "Of course. It would be my privilege to have you join us."

Her tone, though polite, carried a thin edge of mockery.

Nolan's lips lifted in the faintest smile.

His long fingers reached for the shared fork, carefully placing a slice of braised beef onto Eleanor's plate.

The gesture caught her completely off guard.

What exactly was that supposed to mean?

A peace offering?

Or some kind of test?

Still, with so many eyes watching, she had no choice but to lower her gaze and quietly eat what was in front of her.

The food lost its flavor completely. Even so, Eleanor stuck to her disciplined habits, finishing every bite-including the braised beef Nolan had served her.

When dinner ended, Fannie tugged eagerly at Eleanor's hand and pulled her outside to the yard, her laughter mingling with that of the other children.

The cheerful voices rang through the air.

From the porch, Nolan stood motionless, his eyes following Eleanor and Fannie in the distance.

A phone appeared in his hand, and he dialed a number.

"Well, well. Nolan, you actually calling me?" Ryland's voice drawled with teasing amusement on the other end.

Nolan ignored the banter, his tone cutting straight to the point. "Find out where Eleanor graduated from."

A moment of silence followed before Ryland spoke again, caught off guard. "That's all?"

He had been expecting something far more dramatic.

But if it came down to gathering information, Nolan couldn't have asked a better man.

"There's no need to dig around. I already know the answer," Ryland responded.
###Chapter 36 You'll Move In Tomorrow


Ryland spoke with obvious pride. "Eleanor used to share a dorm with Lillian in college. They both mnajored in finance at Northbridge University. But Lillian always said Eleanor was different-she even took clinical medicine as a minor. A total genius! Honestly, her kids are going to have some top-tier genes."

That final line carried more weight than casual praise.

Eleanor's family name might not be impressive, but if Nolan was serious about her, it wasn't outside the realm of possibility. After all, wealthy families had never been strangers to illegitimate heirs.

The call ended without warning, cut off cleanly.

Ryland blinked at his screen,baffled.

Did Nolan actually just hang up on him?

Unbelievable.

Infuriating,even.

Meanwhile, Nolan-the one being cursed in silence-let a sharp gleam flash in his eyes.

Two degrees, one in finance and one in clinical medicine, both from Northbridge University. With credentials like that, Eleanor's display of skill earlier suddenly made perfect sense.

Still, Nolan couldn't shake the sense that something about her didn't add up.

It didn't matter. Time had a way of revealing secrets, and sooner or later Eleanor's little secrets would show themselves.

While he entertained those thoughts, Eleanor busied herself with the children, helping clear the table before bidding Myah a warm goodbye.

Fannie quickly followed after her, worry written all over her face. "Eleanor, it's already so late. Why don't my brother and I drop you off?"

That offer sounded far too dangerous.

More time around NVolan meant risking exposure.

Yet hailing a taxi in this neighborhood at night was nearly impossible.

After weighing her options, Eleanor slipped into the car at last. "I appreciate it, Fannie-and you as well, Mr.Stewart."

Nolan didn't bother responding. He simply leaned back, eyes shut, as though none of it concerned him.

Thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop.

Eleanor stepped out gracefully and gave a polite wave. "Thanks for the ride. Take care on the road.Goodbye."

Without another word, Eleanor turned and disappeared into the residential complex.

Only then did Nolan open his eyes, his gaze fixed on her retreating figure.

Why did it feel like she was running from him?

Tsk.

The more he watched her, the more secrets seemed to pile up.

From the front seat, Erick suddenly blurted out, pointing toward the roadside, "Mr. Stewart, isn't that Mr.Todd's car? What's it doing here?"

Nolan followed the direction of his hand and spotted Jonny's vehicle.

It sat idly beneath a tree, angled just enough to block part of the emergency lane.

Leaning back against his seat, Nolan spoke with cool detachment. "Take a picture and report it to the polic "Understood, Mr. Stewart," Erick replied at once, pulling out his phone to snap a photo as evidence.

Nolan reached over and ruffled Fannie's hair with unusual gentleness. "Fannie, we always follow traffic rules,alright?"

Her wide eyes blinked up at him.

Today,he almost seemed playful.

She couldn't help but like this side of him-it made him feel more human.

Where Jonny's car was parked, Jonny himself was bound to be close by.

Just as Eleanor was about to head upstairs, he stepped in front of her, blocking her way.

Her eyes narrowed as she looked up at him, voice laced with mockery. "Step aside, Jonny."

Instead of snapping back, Jonny crushed his cigarette underfoot and leaned closer.

The sharp scent of smoke mixed with his familiar cold aura, wrapping around her.

"I bought a villa in the city," he said flatly. "You'll move in tomorrow. I admit I was wrong before-l ignored your feelings. From now on, I'll give you three days of my week." With that, he tossed his hair back from his forehead, as if the gesture might impress her.

Eleanor just stared, then lifted her hand and smacked him. "How's that for clarity? Awake now?"
###Chapter 37| Just Don't Love You Anymore


Jonny froze, staring at Eleanor in disbelief.

He had laid out such enticing terms, yet she still turned him down?

What more could she possibly want? The title of his wife?

Absurd.

That spot was reserved for Lainey, and Lainey alone.

He swiped the blood from the corner of his lips, fury flashing in his eyes. "Eleanor, don't push your luck!"

He lunged toward her,trying to claim her lips by force.

Revulsion surged through Eleanor. She shoved him back with all her strength."JOnny, where do you get the guts for this? Do you think you're some kind-of sultan with a harem?"

She regained her composure and continued, "Let me spell it out one last time. I'm not pretending to play hard to get. I just don't love you anymore. That's it. So drop the narcissistic act and go be with your darling Lainey."

Her gaze swept him from head to toe before she flashed him a cold smile. "Frankly, a manipulative man and a shameless woman make a perfect pair."

The words hit Jonny like knives.

Today, he had humbled himself, come down from his lofty perch, and even waited here, just to give her a chance.

If she had only admitted fault, he might have allowed her back into Todd Group.

Instead, she spat in his face with stubborn defiance.

Stubborn. Insolent. Who gave her that right? His jaw clenched, voice low with venom. "Don't forget, Eleanor! You only grew up with the support of Todd Group!"

She laughed coldly. "Wrong. That credit belongs to Sallie, who supported me and the orphanage.I owe her everything.And you?"

Her eyes hardened. "If you keep showing up in front of me, I won't hesitate to let those photos see daylight."

Without another glance, she slid her card and stepped into the elevator.

Jonny's legs twitched to follow, but he stopped short.

The photos wouldn't ruin him, but they would humiliate him.

The thought made his stomach churn.

Damn it. What was Eleanor really after?

Why was she being so impossible now?

Could it be true that she had stopped loving him?

No.

Impossible.

A woman who had loved him for three years didn't just walk away overnight.

No,she had to be angling for more-still dreaming of becoming his wife.

But let her dream.

That title belonged to Lainey, and no one else.

Jonnystormed toward his parking spot, his temper boiling over.

But when he got there, the space was empty. His sleek black sedan was nowhere in sight.

What the fuck? Where did it ggo?

How could a whole car just vanish?

His rage was about to spill over when a man in uniform stepped out from the shadows, with a small notebook in hand.

"Mr. Todd?" the officer asked, handing him a slipof paper. "Your vehicle was parked in a fire lane and has been towed."

Jonny froze, staring at the ticket. What kind of nonsense was this? Since when had he parked in a fire lane?

And even if he had, who would dare to report him?

He snatched the ticket and crushed it in his fist. "Who the hell reported me? Do they have a death wish?"

The veins in his neck stood out as his face twisted with fury.

The officer didn't so much as blink. "Sorry, that information is confidential."

Without another word, he took his leave.

Jonny was left seething. He might have been a president of a listed company, but in a city overflowing with power players, he wasn't anyone special.

Besides, the one who filed the report was Nolan's assistant.

That officer might have been low in rank, but he wasn't stupid.

He knew very well who it was safe to offend and who it wasn't.

And honestly, Jonny had broken the law. This time, he couldn't cry unfair.
###Chapter 38 Please Think Of The Company's Future!


Jonny's eyes stayed fixed on the officer's back until he disappeared, his jaw aching from how tightly he ground his teeth.

Forget it.

The company came first.

He couldn't risk creating another storm.

Slamming his fists against his thighs, he flagged down a cab and rode straight to the Todd family's estate.

Eleanor had always shown deference to Sallie-maybe his grandmother could convince her to return.

To his shock, the second he voiced his plan, Sallie's palm cracked hard across his face. "This entire mess is your doing. How dare you bring it up again?"

The blow landed with all the force of her conviction.

A woman who had built her life on principle could not stomach a grandson incapable of telling right from wrong.

To her, it was nothing short of disgrace.

Reeling from the slap, Jonny bit back any defense.

Instead,he dropped to his knees and clung desperately to her legs. "Grandma, please! Eleanor is already close to Mr. Stewart, and because of that, he's pulled his investment from us. I'm terrified that once I marry Lainey, Eleanor will lash out again and drag the Todd Group down even further. If she doesn't return to me,our company will collapse."

Jonny's voice dropped to a pleading softness. "Grandma, please think of the company's future!"

Deep down, he didn't truly believe Eleanor had caused the Stewart Group to pull out. But he knew Sallie wouldn't budge unless he painted her as the reason.

He doubted a man like Nolan would ever seriously want a divorced woman.

Sallie's chest tightened as fury rose. "Shut up! The Stewart Group left because of your mistakes. Eleanor had nothing to do with it!"

She had lived long enough to see through people.

Her grandson's intentions were as clear as day.

Jonny simply couldn't stand watching Eleanor live well, and he wanted to keep both women at his side.

That selfishness would ruin their family.

Exhaustion crept over her as she pressed her fingers to her temples. With a tired wave toward the servant,she murmured, "Take me back to my room."

Even after she retreated to her room, Sallie's thoughts refused to settle.

Rumors about the Todd Group's troubles had already reached her ears.

The investment from the Stewart Group had been vital to keeping the company afloat.

Without it, the Todd Group truly risked collapse.

In her heart, Sallie knew Eleanor wasn't the kind of woman to strike from the shadows-she was too straightforward, too decent for that.

Still, Jonny's words lingered. If Eleanor really had drawn close to Nolan, perhaps that connection wasn't without meaning.

Maybe, just maybe, there was still a thread of hope to grasp.

The idea of watching the Todd family's legacy crumble after decades was unbearable. Pride might have to be sacrificed for the sake of survival.

After a long pause, Sallie turned to the servant and gave her instructions. "Reach out to Eleanor. Tell herI'd like to see her for a meal-that I miss her."

When Eleanor received the call, she was caught off guard.

Sallie was no ordinary woman. With Eleanor's ties to Jonny strained beyond repair, it seemed unlikely the invitation was out of simple affection.

Was Sallie truly trying to speak for Jonny?

That didn't fit her at all.

Sallie wasn't the type to meddle in such a way.

Carrying her doubts with her, Eleanor still went to the meeting the following day.

At the head of the table sat Sallie, already waiting, her face softened by a welcoming smile.

The moment her eyes fell on Eleanor, her expression grew even warmer, and she gestured gently. "Eleanor,come closer. Let me really see you."

Obeying,Eleanor took the seat beside her and wrapped her hands around Sallie's slightly frail ones.

"Sallie, I..." She faltered, her voice laced with guilt.

The divorce from Jonny had surely hurt Sallie most of all.

Reading her look without difficulty, Sallie let out a quiet sigh and patted her hand. "All I care about is whether you've been treated fairly. Jonny was the one in the wrong, not you."

A wave of gratitude washed through Eleanor at those words. Even among family,such fairness was rare.

Her chest warmed as she gave Sallie's hand a gentle squeeze. "Thank you for thinking of me, Sallie."
###Chapter 39 | Hate To Burden You With This





After the polite greetings were exchanged, Sallie finally cut to the reason she had asked Eleanor out.


"Eleanor, I hate to burden you with this," she began gently, her tone almost hesitant. "But the Todd Group... it represents the work and sacrifice of our family for generations. I've heard you're on good terms with NJolan Stewart. Do you think... maybe you could persuade him to reinvest?"


The request left Eleanor momentarily stunned.


Her lashes lowered, masking the swirl of emotions in her eyes.


If it hadn't been for Sallie's help years ago, the Hope House would have crumbled.


Eleanor had carried that kindness like a stone in her heart, the weight of it leading her, at one point, to  marry Jonny without hesitation.


But that debt had long been repaid.


Besides, Nolan wasn't someone whose choices could be swayed so easily. He was unpredictable,unreadable-a man who kept even his closest rivals guessing.


There was no bond between them.



Why would he alter a business decision just because she asked?


Sallie, noticing Eleanor's silence and the faint crease in her brow, let out a tired sigh. "Eleanor, if it's too much to ask, then forget I said anything. This is our family's mess. It shouldn't trouble you anymore."


Her voice carried a weary acceptance, as though she had already resigned herself to the worst.


Eleanor's heart softened. "Sallie," she said quietly,"if the opportunity comes, I'll bring it up to Mr. Stewart."


It was, after all, only a matter of words. Whether fate  chose to spare the Todd Group, that was something no one could control.


When Eleanor left the restaurant, she pulled out her phone. Her eyes lingered on a name glowing on the screen.



How was she supposed to bring this up to Nolan?


Maybe it would be better to wait for another time.


With a small sigh, she slipped the phone back into her bag.


But Nolan was well-informed.



He didn't need her to speak for him to know what had happened.


By the time half a day had passed, his network had already fed him the details.


He tapped his fingers lightly on the desk, a smile slowly tugging at his lips.


Would Eleanor come to him for Sallie's sake? He thought she would.


She disliked Jonny, but her heart was soft. How could she watch Sallie, aging and worried, carry the weight of a crumbling company?


It would only take her a fewv words to ease Sallie's burden.



Yet,Nolan was wrong.


Days passed, and Eleanor never mentioned a thing.


Well,it seemed he had underestimated her.


In rare good humor, he turned to Erick. "Get the car ready. We're going to the Hope House to pick up Fannie."



"Yes,sir."


Luck seemed to be on Nolan's side that day.


When they arrived, Eleanor, broom in hand, was carefully sweeping leaves from the yard.


Nolan crossed the distance in long, confident strides. What,you weren't going to ask me for a hand?"


Eleanor froze for a moment before lifting her head,her eyes narrowing slightly.


Typical.


In Elepdon, little escaped Nolan's notice.


Still, she hadn't thought he would confront her about it so directly.


Meeting his gaze, she replied coolly, "Well, message delivered. Whether you reinvest in the Todd Group,that's up to you."


Without waiting for a reply, she turned away and began sweeping in another corner, not sparing a single word in defense of the Todd Group.


Nolan felt the corners of his lips twitch with a quiet amusement.



He was just about to speak again when Fannie came running over, her eyes bright. "Nolan, what are you and Eleanor talking about in hushed voices?" He shifted his attention to her, his tone casual."Nothing important. Eleanor just owes someone a debt."


Fannie tilted her head, her clear eyes blinking in thought. "Then why not help her? If it's too expensive, just dock it from my allowance next month."



A faint glimmer passed through Nolan's eyes.


He had already made up his mind to help.


Clearing Eleanor's obligations to the Todd family was an investment worth every bit.


What intrigued him more was how she would choose to repay him in the end.


For the first time, he found himself genuinely anticipating it.
###Chapter 40 Call An Ambulance!





By the following morning, word had already spread through Elepdon's upper circles that Stewart Group was injecting funds back into the Todd Group.


Jonny practically bounced off the couch, the dark cloud that had been weighing him down evaporating in an instant.



He could hardly believe it. What he had tossed out as an offhand comment to win Sallie's sympathy had,against all odds, turned into a lifeline for the Todd Group.


What a windfall!


So he had been right after all.


Eleanor might act cold, but her heart was still tied to him.



Why else would she have spoken up on behalf of the Todd Group the moment Sallie opened her mouth?No, it wasn't about business-it had to be about him.


She must still be hopelessly in love.


A rush of satisfaction swelled in Jonny's chest, so fierce it nearly made him laugh.


Snatching up his phone, he instructed Allard the moment the call connected. "Arrange a private office for Eleanor. I want her back at the company."


When the line went dead, he muttered smugly, "If she's this devoted, I'll throw her a rope. But the title of my wife? That belongs to Lainey,always."


Not far away, Sallie gave a sharp, derisive chuckle."Delusions. After everything you've done, you really think Eleanor would stiIl look twice at you? That girl's heart is pure, but you trampled on it when you had the chance. You can't rewind the past,Jonny."


Her words carried the weight of disappointment. If Jonny weren't the sole heir, the Todd Group would never have landed in his hands. With a heavy sigh, Sallie pushed herself up,retreating slowly to her room.


What she didn't realize was that Lainey, standing quietly by the entrance, had heard every word.


That decrepit woman...always defending Eleanor!


What did Eleanor have that she didn't?


Just a pitiful little orphan with no background, no family name. Strip away her looks, and there was nothing.


And yet Sallie insisted on holding her up like a jewel,even after the divorce, still clinging to her.


And now Jonny, too, wanted her back in Todd Group?


Clearly, he hadn't let go.


Lainey ground her teeth. Fortunately, Eleanor had grown arrogant lately. With luck, she wouldn't agree.


Otherwise, forcing her out again would be far messier. Jonny, ignorant of Lainey's plotting, left for the office not long after.


With the Stewart Group's capital back in play, the company needed immediate attention.


In his rush, he didn't even notice Lainey standing the garden as he left.


Lainey had planned to stage a coincidental run-in with him in the garden, but being brushed off without so much as a glance made her stomp the grass in frustration.



She was about to storm off when a frantic voice rang out from upstairs. "Mrs. Todd! Are you alright?"


Lainey froze, then smirked.


Another episode, was it?


Serves the old woman right.


But this... this could be useful.


If she played the role of the concerned daughter-in-law, she might just worm her way deeper into Sallie's good graces and into her shares.


Putting on her sweetest mask, she dashed inside."Sallie!"



The bedroom door stood wide open.


Sallie was sprawled on the floor, her skin ashen and lips pale.


As soon as Lainey stepped in, the maid blurted out in a rush, "Miss Gilbert, thank heavens you're here!Mrs. Todd's having another attack. I'll get her back to bed, and you grab the medicine from the drawer,quick!"



Lainey bristled at the command, loathing the idea of being bossed around by a servant. Still, she forced a smile and nodded. "Of course, I'll get it right away."


She strode to the bedside drawer, pulled it open, and her eyes immediately landed on a brown glass bottle with a neatly printed label. This had to be it.


She lifted it, then hesitated. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the maid supporting Sallie back onto the mattress, blocking the old woman's view.


A flicker of cruelty flashed across Lainey's eyes. In that brief moment, she slipped the bottle to the farthest corner, sliding a box on top to hide it completely.


Sallie had always treated her like dirt, poisoning Jonny's mind and keeping him from marrying her.


If she dropped dead tonight, that barrier would be gone.


If she survived, then fate was simply being kind.


Feigning panic, she rattled through the drawer noisily.




The maid, now sweating as Sallie's condition worsened, snapped, "Miss Gilbert, haven't you found it yet? It's always at the front-you couldn't possibly miss it!"


Lainey glanced over her shoulder, widening her eyes as if flustered. "I'm telling you, it's not here. Maybe Sallie tucked it away somewhere when she was organizing her things?"


The maid faltered, torn by doubt.


But Sallie had already slumped unconscious.


The maid's hands shook. Without the medicine,Sallie's life could be at risk.


Abandoning Lainey, she tore into the drawer herself,rummaging until she finally pulled out the bottle buried at the very back.


Her hands shook as she hurried to administer the dose, but the delay had already stolen precious minutes.Sallie remained unresponsive.


The maid's throat tightened. "This... this is terrible."


Regret burned through her chest. If she had searched instead of wasting time relying on Lainey,Sallie wouldn't be at death's door.


Her voice cracked as she called for help. "Butler! Call an ambulance
###Chapter 41 You're Making Baseless Accusations





Half an hour later, news of Sallie's collapse reached Eleanor. Without hesitation, she raced straight to the hospital, her pulse hammering with dread.


When she pushed open the door to Sallie's room, the scene made her pause. Not a single member of the Todd family was present, only the loyal maid and the weary butler kept watch by the bedside.


Eleanor didn't waste time questioning it. She hurried to the bedside and examined Sallie.


Her tense brow relaxed after a brief examination.


Sallie's condition was weak, but her pulse was stable.

For the moment, her life wasn't in danger.


Still, something gnawed at her.


"I left her medication with clear instructions. It was supposed to be given on schedule. How could things have deteriorated to the point of a coma?" Eleanor said.



The maid's face drained of color. She wrung her hands before stammering, "It... it was when Mrs.Todd suddenly worsened. At that moment, Miss Gilbert happened to come in,and..."


Before she could finish, a sharp voice sliced through the air. "Well, well. Miss Warren." Lainey swept into the room like she owned it, her lips curling into a poisonous smile. "You've divorced Jonny. Don't you think it's rather improper to meddle in his family matters now?"



The rvalry between the two women crackled in the air. The maid, knowing better than to get caught in the crossfire, quickly slipped away with the butler.


As she was left alone with Lainey, Eleanor's eyes hardened. If Lainey was responsible for Sallie's hospitalization, then she would make sure Lainey rotted in jail. She gave a cold, dismissive laugh. "If I'm not mistaken, Miss Gilbert, you're still not part of the Todd family,are you?"


The barb hit its mark. Lainey's expression twisted,venom flashing in her eyes.


"It won't be long before Jonny and I marry," she spat."Unlike a slut like you! Who's spread her legs for countless men. Jonny despises you!"


Her voice grew louder and harsher, each insult more vicious than the last. "You're nothing but Sallie's lapdog. Do us all a favor and leave Elepdon. Stop shamelessly trying to seduce Jonny!"


Lainey's fury wasn't without reason. She remembered clearly that Jonny had left home late one night, claiming urgent work at the office.


Suspicious, she had had someone look into it. He hadn't gone anywhere near the office. Instead, he had gone straight to Eleanor's neighborhood.


The thought burned Lainey alive. It must be this  bitch! She was dragging him back!


Eleanor, however, didn't flinch. A soft, mocking laugh escaped her lips as she slowly retrieved her phone from her bag, waving it lightly. "Miss Gilbert," she said smoothly, "your tongue is certainly sharp. I wonder how Jonny would react if he heard every word of it?"



The blood drained from Lainey's face. She recorded it?


Her composure snapped. With a snarl, she lunged toward Eleanor, clawing for the phone. "You bitch!"


She had always been soft-spoken and composed around Jonny. If he heard the recording,her carefully curated image would shatter. No! She couldn't let that happen.


But Eleanor moved with deadly precision. In an instant, she blocked Lainey's reach and pushed her back.


Eleanor's lips curved into a cutting smile. "Jonny doesn't interest me. If he's your prize, go ahead and take him. But watch your little games-if I find out you had anything to do with Sallie's coma..."


She let the threat hang in the air.


Lainey sank to the floor, completely undone.


Had Eleanor already discovered what she had done?


She couldn't have known! At the time, it had just been her and the maid, and she had been careful.Eleanor must be bluffing.


Trying to salvage her composure, Lainey stammered,her eyes flicking nervously, "You're... you're making baseless accusations. I don't know what you mean."


But Eleanor's gaze was unwavering.


She was certain Lainey was involved in Sallie's condition, but the exact details remained a mystery.


She would need to speak with the maid later to uncover the truth.


"You know exactly what I'm talking about," Eleanor  retorted, her words slow and deliberate. "And don't think that just because you're in the hospital room pretending to help, you can harm Sallie without consequences. There's surveillance everywhere. One wrong move, and your days of scheming are over."


With that, she turned on her heel and left,leaving Lainey seething in place.


"That bitch! Slandering me without proof! I'll make her pay once I'm Jonny's wife!" she muttered under her breath.


Then her mind snapped back to the recording.


Her stomach churned. She needed a plan, and fast,before Eleanor could use it against her.
###Chapter 42| Shouldn't Have Snapped At You





Eleanor had never been the kind of woman anyone could push around.


The moment she stepped out of the hospital, she wasted no time in forwarding the voice recording straight to Jonny.


She hadn't walked far before stopping again.


With a calm hand, she blocked his number once again, then slid behind the wheel and drove off without looking back.


At that moment, Jonny was pacing restlessly in his office.


Even though the Stewart Group had injected new funds, the amount was barely half of what it used to be. On top of that, several investors had already pulled out, leaving the Todd Group still on shaky ground.


As he brooded over the mess, his phone lit up with a notification.


It was a Facebook message from Eleanor.


A smug smile tugged at his lips.


He had overestimated her. She gave in the moment he showed her a bit of kindness.


Arrogantly, he tapped open the message and hit play.


But instead of Eleanor's supposed pleas, Lainey's sharp, venomous voice rang out.


Jonny froze.How could this be?


Lainey was always soft, always delicate. Since when did she spit words so harshly?


Something was off.


He immediately tried calling Eleanor.


"Sorry, the line is busy right now. Please try again later..." He refused to accept it and dialed again, only to hear the same thing.



Cursing under his breath, he switched back to Facebook and furiously typed, "Did you tamper with this recording on purpose? Eleanor, I must've been blind not to see your manipulative side earlier. Do you think cheap tricks like this will break me and Lainey apart?"


But as soon as he hit send, a bright red exclamation mark appeared.


Message rejected.


Jonny's temples throbbed.


Damn it.



She had blocked him again.


How dared she?


Just then, a soft knock sounded at the door.


"Come in!" he snapped. Startled by his harsh tone, Lainey shrank back. No one had ever raised their voice at her like that.


With tearful eyes, she carefully stepped inside, her voice fragile. "Jonny, did I come at a bad time? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I asked the kitchen to make chicken soup for Sallie and kept some aside for you too. I thought you might not have had time for lunch,so I brought it over."


A single tear slid down her cheek, softening her features into something heartbreakingly delicate.


In the past, Jonny would have felt his heart shatter at a scene like this.



But now, he just


looked at her face, studying her in silence. "Did you run into Eleanor at the hospital?"


Lainey's grip on the thermos stiffened for a moment.


So Eleanor really had sent him the recording. That cunt! Good thing she was ready for it.


Setting the thermos aside, she walked over and softly held Jonny's arm. "Jonny, this is on me. I shouldn't have talked to Miss Warren that way.I just... I love you so much, Jonny. I was scared she might take you away."


She then changed the topic. "Your stomach isn't feeling well, so have some soup first. I know you hate it when people speak harshly. Once you finish,1pack up and leave you in peace."


Her tears spilled freely as she ladled the soup for him, stealing hesitant glances in his direction before quietly turning to leave.



Jonny's chest clenched. She was the woman he couldn't bear to lose. In an instant, he caught her by the wrist and drew her into his arms. "I'm sorry,Lainey. I shouldn't have snapped at you."



Her words made sense. She had spoken harshly only because she cared about him. She was gentle by nature. Eleanor must have cornered her, twisting the moment to her advantage,and then recorded it to create trouble.


The more Jonny thought about it, the more certain he became.


Lainey snuggled into his arms, a small smirk playing on her lips.


Eleanor could plot all she wanted, but Jonny's heart was hers to soothe with a few well-placed tears.


Eleanor was nothing but an orphan with no real influence.



Even so, being outsmarted like this left Lainey feeling annoyed.


That bitch had always treasured Hope House above all else, hadn't she?


Then she would make it vanish.


She might not be able to meddle with the Usepsall project directly anymore, but there were other ways in.


Her brother's geological survey team would be perfect for the job.


As the thought took root, a wicked glint sparked in her eyes.
###Chapter 43 What A Coincidence





After spending some intimate time with Jonny, Lainey finally left, though reluctantly.


As Jonny watched her back fade into the distance,Eleanor's face suddenly came to mind, bright and vivid.



Was she deliberately trying to provoke Lainey? Was that why she sent the recording? To make Lainey doubt him? Could it be jealousy?


Otherwise, why would she bother doing something so petty?


This woman was infuriating.


When he had been willing to give her a graceful way to back down, she rejected it. And now that he had cut her off, she was pulling every cheap trick to stir up trouble between him and Lainey. Forget it.


For Grandma's sake, he would give Eleanor one last chance.



He grabbed his suit jacket from the chair and made his way downstairs, sliding into the black sedan waiting by the roadside.


As he pulled the door shut, his eyes flicked briefly to the driver.



The man was new, an unfamiliar face, but Jonny didn't give it much thought. "To the Podium Apartments," he ordered flatly.


"Yes, Mr. Todd."


When Eleanor got back to her apartment building she instantly saw Jonny hanging around, like an unwelcome shadow.



Her brows knitted slightly, and instead of heading toward the main entrance, she turned toward a side entrance to avoid him. She couldn't understand him at all.


When she was still married to him, Jonny couldn't keep his distance fast enough.


Yet now, he kept showing up on his own, uninvited.


What was he trying to play at?


Jonny saw her and quickly stepped forward, blocking her way. "What's the meaning of this? I'm right here.Didn't you notice me?"


Eleanor stopped and lifted her eyes to meet his with calm confidence."Oh, I saw. Just happened to notice a scumbag standing there. What a terrible day."


Jonny's teeth clicked together in anger.


This woman!


Did she really just call him a scumbag to get his attention?



He was about to speak again, ready to throw her another chance to patch things up, when a clear,low voice rang out. "Erick, find out who this scumbag is that keeps pestering Miss Warren, and get rid of him."


Not far away, Nolan stood tall, posture straight,his expression cool and unreadable. "Miss Warren, what a coincidence."


Erick nearly laughed aloud.


Nolan wasn't even bothering to hide his reason for being here anymore.


He had received word earlier that Jonny's car was headed for the Podium Apartments.


Nolan had told his staff he was inspecting a new property development nearby, but now here he was,exactly where Eleanor lived.


Obvious enough. He wasn't here for business. He was here for her.


Men.


Always saying one thing while meaning another.


With that thought, Erick's eyes flicked between Nolan and the unfamiliar driver in Jonny's car. The two exchanged a subtle, knowing look.


Meanwhile, Jonny was completely oblivious. Forcing a strained smile, he greeted stiffly, "Mr. Stewart,what brings you here today?"


Nolan didn't even glance at him. Instead,he walked straight up to Eleanor. "It's late. Since we've run into each other, how about joining me for a meal? I still owe you a proper thank-you for saving Fannie last time."



Eleanor was taken aback.


Her eyes instinctively darted to Jonny, whose expression was thunderous.


But she quickly made her choice. Better to spend her time with Nolan than waste it dealing with Jonny.


At least Nolan was easier to bear.


"Alright," she said calmly. "Then I'll accept."


Maintaining her poise, she walked beside Nolan and slid gracefully into the waiting black Bentley.


Jonny stood frozen, seething inside. His anger was ready to erupt, but he forced it down.


With the Stewart Group's reinvestment into the Todd Group, he couldn't afford to offend Nolan now. He would just have to endure.


Anyway, Nolan couldn't really have feelings for Eleanor.





Once the novelty wore off, he would have plenty of ways to deal with her.
###Chapter 44 Where Are You Taking Me For Dinner





Inside the back of the black Bentley, Eleanor shifted in her seat, unable to shake her restlessness.


Whenever she was around Nolan,she found him too mysterious to read-and keeping some space seemed like the safest bet.


With this thought in mind, she cleared her throat and spoke up. "Actually, can you let me out at the next corner? Something just came up, so let's catch up some other timne."


She eyed the upcoming side entrance to Podium Apartments, knowing slipping in there would help her dodge Jonny.


But Nolan gave no reaction at all. He kept his eyes shut, silent and unmoved by her request.


Erick sat up front, hesitant to act without a word from  Nolan. He knew better than to guess what his boss might be thinking.


As the car rolled past the intersection, Eleanor grew anxious and tried again. "Mr. Stewart?"


It was only then that Nolan gradually opened his eyes, his calm gaze fixing on her face, which still carried a trace of caution. "Miss Warren, didn't you just agree to this yourself a moment ago?"


She instantly regretted opening her mouth, wishing she could take her words back. How could she forget that the man sitting with her was never easily fooled?


Her smile was forced as she tried to sound polite."You know, Mr. Stewart, every socialite in Elepdon would do anything just to share a dinner with you. lf word gets out that I monopolized your time, I might not survive the fallout. Could you please let me off the hook this once?"


Even as she spoke, Eleanor cringed a little inside.


Nolan caught the hint of embarrassment and let his  lips curl into the faintest grin. "So, you're saying even someone as clever as you can get nervous?"


His laid-back voice made her heart skip a beat.


If only she had never crossed Nolan for the sake of Todd Group three years ago, maybe none of this mess would have happened.


While Eleanor was busy kicking herself for getting tangled up with Nolan, the Bentley suddenly jolted over a bump, and she lost her balance, tumbling sideways.


In a split second, Nolan reached out and caught her,steady and unflustered.


Eleanor stiffened, realizing just how close he was.


His face hovered inches away-so close she could make out the sharp line of his jaw and watch the slight movement in his throat as he swallowed.


That fresh, understated scent he always carried washed over her, making her senses spin.  Without thinking, she swallowed had, her pulse racing.


Nolan looked down at the woman pressed against him, his voice dropping to a teasing tone. "You know,Miss Warren, you're coming on pretty strong."


Eleanor's cheeks burned as she jerked herself away scooting further across the seat.


Could things get any more embarrassing?


She couldn't believe how clumsy she had just been.


Still, even with her pride bruised, she had to admit-Nolan really was almost unfairly handsome.


No wonder all those high-society women tripped over themselves trying to catch his eye.


Determined to keep things moving,Eleanor cleared her throat and tried to act like nothing happened."So, where are you taking me for dinner?"


Since there was no escaping now, she figured the only thing left was to finish the meal and hope he  would let her leave afterward.


Nolan leaned back, arms crossed, studying her for a long moment.


He remained silent for a long while before his lips finally parted. "You'll know soon enough."


From the front seat, Erick caught the whole exchange and nearly laughed out loud.


Who could have imagined that Nolan, one of the most influential figures in Elepdon's elite circle,would act so carefully around a girl he liked?


If his business partners ever found out, they would be stunned into silence.


Erick grinned. It looked like his boss was finally on the verge of getting a girlfriend!
###Chapter 45 This Woman Just Stole From Me
Two hours later, the meal was coming to an end in a private dining room at the Lumina Hotel.


Eleanor dabbed delicately at the corners of her mouth with a napkin, her eyes flicking over Nolan,who sat opposite her, calm and collected as always.


"Thank you for the meal, Mr. Stewart," she said lightly. "Now that we're done, I won't keep you any longer."


She picked up her bag and started to leave.


At that exact moment, Erick came in, and they almost bumped into each other.


He stumbled back, flustered. "Oh, sorry, Miss Warren."


Eleanor was just as surprised, but she composed  herself and gave him a polite smile. "It's okay."


Before he could say anything else, she was already gone.


Erick was left standing there, scratching his head.


She was...something else.


No wonder she caught Nolan's eye.


Shaking off his distraction, he finally turned to Nolan."Sir, there's something you should know. This afternoon, a geological survey team went to Hope House. From what I found, it looks like the Gilbert family is behind it."


Whether the Todds had pushed them to act, though,still wasn't clear.


Nolan set his cup down slowly, eyes narrowing. He considered it for a moment before speaking. "Let it be for now."



He wanted Eleanor to feel indebted to him, to make sure next time she couldn't slip away like that. Meanwhile, Eleanor had just reached the hotel entrance when she ran straight into Emma.


Emma was surrounded by a rowdy group of friends,clearly tipsy and laughing too loud.


The moment she saw Eleanor, she planted herself in her way, a smirk playing on her lips. "Well, well, if it isn't my brother's little admirer. How can someone from an orphanage even afford a place like this?"


Then, as if struck by a brilliant idea, she clutched her hand to her mouth in exaggerated shock. "Wait,could it be... you're here with your sugar daddy?"


Then she gestured to a few of the men standing nearby. "Eleanor, these guys are all from wealthy families.Hanging out with them would be far better than waiting on those old men. Make them happy,and who knows? The tips might even top what your sugar daddy gives you!"


The memory of the exhibition had been gnawing at Emma,fueling her anger. She had been itching for a chance to lash out, and now Eleanor had just walked right into her trap.


Today,she was determined to make her pay.


The men Emma had brought along weren't exactly gentlemen.


Seeing Eleanor, attractive, poised, and seemingly alone, they immediately reached out.


Even if nothing more came of it, a few gropes would satisfy them.


However, before their hands could even touch her,Eleanor's swift kicks sent them flying.


Her face hardened as she tossed each man over her shoulder.


Within seconds, all of them were lying on the floor,groaning and cursing.


"Damn it, Emma! Why didn't you tell us this woman could fight?" one of them spat in disbelief.


Emma froze at the sight, shocked to see Eleanor in action.


For a moment, she couldn't process it.


But then the surge of anger returned-no way could she let this humiliation slide.


She had to make Eleanor pay.


Glancing at the hotel security, she barked, "Aren't you going to stop her? This woman just stole from me. If you don't, your manager will fire all of you!"


The guards hadn't seen Eleanor enter with Nolan.


Offending the Todd family wasn't an option.


Still, after a tense moment, they cautiously closed in on Eleanor, surrounding her.
###Chapter 46 You Really Are Ungrateful




Eleanor rolled her eyes at the whole display."Seriously? That's all you've got?"


She was a good fighter. Dealing with those security guards was child's play.


She was just getting ready to take action when she suddenly caught sight of Nolan, who had just stepped out of the hotel lobby.


He stood leaning against the glass doors, watching her with an amused grin.


No telling how long he had been there,quietly taking it all in.


As soon as Nolan realized she had noticed him, he strolled over, slow-clapping as he came closer.


"Not bad at all, Miss Warren," Nolan called out.


People usually saw Eleanor as soft-spoken and polite, but there was a fierceness in her that no one could push around.


Trailing after Nolan, Erick stared in open-mouthed shock. He never would have guessed that delicate-looking Eleanor could outmatch men. Poor Nolan-he was going to have his hands full with her.


Meanwhile, Emma's tough exterior disappeared the instant she spotted Nolan. Her eyes widened, and she swapped anger for vulnerability as she rushed toward him."Mr.Stewart!"


Before she could get too close, Erick stepped in,holding out an arm. "Miss Todd, you know Mr.Stewart isn't big on unexpected company."


Emma nearly lost her balance, stumbling awkwardly.She glared, annoyed-of course a powerful man like Nolan would step. in when a woman was in distress.


Turning on the waterworks, she faced Nolan and begged, "Mr. Stewart, I have no idea what we did to upset this crazy woman. She just started swinging!You've got to help us out." Nolan's reputation for keeping to himself was well known. He usually stayed out of petty drama.


Even so, the way he watched Eleanor out of the corner of his eye made it clear-she had caught his attention.


The group of rich men exchanged uneasy looks before bolting upright.


One clutched his stomach and blurted out,"Something's wrong with me-l need to get to a hospital."


Another waved his phone as if in panic. "Shoot,I forgot my mom told me to come home early. I can't stay."


"My girlfriend's calling me. We'll catch up some other time!" a third chimed in, bolting away even faster than the ones before him.



With the power he held, Nolan could destroy them without breaking a sweat.


No one in their right mind would have dared to push  their luck.



Yet Emma, stubborn and thoughtless, continued to stir up trouble. Foolishness clung to her every move.



When Nolan said nothing, Emma leaned forward,panic rising in her voice. "Mr. Stewart, you can't let Eleanor deceive you. She's nothing more than a schemer who trapped my brother with her charms..."


Her words were cut short when Nolan spoke at last."Does the Todd Group no longer require financial support?"


Emma froze, blinking in confusion. "What are you talking about?"


Erick quickly interjected, "Miss Todd, what Mr.Stewart is saying is that if your family's company doesn't want the funds, then we will gladly pull out our investment."



The meaning hit Emma hard.


Was Nolan defending Eleanor again? Just like he had at the previous exhibition?


What made that bitch so deserving of Nolan's support?


Although resentment weighed heavily inside her,Emma kept her mouth shut, unwilling to risk a single word.


The funding Jonny fought so hard to secure could vanish with one careless move, and Emma knew if she ruined it, the blame would fall squarely on her.


Resentment burned her throat, but she forced a smile and bowed her head. "Please excuse my behavior. I didn't mean to cause any trouble."


Once Emma slipped out, Nolan approached Eleanor with calm confidence, lowering himself until his face hovered so close that she could feel the warmth of his breath.



The nearness made her tense, and she reacted on impulse, trying to shove him back bout to no avail.

 
Nolan didn't look offended. Instead, his eyes gleamed with amusement, and the corners of his lips curved in a sly grin.


His hand lifted without warning, brushing over her hair in a gesture that felt far too casual for the moment.


"You really are ungrateful," he murmured with a teasing lilt. "Another rescue, another tally-I'll keep track for you."


Shock rooted Eleanor where she stood, the intimacy of his touch catching her completely off guard.


But before her mind caught up, Nolan had already turned away, leaving her behind with her fury simmering.


As if she needed saving.


Those guards would have scattered the moment she dealt with them, yet he insisted on painting himself as the courageous hero.


Her jaw tightened as she swore under her breath that she wouldn't let herself get tangled up with him again.
###Chapter 47 Please Give Him A Hand





Eleanor had no idea that someone on the second floor was watching her every move with a pair of hostile eyes.


Jealousy ate away at Lainey, and her glare nearly burned with it.



How did Eleanor manage to capture Nolan's attention when every woman in town wanted him?


She was nothing but a divorced woman without any connections.



Emma was completely useless and failing to get even the slightest upper hand!


A man, dressed like a butler, rushed over,interrupting Lainey's thoughts. "Miss Gilbert, we've taken care of the situation with the orphanage."


Relief finally washed over Lainey. She gave a crooked smile, her eyes cold. "You did well."


Eleanor only cared about that shabby old orphanage.


Destroying it would hit her where it hurt.


The butler looked uneasy. "Miss Gilbert, what if Jonny finds out about this..."


Lainey's father had assigned him to support her,so he had some idea about Lainey and Jonny.


There had been heated arguments before, all because of that orphanage.


If the truth came out, her father would turn his anger on him.



Lainey shot him a hard look. "It was just a routine inspection team. Whatever they reported is exactly what they saw. It had nothing to do with us."


In her mind, even if Jonny learned the truth, it would not make a difference.



Everything was different now. Her father was already thinking about putting money into the Todd Group.


By now, Jonny wouldn't just avoid blaming her. He would even make an effort to make her happy.


A satisfied feeling crept in as Lainey straightened her shoulders and walked into the private room.


Not wanting to upset her, the butler trailed after her.


Across the table in the private room, Jonny faced Lainey's father, Kurt Gilbert.


Jonny/ lifted the cup but set it back down without taking a sip. "Kurt, if you decide to put money into the Todd Group now, I would be deeply thankful."


If the Todd Group wasn't teetering on the edge of collapse, he would never lower himself to seek help from a company that had yet to make its mark on the stock exchange.


The Gilbert family might have lived quietly in Elepdon, but everyone in town knew their fortune was impressive. Getting them to invest would be the lifeline the Todd Group desperately needed.


Kurt showed no sign of being moved. Leisurely,he took a sip from his glass before finally saying, "Jonny,you know the Stewart Group hasn't made its position clear. Rushing into an investment with you would put us at too much risk."


No clear answer came from him.


Right at that moment, Lainey entered the room and jumped in as if she had been waiting for her cue."Dad, Jonny, and I have known each other our whole lives. You can trust him. Please give him a hand."


She slipped into the chair beside Kurt and linked her arm with his, sharing a look with him.


With a smile that looked annoyed, Kurt made his voice gentle. "You two aren't even married, and you're already choosing his side."


"Dad, why would you say that?" Lainey lowered her gaze, putting on a bashful look, thouigh a flash of calculation hid in her eyes.


It was time to get serious.


Kurt took another slow sip, then focused on Jonny."Now that I think about it, three years ago, I made a mistake by separating you and Lainey. Now, all I want is for my daughter to be happy. If you agree to marry Lainey now, I'll give you $100 million. Let that count as my way of helping the Todd Group through this rough patch."


That kind of money and a marriage to Lainey would have been a dream come true once upon a time.


Oddly enough, Jonny couldn't get Eleanor's face out of his mind.



Noticing his hesitation, Lainey clenched her jaw so tightly it nearly made her teeth ache, but she managed to put on a gentle smile. "Dad, Jonny and I truly care for each other. Please, don't try to force his hand like this."



Jonny snapped out of his thoughts at her words. He realized there was nothing stopping him from being with Lainey now.


If Eleanor got upset, he could always charm her back with a few kind words.
###Chapter 48 Nolan Isn't Going To Bite





Lost in thought, Jonny gently held Lainey's hand and looked straight at Kurt. "Kurt, Lainey's right. Even if that hundred million wasn't inthe picture, I'd still treat her well."



The matter was settled almost before anyone realized it.


Lainey couldn't help but picture herself as the wife of the CEO of a public company.


The thought made her pulse quicken with pride and anticipation.


Finally, she would have everything she had dreamed of.



And as far as she was concerned, there was no longer any place for Eleanor in their lives.


While they excitedly finalized wedding plans, Eleanor's world was anything but calm.


Myah's call had thrown a wrench into her plans. An unexpected inspection team had appeared out of nowhere, claiming Hope House was unsafe. It was old, precariously built on a seismic belt, and therefore a hazard.


They had ten days to relocate or face a forced eviction.



Eleanor spent two sleepless nights sifting through every possible option.


Finally, with her apprentice's help, she found a suitable site. Relief should have washed over her,but it didn't. Lillian had come by to offer comfort, but her words only added to Eleanor's worries. "Eleanor, isn't this land owned by the Stewart Group?"


Eleanor froze and immediately pulled up the Qualen Estates files.


Oh yes.


How could she have forgotten? Qualen Estates was a Stewart Group subsidiary.


Lillian, noticing Eleanor's stress, approached with a teasing grin. "You and Nolan... you two seem pretty close. Why not just talk to him?"


Eleanor stiffened. Lillian had somehow let slip to Ryland about Nolan's supposed impotence.


Ryland, of course, had scolded her and then gone on about how men sometimes like to exaggerate their...abilities in private.


It all added up. Nolan was definitely good in bed, and if Eleanor ended up with him, she would undoubtedly be happy.


Lillian felt it was practically her duty to nudge them together.


Eleanor, meanwhile, shifted uncomfortably under Lillian's knowing gaze.


"Close?" Eleanor echoed, a little sharp. "I barely know him." But Lillian wasn't fooled. Her eyes sparkled mischievously. "Come on, Eleanor, be honest. Are you hiding something from me?"


Could it be that Eleanor had shared secret moments with Nolan?


Eleanor's cheeks burned as she shot Lillian a glare,exasperated. "No. Nothing."


Lillian raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced.


Just as she was about to press further, Eleanor's phone buzzed.She checked it and froze.


"Qualen Estates refused to sell?" Her expression darkened instantly.


Lillian let out a small laugh. "See? Fate is practically shoving you toward Nolan."


She gave Eleanor's shoulder a playful pat. "Too shy to make a move? Shall I set up a meeting for you?"


Eleanor resisted visibly.

 
This wasn't about someone arranging things for her. She had promised herself she would stay away from Nolan, and she wasn't about to dash into his arms now.



Pride wouldn't let her.


But Lillian could see through the tough exterior.


Eleanor was all resolve on the surface, but her heart was soft. For the sake of the orphanage, she would bend if she had to.



With a playful nudge, Lillian pressed on. "Oh, please,what's there to be scared of? Nolan isn't going to bite. And don't forget, that jerk of an ex-husband has already gone public with his engagement to Lainey,and the Todds and Gilberts are working together.If you don't take advantage of Nolan's power, you'll have to rely on the Enigma Group, and even if you move Hope House, they'll still manage to interfere."


Lillian had already heard that once the two families locked in their alliance, the Gilberts poured money into the Todd Group. Not long after, Hope House started facing problems.


Officially, it all looked unrelated, but she refused to believe the families didn't have a hand in it.


Eleanor considered this quietly and realized Lillian had a point.


While she didn't take the Gilberts or the Todds seriously, their constant meddling was a headache.


More importantly, the frequent relocations weren't good for Myah or the kids.


Rather than risk exposing her identity using the Enigma Group's connections, it made more sense to leverage Nolan's influence.


Still, the situation served as a harsh reminder of her earlier bold claims.
###Chapter 49 | Truly Appreciate What You've Done





Half an hour later, Eleanor found herself sitting across from Nolan in a quiet, refined café just opposite the Stewart Group building. Nolan looked his usual self-composed, unreadable, and perfectly at ease.



Meanwhile, Eleanor's attention kept drifting to Lillian,who was perched right beside her like a cat itching to knock something off the table.


Honestly, why had she let Lillian tag along?


She already knew how much Lillian loved meddling,and now her presence only made it harder for Eleanor to speak.


With a quiet sigh, Eleanor shot her a sharp, warning look.


Lillian's lips curved into a little pout, a flicker of  disappointment crossing her face.


Still, she knew better than to overstay her welcome,so she rose to her feet.



Leaning close, she whispered in Eleanor's ear with a grin only the two could catch. "Relax. My brother swears those rumors about Nolan being impotent are lies. HHe's definitely good in bed. So go on and snatch him up! I'll cheer for you!"


Then, with a sly wink at Nolan, she swept out of the café looking far too pleased with herself.


Eleanor froze, her mind blanking. What on earth was that?



Lillian was getting bolder and more outrageous by the day.


Shaking it off, she forced herself to focLIS.


After a long breath,she pulled a folder from her bag and pushed it across the table. "Mr. Stewart," she began carefully, "about the Qualen Estates land, I know your company isn't planning to sell, but I need  it badly. I'm prepared to increase my offer by ten percent."


Of course, she wasn't just some ordinary buyer. She was the hidden force behind the Enigma Group.


If it weren't not for the risk of exposing herself, she wouldn't be here, lowering herself to ask a favor.


Nolan, however, didn't even blink. His fingers rested lazily against the table as he opened the document,skimmed a page, then shut it again and slid it back toward her. "Not for sale," he said flatly.


Eleanor's lips pressed into a thin line. If it wasn't up for sale, why had he agreed to meet in the first place? Was he playing her?


She clenched her jaw. "Then what will it take for you to agree, Mr.Stewart?"


At that, Nolan finally raised his eyes, their depth unreadable. "Miss Warren, I said it's not for sale. But that doesn't mean other arrangements can't be made."  Her stomach tightened. What was he implying?


For a moment, she realized she didn't understand this man at all; perhaps she never had.


Nolan caught the guarded look in her eyes. He noticed it, but it didn't bother him in the slightest.


He then reached into his briefcase, pulled out a folder, and slid a document across the table.


Eleanor glanced at it and froze.



A deed of gift for that land?


He was giving it away, just like that? Her eyes widened in disbelief.



She scanned the page again, and the truth finally sank in.



This didn't make sense. Why would he...


She looked up, blurting the question without hesitation. "Why are you doing this?"

 
Nolan leaned back with ease, his posture casual, his eyes revealing nothing.


"Our foundation has always backed Hope House.This is no different," he replied evenly, as though it was nothing out of the ordinary.


Eleanor studied him closely, trying to pierce through the calm mask he wore.


Yet no matter how hard she tried, his thoughts remained a mystery.


Still, the issue that had weighed on her heart was resolved,and that alone steadied her.


She pushed aside the swirl of emotions and spoke earnestly. "Thank you, Mr. Stewart, On behalf of the children, I truly appreciate what you've done."


A faint arch lifted his brow, and something playful lit up in his eyes.


Leaning forward, closing the space between them until his presence felt overwhelming,he murmured "And how exactly do you plan on thanking me, Miss Warren?" The effortless authority in his voice only made the air around him feel heavier.


Eleanor's pulse stumbled. Instinctively, she shifted back, trying to create some distance. "If there ever comes a time you need my help," she said softly, "I'lI do everything I can."
###Chapter 50 Nolan's Clearly Into You





An empty promise? How amusing.


Nolan's lips curved faintly before he straightened,slipping back into his usual polished composure.


Yet the glimmer of amusement in his eyes betrayed him. Eleanor frowned slightly. Had she said something wrong?



She was just about to ask when a sudden ringtone broke the moment,



It wasn't her phone-it was Nolan's. He answered briskly, but as he listened, his calm expression hardened into something far more severe. The shift was so sudden it startled Eleanor.


Snapping the call to an end, he rose from his chair in one smooth movement. "Sign the agreement.Something urgent came up." And just like that, he was gone, the door swinging shut behind him.



Eleanor stared after him, bewildered.


What could possibly shake someone like Nolan so much? Still, it wasn't her place to pry.


Exhaling slowly, she gathered herself, signed the contract, and left the café with the file in hand.


Lillian hadn't gone far. The moment she spotted Eleanor, she practically bolted over. "So? How did it go? Nolan didn't look very happy when he left. Don't tell me the deal collapsed!"


Eleanor, not in the mood for a barrage of questions,simply handed her the folder.


"What? He really agreed?" Lillian snatched it open,already buzzing with disbelief.


But when her eyes fell on the bold print inside, her jaw nearly dropped to the ground. "No way. Eleanor,am I hallucinating?" Her gaze darted around nervously as she clutched the contract as though afraid someone might snatch it from her hands.


Eleanor rolled her eyes at her dramatics. "Aren't you supposed to be from the Brooks family? Try not to look so desperate."


But Lillian was practically shaking. An entire plot of land worth billions... just given away like it was nothing?


Even on her eighteenth birthday, her father and brother hadn't spoiled her with anything close to that.


And Eleanor and Nolan weren't even... related.


Her excitement quickly shifted to suspicion.


She eyed Eleanor, dead serious now. "Hold on. You didn't... sell yourself to him, did you? No way. You're Enigma. You don't need to trade yourself for land.Love should be taken slowly, not..."


"Stop." Eleanor cut in before Lillian could run  off with her own ideas. "He didn't ask me for anything, and l didn't offer anything. He said it was support for Hope House. That's all."



She repeated his explanation about Stewart Group's long-term support for Hope House.


Lillian, however, wasn't convinced. She squinted at Eleanor, her expression makingit clear she wasn't fooled. "Girl, you've really gotten yourself into something. Nolan's clearly into you."


After all, what kid of corporate sponsorship involved giving away an entire plot of land?


Lillian couldn't come up with a single explanation,other than romance.


At this point, she didn't even need to push them together.



With the way Nolan was moving, Eleanor was bound to get caught up in his pace sooner or later.


Still, being with Nolan wasn't all sunshine. His name alone drew attention, and his admirers weren't exactly few.


The thought made Lillian uneasy, leaving her worried about whether Eleanor could handle the pressure that came with him.


Eleanor, on the other hand, wasn't indulging in such wild ideas.


She gave Lillian a light tap on the forehead and laughed. "Don't start weaving your own romance novel. Nolan said it was for charity, so take his word for it. Let's move on."


Maybe Nolan was simply using Hope House as a chance to polish Stewart Group's public image. It didn't have to mean more.



"Fine, fine." Lillian pouted, but her playful mood quickly returned. "Anyway, it's a win! We should celebrate. Come on, drinks are on me!"
###Chapter 51 They're Only Asking For $100 Million





Eleanor was about to nod when her phone vibrated.


A glance at the screen made her pause. "Sorry,Lillian, I'll have to take this. We'll catch up another time."


Knowing Eleanor's status and the weight of her responsibilities, Lillian didn't protest. She released her arm with an easy grin. "No problem, babe.Just promise to call me when you're free."


Lillian gave a cheeky wink before strutting off,lighthearted as always.


Watching her friend disappear into the distance,Eleanor allowed herself a faint smile before lifting the phone to her ear.


"Boss, the Stewart family just placed an order through the Underground Network. They're  demanding the Soul Surgeon, claiming they'll pay whatever it takes. Just now, they even raised the offer-money or otherwise, any terms can be negotiated. What's your decision?"


The woman's tone on the phone carried a clear hesitation.


Normally, such requests came often, accompanied by staggering bids, some even reaching a billion.Eleanor had turned every single one away. It was hard to imagine this time being any different.


But the image of Nolan's uncharacteristically tense expression flashed across her mind, stirring something within her.


Could this desperation be for Fannie?


Eleanor's fingers tightened around the phone. Then,after a soft exhale, she gave her verdict. "Accept it."


On the other end, silence stretched before the woman blurted in disbelief, "Boss...what?"


Eleanor's face remained composed, her voice level. $100 million. And the location must be cleared. No one stays."


Her double identity had to remain buried. If Nolan lingered nearby, his sharp eyes might see through her facade.


The woman on the line was stunned. One hundred million?


That was far less than what others had offered, yet this time Eleanor.relented.


Was the gossip circulating in Elepdon true?


Was Eleanor somehow involved with Nolan?


She dared not probe further. With respectful haste,she replied, "Understood, boss. I'll make the arrangements."


When Erick received the news, he could hardly contain his excitement. "Mr. Stewart, the Soul Surgeon has agreed! They're only asking for $100million. The only condition is that no one can be present during the treatment." The money wasn't a problem. It was the stipulation that gave him pause.


Fannie was the family's precious gem.


The thought of leaving her in the care of some mysterious doctor felt reckless. What if something went wrong?


But Erick reminded himself that people with real talent were often a little unusual, even eccentric. If this Soul Surgeon was as skilled as their reputation suggested, then perhaps trust was the only option.


Ultimately, the choice wasn't his to make. It rested with Nolan.


Nolan's eyes lingered on Fannie's pale, still figure.


After a long pause, his voice cut through the tension."Do it. Follow their terms."



Thirty minutes later, a woman dressed head to toe in black, her face hidden behind a silver mask, stepped into the hospital. Erick's eyes followed her as she entered the room.So this was the famous Soul Surgeon? He hadn't expected her to be this young, and a woman, no less.Appearances never told the whole story.


Eleanor, oblivious to his scrutiny, had already made her way to Fannie's bedside. She examined Fannie carefully, her brow knitting as the truth revealed itself.


So that was it. NNo wonder Fannie's body was so frail.


A rare genetic mutation had left her with a blood disorder so unusual it was scarcely recorded anywhere in the world.


For most doctors, it was untouchable, impossible to cure.


And yet, Fannie had survived this long, thanks to the Stewart family's tireless efforts.


However, untreatable did not mean hopeless.


From her compact kit, Eleanor produced needles.

With practiced precision, she inserted each one, channeling energy into the girl's weakened body.


When the procedure ended nearly half an hour later,the pallor on Fannie's cheeks had given way to a faint,healthy flush.


Eleanor allowed herself a quiet breath of relief. At least part of her debt to Nolan had been lessened.


She tucked the girl in gently, then packed away her things and left the room.


Outside, Erick, blindfolded as she had ordered,hurried to her side. "Soul Surgeon, how is MMiss Stewart?" His tone brimmed with restrained urgency.


Eleanor answered evenly, "Her state has stabilized.But this illness is congenital. Long-term treatment is required. This was only the first stage. She'll need two more sessions, once a week, before she can be fully healed."


For the first time, someone had spoken with certainty about curing Fannie.


The Soul Surgeon's reputation was no exaggeration.  Ecstatic, Erick nearly bent in a full bow. "Thank you!Thank you, Soul Surgeon! I'll see that your fee is delivered immediately."


Eleanor only gave a small nod before vanishing down the corridor.


Once the silence returned, Erick removed his blindfold and pulled out his phone, his hands trembling with excitement as he sent a message."Boss, Miss Stewart can be saved."
###Chapter 52 I'll Let It Slide This Time




Word of the Soul Surgeon's upcoming consultation sent waves of excitement throughout the Underground Network.


A rush of hope lit up in the eyes of many influential people struggling with severe illnesses.


The inbox belonging to Eleanor's top disciple nearly burst with messages.


Even so, she knew the full story. Eleanor only agreed to this particular case because she felt personally responsible, not for any kind of payment.


For that reason, she had to refuse countless requests.





No matter how many she rejected, the stream of inquiries never slowed.


All she could do was wish that Eleanor might set aside a little time to make a few rare remedies,just to relieve some of the stress.


Glancing over the disciple's string of complaints,Eleanor erased them with a single swipe.


There was no way she could be everyone's hero.


Her plate was full, between her work at Hope House and the brand-new Enigma Group, leaving her with hardly any extra minutes in the day.


Once another hectic week had passed, it was time for Fannie's next round of treatment.


Progress was clear. Fannie had not regained consciousness, but her health was much better.


A worry tugged at Eleanor. If Fannie suddenly woke up,she might not be ready, so she hurried out of the room as soon as the treatment ended.


She might have béen rushing too quickly, as she ended up bumping straight into a man.


The impact was enough to stop her in her tracks. Heat crept up Eleanor's cheeks behind her mask,and she stepped back quickly to say, "I'm sorry."


Catching a clear glimpse of the man's face brought her to a standstill.


Nolan stood right there.


Panic flashed through her mind.


Maybe he wouldn't notice who she really was.


She had to get away fast.


With that idea pushing her, she spun around and made her way quickly toward the elevator.


Nolan narrowed his gaze, sizing up her clothing.Could that actually be the Soul Surgeon?


He had come straight from the office to check on Fannie's progress, only to come face-to-face with the Soul Surgeon here.


Still, the Soul Surgeon reminded him of Eleanor.

Could they be the same person? He dismissed the idea immediately as it sounded ridiculous.


Yet, he couldn't help but call out, "Where are you off to,Soul Surgeon?"


Hearing his voice, Eleanor felt her chest tighten, so she lowered her tone. "I can't tell you."


Without saying anything more, she slipped inside the elevator.


Her quick exit caught Nolan's eye, and he stood there deep in thought.


Nearly running, Eleanor hurried out of the hospital.


That was too close.


Next time she visited Fannie, she would need to be extra careful.


After puulling off her mask and working the tension from her cheeks, Eleanor noticed a call from Lillian lighting up her phone.


"Eleanor, where are you right now? I'll come get you!" After sharing her location, Eleanor watched as Lillian's eye-catching purple-red convertible rolled up beside her.


As soon as Eleanor settled into the passenger seat,Lillian leaned over and gave her a curious look."Eleanor, what have you been up to? You look like something rattled you!"


Eleanor shifted awkwardly under her friend's stare and cleared her throat. "It's nothing. I just left the hospital."


Raising an eyebrow, Lillian looked doubtful but decided not to argue.


She started the engine and made a dramatic pout."Just so you know, I get you for the rest of the day.If you ditch me again, we're officially done!"


A wave of guilt hit Eleanor, and she sent Lillian an apologetic glance. "I'm sorry, Lillian. Things have been kind of overwhelming lately."


After studying Eleanor's tired expression, Lillian let out a sigh and softened her tone. "Okay, since you've been running yourself ragged, I'll let it slide this time."


Their conversation drifted to lighter topics, and soon Lillian brought up some gossip. "Oh, before | forget,did you know Lainey and Jonny finally set a wedding date? They picked the 18th of next month. Lainey's father has even tossed in $100 million as a wedding gift!"


Eleanor gave a distracted nod, her mind wandering elsewhere.


Noticing Eleanor's lack of reaction, Lillian finally relaxed.


If Eleanor could hear that news without flinching,then maybe she really had let go of that jerk. Feeling relieved, Lillian pressed her foot down. "Hang on tight, babe. We're about to have the time of our lives!"
###Chapter 53 | Wanted To Discuss Fannie's Aftercare





Following several days spent with Lillian, another appointment was already waiting.


This would mark the third and final round of treatment.



Fannie stirred awake more than once throughout the procedure.


Still, with Eleanor in disguise, Fannie never guessed her true identity.


As Eleanor prepared to insert the last needle, the room's door swung open, and Nolan entered, his eyes covered by a cloth.


Her hand faltered just a moment, frustration prickling at her nerves.


Of all days, why did he have the luxury to supervise  in person now?


At least he had the sense to keep his eyes shielded,or else she would have had to stop right there.


Once she regained her composure, Eleanor inserted the last needle.


A short wait would be necessary before she could remove the needles.


Nolan remained off to the side, saying nothing.


Eleanor expected the silence to linger, but he broke it with an unexpected compliment. "Your abilities as a healer are impressive, Soul Surgeon."


She offered no reply.


Nolan continued, undeterred by her lack of response,"The last doctor who treated my sister believed her case was almost hopeless. In only three weeks,you've managed to help her recover."


Nolan rarely spoke at such length.


Was he trying to uncover something? A frown settled on Eleanor's face, but she kept her silence.


Since his eyes stayed hidden, she figured there was nothing for him to pick up on as long as she stayed quiet.


Surprisingly, Nolan shifted just enough to face her directly, even with the cloth over his eyes. "Soul Surgeon, are you familiar with clinical medicine at Northbridge University?"


Eleanor's hand trembled for a moment. "I know a little about it."


Clearly, this bothersome man would not give up until she replied.



Everyone knew Northbridge University ranked as the nation's top school. Acting clueless would only invite suspicion.



Sure enough, after she answered, Nolan edged closer.




Although a black cloth still covered his eyes, the faint  lift of his lips showed he was in good spirits.


Standing so near, Eleanor could once again catch that familiar crisp scent of his.


"I happen to know someone who had a degree in the clinical medicine from Northbridge University. She'd be thrilled if she heard you were interested in it."


Could he be talking about her?


Was he growing suspicious?


No,she needed to cut this conversation short.


Luckily, the session wrapped up just then, giving her an excuse to steer away from the topic.


"The treatment is finished, and your sister has made a full recovery. There will be no need for us to meet again." Eleanor delivered the words quickly, gathered her tools without delay, and intended to leave the room,


Yet, Nolan blocked her way without a hint of panic."What's the hurry? I wanted to discuss Fannie's  aftercare."


Staring at his striking features, Eleanor fought back a wave of irritation.


"I'l send all the instructions to the number that reached out before." She tried to slip past him.


Nolan appeared to sense what she was about to do and stepped in just enough to block her way again."I'm sorry, I suppose I'm a bit restless. I want to hear about my sister's condition directly from you."


Even with the cloth over his eyes, it felt as though his gaze pinned her in place.


A sense of impatience crept up on Eleanor.


She nearly blurted out a demand to know what he really wanted.


Her better judgment stopped her just in time.


Exposing herself now would bring nothing but headaches.


With her jaw set and her voice steady, she said, "Mr. Stewart, I'd appreciate it if you respected my boundaries. I trust your staff has already explained my terms."


Her meaning was obvious. She wanted him to stop digging into who she really was.


A trace of amusement flickered across Nolan's face as he lifted his brows. He could see that Eleanor still stayed sharp.


After a moment, he finally moved aside, letting her through.


Relief swept over Eleanor.


She reached for the door, only for Nolan's low voice to echo behind her.


Soft as it was, the sound struck her like a jolt."Eleanor."





Her entire body went rigid.


Every muscle froze.


Was this a confession of what he knew?  Or was he just fishing for a reaction?


She couldn't let anything slip.


Without turning or giving any sign, Eleanor pulled the door open and slipped out, never once looking back.


Nolan removed the black cloth from his eyes, a pleased smile settling on his lips as he watched her leave.


There was no doubt in his mind now. It truly was Eleanor.
###Chapter 54 You Deserve Each Other




In the days that followed the incident, Eleanor kept herself out of sight. Not once did she dare step near Hope House.


The fear of Nolan lingered. If he turned up again and pressed her with more questions, sooner or later she would give herself away.


But while Eleanor hid, Lillian grew restless. One afternoon, she marched straight to the Podium Apartments and all but dragged Eleanor outside.


Reluctantly, Eleanor let herself be pulled along,agreeing to a shopping trip she hadn't wanted.


Their timing, however, couldn't have been worse. By sheer misfortune, they crossed paths with Lainey and Jonny.


Lillian muttered a curse at their rotten luck and was about to steer Eleanor away when a sharp voice rang out.


"Jonny, you don't even bother looking properly before saying I'm stunning!"


Something about that voice made Lillian pause mid-step. Her eyes flicked to Eleanor's, and in the same instant, they both stopped moving.


Inside the bridal boutique, Jonny stood before an irritated Lainey, rubbing his temple like the weight of her words had triggered an instant headache.


Yet what choice did he have? Placating her was the only way forward.


"For me, Lainey," he replied weakly, offering the most hollow reassurance he could muster, "you'll always be the most beautiful."


The words were flat, so empty they barely passed as sincerity.


Frustration twisted Lainey's face as her fingers clenched the hem of the gown. Since the day their wedding date was announced,Jonny had worn the look of a man being marched to execution.



And as if that weren't enough, Sallie had the audacity to survive her ordeal-and then starve herself in some pathetic attempt to derail their marriage.


Fortunately, Vickie had stepped in on her behalf,cutting Sallie off before she could succeed.



None of it mattered in the end.


Every setback only pushed Lainey closer to her goal.


Sooner or later, she would become Jonny's wife.


The thought brought a smile back to her lips. She slipped her arm through Jonny's and spoke in a coaxing tone. "Jonny, you really are too sweet. But these dresses don't please me. Let's try another boutique."


Jonny's reply was little more than a grunt, neither yes nor no. Pretending not to notice his indifference, Lainey turned briskly toward the fitting room to change.


From where they stood, Lillian let out a low whistle."Would you look at that? Lainey really does have the patience of a saint."


Eleanor smirked and lifted her thumb in mock praise."Oh, she's got plenty."


So much for true love.



Right after their wedding date was set, Jonny's mask started to slip.


Men always longed for what wasn't theirs.


When Lainey stepped out of the bridal shop with Jonny at her side, the first thing she caught were the mocking looks plastered across Lillian's and Eleanor's faces.


A prick of heat crawled up her neck.


Had they seen everything inside?


She swallowed the embarrassment down, refusing to let it surface. Straightening her spine, she plastered on a triumphant air, chin tilted high. "Miss Warren, if you're that desperate to cross paths with Jonny, you don't need to drag poor Ms. Brooks along as cover."


Lainey had always known how to weaponize her tongue.


With one cutting remark, she managed to jab at Eleanor while sowing seeds of discord toward Lillian.


But the trap fell flat-Lillian didn't flinch.


Instead, she circled the couple slowly, her lips curling into a smile that dripped with venom. "A tramp and a fool-you deserve each other. May you both choke on your happiness."


"You-" Lainey's anger nearly boiled over, but she choked back the words before they escaped.


This was Lillian, spoiled by the Brooks family. She wasn't someone she could afford to cross.


StilI, resentment festered. How could Eleanor-ordinary, with no power or pedigree-earn the  protection of both the Stewarts and the Brooks family? It was unbearable.


Lainey was ready to spit more poison, when Jonny suddenly tugged her hand.


"Lainey, drop it. We're leaving," he said.


Something about sitting across from Eleanor unsettled Jonny. The sight of his ex-wife-calm,unruffled, radiant in her own quiet way-left a strange flicker of shame gnawing at him.


He should have been boasting, showing her how far above her he now stood.



Yet the memory of that hundred-million wedding gift from Lainey's father weighed heavy on him, making his pride feel cheap.


One day, he promised himself, once his company survived this crisis, he would pay it back in full-then rub his success in her face.


With his word given, Lainey had no room left to press the matter. Still, in her heart, one truth remained unshakable:when the wedding came, she had to be the star.


The gown she wore needed to scream perfection.Nothing less would do.


Before leaving, Lainey cast Eleanor one last poisonous glare, then spun on her heel and stormed off.


Across the way, Eleanor lifted her thumb toward Lillian with a small, knowing grin. Nicely done.
###Chapter 55 The Design Is Siren Amour





Back from the mall, Eleanor slipped easily into the shadows again, keeping her presence quiet and unnoticed.


Avoidance was her protection-she had no intention of risking a run-in with Nolan, cunning as a fox and twice as persistent.


Her work required little face-to-face contact anyway,so hiding wasn't difficult.


But carefully laid plans had a way of unraveling.


An embossed card arrived soon after, Nolan's invitation to a party celebrating Fannie's recovery.


Her instinct was to'decline immediately. Yet after a long pause, she decided to accept it.


What could he really do if she chose to keep her guard up? Nothing she couldn't counter.


And besides, the Hope House still lingered over her like a debt unpaid. On paper, she owed him,and appearances demanded she show up.


The evening crept in faster than she lik<ed.


At the grand entrance of the Lumina Hotel, Eleanor stepped out of Lillian's sleek sports car, her composure wrapped tight around her nerves.


Inside, chandeliers spilled light over a bustling crowd,where gowns shimmered and conversations swirled.


Among them stood Lainey, dressed to impress, her pale pink off-shoulder gown making her look eager to be noticed as she floated from group to group,fishing for relevance.


As if pulled by instinct, Lainey's head turned toward the door.


The instant her gaze landed on Eleanor, her polished smile cracked, faltered, then hardened into something sharper.Jealousy flared in her eyes like a spark catching flame.


What the hell was that bitch doing here?


Lainey had originally intended to drag Jonny along,certain that parading him would cement her importance in front of everyone.


But at the last moment, Jonny brushed her off,muttering about company work and refusing to come.


Deep down, she knew the truth-it wasn't the workload, it was his discomfort. Without a formal invitation, he didn't dare show his face.


Still, Lainey told herself that appearances were everything. In society, status wasn't given; it was claimed. If one stood tall enough, no one would dare caIl it embarrassing.


With that thought, she smoothed her expression and turned back to the crowd, a polished smile curving across her lips. "Jonny Todd and I are marrying soon.I do hope you'll all join us for the celebration." She lingered on Jonny's surname deliberately, letting it roll off her tongue as if it carried the weight of an empire.


But the guests gathered by the Stewart family were anything but ordinary. To them, the Todd name was small change. Not a single expression shifted in admiration.


Awkward silence stretched-until Darleen Faulkner,who had brought Lainey in, looped her arm through Lainey's with easy affection. "Lainey's gown is a custom commission from Enigma," she remarked brightly. "The design is Siren Amour. Surely, we could persuade her to give us a preview?"


Color rose faintly to Lainey's cheeks, and she pretended to let out a careful laugh. "Darleen, I'm flattered, but I must apologize. I wasn't completely satisfied with some details, so Enigma is making final adjustments for mne."


The explanation rippled through the group like a spark. Enigma making revisions for her? That wasn't something just anyone could demand.


Even they struggled to secure such attention.


This was a privilege reserved for the VIP clients.


Eventually, the dismissive looks melted away, and the socialites swarmed Lainey as if she were the evening's centerpiece.


"Lainey, you're simply dazzling-Elepdon's true leading lady!"


"| heard Jonny's ex-wife didn't even get a proper wedding when she tied the knot with him!"


"Exactly, how could a bumpkin like that ever be compared to Lainey?"


"Honestly, Jonny must have lost his mind to marry someone like her in the first place!"



Lainey might not have been the most powerful among them, but her ties to Enigma gave her an edge, and in their eyes, that was enough to warrant flattery. Yet Eleanor sat unmoved. Words like that only dirtied the mouths that spoke them, never the one they targeted.


Lillian, however, had no patience for such nonsense.


Her voice sliced through the chatter, dripping with sarcasm. "Isn't it amusing? Someone crashes an event without so much as an invitation, only to strut around bragging about a gown that went out of fashion years ago."


If memory served, Siren Amour was one of Eleanor's older designs, a style recycled so many times it had long since lost its shine.


The hum of chatter inside the ballroom vanished in an instant, the silence heavy enough to press against the walls.



Lainey's practiced smile wavered, almost collapsing under the weight of being called out so brazenly.


From the moment she stepped into the event, she had been walking on eggshells, terrified someone might realize she hadn't been invited at all-just smuggled in by Darleen's side.


Now, Lillian had not only dragged that truth into the open but also mocked the Siren Amour she had fought tooth and nail to claim.


How was she supposed to win favor among these women now?



Damn that Lillian!



Why was she always standing in her way?


Still, Lainey knew better than to lash out. Offending Lillian would be suicide. So she steadied her breath,pasted on a meek expression, and spoke with deliberate humility. "Ms. Brooks, you misunderstand.I would never boast. I simply admire Enigma's work so deeply that even an older design feels like a treasure to me. And truthfully, Siren Amour is only a spare. Just last week, I placed an order for Enigma's newest release-though I can't be sure it will be finished in time for my wedding." Her lashes dipped, her gaze lowering as if embarrassment had softened her into modesty.


From across the room, Eleanor finally broke her silence, her lips curving into a quiet, amused smile."Is that so? How curious-I wasn't aware Enigma offered pre-orders on unreleased gowns."
###Chapter 56 Hope House Will Be Relocated Soon





Because her workload was unpredictable, Eleanor had never once opened reservations for Enigma gowns.


Lainey's knack for fabricating lies with a straight face seemed to sharpen by the day.


Most of the women in the room had never even laid eyes on an authentic Enigma piece, much less understood the designer's rules.


That ignorance quickly turned into open hostility toward Eleanor. Disdain flickered across painted faces, and whispers turned sharp.


"You're just an abandoned wife from some orphanage. What could you possibly know about high fashion?"


"Exactly-how dare you spout nonsense here and  accuse Lainey of lying?"


But not everyone swallowed Lainey's claim so easily.A few had enough knowledge to hesitate, and Darleen was one of them.


Her confident smile wavered, as though something tugged at the back of her mind. "Now that I think about it... Enigma doesn't allow pre-orders. When l was planning my birthday, my mother and | casually asked..."



Darleen's words faltered, the last note uncertain,before her eyes landed on Lainey with a flicker of doubt.



Could she really have been fooled?


After all, she had vouched for Lainey, snuck her into this very party, and gone out of her way to polish her reputation. If Lainey was bluffing, her credibility would shatter with hers.


The subtle crack in Darleen's tone was all it took. A ripple spread through the circle, voices dropping,  expressions shifting. One by one, people began to second-guess.


Could Lainey really be a liar?


Heat crawled up Lainey's neck, her nails biting into her palms until they nearly broke skin.


Damn that Eleanor.


A blind strike, yet it landed perfectly.


If she didn't turn this around, her footing in these circles would crumble.



Drawing a steadying breath, she lifted her chin,forcing her eyes to glisten as though she were on the verge of tears. "Miss Warren, I understand you resent me because of Jonny, but does that mean you can invent lies to smear me?"


Her voice wavered delicately, the hint of a sob timed to perfection. "The truth is, years ago,I had the good fortune to meet Besty Juarez. When she learned I was getting married, she personally made an exception for me. Tell me, is that so wrong?" Gasps stirred the crowd. Besty was one of Enigma's top executives, a woman so rarely seen in public she was practically a legend.


Could Lainey truly have ties to someone like her?


Darleen's doubt melted instantly, her eyes lighting up with sudden excitement. She rushed forward and clasped Lainey's hand, her earlier hesitation forgotten. "Lainey, why didn't you say so before? You actually know Besty Juarez? I'm preparing for my engagement soon-please,you must introduce me to her!"



The moment Darleen spoke, the others quickly swarmed closer, their voices rising in eager chorus.


"That's right, Lainey, we're all your friends-you can't leave us out!"



"Lainey, you're too lovely and generous to refuse us.You'll introduce us too, won't you?"


The chorus of flattery washed over her, and a faint gleam of triumph flickered in Lainey's eyes.  But beneath that thin layer of pride, panic churned.


She had no connection to Besty at all.


What excuse could possibly save her now?


If she slipped, the lie would come crashing down on her head.



Her expression twisted between smugness and fear,emotions flashing so quickly across her face they almost tripped over one another. From a distance,Lillian folded her arms, smirking. "Eleanor, look at her -Lainey's face is doing backflips."


Eleanor barely registered Lillian's words, her mind snagging on something else entirely. Her stomnach tightened-Nolan was watching her.


From the second-floor balcony, he leaned against a pillar, red wine in hand, his figure framed by the warm light above. He was devastatingly handsome,but that wasn't what made her pulse quicken.


It was his eyes. The steady, unflinching weight of his gaze was so deep it felt as though he could peel  back her every defense.


Eleanor's pulse stumbled, and without giving Lillian a chance to babble further, she seized her friend by the wrist and pulled her straight into the lounge.


The door slammed shut behind them, the lock snapping into place with a sharp click.


With Eleanor out of his sight, Nolan finally allowed his gaze to drift away.


A faint smile ghosted across his lips as he lowered himself with practiced ease onto a circular couch nearby, every movement steeped in unhurried confidence.



From the side, Erick stepped forward, document folder in hand. His tone was deferential. "Mr.Stewart,the team has already begun construction. Hope House will be relocated soon."


Nolan scanned through the papers with little comment, though a flicker of thought shadowed his expression. Was it coincidence, or had Lillian and Eleanor displayed an oddly precise knowledge of Enigma's internal rules?


Closing the file, he leaned back, long fingers drumming lightly against the armrest. "Look into Enigma."


Erick blinked, startled by the sudden order.


Why would Nolan concern himself with a women's fashion house?


Could it be... was he planning to surprise Eleanor with something extravagant?


The thought stirred, but he kept his face composed and answered steadily, "Understood, Mr. Stewart. I'll see to it at once,"
 ###Chapter 57 You've Got A Deal!





Once the banquet drew to an end, the city lights gradually shimmered to life outside.


Spotting a chance when nobody was paying attention, Eleanor approached Fannie and took a quick peek at her not far away.


Fannie's face looked bright and healthy, and her whole energy felt vibrant and spirited.


As long as Fannie took it easy, there likely wouldn't be any serious issues.


After that, Eleanor turned away and returned to the apartment with Lillian.


Lillian barely made it through the door before flopping onto the couch, grinning from ear to ear."Eleanor, did you see Lainey? She couldn't even wait for the banquet to end before storming out! She's definitely hiding something! I swear, I can't get over it!"


The memory of Lainey struggling to look calm while panicking inside made Lillian all the more pleased with herself.


Seeing Lillian so delighted, Eleanor couldn't help but smile, too. Before she could say a word, her phone started buzzing on the coffee table.


Betsy's name flashed on the screen. "Sorry to bother you, boss. Here's the situation. There's a lady in the shop saying she's getting married soon. She wants a custom wedding gown done right away and doesn't care what it costs. She insists we accept her request.I honestly don't know what to do, so I wanted to ask you first."


Lillian overheard Betsy's call thanks to her sharp ears.



Excitement danced in her eyes as she chimed in with a sly grin, "Eleanor, you can't pass this up! Just think about it, your design on that manipulator at her own wedding. That'll be a sight to see!" If there was drama to be found, Lillian wanted a front-row seat.


Even so, Eleanor found herself intrigued by Lainey's little scheme.



A smirk appeared on Eleanor's face as she responded with ease, "Go ahead and accept the order. Just make sure she knows the fee is $10million."



"$10 million?" Besty's voice shot up in surprise.


Normally,their custom gowns didn't go for more than five million.


That amount sounded outrageous, as if they were demanding a fortune fit for royalty.


Still, Eleanor had given her orders, and Besty wasn't about to argue. "Understood, boss."


Once she ended the call, Besty headed over to where Lainey was waiting and flashed her a cheerful grin."Miss Gilbert, the main office has approved your request,Because the deadline is so tight, all the designers and craftspeople will need to work extra hours. As for the price-"


A surge of excitement showed on Lainey's face as she interjected, "Whatever it costs, I'll pay it. Just tell me."



She figured, no matter how fancy a dress could be,the price tag couldn't possibly be outrageous.


Besty offered a calm smile and raised ten fingers."$10 million."



Lainey's happiness faded on the spot, her eyes going wide with disbelief. "W-what did you say?"


Unfazed, Besty kept her polite expression and repeated, "$10 million, Miss Gilbert."


That kind of money could easily snatch up a whole collection of top-tier gowns from other luxury brands!



Enigma's creations rarely broke the five million mark before, so when did their prices shoot up like this? Was Besty seriously trying to puIl one over on her?


Lainey felt the urge to walk out then and there.


But her pride held her back. She had already promised everyone her intentions-failing to get the dress now would only make her look ridiculous.


She feared the thought of becoming the punchline among the socialites.


There was no way she would let herself endure that kind of humiliation!


Besides, she wasn't the one paying the bill, anyway.


Determined not to lose face, she squared her shoulders and forced out a response. "Alright, you've got a deal! $10 million!"


Her hand shook as Lainey filled out the paperwork for the custom gown.


Still, in her mind, it was a fair price to pay for all eyes on her.


Eleanor would never outshine her.
###Chapter 58 Where Did All That Money Go




Thirty minutes later, Lainey breezed into the Todd family's home, the signed contract clutched in her hand, and her mood soaring.


She was eager to tell Jonny the news.


If she dazzled everyone at the wedding, it would make him look good,too.


Surely, he would be thrilled.


Yet the moment she entered the living room, a completely different scene awaited her.


A sharp crash echoed as a glass shattered right at her feet.


"Lainey! Where did all that money go?" Jonny's eyes burned with fury, and for a moment, he looked ready to explode. Lainey instinctively backed away, shock and hurt flickering across her face.


Was he really lashing out at her over ten million?


So be it.



When the time came to turn her back on the Todd Group, she wouldn't hesitate because of him.


But until then, she would play along.


Once she regained her composure, she lifted her head,tears rolling down her cheeks. "Jonny, all I did was order a wedding gown from Enigma. I just wanted us to have a perfect wedding. You know how long I've dreamed of marrying you."


Back then, Jonny would always give in whenever she decided to turn on the charm.


But ten million wasn't a small sum! That was a massive amount!



He jumped through hoops, begged contacts, and scraped together investments. Even with the help of  several smaller firms, he hadn't managed to raise that much.


Yet, she spent it in the blink of an eye.


How could she be so reckless?


With each passing second, Jonny's frustration grew.His words came out colder than ever. "Lainey, do you have any idea what kind of mess the Todd Group is in right now? You're well aware we're struggling to keep the company afloat, and yet you chose to blow a fortune on a wvedding gown?"


When Eleanor was still around, she never wasted money like this.


Her wardrobe was simple, her lifestyle modest, and she rarely splurged on expensive jewelry.


He used to mock her for not fitting in with high society.


Now, he was starting to see that Eleanor had always managed the household wisely and genuinely cared about the Todd family's well-being! Unlike Lainey, who only knew how to spend!


Watching Jonny fume, Lainey felt her nerves panic.


She never expected him to lose his temper so completely over ten million, especially after everything they had been through.


Still, if this plan didn't work, she would just have to try something else. Unlike Eleanor, who lacked elegance and education, she knew exactly how to get her way whenever she needed to.


Putting on an anxious act, she reached out and gripped Jonny's hand tightly. "Jonny, please forgive me. I didn't mean to mess up. Please don't be mad at me...



Tears streamed down her face again, as though she had been deeply wronged.


She paused for a moment, then pressed on, "But everything I did was for you and your family! You have no idea what happened at the banquet. The moment I mnentioned that I'd ordered a dress from Enigma, all those usually arrogant socialites suddenly warmed up to me."


She locked eyes with Jonny. "You know how much everyone in Elepdon's upper class adores Enigma.Every socialite and aristocrat in town craves elegance, and none of them would pass up the chance to be linked with Enigma. Once I walk down the aisle in that gown, they'll all want to connect with me! These relationships could end up being a huge advantage for the Todd Group down the line!"



Her words struck a chord with Jonny.


The Todd Group never had a shortage of promising projects-what they lacked were reliable investors.


Should Lainey's new contacts turn into financial backers, the Todd Group would finally be safe from the Stewart Group's looming threats.


That realization softened Jonny's features. He reached out and drew her into his arms, all traces of anger gone. "Lainey, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you like tat. Please forgive me." Of course, Lainey still felt wounded, but she kept it hidden.




She leaned into his chest, speaking softly and sweetly. "It's fine, Jonny. As long as you know how much I care about us, that's all I need."
###Chapter 59 Show These Troublemakers The Door!


From that point on, Lainey's confidence only grew more inflated.

Within days, word had spread among nearly all the socialites in Elepdon that she had managed to snag Enigma's latest design.

At a bar owned by the Brooks Group, Lillian caught wind of Lainey's obnoxious bragging before even spotting her in the crowd.

Unbelievable.

What rotten luck!

With Eleanor buried in her work and unable to hang out with her, Lillian had simply hoped for a quiet night out at her family's place. The last thing she expected was to cross paths with this pretentious woman.

Any urge to unwind vanished instantly, and she made up her mind to slip out early.

But Lainey, ever observant, had already noticed Lillian's presence.

Champagne in hand, she strolled over with a practiced elegance.

"Ms. Brooks," Lainey called smoothly, giving Lillian a quick scan before laying on the flattery. "Do you enjoy Enigma's designs as well? If you're interested, I'd be happy to connect you with Besty."

She even tipped her chin upward at the end, clearly savoring her supposed upper hand.

Lillian nearly laughed out loud. As if she needed a favor from someone like Lainey to get her hands on Eleanor's work.

Lillian looked Lainey up and down, her gaze openly dismissive. "Miss Gilbert, if my memory serves me correctly, our bar has always reserved entry only for Elepdon's old aristocracy."

There was no mistaking her message-Lainey was out of place here. While Velvet Club stood as Elepdon's largest hotspot, the Brooks bar set the standard for exclusivity,reserved only for the VIP among VIPs.

Someone like Lainey, or even Jonny, had no business making it past the front door.

As she was called out so directly, Lainey's fingers tightened around her glass, and a flash of annoyance crossed her face.

Clearly, Lillian wasn't swayed by sweet talk or intimidation!

She counted on Enigma's status to pave the way, aiming to secure a connection to the Brooks family by winning Lillian over. Such a connection would have worked wonders for both the Todd Group and her own ambitions.

Yet Lillian was proving impossible to win over!

Meanwhile,Darleen watched the exchange with growing irritation. "She's my guest. What, are you planning to kick out guests now?"

She positioned herself between Lainey and Lillian."Don't get cocky just because your family's close with the Stewarts, Lillian. You don't get to walk all over the rest of us. Let me be clear, Lainey's with me, she's under my protection, and I won't let you push her around!"

She was desperate to impress Lainey, secretly hoping it would bring her closer to Besty as well.

Darleen was fueled by that hope, and her voice took on a sharper edge."On top of that, Lainey isn't merely an acquaintance of Besty's-they're actually related, even if it's distant. So, what reason could you possibly have for saying she doesn't belong here?"

Lillian nearly choked on her drink.

Lainey had a real talent for spinning tall.tales, and Darleen was gullible enough to buy every word.

Darleen's eagerness to cozy up to anyone useful had always grated on Lillian's nerves.

Today felt like the perfect moment to teach Darleen a lesson about rules. With a playful grin, Lillian kicked up her foot onto a nearby chair and rolled up her sleeves. "This is my family's territory. We decide who stays or goes. You're really willing to cross us just for Lainey's sake?" She addressed Darleen.

The Brooks name carried real weight in Elepdon, ranked firmly among the top ten families. Even without the Stewarts,their influence was undeniable.

In contrast, the Faulkner family barely scraped into the top fifty.

For a second,uncertainty flickered across Darleen's face.

Still, the thought of getting in Besty's good graces tempted her with visions of becoming the heir of the Faulkner family!

Gathering her courage, Darleen replied, "Ms. Brooks, there's no need for conflict. We're just here for a good time. Surely you wouldn't want people saying you kick out paying customers for no reason?"

That last line carried a subtle warning.

But Lillian wasn't one to back down. Raised in privilege, she was used to getting her way, and idle threats meant nothing to her.

With her hands on her hips and a mischievous spark in her eyes, she called out to the staff,"Well,what are you standing around for? Show these troublemakers the ddoor!"

The staff wasted no time and quickly moved in to show Lainey and Darleen the exit.

"Lillian, you'll pay for this! I won't forget.it!" Darleen yelled.
###Chapter 60 Show Up And Steal The Spotlight!


The scene downstairs was in complete disarray, but Ryland, relaxing upstairs, barely spared it a thought.

His only sister had always been his weakness, and he would let her get away with just about anything since they were kids. Unless Lillian managed to drag the Brooks family through the mud or get someone seriously hurt,he considered everything else fair game.

He let out a warm, helpless chuckle before heading back to the private room.

A massive floor-to-ceiling window offered a front-row view of the chaos below.

Nolan lounged quietly on the sofa, taking in the chaos without a word.

Ryland dropped into the seat next to him, downed a generous gulp of wine, and asked casually,'Nolan,what brings you here tonight?"

Nolan's unexpected arrival usually meant something big was brewing.

Ryland couldn't tell if it would spell trouble or opportunity.

Then Nolan's next sentence nearly made Ryland choke on his drink. "I've heard rumors that your sister might be Enigma."

"No way!" Ryland replied, sounding completely sure of himself.

Ryland couldn't imagine Lillian pulling off something like that.

Her reputation for being hopelessly unskilled preceded her. There was no way she could actually be Enigma.

If Lillian wasn't behind the mysterious identity, then Eleanor had to be. It was the only explanation for how both of them seemed to have inside knowledge of the Enigma Group and even quietly conducted business with them.

Even though they kept things under wraps, Nolan's sources had managed to dig up a few clues. Nolan didn't see any point in dancing around the issue with Ryland, so he spelled out his suspicions right away.

Ryland's eyes went wide, shock flickering in his gaze.

He instinctively leaned in, eyeing Nolan up and down, as if checking to see if his friend had lost his mind,before letting his guard down a bit.

"You can't be serious, Nolan," Ryland blurted out. "You're telling me Eleanor is Enigma? That's absurd! She double-majored in clinical finance, not fashion. What would she know about haute couture? Plus, isn't Enigma rumored to be some foreign guy?"

By the end, Ryland concluded, "Nolan, you've let your feelings cloudyour judgment."

Nolan narrowed his eyes, keeping his thoughts to himself.

With everything he had uncovered, even if Eleanor wasn't Enigma, she definitely had close ties to them.

Well...

This woman was turning out to be more complicated than he had imagined.

Completely unaware of Nolan's suspicions, Eleanor focused intently on creating the perfect dress for Lainey,just as she had been commissioned.

Her sense of professionalism wouldn't allow her to slack off; She believed that once she accepted payment,she owed her client her very best work.

Eleanor had no doubt the gown would be stunning, but whether Lainey could actually pull it off-that wasn't her problem.

While she mused over the details, her phone buzzed with an anonymous message.

She opened it to find an invitation to Lainey and Jonny's wedding.

Really?

Those two had the nerve to invite her? Did they not worry she might stir up some drama?
Eleanor couldn't resist snapping a screenshot and sending it to Lillian just for fuun.
To her surprise, Lillian bombarded her with excited texts insisting she make an appearance.
"You have to go!"
"Don't let Jonny think he's won. Show up and steal the spotlight!"
"Promise me you'll show up looking absolutely gorgeous and make them regret it!"
Eleanor, on the other hand, had zero interest in attending.
If she had a choice, she would much rather spend the day with the kids at Hope House.
She was about to politely decline when another message from Lillian popped up. "If you're not going, then I'm not going either! And if I miss it, my parents will accuse me of being antisocial. Help me out, please!"
What choice did Eleanor have?
With a helpless sigh, she deleted her previous refusal and simply replied, "Fine, I'll go."
###Chapter 61 What's So Funny, Lillian


The eighteenth came sooner than expected.

No sooner had they stepped out of the sports car than Lillian dragged Eleanor straight into the banquet hall.

So Jonny and Lainey tied the knot, huh? As if anything was official without Eleanor in attendance.

Clad in an elegant ink-hued couture gown and sporting bold red lips, Eleanor was destined to outshine Lainey.

The hall itself was a spectacle, gilded, over-the-top, the kind of decor that practically shouted for attention.

Eleanor's gaze swept the room without interest. She was unimpressed by the flashy décor.

It was obvious that this kind of grand extravagance was Vickie's idea.

As she thought about Vickie's endless scheming, Eleanor's lips curled with a trace of amusement.

When two scheming women clashed, who would come out on top?

Her thoughts were interrupted by a chorus of whispered gossip nearby.

"Isn't that Jonny's ex-wife? What's she doing here?"

"Showing up on her ex-husband's wedding day, she's bold, that's for sure!"

"She's probably here to make a scene."

Lillian tensed, ready to snap back, but Eleanor gave her a gentle tug, stopping her.

They had made it this far; no amount of whispering would make Eleanor turn back now.

In the end, it was nothing more than a group of small-minded gossips hoping to stir up drama.

While greeting guests, Jonny immediately spotted Eleanor's arrival. Why was she here?

Hle was sure he hadn't sent her an invitation. Who had taken it upon themselves to let her in?

Maybe she still had feelings for him and tagged along with Lillian, invitation or not.

The more Jonny convinced himself he had figured it out, the more self-satisfied he became.

He made a show of strolling over, hand in hand with Lainey, putting on an air of the devoted fiancé.

Before Jonny could move closer, Lillian called out in an exaggerated tone, "Miss Gilbert, is that the Enigma gown you had made just foryou? Absolutely...remarkable."

Eleanor kept silent, a subtle smile curving her lips.

On a day like this, crossing paths with Lillian could only spell trouble for Lainey.

The rest of the socialites, taking Lillian's words at face value, quickly chimed in.

"Oh yes, it's gorgeous."

"Miss Gilbert, your dress really is stunning."

"I've heard Enigma's work is nearly impossible to get. Mr. Todd must truly treasure you."

Lainey glowed with pride, certain that her ten million investment had paid off.

Jonny,too, savored the compliments.

He was grateful Lainey had the sense to commission an Enigma gown-otherwise, how would he ever have impressed these ladies of high society?

While the happy couple soaked up the compliments, Lillian slipped closer, flashing a sly grin. "I'm curious, is there any special meaning behind the dress?"

A special meaning?

When Lainey picked out the gown, she was simply drawn to its beauty. She had never given much thought to what it might symbolize. Still, with the spotlight on her, she needed an answer.
After a moment's consideration, Lainey replied, "The dress features intricate web-like lace and winding serpent embroidery. It's meant to embody elegance, mystery, and an irresistible charm."
The guests seemed to ponder her words, but Jonny looked the most affected.

A memory flashed in his mind, a scene from their courtship, when Lainey would look at him with pure devotion in her eyes.

A wave of emotion swept through him, and his eyes softened as he looked at Lainey.
Meanwhile, beside them, Lillian was doing her best not to burst out laughing at Lainey's explanation.
She had been trying to find a way to bring up the meaning behind the lace and serpent details, but Lainey had walked right into it herself.
Lillian couldn't tell whether Lainey genuinely had no clue about the symbolism, or if she was just pretending.Leaning into Eleanor, Lilian chuckled for a moment, about to make a witty remark when a familiar voice interrupted. "What's so funny, Lillian?"

Ryland and Nolan strolled in, their confident, commanding presence immediately drawing every eye in the room.
###Chapter 62 Look At This Dress!


Eleanor's eyes flickered in Nolan's direction almost on instinct.

The moment her gaze collided with Nolan's, a jolt of surprise ran through her, and she instantly averted her eyes.

Nolan seemed to have made it his mission to haunt her lately.

She couldn't wrap her head around how the head of the Stewart Group managed to find so much spare time.

Lillian, entirely unaware of Eleanor's unease, grabbed Ryland's hand and said cheerfully,"Ryland, look at this dress! Isn't it gorgeous?"

Ryland glanced over, nearly laughing out loud.

With a perfectly straight face, he played along. "Hmm, there's definitely some unique symbolism there.Quite impressive."

His tone suggested a compliment, but there was an underlying note of irony.

Nolan let his gaze linger on Eleanor for a moment before turning his attention to Lainey.

He finally offered a verdict. "Hmm.. she wears it like a saintly figure draped in shadows."

If he hadn't given Eleanor those loaded glances beforehand, people might have believed he was genuiely praising Lainey.

But there was an unspoken weight to his glances.

Whispers of old scandals immediately sprang to mind for everyone nearby.

Lainey truly fit the image; after all, she had taken Eleanor's husband.

Who else could play the part of a saintly figure shrouded in darkness? That meek,sorrowful act of hers made it all the more convincing!

Jonny's face clouded with frustration.

They were openly sabotaging his big day!

But with the Stewart and the Brooks families wielding so much power, he was in no position to retaliate.

If he had known it would turn out like this, he never would have invited them to win them over.

Now, he was paying the price for his own ambition.

Lainey's flawless makeup did nothing to hide the flush of embarrassment burning across her cheeks.

Ten million had gone into that dress, only to become the butt of a joke!

Nolan was siding with Eleanor and twisting the knife on purpose!

Lillian caught sight of Lainey's mortified look and knew exactly what was running through her mind.

She leaned in, taking full advantage of the attention, and added in a sweet voice, "If we're being honest, the gown is gorgeous, but the one in it... not quite as impressive."

Rage bubbled up inside Lainey, and if Jonny hadn't been gripping her arm, she likely would have lashed out at Lillian right then and there.

Even though frustration simmered beneath the surface, Jonny managed to keep his composure.

If he couldn't challenge them directly, the best option was to retreat gracefully.

He mustered a strained smile. "Mr. Stewart, Mr. Brooks, please enjoy the celebration. Lainey and I have some things to attend to, so we'll excuse ourselves."

With the couple moving away, the rest of the guests slowly began to scatter as well.

Nolan now had a clear line of sight to Eleanor, who looked especially stunning tonight.

Feeling his unwavering attention, Eleanor grew a bit uneasy. Eleanor was about to pull Lillian along whena voice rang out in front of them.

"Nolan..." Emma's tone was so sweet it was almost nauseating.

Great, so much for a quick escape.

There was clearly more drama ahead.

Eleanor and Lillian shared a knowing look, stopping in their tracks at the same moment.

Jealousy then flickered in Emma's eyes as she glanced their way, but she quickly masked it behind a dazzling smile.

Drawing closer, she pretended to stumble and let out a theatrical gasp, aiming to fall right into Nolan's arms.

Trying to fling herself at Nolan?

Really?

But Nolan had zero patience for that kind of performance.

A look of clear annoyance flashed in his eyes as he quickly moved aside.

"Ah!" Emma tumbled to the floor, and her glass of red wine splattered perfectly across her dress.

Disaster, served up for everyone to see.

Eleanor couldn't resist a quiet chuckle.

Nolan always had an army of admirers chasing after him, and this top fan was pulling out all the stops.

Eleanor casually folded her arms, eyeing Nolan with an amused, knowing look.

When their eyes met, Nolan's lips twisted into a sly grin, a playful glint lighting up his expression.

For a moment, his usual polished expression vanished, replaced by something far more irreverent.
###Chapter 63 Lainey's The One In The Spotlight Today!


Emma was overwhelmed by pain.

Pushing herself off the floor with a pained expression, she leaned toward Nolan and whispered in a sweet tone, "Nolan, I'm really hurting. Won't you rub it for me?"

Lillian broke into uncontrollable laughter.

Really? That tired trick?

Did Emma honestly think Nolan was some clueless schoolboy who would fall for it?

Nolan's reaction was immediate-his look of disgust deepened, leaving no doubt about what he thought.

Heat rushned to Emma's cheeks, the sting of humiliation twisting quickly into rage.

She slammed her heel against the floor and snapped through clenched teeth, "Eleanor, don't act so pleased with yourself! Lainey's the one in the spotlight today!"

That reminder seemed to revive her boldness.

"Humph! Besty Juarez from the Enigma Group is coming too. Lainey's gown was custom-made by her.I doubt a country bumpkin like you has even heard of Enigma!"

What did it matter if Eleanor had managed to stick close to Lillian and Nolan?

In the end, she was still Jonny's castoff, a woman thrown aside without hesitation.

She didn't belong here. She didn't deserve Nolan's attention.

To Emma,Eleanor would always be nothing more than a country bumpkin pretending to fit in.

Emma's nails dug into her palm as fury twisted inside her. She would rip off that mask and show everyone exactly what kind of bitch Eleanor really was. "I see." Eleanor's reply came smooth and deliberate, her lips curving into the faintest smirk. "And what exactly does that prove?"

Emma's chest tightened with fury, the casual dismissal nearly knocking the breath from her.

How dared this bitch act so unbothered?

Did she truly not take Besty seriously?

She really was nothing more than an ignorant country girl pretending to belong.

Before Emma could snapback, a voice rang out from the crowd, sharp with exctement. "Besty's here!"

The spectators shifted instantly, clearing a neat path through the gathering.

A poised woman in a tailored suit strode forward, her presence commanding attention. Several assistants trailed close behind, underscoring her authority.

It was Besty-head of Enigma's Elepdon branch.

Emma's eyes brightened as if salvation had arrived. Straightening her posture, she hurried forward and put on her most flattering smile. "Besty, thank God you're finally here! You won't believe the arrogance I've just witnessed. Someone thinks Ms. Brooks' support gives her the right to dismiss you-and Enigma itself!"

Emma threw her hand out, pointing squarely in Eleanor's direction.

"She even pushed Ms. Brooks to mock Enigma's entire design philosophy! She said Lainey's dress carries a terrible meaning. People like her don't belong here. You can't just ignore this. Honestly, I think Enigma should blacklist her completely-make sure she never buys another piece from you again!"

Her voice rose higher with every word, her outrage feeding on itself.

Besty's expression tightened as she listened, her eyes narrowing while she turned to follow where Emma was pointing.

The sight nearly made her knees give out.

That wasn't just some guest-it was Enigma. The founder. The hidden force behind Enigma Group itself. The others might stil be blind to Eleanor's true Identity, but Besty cotad never mistake hee.

Years ago, when she was nothing more than a salesghl iy ono of Enigma's bortiquies, that very woman hed pluckod her from obscurlty and set her on the path that fed to her cirtont post.

Forgest ignoring her. Even i Eleanor ohose to grind her under her heet, Besty wouldn'e dare so much ad breathe a complalrt.

A cold sweat broke aoross Besty's forehead.

She stepped forward, ready to greet Eleanor, when a floeting look from her stopped her cold. That subtle,knowing glance carried a clear message-Eleanor had no intention of revealing who she really was.

ft her perfectly; the woman had aways moved in shadows, never craving the spotllght.

If she wlshed to remain unseen, then she would play along.

Masking her shock, Beaty smoothed her expression and swiveled back toward Emma. "Miss Todd,you can't be serious. Perhaps you've had a little too much to drink, because what you're saying is nothing but foolishness."

Emma was certain she had just outmaneuvered Eleánor.

She had no idea that her own words were about to come back and destroy her in front of everyone.
###Chapter 64 I'm Terribly Sorry


Emma felt a jolt of shock.

Besty should have been on the Todd family's side, so why was she defending Eleanor?

As her mind scrambled to make sense of it, Lainey approached alone, moving confidently through the crowd.

Jonny was still mingling with the men, sipping his drink, completely oblivious.

It didn't matter.

Today, this was her stage.

Lainey offered a polite smile and greeted, "Besty, it's good to see you here."

Besty wasn't great at remembering faces, and she didn't immediately place Lainey.

But the dress? That she recognized instantly.

It was the same gown she had recently sought Eleanor's special permission to handle.

Eleanor had quoted ten million for it-a price she rarely entertained for any project.

So Lainey must be friends with Eleanor.

Otherwise,why would Eleanor have told her to attend the wedding?

Quickly, Besty composed herself, bowing her head slightly. "Miss Gilbert, congratulations. I apologize for coming so abruptly without a gift. I promise to visit soon and make it up to you and Mr. Todd with a token of my appreciation."

The guests around them were taken aback.

Besty from Enigma Group spoke with such courtesy to Lainey? All those whispers about their closeness must have been true!

Lainey let herself bask in the moment, savoring every second.

Spending that ten million had been worth it; she could practically feel Elepdon's elite social circles opening up to her.

Eleanor would no longer dare mock her.

Maintaining her composure, Lainey smiled graciously. "You're far too kind, Besty. It's such an honor that you could attend my wedding despite your busy schedule."

Besty gave a quick nod, but her gaze immediately flicked toward Eleanor.

She blinked subtly, as if silently asking, "Boss, did that work for you?"

Of course, Nolan noticed it all. His earlier suspicions seemed to be confirmed. How many more of Eleanor's tricks were still hidden?

Eleanor felt his gaze burn into her back and frowned.

Would he ever stop staring?

Nolan met her eyes directly, lifting his eyebrows, almost as if to say,"I've seen through you."

Eleanor's heart skipped a beat.

Did he have some kind of X-ray vision?

She and Besty had only exchanged a glance.

This had to be a trick;

he was just trying to get under her skin.

Deciding it was safer to ignore him, she turned away, refusing to meet his gaze.

But Emma, witnessing the charged moment, couldn't hold back her fury. On impulse, she snatched a glass of wine from a passing waiter and flung it at Eleanor.

Then,pretending to be shocked, she held her chest."Oh, Eleanor! I'm terribly sorry. I didn't manage to hold it right. You're so gracious; I know it's fine, isn't it?"

She had used this stunt countless times over the past three years, and Eleanor had never once reacted.

Even now, cozying up to the Stewart and the Brooks families, Eleanor was still that same foolish girl.

But suddenly, red wine spilled everywhere.

Emma froze, staring at the empty glass in Eleanor's hand.

This wasn't possible.

How dared she?

This was her brother's wedding!

"Eleanor, I'll kill you!" Emma screamed, charging forward without a second thought. ###Chapter 65 This Is All Your Fault, You Bitch!


Eleanor didn't budge, but Nolan subtly moved to stand in front of her, like a protective barrier.

Emma, suddenly realizing Nolan was there, froze mid-step. "Nolan! She's picking on me!"

Her voice was a mix of indignation and disbelief. She was still caught in her own dramatic fantasy.

Lillian, finally losing patience, folded her arms and gave Emma a sharp, evaluating look. "Miss Todd, maybe check yourself in a mirror before running to Nolan crying,"

she said, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

Then, with a cruel edge, she added, "Honestly, you look absolutely ridiculous right now."

Compelled almost against her will, Emma grabbed a mirror. One quick glance and her face went pale.

Her makeup had completely melted, and smears of color ran across her cheeks and forehead. It was a total disaster.

Ugh!

How was she supposed to face anyone like this?

"This is all your fault, you bitch!" she yelled, her hands over her face, her eyes shooting daggers at Eleanor.

The noise and chaos immediately drew Jonny's attention.

He gestured to the guests to stay back and made his way toward the scene.

Seeing Emma's ruined appearance, Jonny frowned. "What in the world happened here?"

Lainey, quick to seize the moment, pretended to be concerned. Still smiling, she handed Emma a tissue.

Her voice carried just enough emotion to sound genuine. "Jonny, I'm so sorry. I got so caught up talking to Besty that I didn't notice Emma." Lainey turned to look at Eleanor. "Miss Warren, I know you might still be upset with us, but today is our wedding-a happy day for all of us. Whatever grudges you have, you shouldn't take them out on Emma.She's still young. If she did something wrong, you could just talk to her instead of hurting her!"

Eleanor couldn't help but smirk, impressed by Lainey's talent for twisting the truth. "Lainey, I have to admit.You've gotten really good at turning things around to make yourself look innocent," she murmured.

As the two women squared off, ready to exchange sharp words again, Jonny felt his patience snap.

He shot Eleanor a hard look, his voice tight with frustration. "Eleanor, I get that my remarriage might bother you, but there's a line. You can't make things hard for Emma, and you definitely can't show up at our wedding like this.Apologize.Now."

Lillian, standing nearby, was barely containing her disbelief.

Could the whole Todd family really be this ridiculous?

The nerve of them! She shook her head, feeling her temper flare.

She shouted at Jonny, "You think Eleanor still have feelings for you? That's ridiculous. And what nonsense is this about crashing your wedding? You sent the invitations yourself. Have you already forgotten? Or maybe your new wife stirred up trouble with Eleanor behind your back, and you were clueless?"

She added, "And let's not forget-it was your sister who splashed wine on Eleanor first! And now you expect her to just stand there? You're all such clueless fools!"

If Lillian weren't a woman of high standing, she might have spat in his face on the spot.

Jonny, meanwhile, felt his face heat up with embarrassment and frustration. He wasn't sure if Lillian was speaking the truth or just trying to stir conflict between him and Lainey.

His mind reeled, leaving him frozen in indecision.

And yet, it was the Brooks family.

He couldn't risk offending them. Besty, who had been quietly observing the chaos, finally pieced it together.

So Lainey wasn't really Eleanor's friend-she had been a rival all along.

That meant everything she had thought before was completely wrong.

Before she could process it further, Emma clung to her arm, her voice full of urgency and desperation."Besty! You have to help me! Before, you were kind and didn't want to stoop to Eleanor's level, but now look at her! She's taken advantage of me and bullied me even more! You have to teach her a lesson for me!"

Besty froze for a moment.

No way was she going to drag herself into this mess just because of Emma.

Not happening.
###Chapter 66 Making A Scene Won't Change A Thing


Besty removed her hand from Emma's grip in terror.

"Miss Todd, I don't actually know you, so mind how you speak," Besty said.

Emma blinked in shock. "Besty! How can you say that? You're supposed to be close to my sister-in-law!"

Eleanor could hardly believe Emma's cluelessness.

At the same time, Lillian folded her arms, her eyes fixed on the scene, clearly waiting for the drama to happen.

Besty quickly explained, worried Eleanor might get the wrong idea, "You mean Miss Gilbert, right? I barely know her. She just claimed she spent $10 million at Enigma Group, called herself our top VIP, and insisted l come. Otherwise,I wouldn't be here."

It wasn't personal. Eleanor had told her to come.

Otherwise, even if Lainey had splashed out a hundred million, she wouldn't have bothered.

These folks were completely out of touch with the real world.

The crowd went quiet instantly.

Wait, Lainey wasn't friends with Besty at all?

Besty didn't even know her?

Some rich women's faces darkened instantly.

They had never needed to ask for favors before.

And here they were, bending over backward for Lainey just because of Besty, and now this? Ridiculous.

Lainey instinctively recoiled under all the angry, scrutinizing eyes. To make matters worse, Jonny looked genuinely furious.
His eyes blazed with anger as he glared at her.
He had been counting on Lainey to leverage Enigma Group for some valuable connections, but instead,not only was the ten million gone, but also their family's reputation had been completely ruined!
Lainey...he had to admit, she had a way of getting under his skin.
Watching the couple about to clash, Lillian felt a secret thrill.
She lifted her chin and addressed Lainey, speaking louder on purpose.
"Wait a minute... you and Besty weren't even friends? So all this time you were just using her name to show off?"
If Besty's comment had embarrassed Lainey, Lillian's statement practically nailed the lie in front of everyone.
The socialites, realizing they had been played, erupted with anger, demanding Lainey explain herself.
Jonny rubbed his temples in exasperation.
How on earth had a simple wedding turned into this disaster?
He spun toward Eleanor, his gaze dark and unwavering."Look, I get it. You're upset, but it's done. Making a scene won't change a thing."
He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. "Just calm down, don't stir trouble, and I'Il make it right later."
Eleanor blinked in disbelief. Was he seeing things?
What made him think she was making a scene, and that she still cared for him?
Had he completely ignored Lillian's words?
Meanwhile, Lainey was boiing with jealousy.
She had heard what Jonny said. He still had feelings for Eleanor!

So where did that leave her?

Before she could react, a cold, teasing voice cut in. "Really, with me here, do you think she'd still be interested in you?"

Nolan had approched Eleanor.

His eyes flicked toward Jonny, flat and dismissive, like he was watching a fool make a scene.

Jonny froze.

Nolan, of all people, openly claimed interest in Eleanor in front of everyone?

It was practically a challenge thrown in his face.

It made no sense. Eleanor wasn't the kind of woman people fought over.

She wasn't glamorous like Lainey, and even Emma outshone her by miles.

How could Nolan possibly single her out?

Neither Jonny nor Eleanor could figure out what Nolan was doing.

His words were only causing more confusion than anything else.

Wanting no part of it, Eleanor decided she had had enough.

She grabbed Lillian by the arm and theý made their way towards the exit, ignoring the chaos around.them.
###Chapter 67 She Won't Escape Me


The instant Eleanor and Lillian left the hotel, the noise of the hall fell away.

Lillian spun around, eyes wide with mischief, and all but exclaimed, "Eleanor, don't tell me Nolan just confessed to you!"

Eleanor clapped a hand over her friend's mouth, flustered. "Cut it out! He was only lending me a hand. Don't make it sound like something it's not."

Her hand dropped as her expression turned firm. "Honestly, romance is the last thing on my mind. What I want is to keep Hope House running-and maybe even open more so more kids can have a safe place."

That was her truest priority, the only goal that felt worth chasing.

Lillian knew Nolan's reputation well. He wasn't exactly famous for kindness, which made his behavior toward Eleanor even more puzzling.

But seeing how serious Eleanor was, she swallowed her teasing and slipped her arm through her friend's instead. With a grin, she said, "Fine, I won't push. If you're building more orphanages, then I'm all in-money,effort,whatever it takes."

She then continued, "But you, missy, also need a break. Come on, let's go. I'm dragging you out for some fun before you bury yourself in work again!"

Lillian's gleaming purple convertible tore down the street, the engine growling until it finally vanished from sight.

By the time Nolan and Ryland stepped outside, the air was still heavy with the stench of exhaust.

Ryland tipped his sharp jaw upward, clicking his tongue in amusement.

With a sly grin, he bumped his elbow against Nolan. "Well? You're not going after Eleanor? She sped: off because of you.Perfect chance to explain yourself-and who knows, maybe win her over while you're at it." It was true. Nolan had been a breath away from blurting out that he liked Eleanor-far bolder than usual.

His eyes lingered on the empty stretch of road, unreadable.

Only after a long silence did he finally shift his gaze back, the corners of his lips curving slightly. "No need.She won't escape me."

Ryland arched a brow, intrigued.

Confidence like that didn't come from nothing-and if Nolan was this certain, then Eleanor was already his in one way or another.

Ryland's worry turned out to be pointless.

What had unfolded today would spark delight for some yet leave others bitter.

If the rest of the Stewart family caught wind of it, their reactions would be far from simple.

Thanks to the scandal, Jonny and Lainey's wedding collapsed into a public farce, whispered about all over Elepdon.

Lainey shut herself indoors for days, too humiliated to show her face.

Even worse, Jonny never came home after the wedding night.

He vanished completely-ignoring her calls, leaving her messages unread, as though she didn't exist.

And every bit of it, in Lainey's mind, was because of Eleanor.

Her nails dug into her palms as she fumed. Why couldn't she measure up to that woman?

Why did everyone jump to Eleanor's defense?

That bitch walked around unbothered, even with Hope House on the brink of being forced out. Not a trace of worry showed on her face.

Lainey clenched her teeth. Could Eleanor already have found another location?

No-impossible. Elepdon's housing prices were outrageous. Even if she did find a land, there was no way she had the money to pay for it.

Lainey's doubts never found answers.

No one in their wildest dreams would have believed that Nolan had outright handed Eleanor an entire plot of land.

If the truth came out,people would look at her in a very different light.

But land wasn't the only thing he gave away. He gave his time.

Day after day, Nolan remained at the orphanage, personally supervising the new building as if it were his own project.

Ryland finally lost patience. "Nolan, chasing after a woman doesn't mean you have to tie balloons and run errands like a volunteer."

Nolan lifted his eyes with a calm that cut like ice. "And that right there explains why your parents keep fretting about your future."

Ryland nearly choked.

Was this really Nolan-the aloof, untouchable man he had known for years?

"Alright, alright, I get it," Ryland muttered, throwing up his hands. "Just don't blame me if your grandfather blows a fuse when he realizes you're skipping the company."

He stalked off, shaking his head.

Left behind, Nolan rose slowly, his gaze drifting toward the window. Inside, Eleanor was laughing with the children, her warmth filling the room in a way that tightened something deep in his chest.

Time spent with Eleanor carried a rare ease, a comfort Nolan hadn't felt in years.

It gave him a reason to remain by her side without forcing the closeness.

Over the past few days, she no longer held him at arm's length. Her guard had eased-not because she trusted him fully, but because he never pressed where she didn't want him to.

He let her keep her secrets. That alone was enough to let him stay within her circle.

And once someone crossed into the realm of "friend," Eleanor treated them with a quiet courtesy.

Until Hope House finished its relocation, that fragile understanding bound them together.

Fannie's heart fluttered with excitement. Could Eleanor really become her sister-in-law one day?

The idea lit up her imagination, a wish planted deep inside her chest.

But for now, it remained nothing more than a fragile dream.

Eleanor stood before the freshly completed orphanage, satisfaction softening her expression.Extending her hand, she said with quiet formality, "I appreciate your help, Nolan."

Nolan's gaze dropped to her offered hand, his brows arching with faint amusement.

After a pause, he clasped it lightly, his voice low. "No need for thanks. I've got my own reasons."

Eleanor pulled her hand back, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. Instinctively, she asked, "What reasons?"


A glint of satisfaction flickered in his eyes.

Leaning just a little closer, he said in a deliberate drawl, "Because I want to stay near you."

It was as close to a confession as he had ever given.

Caught off guard, Eleanor quickly deflected. "Don't joke like that. Anyway, remember the ribbon-cutting ceremony the day after tomorrow."

Before he could reply, she turned and hurried off, her retreat almost too quick.

Nolan watched her go, a slow, knowing smile curving his lips.

"Eleanor, once I decide to pursue you, running won't save you," he muttered under his breath.
 ###Chapter 68 We've Traced The Source


The morning of the ribbon-cutting ceremony dawned clear, sunlight pouring down like a blessing.

Everything unfolded without a hitch.

Myah beamed as she and the children stepped into their new home, their laughter filling the air with warmth.

Yet, while joy spread in one place, bitterness brewed elsewhere. Inside the Todd family's vila, Lainey's mood soured with every passing minute.

Her glare fixed on the television, teeth grinding as Eleanor's face filled the screen.

There she was-standing among children, her smile poised, her presence effortlessly radiant.

But why?

What gave Eleanor the right to stand there looking so polished, so untouchable?

Lainey's eyes narrowed at the dress draped elegantly over Eleanor's figure. Wasn't that an Enigma design?

Driven by suspicion, she pulled up Enigma's website on her tablet, scrolling through the latest collection.

She hadn't expected much-certainly not confirmation.

But there it was. The very same dress, listed as this season's release, carried a price tag of no less than five million.

Eleanor had been cast out of the Todd family. Where in the world had she found the means to afford something like that?

Lainey racked her brain, circling the question again and again, but no matter how long she stewed, no answer came.

One conclusion settled firmly in Lainey's mind-Eleanor's wealth couldn't be clean. Her gaze lingered on the television screen, and a twisted idea began to sprout, spreading like wildfire in her thoughts.

If Eleanor insisted on making life difficult for her, then she would return the favor tenfold. Eleanor would know no peace.

By that afternoon, her scheme was already in motion. An anonymous post exploded onto the trending charts, its headline crafted to ignite fury."Hope House ribbon-cutting? Orphans' donations funneled into private pockets?"

The post featured a glossy photo of Eleanor at the ceremony, her designer dress front and center as if it were Exhibit A.

Attached beneath were a string of grainy screenshots, allegedly showing Hope House's expense records,with a suspiciously large amount of money unaccounted for.

The reaction was immediate. The Internet boiled over with anger.

"Who is this woman? How shameless must she be to steal from an orphanage?"

"Absolutely disgusting-this is evil, plain and simnple!"

"People like her shouldn't just be exposed; they should be thrown straight into prison!"

Many netizens wasted no time digging into Eleanor's background, piecing together fragments until her past stood exposed for all to see.

"Wait-she grew up in the orphanage herself? She, of all people, should understand how vital those donations are. For her to take from the children is beyond cruel!"

"No wonder Jonny Todd got rid of her! If he'd stayed married, the entire Todd Group would've been dragged straight into scandal.".

···

The comments piled on endlessly, each more vicious than the last, drowning the feeds in venom. Lillian's blood boiled as she scrolled. Every word felt like a slap.

Did these people seriously believe Eleanor would stoop so low as to steal scraps from the very place she supported with her own money?

She couldn't contain herself any longer. Her fingers flew over the keyboard.

"Utter lies! Eleanor donates tothe orphanage-she doesn't take from it! Why would she bother embezzling when she gives her own money? Stop spreading garbage!"

But her defense barely made a ripple. Within minutes, her comment was buried under a wave of fresh attacks, the trolls multiplying like someone had deliberately thrown fuel on the fire.

Clearly, this wasn't just gossip spiraling-it was orchestrated. Someone was pulling strings.

Lillian didn't waste a second before firing off a message to Ryland's assistant. "Trace the IP of whoever posted this filth. I want to know exactly who's behind it."

Her jaw tightened. Whoever dared to smear Eleanor like this wouldn't get away with it.

While waiting for a response, she kept refreshing the thread, scrolling furiously through the comments.

Not a single person defended Eleanor. Not one.

What was wrong with these people?

Were they all blind-or just plain stupid?

She was seconds away from unleashing her own tirade when a new notification appeared. Someone had finally spoken up.

The name stopped her cold-Besty.

From Enigma's verified account, a bold statement appeared. "The gown worn by Miss Warren at the ribbon-cutting was an exclusive sponsorship from Enigma Group. Miss Warren has dedicated herself to Hope House for years, volunteering weekly and donating substantial funds. She is an example-to be admired,not slandered." Attached to the post were detailed records-receipts of Eleanor's donations, logs of her volunteer hours,proof stacked neatly for all to see.

Netizens might scoff at rumors, but no one dared question the authority of Enigma.

Their word carried weight, and their brand left no room for doubt.

Within minutes, the storm of insults flipped on its head. The comment section overflowed with praise, the hate drowned out by admiration.

Relief finally loosened Lillian's chest.

Watching Eleanor's name dragged through the mud had felt worse than being attacked herself.

Eleanor had been right to trust Besty-when the situation turned dire, Besty knew exactly how to strike back.


Just as Lillian allowed herself a brief breath, a new message pinged on her screen. "Miss Brooks, we've traced the source. The IP behind the original post-and several troll accounts stirring the comments-all lead back to the Todd family's villa. Also, you'll want to see this. Attachments included."

Lillian tapped the files open. Her lips curled into a sly grin as the images came into focus.

Perfect ammunition.

Without hesitation, she uploaded the screenshots and crafted her own post, each word aimed like a blade.

"Funny how some people love preaching about charity. Remember that wedding pledge-$5 million promised for poor children, but only $3, 000 delivered? Was that just sloppy bookkeeping... or a deliberate scam? Lainey Gilbert, would you like to clear this up?"

But Lillian wasn't done. Her fingers flew over the keyboard as she fired off another comment beneath the post.

"A little advice for whoever's been hiding behind screens and buying trolls-maybe clean up your own dirty laundry before smearing someone else. By the way, the legal notice is already on its way. Do check your mailbox." For good measure, she attached the traced IP address, leaving no room for denial.

There was no way Lainey could defend herself.
###Chapter 69 That's His Business With Eleanor


The Internet erupted like wildfire, comment threads exploding in every direction.

Unlike the noise of nameless netizens, Lillian's words carried weight-and the evidence she dropped hit harder than anything that came before.

Her screenshots were crisp, undeniable, nothing like the blurry fabrications from the earlier smear campaign.


Netizens might be quick to gossip, but they weren't idiots.

In seconds, the crowd realized they had been manipulated.

Lainey's Twitter page was instantly swarmed.

"So we've been tricked? Turns out Lainey Todd is the real villain!"

"Unbelievable-she even faked charity donations."

"Five million magically shrank to fifty thousand? That's not charity, that's daylight robbery."

"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the Todd Group had a hand in this too!"

...

Lillian scrolled through the chaos, satisfaction dancing on her lips-until her expression froze mid-smile.

It was as though time itself had stopped, a chill gripping her out of nowhere.

In the very next instant, Lillian's eyes flewwide, locked on her phone as if she couldn't believe what she was seeing.

Her face lit with shock, the kind that made her look as though the floor had shifted beneath her feet.

She shot up from the couch, jammed her feet into her shoes, and dashed into the kitchen, nearly skidding to a stop as she shoved her phone in front of Eleanor, who was calmly stirring a pot on the stove.

One name burned on the screen-Nolan.

He had actually reposted her call-out.

And worse, he hadn't left it at that.

"Eleanor Warren treats the world with kindness, yet shows no mercy to me."

The words were followed by a sorrowful emoji, dripping with wounded self-pity.

Eleanor's hand froze on the spoon, her mind momentarily blank.

At the same time, the comments beneath Nolan's post were exploding in real time.

"Hold on-did Nolan Stewart just post?!"

"Am I hallucinating, or is that really the head of Stewart Group?"

"You're not hallucinating! I've stalked his account forever, and he's finally alive online!"

"Wait, wait, is he hinting at Eleanor? Is this some kind of confession?"

"Wow, that came out of nowhere!"

"You mean the Todd family tossed her aside, and now the head of Stewart Group is the one declaring his love?"

How reckless could Nolan be?

A private confession would have been enough, yet he had to plaster it across social media.

Did it ever cross his mind what she might feel?

Eleanor forced herself to look away, feigning composure as the glow of the screen faded from her eyes.

Still, the warmth blooming in her cheeks betrayed her attempt at calm. With a sharp snap, Lillian shut her phone and squealed.

"Eleanor! Did you see that? Nolan Stewart actually confessed to you! He's the man every single woman in Elepdon is dying to marry! Oh my God, this is legendary, and I am living for it!"

In her excitement, Lillian's earlier worries evaporated.

For once, Nolan, the man who always avoided romance, had bared his feelings to Eleanor.

It suddenly felt like nothing could stand in the way of what they had.

Differences in status? Irrelevant.

The swarm of women vying for Nolan's attention? Meaningless.

Nolan and Eleanor seemed like they were made for each other. He carried himself with a cool, refined air,while she burned with independence and fire.

Lillian's squealing grated on Eleanor until she could barely take it anymore.

With a light tap on her friend's head, Eleanor said, "Dinner's ready. Quit making a fuss and sit down to eat."

Food, however, didn't hold a candle to the unfolding gossip.

Eyes sparkling with mischief, Lillian dialed Ryland. "Hey, is Nolan with you? I've got questions, and I'm dying to get a quote from him."

On the line, Ryland nearly choked on his coffee. "Are you out of your mind, Lillian? That's his business with Eleanor. You've got no reason to stick your nose in."

For the first time ever, he hung up on his sister without hesitation.

Some things were simply too personal to be dragged into her antics.

Almost immediately after Nolan's post went live, Norwood Stewart, his grandfather, was on the phone.

Nolan answered and entered the study. Out of curiosity, Ryland approached the study, and pressed his ear against the door,trying to eavesdrop their conversation. Though he couldn't catch a word of the exchange, Ryland guessed that it wouldn't be a pleasant conversation.
###Chapter 70 Wasn't The Disaster At The Wedding Enough
It didn't take long before Nolan stepped out of the study, with an unreadable expression on his face.
When his gaze met Ryland's, the air grew tense.
Ryland coughed lightly, trying to ease the mood. "So, did your grandpa lecture you?"
"Yes," Nolan replied.
Ryland nodded knowingly.
Of course, Norwood would never approve of a granddaughter-in-law like that.
After all, Nolan's family history was a scar etched deep. His father, Colson Stewart, had once been married to Reyna Freeman, a celebrated socialite from Elepdon and Nolan's mother.
Their marriage had started in harmony, full of promise, but everything fell apart when Ady Yates, daughter of a maid in the Freeman household, who had grown up alongside Reyna, got involved with Colson.
The affair tore the family apart. Reyna's heartbreak consumed her, and she ultimately ended her own life.
Nolan lost his mother, and worse, Colson's affection for him turned into neglect and cruelty once Ady gave birth to a son of her own.

It was Norwood who finally intervened, taking Nolan away and raising him under his direct care. Later, when Nolan proved his ability, Norwood even skipped over Colson entirely and handed the Stewart Group straight to his grandson.

To see Nolan, so usually reserved, almost indifferent, suddenly speaking of love was enough to rattle Norwood. He feared history repeating itself, feared Nolan losing himself the way Colson once had. That was why he had made the call.
As for Colson, his cruelty was beyond doubt. He had been living a carefree life in Zerovia with Ady and their son, completely abandoning Nolan.

But if there was one thing Nolan despised, it was pity.

Sensing the weight behind Nolan's silence, Ryland quickly lowered his gaze.

The man's aura had gone ice-cold in an instant, and Ryland nearly trembled under it. "Sorry, Nolan.I went too far. It won't happen again."

He cursed himself silently. What had he been thinking, eavesdropping like that?

While Ryland regretted his slip, across town at the Todd family's villa, Lainey was livid. She smashed her phone to the floor.

Damn it!

Of all times, why would Nolan choose now to confess to Eleanor?

How could someone as untouchable as Nolan possibly fall for a plain woman like Eleanor?

The thought was unbearable.

She couldn't allow it. No, she had to tear them apart.

If Eleanor truly ended up with Nolan, everything would be lost.

Lainey wore a groove in the floor with her pacing, trying to figure out her next move, when the villa door suddenly swung open with a loud bang..

It was Jonny.

And from the storm on his face, he was anything but calm.

Before Lainey could slip into her usual act of looking pitiful, Jonny was already towering over her, his shadow swallowing her up.

He grabbed her by the collar, his fury pouring out through gritted teeth."Look at the mess you've caused!Wasn't the disaster at the wedding enough? Why do you keep stirring things up? Now the whole Internet is dragging our family through the mud. Is that what you wanted?

He had done everything possible to avoid clashing with the Stewart and the Brooks families, yet Lainey couldn't keep herself from stirring the pot.

Did she think the Todd Group was untouchable? That no matter how badly she messed up, nothing would ever happen to it?

The anger blazing in his eyes made Lainey want to slap him, but she held herself back.

She hadn't secured control of the Todd Group yet, and crossing him now would only backfire.

So instead, she forced tears to her eyes and crumpled into her pitiful routine. "Jonny, I swear it wasn't me.l didn't post anything. It was Lillian and Eleanor who set me up!"

There was a time when her tears would have cut right through him.

But now, he felt only a cold distance.

The evidence pointed straight to her, and still she refused to admit it.

How had he ended up married to someone so manipulative, so reckless?

Disgusted, Jonny shoved her away and stormed off toward the study withou a second glance.

Lainey dropped onto the sofa, her face twisting with hatred.

One day, she told herself, Jonny would regret ever treating her this way.
###Chapter 71| Know You Got The Invitation Too


Rage boiled in Jonny like never before.

Days had passed without him setting foot at home, his excuse always circling back to endless work.

Lainey, however, wasn't fooled for a second. She knew he was simply growing weary of her.

There was no way she could just wait around while everything slipped through her fingers.

Until she had full control over the Todd Group, Jonny still mattered.

While those thoughts tangled in her mind, a headline suddenly jumped out at her. "Enigma Group is about to hold a fashion design competition. Word is, the top three might even earn the chance to become Enigma's personal students."

The idea of being chosen as a student of Enigma sent her heart racing.

Such recognition was priceless.

With their backing, she could rise to the top of the fashion world in an instant.

If she had that kind of power, would Jonny's loyalty even matter anymore?

Her time studying fashion design overseas gave her confidence. A competition like this wouldn't intimidate her-it was an open door she was readý to step through.

Fueled by resolve, she wasted no time signing up for the competition. Afterward, she hurried upstairs to the study, eager to capture her ideas before the spark faded.

While she was rummaging through her supplies, a sheet of paper slipped free from a heavy notebook.

It wasn't blank. It was a sketch.

The design screamed sophistication, its elegance rivaling the signaure style of Enigma Group. Her mind spun with questions. Who could have drawn this?
Eleanor?
No,that was absurd.
She was just an orphan; what could she possibly know about design?

Forget it.

Fate had practically handed her this masterpiece.

With a few adjustments, the judges would be floored.

The thought alone sent a thrill through her. Heart racing, she sat down at the desk, her pencif scratching furiously across the page as she reshaped the sketch into her own.

Days later, in the Podium Apartments, Lillian's nerves betrayed her. She kept sneaking glances at Eleanor,who lay sprawled on the sofa, lazily flipping through a magazine. Words hovered on her lips, but hesitation kept them locked away.
Several days had slipped by since Nolan's confession, yet Eleanor hadn't once stepped outside her apartment.

This was unbearable. How could her favorite love story stall like this?

Lillian scooted closer and whispered, "Eleanor, I heard the fashion design competition your firm is hosting already narrowed things down to eight finalists, and one of them is supposed to be a genius. Honestly,you're incredible! Only you could think of such a clever way to promote Enigma while finding the best talent at the same time."

Eleanor flipped another page, her eyes still glued to the magazine. "Cut the sweet talk. What do you actually want?"

Panic bubbled in Lillian's chest. She needed to push Eleanor into the world again. Without bumping into Nolan, how could their romance possibly move forward?

As the self-appointed matchmaker, she was running out of tricks.

Then, the perfect solution popped into her head.

"Eleanor, Sallie's seventieth birthday is coming up in a few days. I know you got the invitation too. Why don't we go together?"

The Todd family had its flaws, but Sallie had always been different-kindhearted and generous. On top of it,Eleanor was in her debt.

It was impossible for Eleanor not to feel a tug at her heart.

Her hand stilled mid-turn of the magazine, though she didn't voice an answer right away.

Noticing the hesitation, Lillian leaned in and whispered, "Don't tell me you're nervous about bumping into Nolan?"

Eleanor gave a sharp laugh. "Me? Nervous? Please."

She just didn't feel like giving him another opening.

Honestly, she was not sure how she was supposed to deal with him.

Years of friendship had made Eleanor an open book to Lillian, and she could read every thought behind those words.

Armed with that knowledge, Lillian putsher plan into motion. "You can relax. I already checked-he left the country a couple of days ago and hasn't come back yet."

The second she heard that, Eleanor snapped upright from her lazy sprawl. "Fine, I'll go!"

After all, it was Sallie's birthday celebration.

She had every reason to show up, pay her respects, and checked in on Sallie.
###Chapter 72 Did You Catch Emma's Words


No one had imagined that Sallie's birthday celebration would turn into Lainey's carefully orchestrated showcase.

The moment Eleanor and Lillian entered the hall, Emma's excited voice rang out.

"My sister-in-law is absolutely amazing! You won't believe this-she just placed first in the preliminary round of the Enigma Group's fashion design competition! I've already secured a stack of tickets for the finals. You should come and see Lainey crowned as Enigma's apprentice!"

What?

Enigma's apprentice?

The very idea carried weight and prestige beyond measure.

As soon as the wealthy young women confirmed the rumor was genuine, they crowded around eagerly, their past grievances with Lainey swept conveniently aside.

Jonny stood proudly at Lainey's side, basking in the light she cast.

The shadows of recent days melted away like mist under the sun.

Lainey might have caused scandals, but in this moment, she handed him honor that outshone them all.

If she truly secured Enigma's apprenticeship, the Todd Group would ascend into an entirely new league of influence.

Lillian leaned closer, her lips twisting in doubt as she whispered to Eleanor, "Hard to believe a schemer like Lainey could actually have talent in design."

Eleanor lifted her glass, letting the champagne swirl lazily. "Maybe so. She did study fashion design abroad,after all." Lillian pressed her lips together and chose silence.
The competition's reputation spoke for itself-judges were impartial, the process transparent.
Lainey advancing to the finals meant she had genuine skill, at least on paper.
Even so, Lillian doubted the outcome would change anything. Winning a trophy was one thing. Being selected as Eleanor's personal apprentice was another matter entirely.
With no desire to linger near the spectacle, Lillian and Eleanor turned their attention to Sallie.
To their surprise, Sallie's complexion looked healthier, her energy noticeably brighter-perhaps because Lainey, consumed with her own ambitions, hadn't troubled her lately.
Eleanor offered her a few words of caution and care, then linked arms with Lillian, ready to leave.
Before leaving the party, she stopped briefly at the restroom.
But when she stepped back into the halway, her path was suddenly blocked.
Her gaze lifted, only to meet Jonny's self-satisfied grin, and irritation pricked at her instantly. "Please step aside," she said.
Jonny had clearly been waiting for this chance, and now that she stood alone, he had no intention of letting her go so easily.
Jonny tossed his head back with exaggerated confidence, his voice dripping with self-importance. "Did you catch Emma's words? It won't be long before the Todd Group rises higher than ever, and I'll be the shining figure in the city's upper circles. Didn't Besty Juarez show interest in you? If you use that connection to open doors for me, I'll make sure you live in comfort beyond your imagination."
In his narrow view, Eleanor was nothing more than a woman chasing wealth through Nolan.
He believed his own hype-that he was destined to embody influence and that her affection for him meant she would never refuse.
The smug curl of his lips deepened. "But don't get ahead of yourself. The title of my wife belongs to Lainey and Lainey alone. She'll be Enigma's chosen apprentice, and I'll stand by her no matter what. You'll just have to accept that."

What the hell?

Had the man lost his senses in a matter of days?

Eleanor could only stare at him in stunned disbelief. She finally said in sharp tones, "Move aside."

Turning on her heel, she started to walk past him without another glance.

His pride stung, Jonny's expression twisted. A wave of possessiveness surged through him as he seized her wrist and yanked her closer.

"Don't put on this act, Eleanor! I can see right through you. You still care about me-you're just being distant to keep me chasing, aren't you?"

The moment his words left his mouth, Jonny lunged forward, trying to force a kiss.

Eleanor's restraint shattered, every ounce of her patience gone.

A sharp glint of ice flickered in her eyes as she braced herself, ready to drive her knee into him.

But before she could make her move, another figure intervened first.
###Chapter 73 Be My Girlfriend


Out of nowhere, Nolan appeared, his fist landing squarely on Jonny's jaw. Jonny stumbled and hit the floor hard,caught completely off guard.

Nolan turned immediately to Eleanor, his eyes softening."Are you okay?"

Still stunned, she nodded. "I... I'm fine."

But her thoughts were a mess. Lillian had told her Nolan was abroad, so why was he here now? Had Lillian lied?

Before she could sort through it, Jonny pushed himself back up, blood smearing at the corner of his mouth.His glare was venomous. "Mr. Stewart, I was only dealing with my ex-wife. Don't you think you're overstepping?"

Nolan gave a short, icy laugh.

He crouched down until he was eye-to-eye with Jonny, his voice low and deliberate. "You're her ex-husband. And I'm her current..."

He stopped there, leaving the final word unspoken, though his meaning was clear. Eleanor would be his.

Jonny's bravado collapsed under Nolan's suffocating presence. He bit back any retort, swallowing his anger, though hatred simmered in his eyes.

He swore silently that one day, he would make Nolan pay for this humiliation.

But Nolan wouldn't have cared, even if he knew.

Todd Group could never match Stewart Group's power.

Meanwhile, Eleanor, flustered by the tension, used the chance to quietly slip away.

She found Lillian just as the party wound down. Sallie never showed her face all evening.

What was supposed to be her birthday ended up feeling like Lainey's stage instead, giving the guess plenty to whisper about.

Guests murmured that Sallie clearly despised Lainey if she couldn't even fake civility for her birthday.

Eleanor had no interest in the chatter. She tugged Lillian toward the door.

The last thing she wanted was another run-in with Nolan.

The longer she stayed, the riskier it felt.

But fate had other plans. Nolan was already waiting by the door.

Lillian, quick to sense an opportunity, excused herself at once.

Erick also drifted aside.

Eleanor was left alone with Nolan, unsure of what to do.

She gave him a stiff smile. "Nolan, thanks for earlier. I have something to take care of, so I'll be going."

However,Nolan didn't budge.

Instead,he leaned in, eyes locked on hers, his tone low and persuasive.

"I have a permanent solution for your ex-husband problem.Do you want to hear it?"

Her instincts screamed to refuse, but before she could get a word out, he closed the gap further, his breath grazing her ear as he murmured, "Be my girlfriend."

Her heart lurched.What kind of outrageous proposal was that?

She blurted out immediately, "Thank you, but I'm not looking for a relationship."

Nolan, unfazed, gave a calm reply. "Then I'll just move to Plan B."

A chill prickled down her spine. Almost on cue, her phone buzzed. Heart sinking, she glanced at the screen, and there it was, on her WhatsApp, in bold letters: "Daily question: When will Eleanor agree to be my girlfriend?"

Her face flushed with horror.

Was he seriously putting her on the spot like this?

She kept staring at the screen, utterly mortified.
###Chapter 74 And Who Even Knows If He's Serious


Nolan lifted his brows, putting on that innocent look of his.

"Think of it as my way of marking my territory," he said with a playful grin."At least now your ex will think twice before bothering you again."

Oh,so should she thank him for that?

Eleanor bit back a groan, forced a polite smile, and slipped out without another word.

She hopped into the first taxi she could flag down and blurted, "Please, hurry. Drive!"

She acted as though something terrifying was right on her heels.

Not too far off, Erick was still frozen in disbelief, his jaw practically on the floor.

He edged toward Nolan, testing the waters with a cautious, "Boss, aren't you going after her?"

Nolan didn't move. If anything, his grin only grew more cunning. "No hurry," he drawled.

After all, some things couldn't be rushed.

Push too hard, and she would only run further.

By the time Eleanor made it back to herapartment, she was finally catching her breath.

That was when Lillian popped up, grinning like she had been waiting all day for this.

"Weli, well, I saw Nolan's post. So, when will you agree to be his girlfriend?"

Eleanor shoved her aside, grabbed a glass, and poured herself some water.

"He's decent, I won't deny that. But my hands are full right now. Between my career, the orphanage, and trying to help more kids, I don't have room for all that. " She sighed and muttered, "And who even knows if he's serious? Someone like Nolan wouldn't actually look twice at a divorced woman like me. He's probably just settling an old score from years ago."

But Lillian wasn't buying it.

She had known Nolan since childhood, and if there was one thing she was sure of, it was that the man didn't say things he didn't mean.

Twice he had confessed, and that wasn't something he would do for fun.

As she watched Eleanor sink into her doubts, Lillian's mind was already spinning with plans.

Over the next few days, she quietly sent a few messages Nolan's way.

And then, the following morning, Eleanor's phone buzzed with a message from Myah.

"A miracle happened last night. A generous company stepped in and donated several prime land plots along with a huge sum of money to Hope House. I was thinking, maybe this is the right time to open more branches? That way, we can welcome more kids. Drop by when you can and see for yourself, okay?"

Attached were pictures and official papers showing the transfer of ownership.

Eleanor scrolled through them, and her eyes widened.

Stewart Group?

And in such prime areas?

Was Nolan insane?

Moves like this would cost the company billions.

Surely his family wouldn't just sit quietly about it.

Her mind was in a blur of confusion, and before she knew it, she was opening Nolan's Facebook page as if something unseen had guided her there.

A fresh update stared back at her: "Still working on it."

Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

So he was serious? His confession was more than just a passing impulse?

Before she could process further, her phone rang, and Besty's name flashed on the screen. "Boss, the finals are next week, but we still don't have the final content locked in."

That instantly reminded Eleanor of Jonny's smug attitude yesterday.
She hadn't even seen Lainey's earlier drafts yet.

Whether Lainey had been cheating or not, everything would be clear in the final round.
Eleanor curved her lips into a faint smile and gave her instructions. "Tell every finalist that during the finals,they'll need to present a complete gown based on their earlier sketches. It has to be worn, either by themselves or on a model. That way we can judge their full ability."

"Got it."

After hanging up, Eleanor made her way/to Hope House.

What she found there surprised her even more.

The Stewart Group had already sent in a professional team.

They weren't just covering the construction, but they also had mapped out the project plan, secured workers, and even arranged long-term funding.

At this point, opening new branches barely needed her or Myah's involvement at all.
###Chapter 75 Are You Enigma


Moved, Eleanor wanted to thank Nolan.

Just as the Stewart Group staff were packing up to leave, the question slipped out before she could stop herself."Is Nolan around?"

Her voice had barely faded when a few of the suited employees froze, trading knowing looks with half-suppressed smirks.

Heat crept up Eleanor's neck.

Why had she blurted that out?

Now they would definitely be making assumptions.

Trying to brush it off, she quickly added in acasual tone, "I just thought, since he has done so much for the orphanage, I should thank him in person, maybe invite him to dinner."

The staff nodded as if they bought what she said, but their smiles told a different story.

By now, gossip had already taken root both inside the Stewart Group and all over Elepdon.

People were whispering that Nolan, the famously cold and untouchable man, was chasing after Eleanor,the divorcée.

Apparently, he was spending money left and right to get her attention, yet she seemed immune to all of it.

But with her slip just now, the rumor mill had been handed fresh fuel.

The team leader leaned in with a sly grin. "Miss Warren, if you want to see Mr. Stewart, you should probably reach out to him yourself. Someone like him isn't exactly within our reach."

The others chimed in with quick agreement, then bowed out politely, leaving Eleanor standing there,feeling rather awkward. Forget it.

She'd just thank Nolan the next time she bumped into him.

Reaching out first would only make him read too much into it.

Maybe he was really tied up with work, because after those little updates on Facebook, he hadn't shown up around her again.

Eleanor actually found some comfort in that.

Two days later, the big day arrived-the finals of the fashion design competition.

The event was held in the grand banquet hall on the first floor of Enigma's store.

At the main entrance, a red carpet stretched out, and the lively crowd filled the place with noise and energy.

Meanwhile, at the quiet back entrance, a sleek black van pulled in and came to a stop.

Besty, already waiting there, stepped forward as the door opened. She bowed slightly and said with crisp respect, "Boss, everything's ready."

Eleanor checked her watch and gave a simple nod."Let's move."

Together they avoided the main building, slipping into the private passage reserved for insiders.

Right when they rounded the corner near the entrance, Eleanor's steps faltered. Her eyes landed on Lainey,who had arrived for the competition.

She was dressed in a flowing pink pleated gown, the soft color making her stand out as she moved through the crowd like a butterfly with a trail of admirers behind her.

Eleanor froze. That dress... it rang a bell.

Before she could dwell on it, Besty spoke up again, gently pulling her back to the moment. "Boss, your lounge is upstairs on the second floor, If you need anything, I'll be right here."

"Okay," Eleanor replied, tearing her gaze away before heading upstairs. The lounge turned out to be exactly her taste-spacious, quiet, with a perfect view overlooking the lively hall below.

She leaned against the railing, her eyes scanning the sea of people, and then it clicked. That dress Lainey was wearing-it was one of Eleanor's own discarded designs.

She had once sketched it, decided it wasn't good enough, and shoved it between the pages of a notebook.

So that was where Lainey had fished it out.

A faint smile curled at Eleanor's lips. Things were about to get interesting.

Down below, Lainey stood in the middle of her admirers, soaking up the praise as if the spotlight belonged only to her.

With the way everyone's eyes followed her, she felt certain today's trophy had her name on it.

After so many unlucky breaks, luck was finally turning in her favor.

Then, a voice from the crowd cut through the chatter. "Miss Gilbert, your design looks so much like Enigma's style!"

The words spread like wildfire. Faces turned, and eyes narrowed in suspicion.

And now that people were really looking, it did carry Enigma's unmistakable touch.

Had Lainey copied Enigma's work?

Or was she actually Enigma?

The crowd seemed far more excited about the second possibility.

"That's right!" a woman added. "Miss Gilbert studied fashion overseas."

The woman turned to Lainey. "Miss Gilbert, why don't you just be honest with us? Are you Enigma?"
###Chapter 76 The Competition Is About To Start


Lainey was in a state of near panic, completely blindsided by the turn of events.

It was,in a way,perfect.

The plagiarism scandal had blown over, and to top it off, she had even been mistaken for Enigma.

Of course, she couldn't admit it outright.

Who knew when the real Enigma might appear?

She forced a weak laugh and protested, "How could that be? You girls really know how to joke around."

Her ambiguous response, however, said more than her words ever could.

The scene quickly turned chaotic, with compliments flying everywhere.

When Lillian arrived, she was utterly entertained by the absurdity unfolding.

Hell yes.

Let it get even messier.

The bigger the drama, the more amusing.

She was curious to see how Lainey would handle this in the long run.

With that, Lillian looked away and went upstairs.

When she met Eleanor, emotions naturally ran high.

After some polite conversation, Lillian got back to her matchmaking. "Nolan has done a lot for yòu lately.Don't you think it's time you gave him some thought? He has been a bachelor in his whole life, and he finally got a crush on someone." Eleanor nearly choked on her coffee, quickly clamping a hand over Lillan's mouth, °Quiet. The competiion is about to start."

Muffled and wide-eyed, Lilian could only blink and nod, signaling her compfiance.

Lainey secured first place.

Eleanor raised a brow and pressed the intercom."Listen up. I won't be taking on apprentices this year.And second and third place can join the company."

Besty froze in disbelief.

Not taking on apprentices at all was one thing, and that rumor had circulated before.

But skipping the first-place winner entirely to reward the second and third? That was unthinkable.

Still, she knew better than to question it.

Execution came first.

So she relayed Eleanor's message exactly as it was.

Lainey, who had been reveling in her victory, felt her face darken with rage.

What was the point of all her scheming and risks if this was the outcome?

Anger bubbled up inside her, and she was about to snap when laughter erupted from the crowd.

"Enigma! Your acting is so over the top!"

"Seriously, we all get it already!"

Acting?

What were they talking about?

Lainey paused, confused for a moment, until the word Enigma clicked in her mind.

Ah,they were still caught up in that earlier misunderstanding! A grin spread across her face as an idea struck her. She lifted her hands and formed a heart with her fingers toward the audience. "Love you all!"

She didn't verbally admit it, but thé gesture spoke volumes and was enough for the crowd to take it as a silent acknowledgment.

This was amazing!

Today,they had truly seen the real Enigmá in áction.

The moment Lainey stepped off the stage, she was swarmed by reporters.

"Miss Gilbert, did Besty's sudden announcement about not accepting apprentices come from your suggestion?" one shouted, with his camera flashing.

Before Lainey could answer, her passionate fans jumped in to explain.

"Of course! Miss Gilbert is Enigma herself. Who else would make that kind of decision?"

"Right! Think about it. Why would second and third place get rewards, but not the first? It makes perfect sense now."

"Enigma probably joined just for fun and didn't expect things to get so big, so she had to quickly change the rules."

Within moments; the crowd had pieced together a seamless argument.

Soon, everyone was convinced that Lainey was undoubtedly Enigma.

Yet, Lainey simply raised the microphone and said calmly, "No comment."

Sometimes silence says it all, and today, her words, or lack thereof, were a quiet confession.
###Chapter 77 Shouldn't We Expose Her


The situation was spinning completely out of control, and Besty could only watch in stunned silence.

She couldn't begin to understand how things had escalated so far.

But from the second floor, Eleanor had a clear view.

Since her boss wasn't moving a finger, Besty knew she couldn't either.

Resigned, she decided to walk away, leaving the mess behind.

Upstairs, Lillian was fuming. "Eleanor! Did you see that? She admitted it on purpose. Shouldn't we expose her?"

Eleanor shook her head, calm and collected. "Expose her and reveal my identity? That's pointless. She's not important enough to worry about."

Simply put, Lainey wasn't even worth Eleanor's attention.

Lillian's annoyance melted into adoration. On impulse, she leaned in and planted a kiss on Eleanor's cheek.

Startled, Eleanor darted away, escaping her playful affection.

By the time the competition wrapped up, two hashtags had already exploded across social media:#EnigmaldentityExposed and #EnigmaGroup'sDesignCompetition.

After years of mystery, the public finally believed they had caught a glimpse of the elusive Enigma.

Fans went wild, flooding Twitter until servers nearly buckled under the traffic.

Jonny,however, was even more thrilled than the fans.

He put down his phone, pulled Lainey close, and held her tightly, pressing a passionate kiss to her lips."Lainey, I'll be good to you from now on," he promised. Enigma!

His wife was Enigma, the legendary designer, unattainable to all, yet standing right here beside him.

He could hardly believe it.

Relief and pride swelled in him, knowing the company's troubles would be behind him and that humiliation was no longer looming.

Lainey secretly rolled her eyes, hiding her disdain behind a delicate act.

She acted shy, giving him a gentle push while speaking softly."JOnny, you're hurting me."

The plea melted him instantly.

His grip eased, and Lainey nestled closer, tracing lazy circles across his chest. "Seeing you so happy makes me happy too."

She continued, her eyes shimmering with fake tenderness, "But now that everyone knows who I really am,staying as your secretary might spark gossip. And I heard the CFO is retiring soon. so..."

She let the words hang, because the pause was louder than anything she could have said.

And Jonny, unwilling to let her down, nodded immediately. "I'll handle it with HR right away."

Satisfied, Lainey.no longer had the patience to fuss over him.

She rewarded him with a chaste kiss on the cheek and said, "No need to rush. I need a break too. The fans have kept me occupied all day."

With that,she swept upstairs.

The moment the door clicked shut, her gentle facade disappeared entirely.

If he had consistently treated her well, she might have spared herself the ruthlessness.

But knowing he still had feelings for Eleanor and had repeatedly belittled her for that stoked a fire within Lainey. She was determined he would pay for his ignorance.

However, before turning her attention toward the Todd Group, she knew she had to cement her public persona as Enigma.

A sly smirk crossed her face as she drafted a post. "Everything's aligning perfectly."

Alongside it, she shared a side-profile photo of herself taken backstage.

The dim lighting softened her smile, making it gentle.

To the fans, the tweet seemed like proof that she really was Enigma, and almost immediately the online community exploded with excitement.

"Wow, Enigma,you're stunning!"

"You're like a living fairy! Absolutely enchanting!"

"I knew it! Lainey is Enigma! That quiet strength in her eyes. It's unmistakable!"

Lainey leaned back, savoring the chaos she had sparked. These frantic admirers were so easy to sway.

Right then, her phone started buzzing with private messages.

They were all from Elepdon's high-society young women, who usually acted superior to everyone else.

"Enigma, please, I need a custom gown! Name your price!"

"Can I wear one of your pieces for my birthday next month? I'll pay anything!"

Lainey's eyes glittered with disdain as she scrolled through the groveling messages. They were nothing more than self-important sycophants now reduced to pleading.

Exactly the effect she.had intended.

With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she set her phone aside.

Of course, she had no intention of responding. Not everyone deserved her attention, not yet. With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she set her phone aside.

Of course, she had no intention of responding. Not everyone deserved her attention, not yet.

Her status as Enigma placed her far above these petty admirers.
###Chapter 78 Don't Underestimate Her


Lainey knew people, and how to bend their instincts, better than most.

Her carefully cultivated persona fit Enigma perfectly, and fans ate it up. They saw her every gesture, every expression, as proof of the legend they adored.

Some even went so far as to take aim at Lillian, eager to curry favor with Lainey.

"The donation mess? That's clearly Lillian stirring trouble!"

"Exactly! Enigma doesn't need to fake anything. One dress from her, and it's worth millions!"

A particularly zealous fan dug up photos of Lillian scolding Lainey at a party and shared them online,twisting the story for maximum effect.

Outrage erupted immediately, and before long, Lillian was drowning in criticism across social media.

The Brooks Group's official account didn't escape the backlash either. Comment after comment poured in.

"Lillian Brooks is abully. How could she treat Lainey like that?"

"Lainey's too kind. That's why she keeps getting walked over by people like Lillian!"

"Down with the Brooks Group!"

"Couldn't agree more!"

"I've never trusted Lillian. I once saw her with eight different men in one day. You know exactly what l mean!"


···

Meanwhile,Lillian was sitting at the Brooks bar, sipping her drink, completely oblivious to the chaos online.

It wasn't until she went to leave and found herself hemmed in by a crowd that she finally realized what was happening.

Bullying Lainey? That was absurd.

She had only ever spoken the truth!

A surge of anger shot through Lillian. She instantly rolled up her sleeves, ready to make her point, not caring that she was outnumbered.

However,before she could get a word out, people closed in around her.

The atmosphere was tense, and a clash seemed likely.

Seeing all that, the bar manager freaked out.

If anything happened to Lillian on his watch, it would be on him.

He barked orders, sumnmoning the security team. "Move! Get her out of here! Protect Ms. Brooks!"

The guards, all retired special forces, immediately sprang into action.

In no time, Lillian was escorted to a private lounge on the second floor, safe from the crowd.

Never had Lillian, a Brooks, felt so humiliated.

Her thoughts immediately turned to Lainey.

Seething,she cursed.Lainey and hoped her lies would be exposed so the online chaos would finally stop.

Grabbing her phone in frustration, she called her brother. "Ryland, I'm cornered at the bar by some wild Lainey fans. Send the bodyguards and get me out of here."

Ryland's worry was instant. "Stay put. Don't move. I'm on my way."

After hanging up, he muttered to Nolan, who was nearby, "Can you believe this? Lillian just said a few words supporting Eleanor, and now she's surrounded by Lainey's crazed fans! That woman can't possibly be Enigma. Honestly, at this point, I really wish Eleanor was..."

He suddenly stopped, not saying the last word, "Enigma," because even he thought it was silly. After all, Eleanor had grown up in an orphanage, far from high society. How could she design such luxurious dresses?

And if she truly were Enigma, why would she marry a loser like Jonny?

Nolan, reading Ryland's thoughts,remained calm.

He sipped his wine, placed the cup down, and offered a faint smile."D。on't underestimate her,"he said.

Eleanor was full of hidden depths, more than most realized.

Ryland chuckled wryly. "I wouldn't dream of it. I'm just... never mind. I'll go pick up Lillian."

With that, he grabbed his coat from the sofa and hurried out the door.
###Chapter 79 Lainey Plagiarized Enigma's Work
Word spread fast, and soon Eleanor heard that Lillian had been cornered.



At first, she had no plans to step in, let alone expose herself as Enigma. She would have rather sat back and watched Lainey embarrass herself. But what she didn't expect was for Lainey's fans to drag Lillian into the mess.



Lillian was the one person Eleanor refused to see harmed.



There was no way she would let anyone stain her reputation.



So,she pulled out her phone and hit send on a tweet."Lainey plagiarized Enigma's work."



Eleanor wasn't the type to throw out claims without evidence.



Along with the post, she attached the edited draft from earlier-the one signed, clear as day. Enigma. The reaction online was instant chaoS. Die-hard Enigma fans quickly chimed in.


"Oh wow, Eleanor might be telling the truth."



"That draft looks way better than Lainey's version."



"That's Enigma's signature, no doubt about it."


Still, the majority weren't hardcore fans. They were just casual followers who couldn't really judge art. In their eyes, Lainey was Enigma. She had the title, and that was enough.


So instead of support, Eleanor's comments section was flooded with attacks.



"Where would an orphan like you even get Enigma's drafts? You probably swiped them from Lainey."



"Exactly! Everyone knows you and Lainey don't get along.You're just bitter"



"You dare go against Lainey? Don't make me laugh."



"Waving around some random design and calling it proof? Wait till the lawyers come knocking!"







Meanwhile, Jonny had his eyes glued to the online storm. As he scrolled through the comments, a memory surfaced-Eleanor used to spend hours sketching in the study.



Back then, he assumed she was just idly passing the time.



But now, could it be that Lainey had stolen her designs all along?



Could Eleanor actually be Enigma?



No,that was ridiculous.



There was no way...or was there?



Jonny tried to brush the thought away, but a nagging uneasinessclung to him.



To clear his mind, he figured he would go straight to Lainey and ask her about it.



Without wasting time, he headed upstairs to look for her.



The moment Lainey saw him walk back into the room,her heart skipped.



Panic rushed through her. Why was he here now?


 
Wasn't he supposed to be buried in work in the study ? Did he... see Eleanor's post too? The idea made her pulse quicken.



Sure enough, Jonny paused for a moment, then asked,"Lainey, what's going on with that post Eleanor made?"



Lainey quickly steadied herself and met his eyes with a calm look. "Baby, strangers might doubt me, but you don't, right? That sketch was mine. I drew it years ago while I was abroad and sold it soon after. I never imagined Eleanor would buy it just to smear me."



She let out a quiet sigh, her expression softening into something more earnest. "Really think about it. If I wasn't the designer, how else could I have the original sketches and turn them into an actual dress?"



She wasn't sure how Eleanor had gotten her hands on the draft, but fear wasn't something she allowed herself.



From what she knew, the true Enigma was a foreigner who had disappeared from the spotlight three years ago.



Even now, the Enigma Group had stayed completely silent.



Clearly, Enigma had no intention of revealing their identity So why shouldn't she use this chance?



If she played her part right, she was Enigma. The thought gave her confidence.



Jonny,meanwhile, felt the knot in his chest loosen.



He was convinced now-Lainey had to be Enigma.



After all, if Eleanor were the real one, wouldn't she have said something years ago?



He even thought, if she had, maybe their marriage wouldn't have ended the way it did



Catching the relief in his eyes, Lainey wasted no time nudging him back toward the study


Once he was gone, she pulled out her phone and crafted another tweet, puttinng on just the right shade of wounded innocence. "The truth will stand on its own. I trust those who truly know me will continue to believe in me."
###Chapter 80 Welcome Back,Enigma
Lainey's post instantly set Enigma's fans on the attack,their urge to defend her erupting in full force.



The replies under Eleanor's tweet grew nastier by the minute, overflowing with cruel and biting remarks.



Lillian, barely able to contain her outrage, called Eleanor in a rush. "Eleanor, how long are you going to let her get away with this? When are you finally going to shut her down?"



She was fed up with Lainey's manipulations and couldn't tolerate another second



If Eleanor wouldn't step up, Lillian was determined to find someone who would.



The truth was. Eleanor had been thinking about making a move.



It would let her call out Lainey's behavior without revealing the fact that she was Enigma.



But now, she had another idea.



A sly, enigmatic smile appeared on her lips. "Right  now's the perfect moment."



Before Lillian could reply, Eleanor had already ended the call.



She jumped onto Twitter and switched to an account that hadn't posted in three years but still boasted tens of millions of followers.



Without much effort, Eleanor snapped a selfie, her expression calm but laced with quiet defiance.



With a tap, she shared the photo and let the tweet fly.



Ryland was the first to spot the new post.



His jaw practically hit the floor



"No way! Eleanor is actually Enigma?" he blurted out in disbelief.



For a moment, he questioned whether he was even awake.



Things only escalated when Besty, Enigma Group's brand director, immediately shared Enigma's tweet,adding,"Welcome back, Enigma."



That repost made it official that Eleanor really was Enigma.



The Internet exploded. "Are you kidding me? Was I actually trash-talking my favorite designer?"


"I can't believe how clueless I was.I want to crawl into a hole and disappear."



"How could I have insulted the real Enigma while defending a fake? I honestly deserve a slap."


"Enigma, I'm so sorry. We're not worthy of being your fans."



"I was wrong."



Fans flooded Eleanor's comments with tearful apologies, desperate to make amends.



Eleanor never cared what they thought, anyway.



Truthfully, if Lillian hadn't been attacked by online mobs,Eleanor would have never revealed herself



With a quick tap, she sent out another tweet. "Lillian is the one you owe an apology to. If not for her, Enigma would have stayed away."



Those two short tweets unleashed a fresh tidal wave online.



For a moment, the fans were caught off guard, but they soon understood exactly what Eleanor was getting at Eleanor was right, and if Lillian hadn't been targeted by trolls, Enigma would have stayed hidden, just as she had for the past three years.



It was their own actions that dragged Lillian into the mess and forced Enigma to reveal herself.



Fans found themselves deeply touched by the loyalty between Enigma and Lillian



To them, Enigma felt untouchable, as distant and flawless as the moon hanging in the night sky



They were almost afraid to bother her, worried their words would ruin the magic.



Instead, all their guilt and protective energy were redirected to Lillian, swearing to defend Enigma's best friend at all costs.



"To make up for it, I just placed ten orders from the Brooks Group website!"



Instantly, similar comments flooded in.



"Let's all shop together!"


"I'm officially switching my whole house to Brooks Group products!"



In no time, the Brooks Group's online store was completely wiped out by fans. Not a single item, down to the last toilet seat cover,was left in stock.



As a result, the Brooks Group's stock pice skyrocketed.
###Chapter 81 You Sound Green With Envy
Ryland never expected that the Brooks Group would be the biggest winner out of all this.



He couldn't resist bragging about it. Grabbing his phone, he dialed Nolan. "Nolan, jealous yet?" he teased.



There was a short silence before Nolan's cool,detached voice came through, "That's all it takes to excite you?"



Instead of being dampened, Ryland became even more animated."Oh, admit it.You sound green with envy. Eleanor just dropped a tweet, and our firm's value shot up by billions. Meanwhile, you've been pulling strings behind the scenes nonstop, but what's to show for it? Nothing."



The more he spoke, the more triumphant he sounded.so much so that he didn't even notice Nolan's silence stretching on.



When he realized his friend's silence, Ryland quickly softened his tone. "But credit where it's due, Nolan.You've got sharp instincts. The woman you like? She's extraordinary." That line finally eased Nolan's expression.


After ending the call, he opened his Facebook and posted one line. "I feel hurt."



Over at Eleanor's apartment, Lillian was sprawled on the sofa,scrolling through glowing fan comments with her.



The second she saw Nolan's post, she nearly leapt up.Shoving her phone in Eleanor's face, she squealed,"Look! Nolan says he's hurt because of you!"



Eleanor gave the post a glance, her lips twitching faintly.



Honestly, Nolan could be so childish.



"Don't give me that look!" Lillian laughed, nudging her with her elbow. "Seriously, why don't you just say yes to him already? Now that everyone knows you're Enigma, you two are basically the ultimate power couple!"



Eleanor calmly pushed her head aside. "I've got no time for romance. I'm busy planning a charity foundation to help orphans across the country."



Lillian pouted. "Keep denying it all you want. But if another woman snatches him up, don't come crying to me." While Eleanor wasn't crying, Myah was almost in tears.



Ever since Eleanor's identity came out, Hope House had been overrun by reporters.



"Ms. Sutton, how did you raise such a genius like Enigma?"



"Was she always special as a child?"



"Can you share her childhood story?"



Myah had no answers for them.



To her, Eleanor was just a bright, kindhearted kid and not some mysterious figure wrapped in fanfare.



Overwhelmed, she shut the doors and refused to see anyone.



When Eleanor heard what was happening, she immediately went online and posted, "Please don't disturb Myah. She's simply a kindhearted person."



Her fans listened, and within hours, the crowd outside Hope House cleared away.



But then, sharp-eyed followers noticed that Enigma had registered a national orphan foundation.



Instantly,her comments flooded with excitement. "I'll donate right away!"



"Our idol isn't just talented, she's kind too!"


"Open the donation channel, I'll be the first in line!"



The Internet atmosphere flipped from noisy chaos to celebration.



Fans cheered as though they had won a battle.



Meanwhile, Lainey watched from the shadows.Seeing her name mentioned less and less should have brought relief, but the truth hit her hard. Eleanor was Enigma.



And she had seen firsthand just how terrifyingly loyal and passionate Enigma's fans could be. If they ever turned on her, she knew it would be the end.
###Chapter 82 | Want You Out!
Yet,Lainey had forgotten that the Internet had a long memory.



After a few days of cheering and hype, Enigma's fans finally cooled off and started piecing the whole mess together.



That was when it hit them that Lainey had played a huge part in their blunder.



If it weren't for her vague, misleading words, they would never have mistaken her for Enigma in the first place.



Once that realization settled in, the fans didn't even need to sayit aloud. One by one, they slid into private group chats, ready to launch a counterattack.



This time, they wanted revenge.



"Anyone got dirt on Lainey Todd? Let's dig everything up."



"Didn't she brag about being a Gilbert? Please. The Gilberts aren't even relevant in Elepdon."


"Forget that. What about her number and address?Who can leak them?" Within thirty minutes, her phone number, home address, and even her usual hangouts, the cafés, malls,and everything in between,were plastered online for anyone to see.



Not long after, Nolan threw fuel on the fire by publicly cutting ties between the Todd and the Gilbert families,making it clear that his loyalty stood firmly with Enigma.


On the other side, Lainey was relaxing with a face mask on, casually watching a drama.



Suddenly, her phone lit up with a message from an unknown number. "Bitch, thief. Just die already."


Right after that, her phone went haywire, buzzing nonstop as the flood of messages turned into a full-blown onslaught.



"Ah!" Lainey shrieked, clutching her ears before hurling the phone against the wall.



How could people be so vile?



They had leaked her personal number as if she were the villain.



It wasn't her fault they jumped to conclusions!



She had never once confirmed she was Enigma. Why should she be punished for their stupidity?


Damn it all! They deserved every curse she could think of.



But the blow that shook her the hardest was Nolan's public declaration. By siding with Eleanor, he ended all cooperation with the Gilbert family and divested the Todd Group.



Lainey was freaking out. What was she supposed to do now?



Jonny would be livid.



And right on cue, the door opened, and there he was.



His stare was sharp enough to cut and heavy enough to crush her.



Lainey's legs turned to water. She wanted to run to him,to explain, but her body wouldn't move.


All she managed was a shaky whisper. "Jonny..."


Jonny walked up to her, step by step, and then slapped her hard across the face. "You worthless woman! Why don't you just die? Plagiarism was bad enough,but now the whole thing's out of control. Do you see what you've done? We and the Gilbert family are finished because of you. Divorce! I want you out!" Divorce?



The word stabbed her like a knife. She couldn't afford that, not now, not ever.



Tears streamed down as she clung to his wrist in desperation. "I only did it for you, for this family! Tell me,what did I do so wrong?"



But Jonny's patience was gone.



With another vicious slap, he knocked her to the floor and barked at the maids, "Lock her in her room. She doesn't step out unless I say so."



Lainey kicked and fought weakly, but the maids easily dragged her away.



Jonny tugged at his tie in frustration, regret washing over him.



How could he have been so blind? Eleanor. The woman he had dismissed as plain and docile had been Enigma all along-the genius designer the entire industry revered.



And him?



He had chosen Lainey instead, a woman who turned out to be nothing but a shallow pretender.



If Eleanor were still with him, if he hadn't signed those  divorce papers... he wouldn't just be her ex-husband -he would be the husband of Enigma.



The Todd Group would never have been pushed to the edge of bankruptcy.


They wouldn't be mocked and toyed with by Nolan,who invested one day and pulled out the next.



No,he couldn't let it end this way.



He had to get Eleanor back, no matter what it took.



She had loved him for three years; those feelings couldn't have been fake. If he humbled himself, if he begged,surely she would forgive him.



With trembling fingers, he pulled up Eleanor's number and hit dial.



But every time, the same cold recording answered,"The number you've dialed is no longer in service."



After trying again and again, he finally sank onto the sofa,hollow and stunned.



Of course.



With Nolan by her side now, why would she ever look back?



But no matter what it took, Eleanor had to be his again. If persuasion failed, he wasn't above taking a darker path.





But for now, he had no move to play.
###Chapter 83 Take Me Out To Eat
Eleanor had no idea about Jonny's determination.


At that moment, she was fully absorbed in her duties at the Hope House.



Myah had already seen the trending news online, but for a while, she kept it to herself, unsure whether to bring it up.



In the end, she gathered her courage and went over to Eleanor, speaking with quiet sincerity. "Eleanor, you should start thinking about your own future. You can't spend your whole life here It's time you found someone to share your days with."



The "someone" she hinted at was none other than Nolan.



Myah's words caught her off guard, though she knew they came from a place of genuine care.


Turning,she gave a soft smile. "Myah, if I leave, who will be here to help you?" she asked gently.


Before Myah could answer, a figure stepped into the doorway,his tall frame blocking the sunlight. Both women looked up, startled to see Nolan standing there. Neither of them had noticed when he arrived.



Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. Why was he here?


Myah, however, recovered quickly. She nudged Eleanor forward with a knowing smile. "Go keep Mr.Stewart company. Don't worry about the rest. He's been such a generous supporter of the orphanage."



Her words sounded casual, but it was clear she was deliberately giving them space



She had read enough online to know that Nolan had feelings for Eleanor



With Myah practically pushing her, Eleanor had no choice but to lead Nolan around as though he were an honored guest



They strolled along, talking off and on.



After a while, Nolan was the one to stop first



He turned to Eleanor, a teasing smile in his eyes."What's the matter, my dear girlfriend?"



Eleanor's cheeks burned.



Girlfriend?



When did that happen? She was about to snap back when he suddenly reached for her wrist,his touch warm and firm.


With a gentle tug, he drew her closer, and his voice dropped low. "If you're going to find a partner," he murmured,"it can only be me."


Then,just as quickly, he released her. He slid his hands into his pockets, his whole demeanor shifting-now relaxed, almost smug.



"Since I'll be the one in the end," he added with a faint smirk, "I might as well start the role early."


Eleanor could only stare at him, torn between exasperation and helplessness.



She couldn't argue with him



In the entire city of Elepdon, there really wasn't a man who could compare to him.


And though she hated to admit it, their recent interactions had changed her heart. Slowly, bit by bit,she had started to feel something for him.


Nolan wasn't just easy on the eyes. He was dependable, kind, and the kind of man who gave his all, and not only to her but also to the Hope House she poured her heart into. By all accounts, he really was the right choice.


Eleanor thought to herself that if she were ever to settle down with someone in this lifetime, Nolan wouldn't be a bad pick at all.



Her quietness made Nolan's heart race. He realized he had gambled, and for once, luck was on his side.



He had been terrified that pushing her might scare her away.


But she shone too brightly for him to stay still. He had been haunted by the thought that someone else could sweep her away if he didn't act.



Now,relief washed over him. The risk had been worth it.



Smiling, he reached for her hand and snapped a picture of their fingers interlaced. W/ithout hesitation.he posted it on Twitter and tagged her account. "My dear girlfriend, looking forward to our future."



To his delight, Eleanor didn't stop him.



If he was the one she would end up with anyway,she figured she might as well start getting used to it now.


She shared his post, tagged him, and wrote, "My dear boyfriend,looking forward to our future." After hitting repost, she slipped her fingers into Nolan's hand,feeling the warmth of his palm. "I'm starving. Take me out to eat."



Nolan's smile softened even more, his tone carrying nothing but affection. "Whatever you want."



The two of them happily flaunted their relationship online.



But while they enjoyed themselves, the Twitter staff were the ones paying the price



Their announcement hit the platform like a storm,crashing the server.


The operations team scrambled around trying to fix the mess, and when they finally got things under control, they left a helpless comment under the couple's posts. "Next time, maybe warn us before dropping a bomb like this?"



Of couse, their plea was completely ignored


At the same time, Ryland and Lillian were equally floored.



Since no one could get through to Nolan or Eleanor directly,all the calls landed on them instead.


At a bar, Lillian slammed her glass against the counter.  grinding her teeth.



Just a few days ago, Eleanor swore she was too busy to bother with love, and now here she was, publicly declaring her romance with Nolan?



Lillian refused to swallow it.


She was dead set on tracking Eleanor down and getting answers.
###Chapter 84 You're Not My Wife



Lillian made her way towards the bar's exit but stopped short when she saw Jonny sprawled drunkenly on the floor.



His suit was rumpled, his hair was sticking up like a bird's nest, and he was nothing like the polished president image he usually tried so hard to maintain.



In his arms, he held a crudely carved wooden rabbit,clutching it tightly as he muttered in a slur, "Eleanor.sweetheart..."



At the sound of her friend's name, Lillian's fury spiked.She almost smacked him right there



This scumbag!



Where was all this so-called affection back when it actually mattered?



Scowling in disgust,she turned sharply and made for the exit.



But right at the doorway, she nearly collided with Lainey. Lillian couldn't be bothered. Without a word, she sidestepped and swept past her, as if Lainey weren't even worth a glance.


Lainey, on the other hand, seethed inside at the blatant dismissal. Still, she bit her tongue and pressed forward, only to see Jonny slumped on the floor.



Her stomach sank.



So this was what he had been doing? Did he have no shame left at all?



After Eleanor's bombshell post, Jonny had stormed out without explanation. Now here he was, humiliating himself in public.



If the bartender hadn't called, she wouldn't even have bothered showing up



She jabbed him with the tip of her shoe "Jonny, get up. We're going home."



But the moment he realized it wasn't the woman he wanted, his drunken fury flared. "Who the hell are you?Get lost! You're not my wife. Eleanor is my wife! She's my only wife!"



The bar instantly buzzed with whispers and side glances. The crowd, who already recognized Jonny,were clearly enjoying the spectacle.



So this was how the so-called golden couple ended up?



Lainey's face burned. Jonny could afford to be a drunken fool, but her pride wouldn't allow it.


In a fit of rage, she snatched the rabbit from his arms and hurled it to the floor. "Jonny, look at me properly!I'm your wife. Not Eleanor! Me!"


Without waiting for his reply, she dragged him up with brute force and hauled him toward the door, ignoring the murmurs and mocking stares.


Neither of them noticed the tall man who stepped forward once they stumbled away. His bespoke suit was sharp,his presence commanding.



Slowly,he walked over to the wooden rabbit left behind, crouched down, and picked it up.


As he studied it, his sharp eyes widened in disbelief.Wasn't this the very same rabbit his boss's daughter had held in her arms when she disappeared twenty years ago?



He straightened, his voice dropping low and cold as he addressed the bodyguard at his side. "I want  everything there is to know about that woman."



Days later, at the Gilbert family's estate, Kurt and his wife sat nervously in the drawing room.



The man across from them radiated authority with nothing more than his posture.


Kurt rubbed his palms against his knees, finally mustering the courage to speak.. Perkins,regarding the Homecoming Support Foundation you mentioned, we're more than willing to provide full support."



Truthfully, he couldn't believe their luck.



Denny Perkins was a man of mystery and immense influence, yet here he was, offering a partnership that came with nothing but benefits.



But why him? What had he done to earn this stroke of fortune?



Denny lifted his teacup and spoke without looking up."No need for pleasantries, Mr. Gilbert, I didn't come here solely because of your family's influence."


He finally raised his eyes, sharp and deliberate. "It's also because I heard that your daughter was adopted."
###Chapter 85 When Did You Get Here
 Kurt and his wife looked at each other, their faces going pale.



They had buried this secret so deep that even Lainey herself had no clue. So how on earth did Denny manage to dig it up?



A wave of panic washed over Kurt.



But the more he thought about it, the less surprising it seemed.



With Denny's reach and influence, pulling a secret like this intothe light would have been child's play.



Forcing his lips into something that resembled a smile,Kurt tried to keep his composure. "Mr. Perkins, you certainly keep yourself well-informed."



However, Denny wasn't finished, and the very next words out of his mouth hit like a thunderclap. "From the way you're reacting, don't tell me you actually stole her back then?"



Kurt's heart nearly stopped. His hands trembled as he shook his head wildly. "No! Absolutely not! We  adopted her properly, from an orphanage,with all the official paperwork!"



Lauryn Gilbert, Kurt's wife, was terrified that the wrong idea might take root and jumped in at once."Yes,exactly! Westhaven Orphanage.Everything was done by the book, and all the documents are there!"


Denny casually jotted down the name, then let his tone ease into something almost friendly. "No need to be so stiff. We're just talking. Tell me, after you brought her home, how did she grow up? What kind of student was she? I want the whole picture,every detail. This could determine whether you end up holding this project."



Neither Kurt nor Lauryn dared hold anything back after that They poured out everything they could remember.



What they didn't realize was that someone else had heard it all. Lainey had been on her way inside when the words stopped her cold.



Adopted? The identity she had worn like a crown for years, the pride of being the Gilberts' daughter, was nothing but a lie?



Even if things with Jonny had fallen apart, she had thought she could still lean on the Gilbert family.



But now, she wasn't even theirs by blood. The truth was too much to bear.



She just couldn't accept it.



Just like that bitch Eleanor, she was nothing more than an orphan.


In that moment, it felt as if her entire world had crumbled.



Her knees went weak, and she staggered back several steps before finally steadying herself.



Inside, the conversation ended, and Denny stepped out. His aura of wealth and authority was impossible to ignore.



Lainey's heart lurched, and she instinctively shrank into the shadows near the doorway



Denny didn't notice her.



He paused in the courtyard, pulling out a wooden rabbit, his eyes burning with a hope he could barely contain.



He needed to arrange a meeting with Lainey and somehow get hold of a strand of her hair. A DNA test would confirm everything.



With that decision made, he tucked the rabbit back into his pocket and left the Gilbert family's estate. Only when the sound of his car faded did Lainey slip out from her hiding spot.


That rabbit... wasn't it the very one she had smashed to the ground?


So,he had picked it up afterward?



From the bits she overheard and Denny's demeanor,a wild, reckless thought began to take root.



Could it be that this man was from Eleanor's real family?



Could he have mistaken her for Eleanor?



Her nails dug into her palms. No.



That could never be allowed.



Eleanor must remain an orphan forever


If Eleanor not only carried the title of Enigma and was destined to marry into the Stewart family but also turned out to be from a powerful household...then her life would be utterly eclipsed. She would never stand a chance again.



The idea alone filled Lainey with fury.


Forcing herself to calm down, she pulled out her phone, uploaded the photo she had secretly snapped  of Denny, and quickly ran a search.



The results made her pulse race.



The man was Denny Perkins, chief assistant at the Benton Group, one of the most powerful dynasties in the world.



Their influence stood shoulder to shoulder with the Stewart Group's, stretching across continents.


Lainey's thoughts went wild.


If she played her cards right, she could slip seamlessly into that kind of fortune



The Gilberts would be nothing in comparison.



And Jonny? By then, he would be a discarded ###Chapter of her life.



She wouldn't even have to lift a finger.


The Benton family would surely arrange a marriage far more prestigious than anything Jonny could offer.With her beauty and the Bentons backing her, why stop at Elepdon? Even marrying a Breoquan prince wasn't impossible!


Lainey's excitement swelled so much that she barely noticed Kurt stepping out. "Lainey? When did you get here? Why didn't you go inside?" His brows furrowed with concern. "Did Jonny upset you again? If he did, just tell me, and I'll take care of it."



The affection in his tone was evident, but now it only rang hollow.


He was just an adoptive father. Compared to the possibilities she had just uncovered, what was Kurt Gilbert worth?



Her interest in humoring him evaporated. Brushing past him without a second glance, she said flatly, "I just got here. I'm tired. I'm going to my room."


Kurt blinked after her,bewildered.



Why was his daughter suddenly so distant?



Surely Jonny had wronged her again.


His fists clenched at his sides. One way or another, he would make that boy pay.



Lainey ddn't deserve to be treated this way.
###Chapter 86 I'm Not Kurt Gilbert's Daugh ter  	
Kurt and his wife adored their adopted daughter,Lainey, and her sudden return had them overjoyed.


Within just half a day,they had already showered her with jewelry,spending without a second thought as if glittering trinkets could buy her happiness.


Lainey, however, wasn't moved. She forced a polite smile,but her heart wasn't in it.


What she was really waiting for was Denny's call.


She figured Denny's plan would be to come up with some excuse to meet her, then secretly use her hair for a DNA test. That would be her perfect chance to secretly switch Eleanor's hair with hers.



Her prediction came true sooner than she thought.The very next morning, her phone buzzed.



Denny used the excuse that, since she played an important role in the Homecoming Support Foundation Project, he wanted to sit down with her at Usepsall Café the following day to go over the details.


Lainey played her part well. She acted hesitant at first,  then reluctantly agreed to meet him.


At that point, everything was in place, and she just needed the final step to complete her plan.


She quickly told her parents she would go home and drove straight back to the Todd family's villa.


Since the household staff had already cleared out Eleanor's things, the room looked almost empty,with only a few old pieces of furniture left behind.


Putting on gloves, Lainey crouched down and carefully searched every inch of the floor.


After almost an hour of searching, she finally spotted a few long strands of hair tucked deep under the bathroom sink.



Using tweezers, she carefully collected them and sealed them inside the bag she had prepared in advance.



With that done,she could practically picture herself becoming part of the Benton family. It felt so close she could almost touch it.



Just as she was happily getting ready to leave, she was startled when Jonny suddenly came back home.



His body reeked of alcohol, and his face looked stormy as he snapped, "Gone the whole night, and  this soon after our wedding? What's this,huh? Are you already thinking about divorce?"



He thought he was just blowing off steam, but to his shock,Lainey smiled and calmly answered,"Of course,I'd love that."



Jonny froze, completely caught off guard.


He had been expecting her to cry, throw a fit, or beg like she usually did. Never in his wildest dreams did he think she would agree so easily.



Squinting suspiciously, he studied her face."What kind of game are you playing now?"



Lainey crossed her arms, walked toward him with a proud look, and said with disdain, "Game? No. It's simple. You're just not good enough for me."



Jonny wasn't the naive lover he used to be. Seeing her dodge the point, he grabbed her wrist and demanded, "Tell me exactly what you mean!"


Lainey quickly pulled her hand free and lifted her chin proudly. "Do you want to know why I didn't come home last night? I went to watch a very entertaining show, and while I was there, I discovered something shocking. I'm not Kurt Gilbert's daughter. I'm actually the long-lost daughter of the Benton family in Breoqua." She didn't bother to keep it a secret anymore.Why should she? With Eleanor's hair in her possession,the DNA results would prove her claim soon enough. Then,once she was officially recognized as a Benton,her position would be unshakable.


Jonny,however,was stunned.



His mind reeled at her words. Could this really be true?


The Benton family was just as powerful and renowned as the Stewart family



If they backed the Todd Group, not only would the company survive, but it would also flourish.



But then again, could he really believe Lainey?


She had put on acts, lied, and schemed too mmany times for him to trust her easily.


Lainey noticed the doubt flickering in his eyes,but she didn't care in the slightest.


Instead,she let out a mocking laugh, her gaze dripping with scorn as she continued, "Get it through your head,Jonny. I'm the one divorcing you."


When had Lainey ever dared to look him in the eye and challenge him like this?



Something about her newfound confidence rattled him.  Could she actually be telling the truth thistime?


Even if she wasn't, he reasoned, if there was even the slightest chance of using this connection to the Benton family,it would be worth it.


With that thought, his attitude shifted in an instant. His harshness melted into sweetness, his voice softening as he coaxed, "Lainey, after all we've been through,can we really just end things like this? Listen, there's a grand charity auction coming up in a few days. I'll take you with me. Whatever catches your eye,I'll make sure we bid for it, alright?"


But as the supposed future member of the Benton family,why would she care for such little gestures?


Even so, until she drained every bit of benefit from him,letting him trail by her side wasn't sucha bad plan.


Lainey tilted her chin and looked down on him with a smug expression "That depends on how well you perform."



The next afternoon, Lainey met Denny as planned


Treating her with the utmost respect, Denny politely pulled out a chair for her. Once she sat down, he took a file from his briefcase and placed it in front of her.


"Mrs. Todd, our firm is launching a charity program called the Homecoming Support Foundation. Since  you've always been passionate about charity work,we'd like to hear your opinion."



Lainey picked up the document, though she hardly paid attention to its contents. Her mind was elsewhere.With practiced subtlety, she slipped a sealed bag from her purse under the table and quietly placed the strands of hair onto her lap.


She lingered a moment, then took a delicate sip of her drink before excusing herself smoothly. "I'm sorry,I need to step away for a moment."



As she stood up, the strand of hair slid off her lap and landed on the sofa cushion.



To anyone watching, it would look like it hadsimply fallen naturally.



Sure enough, the moment she stepped toward the restroom, she caught sight of Denny discreetly snatching up the hair and slipping it quickly into his pocket.



Lainey's heart raced with excitement.


Perfect. Everything was going exactly as planned.


Soon,she would be part of the Benton family


But she wasn't as invisible as she thought. From across the room, Darleen had been quietly watching. She frowned in confusion.



Why was Lainey behaving so oddly, dropping strands of hair like that?



And why did that man with her look so strangely familiar?



Darleen wracked her memory, trying to recall who he was,but nothing came to mind.



Eventually,she let it go.



Whatever the scheme was, she wanted no part of it.Lainey was nothing but trouble



She had learned that lesson before, and she wasn't about to fall for it again.
###Chapter 87 You've Met The Bentons Before
Lainey finally gotthe moment she had been waiting for.





Just two days later, headlines exploded across the internet


"Breaking News! Lainey Todd, wife of the Todd Group's CEO, was revealed to be the long-lost daughter of the prestigious Benton family from Breoqua!"


The announcement instantly stirred a frenzy online.


Almost immediately. Eleanor's phone buzzed. It was Lillian calling."Eleanor,did you see it? That sly woman actually managed to climb her way up. Just goes to show, bad weeds never die."



Eleanor leaned back on her sofa, calmly scrolling through a picture of Lainey on her tablet. In the photo,Lainey appeared shy and innocent, though her expression stayed unreadable.


Eleanor exchanged a few polite words with Lillian before ending the call. Not long after, another notification lit up her phone


It was a message from Nolan.o you want me to look into the Benton family for you?"


Eleanor's slender fingers tapped a short reply. need."



The Benton family had nothing to do with her



She had bigger things to worry about now.



In just three days, an antique that had been lost overseas for years was going up for sale at Crownwell Auctions.



It was a national treasure, and leaving it abroad was not an option. It had to be brought back home.



As Eleanor thought about this, her phone buzzed again.





Another message from Nolan popped up



"Baby, you've been ignoring me for too long.When are we finally having dinner?" It ended with a pitiful puppy emoji.



A rare smile tugged at Eleanor's lips as she looked at the cartoon face. For once, her usually composed expression softened. She typed a single word back. "Now."


Moments later, a sleek black Bentley rolled to a stop in front of her apartment building.



The door opened, and Nolan stepped out first.



His long strides, sharply tailored suit, and perfectly defined features under the sunlight immediately caught people's attention.


With broad shoulders and a lean waist, he looked effortlessly magnetic, drawing the eyes of everyone around.



When Eleanor slid into the back seat, her brows pinched slightly. "Next time, don't park right at the entrance."



Nolan tilted his head,his tone playful. "And why not?"


She fastened her seatbelt and met his gaze steadily."Because I don't like being gawked at like I'm on display."



His chuckle was low and indulgent. "Ah, so it seems being too exceptional really is a flaw."



After a smooth drive, the car pulled up in front of Cloudcrest Dining-a renowned luxury restaurant in Elepdon. Exclusive and notoriously difficult to book, it was a place reserved for only the city's most influential figures.


A waiter, already waiting at the entrance, bowed respectfully and ushered them inside.


To Eleanor's surprise, the entire restaurant was empty,save for the gentle hum of soothing background music.


She glanced around, her brows slightly raised "You booked out the whole place?"



Nolan pulled out a chair for her with elegant precision,waiting until she was seated before replying, "Of course. With who we are and the relationship we share,do you think we'd get to enjoy a peaceful dinner otherwise?"



Eleanor said nothing


He wasn't wrong, after all.


Yet, sitting in such a massive restaurant with no one else around felt a little excessive to her


However,right at that moment, commotion broke out at the entrance.


A familiar voice barked, full of irritation. "What do you mean we can't go in? Do you even know who I am?"It was Jonny.


Hot on his heels was Lainey's soft, coaxing tone."Jonny, leave it. We can eat somewhere else. It's only dinner."



On the surface, her voice was patient and generous Inside,though,she was sneering.



Once,she had thought Jonny was the perfect catch But now? He seemed painfully ordinary.



Throwing a fit over being denied entry hardly reflected the refinement of the elite.



Once the Bentons returned from abroad and officially claimed her, she would cast him aside without hesitation, otherwise,he would only drag down her status.



Jonny, completely oblivious to her inner thoughts,finally swallowed his anger when the manager refused to budge Turning to her with a guilty face, he murmured, "Lainey, I'm sorry Let's just go somewhere else."



Soon,their voices died down, and silence returned to the restaurant.


Nolan leisurely sliced into his steak and remarked,"1can't help but wonder how such respectable parents  like the Bentons ended up with a daughter like that."



Eleanor's eyes lifted in curiosity. "You've met the Bentons before?"


"At several international business conferences," he replied, his gaze steady on hers. "Lainey is nothing like them,especially Mrs. Benton. She carries herself with a kind of calm elegance that, oddly enough, makes me think of you."


Eleanor's knife paused briefly before continuing as if nothing had happened.



She didn't bite at his remark. Instead, she asked in a light, offhand tone, "And what sort of aura do you think I have?"



Nolan set down his utensils and leaned in across the table,closing the distance between them.


His eyes were intent, and his voice was low. "Bold.Alluring, Fearless."



A quick rush went through Eleanor, her heartbeat skipping unexpectedly.


She turned her head, pretending to focus on her plate,though the warmth creeping up her ears betrayed her."Just eat your dinner."



When he caught the flush at her ears, Nolan's smile deepened.


Leaning back into his seat, he picked up his usual calm composure. "The Crownwell Auctions are coming up in a few days. Shall we go together?"


Eleanor had planned to attend anyway, so she answered without hesitation, "Alright."
###Chapter 88 My Girlfriend's Busy
On the day of the auction, Eleanor was just about to hail a cab when a sleek, understated Bentley rolled up right in front of her



Without bothering with formalities, she opened the door and slid into the backseat.


After all, why not take advantage of having a personal driver at her disposal?


As she got comfortable, Nolan looked at her with sparkling eyes.


Eleanor felt her cheeks warm and quickly turned to the window,pretending to admire the passing scenery.


Erick,watching quietly from the front seat, couldn't help but let out a sly chuckle.



Ah, the unmistakable vibe of romance



Life had certainly gotten sweeter ever since Nolan had successfully won Eleanor's heart



The auction was being held at the Lumina Hotel. The moment Eleanor stepped out of the car, a group of eager socialites surrounded her.


"Eleanor, I'm getting married soon! Can you design my wedding gown?"



"Eleanor, I'm a fashion design student and have won countless awards. Can I be your apprentice?"


"Eleanor, I'll pay anything just to have you design my evening dress."



"Eleanor,you look absolutely stunningl"



The crowd quickly became overwhelming, but Nolan calmly extended his long arm and pulled Eleanor close.


"Sorry, my girlfriend's busy," he said, keeping her protected as he guided her toward the venue.



No one dared cross him.



The socialites had no choice but to step aside and disperse,swallowing their frustration.


Meanwhile, Jonny walked in with Lainey draped over his arm and froze at the sight of Nolan holding Eleanor.



Fuck!



How had Eleanor grown even more radiant? That dazzling woman should have been his wife



It all boiled down to Eleanor.



If she hadn't thrown a fit when Lainey returned, he could have had both incredible women by his side.


Still,things weren't entirely lost.



Lainey would soon secure recognition from the Benton family and claim their massive fortune.



Whatever Lainey acquired would ultimately come under his control.



With riches comparable to entire kingdoms, he refused to accept that Eleanor wouldn't come back to him eventually.



Lainey noticed his silence and immnediately understood what he was thinking.



She wasn't bothered.



The divorce was final, yet the auction was still a chance she couldn't miss.



After all,which woman would turn down more jewels?



What Lainey hadn't anticipated was Eleanor showing up at the auction and easily capturing everyone's attention. She couldn't stand it.



Puffing out her chest and lifting her head, she deliberately cleared her throat.


Even the socialites who were about to leave couldn't help but return, albeit reluctantly



"Oh, it's Lainey!"



"Lainey, don't forget us when you officially join the Benton family."



"Yes! The Bentons are so incredibly wealthy When they acknowledge you, don't forget us little people,"



They bent over backward, showering her with praise,because they had no choice



After all, both the Stewarts and the Bentons were untouchable.



Lainey, who was enjoying their praise, replied with pride, "Of course, I'll never forget you, my dear friends."



Then she purposely looked at Eleanor, only to see her completely ignoring her and walking off with Nolan.


Fury flared, and she clenched her fists tightly.


 
The audacity! Once she was officially acknowledged, Eleanor's family would effectively become hers.


And when she finally secured the Benton fortune, she would make sure Eleanor understood the full extent of it.


She would relish watching how Eleanor would respond to such a revelation.
###Chapter 89 Should I Lend You Some
Thirty minutes later, the auction finally got underway


The first lot was a dazzling ten-carat pink diamond ring called The One.


The moment it hit the spotlight, the crowd of socialites gasped in awe.


The auctioneer cleared his throat, announcing."Opening bid is $10 million."



Lainey,legs crossed and confidence radiating, shot Jonny a look



Jonny caught her meaning but hesitated, lowering his voice. "Lainey,how about picking something else?"


The Todd Group was in deep financial trouble, and he only had a million in liquid cash to his name


There was no way he could cough up ten million.



Lainey was unmoved.


If Jonny wasn't willing to shell out that kind of money for her, she saw no reason to entertain him further. She shot him a glare, her expression dripping with scorn. "You were the one who insisted I come,and now that I want this ring, you're hesitating? Don't worry, I won't force you. My real parents will be back soon,and when they are, I'll have more than enough jewelry like this."



She spoke as if her presence alone was a favor to him,completely unwilling to compromise.



Jonny could only clench his jaw in frustration at her attitude. "Fine, I'll bid on it!"



But before he could act, a calm, almost bored voice called out from the front row. "$50 million."



Nolan didn't bother with the paddle as he simply lounged back in his seat, naming a price that stunned the entire room into silence



Fifty million?



The ring's value didn't even reach thirty!


The auctioneer barely contained his excitement."$50million going once, going twice, sold!"


He hurried to close the bid, anxious that Nolan might suddenly retract his offer.


That extra twenty million would make his numbers  look fantastic. Of course, he was thrilled.



Nolan, meanwhile, seemed completely unfazed by the spectacle around him.


He accepted the ring from an attendant, then slipped it onto Eleanor's finger himself.


After studying how it looked on her hand, he gave a small, satisfied smile. "It's perfect for you."


Eleanor was left at a loss, unable to decipher his motives.


He was well aware that she had no real interest in extravagant jewelry.


To her, fifty million could have done so much more,like feeding and clothing the kids at Hope House instead.



Nolan noticed her quiet discomfort and immediately grasped what she was thinking.


Leaning in close, he whispered against her ear, "Save it for when I officially propose."


Eleanor found herself momentarily speechless.


That was...unexpectedly daring!



She genuinely didn't know how to respond. On the other hand, Lainey squirmed with envy watching the scene unfold.



What did Eleanor have that caught Nolan's attention?


She was going be acknowledged by the Bentons.Wasn't she supposed to be above someone like Eleanor?



Unable to hide her bitterness, she spoke up with a sneer. "Jonny, you really have my sympathy. Eleanor spent three years as your wife, relying on you for everything, and now that she's landed someone wealthier, she's tossed you aside without a second thought."


Her jab all but called Eleanor a gold digger.


Everyone else glanced around nervously, unwilling to say a word.



Neither camp was safe to offend, and a careless comment could mean real trouble later.


Right then, an uneasy hush fell over the room.


Eleanor didn't bother replying, simply glancing at Lainey for a moment before turning away.


Her focus was on business tonight; she had no intention of getting dragged into childish taunts. Auction item after item went up, antique paintings,sparkling jewelry, and Eleanor said nothing.


Meanwhile, Lainey, riding high on compliments from the crowd, snatched up several minor pieces, ignoring Jonny's livid face.


She shot a barbed remark at Eleanor. "So this is the legendary Enigma? Shows up at an auction and doesn't place a single bid. What's the matter? Money a little tight? Should I lend you some?"


Eleanor acted as though Lainey's words were nothing but background noise, refusing even to glance her way.


She sat quietly, looking bored, like nothing at the auction could hold her interest.


But as soon as the auctioneer brought up the Queen's diamond tiara, something flickered in her eyes.


"That one."



In one smooth, deliberate motion, she raised her hand,elegance and determination radiating from her.



With that simple gesture, she made it clear that no matter the price, she wouldn't back down.



No one else would dare challenge her. A heavy hush swept over the venue, as if everyone was holding their breath.
###Chapter 90 Everything I Have Is Yours
Nolan's gaze was soft, filled with unwavering warmth as if he was promising Eleanor,"The tiara will be yours."



A surge of envy twisted across Lainey's face,her eyes darkening with disbelief. "No way! How on earth did she come up with that much cash?"



Even knowing Eleanor was Enigma didn't make sense of it. She couldn't have managed that kind of money on her own.



Did Nolan secretly give it to her?


No,that couldn't be.


Nolan might be rich, but he wasn't reckless enough to throw a fortune at someone he had just started dating.


What Lainey didn't realize wasthat one day soon,Nolan would be willing to give up every cent he owned just to put a smile on Eleanor's face. That,however, was a Chapter yet to unfold.


For now, Eleanor sat unfazed by the doubters and let a small, confident smile play on her lips. She stood up, handed a card over to the auctioneer,and said in a clear, steady voice, "Feel free to check the balance."



Grinning widely, the auctioneer accepted the card and motioned for one of the staff members to handle it."Let's get this confirmed right away!"


WVhile they waited, Lainey's expression remained glued to Eleanor, her excitement barely contained as if she expected to watch Eleanor's bank account be exposed for everyone to see.



She folded her arms and scoffed, "Some people just can't help pretending to have what they don't! I can't wait for her to slip up, then we'll see what happens-"



A sudden, icy stare sent a shiver down her spine before she could get the rest of her sentence out.


Instinctively, she turned around and found herself staring into Nolan's unreadable eyes.


It rattled her.



Caught off guard, she clamped her mouth shut and stopped talking.


Just then, a staff member hurried back, waving the card. His voice shook with excitement as he handed it back to Eleanor and announced, "After checking,Miss Warren's balance exceeds ten billion. She's fully cleared to pay for the tiara."


Ten billion-an amount that left everyone stunned!


Besides Nolan, nobody else in the room seemed to hold that kind of financial firepower.


The question buzzed in everyone's mind: Who exactly was Eleanor?



Was there more to her than just being Enigma?


While the crowd whispered among themselves,Eleanor effortlessly won the Queen's diamond tiara,placing the opening bid of one hundred million.


She had braced herself for a bidding war, but to her surprise, no one else joined in to bid.


Lainey tried to stir up trouble, but Jonny grabbed her arm and kept her in check.


A wave of relief washed over Eleanor as she became the new owner of the Queen's diamond tiara.


In that moment, she knew she had honored her mentor's wish. Another priceless artifact had finally found its way home. Nolan watched the joy on her face and moved a little closer. "If there's ever anything you want, just say the word. I'll make sure you get it."


Eleanor carefully set the tiara to the side, then fixed her eyes on him. "Do you really mean that?"



A hint of worry tugged at her as she wondered if he even realized how much she was asking.



Taking on this mission meant pitting her own determination to stand firm against powerful financial interests.



Put simply, no amount of money was enough, no matter how much one had.



She could only push forward with everything she had.


If Nolan chose to support her, doors to treasures she could never reach alone might finally open.


But was he truly willing to take that step with her?


Something in the way Nolan held her gaze told her he understood exactly what she needed.



She wasn't looking for something ordinary, and he knew it. Still, he didn't hesitate.


His eyes traced her features, lingering on her lips. "Yes,I meant what I said." He then leaned in and pressed a soft, fleeting kiss to her lips, as if sealing a vow between them. "Everything I have is yours."


For a brief moment,Eleanor found herself completely swept up by him.


How did he always seem to know the right thing to say?


Although their time together had been brief, he had a way of making her feel as if she were the center of his entire world.



Eleanor found herself at a loss, unwilling to chase the thought any further.


To hide her flustered state, she sprang to her feet."I got what I wanted, so we should head out."


Nolan could immediately tell that she was being shy.


Choosing to let her off the hook, he held back any playful remarks.


He just offered a gentle nod and quietly walked out with her.
###Chapter 91 Is It True You Evaded Taxes
It wasn't until Eleanor and Nolan vanished completely from the venue that Lainey finally returned to reality.



She could hardly believe her eyes.



Nolan, acting as though Eleanor were the most precious person alive, was eager to hand over money?



What exactly did Eleanor possess that made her worthy of such devotion?



Her first instinct was to chase after them,but Jonny's hand held her back firmly.



The Benton family might wield incredible power in Breoqua,but here in Elepdon, the Stewart family ruled.Offending Nolan in his own territory would be a mistake even the Bentons couldn't rectify.



Being restrained by Jonny only made Lainey look down on him further.



He was utterly useless, always holding her back.


But seeing Nolan's generosity sparked an idea. Once she was acknowledged by the Bentons, she would push them to extend their influence domestically and arrange a strategic alliance with the Stewart family.



That way, Nolan would eventually be hers.



If she could have taken Jonny from Eleanor once,surely she could take Nolan too.



With her mind made up, Lainey stopped her protests and obediently followed Jonny back to the villa.



Her compliance, however, was only skin-deep.



Inside, her mind was a storm of anger and jealousy.



Thinking about Eleanor's bank balance churned her stomach with envy.



She assumed the money had come from Nolan and knew it would ultimately be hers.



A scheming smile crept onto her face as she formed a plan to investigate Eleanor further.



Hours passed, but she found nothing.



Still, she refused to give up.


Then, just as she was about to shut down her computer, she stumbled upon a critical detail. The Queen's diamond tiara, the same one Eleanor had auctioned tonight, was an exhibit from overseas.


According to the rules, the auction winner had to pay customs duties. But Eleanor hadn't done so.


Lainey's eyes lit up with mischief. "Eleanor, you've brought this upon yourself," she whispered under her breath.



Given her prestige in the design world, any post about Enigma would go viral instantly, and especially the one hinting at a legal misstep.


So within a day, Lainey's anonymous tweet exploded online.



The headline blared, "Shocking news! Famous designer Enigma caught evading taxes!"



She had even included a link to the official auction page.



A quick click revealed the words "tax unpaid" listed under the Queen's diamond tiara.



It was indisputable evidence.


Eleanor could almost guess who was behind this, but she had no way to defend herself. Technically, she hadn't paid the customs fee, but in reality, since the auction was for charity, no tax was required. Even if  she wanted to pay, the museum wouldn't accept it.


However, Eleanor couldn't reveal this reason,or her identity would be blown.


If that happened, she would end up spending far more than necessary on future auctions for national treasures.



Her fans, unaware of these details, saw only the headline that their idol had broken the law.



Disappointment swept through the fandom, and many abandoned her.



Even the operation of Enigma's store in Elepdon was affected.



After receiving a panicked call from Besty, Eleanor headed to the store immediately.


The moment she stepped out of the car, she was swarmed by media.



"Miss Warren! Is it true you evaded taxes?"


"You spent $100 million on the Queen's diamond tiara;was that money legitimate?"


"Will Enigma brand suffer because of this?"


Besty quickly appeared with her bodyguards, skillfully  creating a human shield around Eleanor.


Once they reached the lounge, she handed Eleanor the report detailing the losses.


"Boss, I'm sorry. My poor management..." Besty's voice was full of guilt.


They had lost one hundred million in just one day, and she felt she had let Eleanor down.


Eleanor took the document, gave it a quick look, and set it on the table. "It's fine. It's not your fault."



She could handle this loss, and if needed, she could make more under the name of the Soul Surgeon through the Underground Network, a move that would also protect her from constant scrutiny there.


Still, Besty felt responsible. "There are fans willing to defend you, but they're afraid to speak out because of legal issues. Should we post something on Twitter?"


Eleanor shook her head. She would rather take the criticism than risk exposing her identity.


She gave a few instructions to Besty and headed out.


Outside, the persistent reporters hadn't gone anywhere.


Paying them no mind, Eleanor walked directly to a  taxi at the curb.



Her calm, indifferent demeanor, completely ignoring the commotion, was once again photographed by onlookers, and within moments, the footage spread across social media.



The public reacted strongly.



"Who does she think she is? She's so cocky!"


"Look at her! She's probably scared and staying quiet to dodge the problem!"


"Not responding is the same as admitting it.Investigate her thoroughly!"



Before long, Enigma's once-spotless reputation began to tumble, the whispers growing louder with each passing hour.
###Chapter 92 My Wife Will Only Be Her
Several days later, the atmosphere at Stewart family's residence was tense.



The butler's report barely finished when Norwood shot Nolan a look of pure fury, unable to hide his displeasure.



"So this is the incredible woman you want as your wife?"Norwood snapped.


Nolan squared his shoulders, refusing to back down as he locked eyes with Norwood. "Grandpa, I believe in her."



That calm response only fueled Norwood's outrage,causing him to break into a fit of coughing as his cheeks turned bright red.


"You believe in her? What good is your belief?"



Norwood's hand shook as he pointed accusingly at Nolan. "I won't accept a granddaughter-in-law with a stained reputation! You've always gone your own way,but this time, you must do as I say. End it with her!"


Nolan kept silent, his eyes flickering toward the butler  for help.


Recognizing the cue, the butler moved quickly, gently patting Norwood's back to help him catch his breath.


Once Norwood had calmed down, Nolan returned his focus to him and spoke steadily. "Grandpa, she's my girlfriend. I'll handle things the way I see fit. Your health comes first, so please take care of yourself.I'll visit again in a few days."



Without waiting for a reply, he walked out of the house with purposeful steps.


"Why must you be so stubborn?" Norwood's anger boiled over as he slammed his cane on the floor.



He couldn't shake the feeling that the Stewart family was doomed to have someone put love above family honor.



Colson had done it once, and now Nolan was repeating the same mistake.


Norwood couldn't shake the fear that Nolan's downfall would eventually come at the hands of a woman.


At least he had guessed one thing correctly-Nolan always wore his heart on his sleeve.


When he fell for someone, it meant unwavering faith  and loyalty, no matter the circumstances.



From the driver's seat, Erick glanced at Nolan in the rearview mirror and spoke carefully. "Mr. Stewart, was your grandfather upset with you?"



Nolan reclined against the plush seat, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Don't worry about it."



He had no interest in revisiting that sour conversation.



His mind was on Eleanor.



The Internet backlash was getting worse by the hour,and he wasn't sure she could manage the pressure on her own.



"Get a PR team to take down the trending topic right away," he instructed.


Erick paused, a troubled expression flashing briefly."Mr. Stewart, we can't make it disappear. The scandal is about taxes, and that's way out of our hands."



The news even included the official auction page as proof, making any attempts to hide it completely useless.



In fact, Erick had tried to block the story the moment it broke, but the effort had been in vain.



Standard PR tricks were completely useless in a  situation like this.


The news left Nolan quiet, his usually cool gaze clouded with thought.


He stayed silent for a few seconds before giving a quiet order. "Stop the car here."


Dozens of reporters were waiting just outside the Stewart family's residence, and the moment the car rolled to a halt, they surged forward in a frenzy.


"Mr. Stewart, do you have any comment about Enigma's tax investigation?"


"Will your family block your engagement to Eleanor because of the scandal?"



"Are you planning to end things with Eleanor over this?"


"Mr. Stewart, can you give us your official response?"


Erick began to get out, ready to clear a path through the crowd, but Nolan held up a hand to stop him.



Without hesitation, Nolan got out and walked right into the sea of cameras and microphones.



Though his expression remained stern, a gentle warmth crept into his eyes as he spoke. "I believe in her.No matter what happens, my wife will only be her." Right then, the entire group of reporters instantly fell silent.



Even if they had heard Nolan say something similar in the past, the conviction in his voice this time left them speechless.


He was, after all, Nolan Stewart-the city's most striking and impossibly wealthy bachelor.


Eleanor might have been a renowned designer,but with Nolan's power and fortune, he could have chosen anyone he wanted. Why was he so obsessed with her of all people?


The more they tried to make sense of it, the more impossible it seemed.



As if that wasn't enough, Nolan delivered one last message, his voice unwavering. "Let me be clear: if anyone goes against her, they go against me."


He slid back into the car, leaving the press frozen in disbelief.



The reporters could already picture the chaos this story would unleash; the city's high-society women were bound to be devastated.


After all, casual flings were common, but true,unwavering loyalty from a man like Nolan was a rare n..thing.
###Chapter 93 Will You Let Us Handle This
 Within just half a day, Nolan's comments shot to the top of trending	topics,	tagged	with	#Nolan'sDevotionToEnigma         and         #Nolan'sSupportForEnigma.


Seeing the news,Eleanor felt a deep sense of warmth,finally understanding what it meant to be trusted completely.


"Eleanor, you've seen this, haven't you?" Lillian gripped her hand tightly,her voice edged with worry."Nolan has publicly backed you. If anything concerns you,speak up now. Public opinion can be brutal."


Lillian thought about the Stewart family's position and understood that unless their view changed, Norwood would refuse to accept Eleanor.


Even if Eleanor married Nolan, a truly peaceful life wasn't guaranteed.


Still, Eleanor remained composed.


Nolan's support stirred something within her,causing a brief hesitation, but it passed quickly. "Think of it as a test for Nolan," she responded.



Eleanor knew that if Nolan couldn't weather this challenge, he wouldn't endure the unpredictable storms that lay ahead.



She wanted a partner who could walk beside her as an equal, not someone who needed endless shielding.


Sensing Eleanor's silence, Lainey grew bolder.


She anonymously sent out several more tweets, one directly targeting the Hope House.


The headline screamed, "Financial Chaos at the Hope House-Large Donations Allegedly Diverted to Enigma's Personal Account."


At the bottom of the post, she had even attached what looked like bank statements, carefully forged.


Under normal circumstances, netizens might have questioned whether the images were real.


But at this critical moment, nobody paid it any attention.


Everyone focused only on one thing: Enigma's reputation appeared completely destroyed.

 
The backlash online was unrelenting. Even Myah couldn't escape the storm.


Surrounded by a swarm of reporters, she repeated herself over and over. "No, Eleanor didn't take any money. Those funds were meant to help the children




Her words, however, were quickly lost in the chaos.


Hardly anyone believed her explanation.


Some even accused Myah of being complicit, claiming she deserved to be jailed.


When Eleanor heard the news, her usually steady eyes flickered with emotion.



Myah was the person who had granted her a second chance at life, a rare soul whose safety she would defend without hesitation.



Enigma's reputation could be sacrificed, but Myah could not be touched.


With that resolve, she pulled out her phone, preparing to address the press herself.


Just as she was about to act, a call came through. "Is this Miss Eleanor Warren? I'm Leon Ortiz, curator of the Elepdon Museum."


At that, Eleanor raised an eyebrow, momentarily taken aback. "Is there anything I can help you with?"



On the other line, Leon exhaled, his voice tinged with regret. "Miss Warren, we've seen the false reports spreading online. We deeply regret that our oversight has caused you so much trouble."



They refused to stand idly by while someone patriotic was dragged through the mud.


Eleanor's fingers tightened slightly around the phone."And?"



"The Queen's diamond tiara was a donation you made to our museum without expecting any compensation.All taxes were waived under our agreement, so there's no question of evasion!" Leon stated firmly. "We want to set the record straight. We cannot allow an honorable person to be defamed. Will you let us handle this?"



Eleanor paused, a faint smile tugging at her lips before she said, "Alright. I'lllet you."



Her decision was made for the sake of the Hope House and, above all, for Myah.
###Chapter 94 I'll Trust You



Eleanor couldn't guess what strategy Elepdon Museum would use to restore her reputation.


What mattered most was that once their official statement went public, Myah would no longer be in danger.



Before that could happen, Eleanor knew she had to visit the Hope House and reassure Myah, sparing her from unnecessary anxiety.



Determined,Eleanor set out right away.



When she stepped up to the entrance of the Hope House, she was taken aback to see a fence now enclosing the once-vacant lot across the road.



Inside the fenced area, construction workers were already hard at work, piecing together the frame of a new building.



What really took her by surprise was spotting Vickie and Emma overseeing the whole project.



Eleanor was about to quietly slip past, but Emma intercepted her.



The sharp click of Emma's heels echoed as she strode  up to Eleanor.



"Well, if it isn't the famous Enigma!" Emma taunted."After all the mess you've made for the Hope House,you still have the guts to show your face?"


Waving her hand toward the construction site, Emma looked smug. "Take a good look. The Todd Group is putting up a brand-new orphanage. Our family actually cares about these kids, unlike you. Once it's done, they'll have a real home and everything they need."



The Todd family was using charity as leverage, turning it into a weapon for personal gain.


Eleanor was taken aback by just how brazen the Todd family could be.


Greed and self-interest seemed to be woven into everything the Todds did; genuine charity had never been part of their story.


Still, Eleanor saw no point in getting dragged into a pointless argument with Emma.



She turned to walk away, but Emma caught her,by the arm.



"Stay right there!" Emma yelled, her voice ringing out."Everyone, look! It's Enigma herself! She evaded taxes and embezzled money from the Hope House!" Emma's outburst was enough to make all the workers stop and stare.


Eleanor paused, her gaze full of biting sarcasm as she faced them. "Maybe try fixing your own family's scandals before pointing fingers. The Todd family have been pocketing funds from charity projects for a long time, and both you and your mother are fully aware of it,Emma."


Her words cut with unmistakable force.


That was when Vickie hurried over, pulling Emma away before things could escalate.


Vickie chimed in, her tone sharp. "Emma, that's enough.Why bother getting into it with her right now?The Internet's already torn her apart-she's already being dragged through the mud. There's no point in arguing any further."



She then added, "Jonny believes that with Lainey backing us, our family is on the verge of making a name for itself. We should be polishing our reputation,not stirring up conflict. Do what your brother suggested and put your energy into building the orphanage instead."


Although Emma was itching to argue, she finally bit back her words. She shot Eleanor one last, venomous glare, then stalked off with her head held high.


Eleanor had no idea what plans the Todds wvere plotting, but she was certain their intentions weren't good.


Still, whatever it was didn't concern her.


She gathered herself and walked into the Hope House.


Once inside, she delivered her prepared message to Myah.



Hearing Eleanor's reassurance, Myah finally let out a long sigh.


She squeezed Eleanor's hand, her voice trembling with sadness. "Eleanor, I'm not worried about myself.What hurts is seeing everything you've done for these children twisted by strangers. It's not fair to you."


Eleanor offered a gentle comfort. "Don't worry,Myah.The museum will clear things up soon. I promise you,everything will work out."


But until the truth was out, Myah knew peace would be hard to find.



She didn't want to make things harder for Eleanor,knowing how much she had already endured. Determined to put on a brave front, Myah straightened her shoulders and replied, "Alright, I'll trust you."
###Chapter 95 They're Already Guessing You're Butterfly  
Eleanor had been tidying up inside Hope House when Nolan showed up.



He,however,chose to wait outside rather than go in.


His attention soon shifted to Erick, eyes sharp and unreadable. "If the media storm about Eleanor's taxes can't be stopped, then make sure you handle whatever rumors are circling Hope House."



Nolan understood just how much Myah meant to Eleanor, and he figured Eleanor must be on edge by now.



But Erick, nearly bouncing with enthusiasm,gave his report. "There's no need for that, Mr. Stewart."


He passed over the tablet, barely containing his excitement. "Everything's been flipped on its head!"


At that, Nolan, looking puzzled, took the tablet from him,his brow furrowed in curiosity.


What he saw next surprised him: right at the top of the trending list, the official Twitter account of the Elepdon Museum caught his eye. The museum's recent post, tagging Eleanor,announced, "Miss Eleanor Warren, we appreciate your commitment to preserving national treasures. During the auction, you generously gifted the Queen's diamond tiara to our museum. This artifact carries tremendous historical value and significance. Our museum will be hosting a special exhibition in two weeks, and we are inviting everyone to join us."



Nolan couldn't believe it. She really gave away the tiara?



He remembered how happy she had been that day,never once imagining she had bought it just to give it away.



What was she really hiding? His curiosity only grew.



As Nolan kept scrolling, the replies caught his attention even more.



A highlighted, pinned reply from the Elepdon Museum stood out at the very top of the comment section."Miss Warren has been supporting the preservation of artifacts for years, so her tax status has been clear for a long time."



One reply stood out. "Wait, are you saying she's actually been donating for years?"



Another chimed in, "Did things just do a complete  turnaround?"



Someone else explained, "The important thing is,she donated the piece the very same day she bought it.That means she always intended it for the museum.Why is anyone blaming her?"


"I honestly had no idea. I take back what I said.My apologies," another commenter admitted.


Yet another added, "If her goal was always to donate it, why should she owe any taxes in the first place?"


A different user chimed in, "I work with Photoshop,and let me tell you those bank statement screenshots people were sharing were definitely edited."


"Enigma, we're sorry. We really messed up." Another remorseful comment read.


The majority of the responses were supportive, but tucked away among them was one vague reply."Doesn't this strategy look familiar? If I'm not mistaken, the last person to pull something like this was Butterfly!"


In the world of collectors, Butterfly was practically legendary, famous for her commitment to safeguarding the nation's treasures.


Anyone with insider knowledge would have pieced together Eleanor's true identity after seeing this. The majority of online commenters, though, weren't experts. They were just regular people, blissfully unaware.



But Nolan picked up on it immediately.


Could it be? Was Eleanor actually Butterfly all along?


That possibility left him feeling undeserving of her.


Eleanor always seemed gentle and sweet to him, and she had never stopped to surprise him.


Meanwhile, he was simply another rich guy, nothing truly remarkable in comparison.


That thought pushed Nolan into action.



He knew he needed to make his move before anyone else uncovered the truth and tried to win her over.


That realization sent him rushing out of the car and straight into Hope House.



The instant he found Eleanor, Nolan pulled her aside to a corner, wrapping her in his embrace.


His breath brushed against her cheek as he spoke softly. "You accepted my ring that day, remember? So,what do you say? Will you marry me?"


Eleanor hadn't been expecting a proposal, so his  question left her speechless.


Nolan's tone shifted, sounding almost wounded as he admitted, "Even just being you, you've already got a crowd of admirers. If everyone knew about your another identity, how am I supposed to compete?"


Was he really just trying to stake his claim before anyone else could?



That realization made Eleanor chuckle. "Why would you even think that?"



Leaning in, Nolan rested his chin on her shoulder, his voice tinged with annoyance. "I saw what people were saying online. They're already guessing you're Butterfly."



So,her secret was starting to unravel after all?



That thought wiped the playful spark from Eleanor's eyes.



She eased out of his arms and pulled out her phone.



Her fingers moved quickly as she scrolled through the hot topics and comment threads, a quiet sigh of relief escaping her lips.


Thank goodness, only a handful of people seemed to have caught on to the truth so far.
###Chapter 96 He Really Does Care About You
 Eleanor felt a surge of satisfaction and leaned in to press a soft kiss against Nolan's lips "Feeling better now?" she asked.



Nolan froze for a heartbeat, pleasantly surprised, and instinctively leaned in to deepen it, but Eleanor gently pushed him back.



"That's enough," she said softly



If it weren't for Nolan's recent considerate behavior,she wouldn't have made the first move



He got the hint and stepped back with a sly smile,quickly returning to his usual calm and confident self


With his hands in his pockets, he looked at her with curiosity. "So, are there still things about you l don't know?"



Eleanor shot him a sharp glare and returned to her cleaning.


After a beat, she muttered, "No comment."


 
When Nolan left the orphanage, he couldn't suppress that bright smile.


Erick blinked, stunned.



It had been years since Nolan had smiled like that.



But before Erick could tease him, Nolan's piercing gaze pinned him to the spot.



"Mr.Stewart..." Erick straightened instantly.


"Drive," Nolan ordered, his eyes still sharp.



"Yes, sir," Erick replied, obedient as ever.



But the good mood didn't last.



His phone buzzed, and he saw that his grandfather was calling.



"I know what's going on." Norwood's voice was firm."But you and her? Forget it Don't even think<about it."



It was clear that Norwood would never accept Eleanor as his granddaughter-in-law.



To him, a woman who had captured Nolan's heart simply didn't fit the family's expectations



He wanted someone from a similar background and social standing,someone who could match Nolan in every way. Nolan knew exactly what his grandfather meant, but he refused to back down. "Grandpa, I understand your concerns. I'll prove it to you-"



"No. I don't agree." Norwood cut him off, hanging up before Nolan could finish.



On the other side, Nolan stared at the dimming screen,a determined glint in his cold eyes.



Then, pulling out his phone, he typed a message to Eleanor. "Together forever, no matter what."



At that exact moment, Eleanor took a sip of soup and nearly choked on it. "Seriously?" she muttered under her breath.



First a proposal, and now this mysterious message.


Was he upset, serious, or just being dramatic? She had no idea.



However, before she could ponder further, Myah's concerned voice came from beside her. "What's wrong? You seem distracted."


Myah's curious eyes fell on Eleanor's face, and seeing the faint blush, she immediately understood. "Alright,finish your meal, then go enjoy your romance. That young man... he really does care about you." Eleanor felt jealous.



"It's barely been a short while, and you're already on his side?" she muttered softly, jealousy creeping into her tone.



Myah rolled her eyes playfully. "Enough whining. Eat,then get back to your work. Don't worry about the Hope House. I've got it covered."


Eleanor let out a sullen "oh" and quickly finished her meal.



After cleaning up, she stared at Nolan's earlier message,lost in thought.



Together forever?



She shook her head slightly, bemused.



They had only just started seeing each other, and he was already dropping lines like that.


Could Lillian have been right? Maybe the Stewarts really did dive headfirst into love without a second thought.



The more Eleanor considered it, the more it seemed believable.



Despite being a shrewd business tycoon, Nolan might just be a hopeless romantic. Well, maybe she should treat hima little better from now on.



Everyone deserved a bit of indulgence for being a hopeless romantic.


Meanwhile, Nolan had no inkling that his impulsive,heartfelt message might make him look foolish.Had he known, he would have deleted it immediately.



At the same time, at the Todd famnily's residence,Lainey was far from laughing. She gripped her phone so tightly her knuckles went white, finally hurling it to the floor in frustration.


Those relentless netizens! Somehow, they had tracked her down again, and their insults were growing harsher by the hour. How could they find her, even after she changed her IP and stayed anonymous?


But soon, she reminded herself, soon she would officially be a Benton. Those lowly online critics didn't matter. Nothing could touch her once she had that kind of power.


Still, the real thorn in her side wasn't the Internet.It was Eleanor.



Every time she thought she had her rival cornered,Eleanor slipped through her fingers unscathed. The thought made Lainey's chest tighten with fury.


She refused to accept it. She wouldn't accept it.



Jonny, having seen the online commotion, looked equally stunned. Eleanor's latest charitable donation had made waves, and somehow, Lainey had been behind those rumors all along.



Yet despite the shock, Jonny's attention shifted.He couldn't afford to lose Lainey after already losing Eleanor.



Since Lainey was a Benton by blood, he had to keep her happy.



With that in mind, he quickly pulled her into his arms,trying to soothe her. "Hey, don't be upset. Tomorrow,we're heading to the beach. Just you and me,okay?Relax and forget about all this nonsense."



Lainey, with no other outlet for her anger, nodded obediently, though her mind was still simmering.
###Chapter 97 Eleanor, Don't Get Too Comfortable
Lillian had been scrolling through comments when one in particular caught her attention. Someone boldly suggested that Enigma might actually be Butterfly.


Of course she saw it. As Eleanor's number-one fan,she never missed a single post, reply, or rumor tied to her best friend.



Still, the thought left her fuming.


Eleanor,hiding something this big from her?


Snatching her purse off the sofa, she marched out the door and waited until Eleanor arrived back at her apartment.



The second Eleanor appeared,Lillian crossed her arms,with her best "serious interrogator" look, and demanded, "Alright, tell me the truth, are you Butterfly?"


Eleanor froze, then let out a small sigh."Whether I am or not, I'm still your best friend."



That was all Lillian needed. Knowing Eleanor as well as she did, the lack of denial was practically an admission.


Her jaw dropped.



Eleanor was actually Butterfly-the legendary collector everyone talked about!


The shock lasted about two seconds before her inner drama queen burst forth. She grabbed Eleanor's arm,fake-crying like she was in a soap opera. "How could you keep something this huge from me? Do you even love me as a friend?"



She squeezed out a few tears for effect, then immediately demanded, "You have to make it up to me! I want a seaside vacation in Asnoyle, and you're coming with me. No excuses!"


Faced with Lillian's theatrics, Eleanor could only give in with a helpless nod.


Asnoyle, on Elepdon's eastern coast, was a hotspot for tourists.


But Lillian's dreamy plan for a quiet, two-person getaway was shattered the moment they arrived.


Wherever Eleanor went, whispers and squeals followed. "Wait, isn't that Enigma?"


"She's even prettier in real life!"



"Quick, let's ask for her autograph!"


Within mninutes, they were swarmed. Lillian instantly regretted everything.



This wasn't a beach trip. This was a full-blown fan event.



And the universe wasn't done messing with them.


Of all people, they bumped straight into Jonny and Lainey.



Lainey's face soured the second she saw Eleanor soaking up the spotlight.


With a smug little sway in her steps, she sauntered over and lowered her voice so only Eleanor and Lillian could hear. "Eleanor, don't get too comfortable. Once my parents return, my status will soar. And when that happens, I'll have countless ways to deal with you."


Eleanor didn't even bother glancing at her.


Ignoring Lainey was, in her opinion, the sharpest response.



Lillian, on the other hand, wasn't built for patience. Planting her hands firmly on her hips, she glared at Lainey and snapped, "Are you blind? Move it. You're in our way!"



But Lainey,now carrying herself like she was a Benton,clearly didn't think much of the Brooks family.



Folding her arms with a smug tilt of her chin, she smirked. "Enjoy your pride while it lasts. When the time comes, we'll see how tough you really act in front of me."



She threw one last disdainful look at Lillian before strutting off, with Jonny following close behind like a loyal little sidekick.


Lillian's temper flared. She stomped her foot and shouted after her, "Who does she think she is? So what if she really is a Benton? Big deal! We've got Nolan!"



Eleanor couldn't help but laugh at her friend's fiery outburst. She reached over and soothed, "Don't let her get under your skin. She's not worth it."



Then,looking slightly sheepish,Eleanor added,"By the way,if you still want to hang out, we'd better make the most of today."



Lillian narrowed her eyes, suspicious. "What's that supposed to mean?" Avoiding her gaze, Eleanor touched her nose and admitted, "Dyer messaged me. They just found a cluster of ancient tombs in Otrad, and he wants me there the day after tomorrow."


Her tone softened with guilt. "So, for a while, I probably won't have much time for you."



Lillian's anger instantly froze on her face, but it quickly crumbled.



Her eyes welled up, and she burst into loud sobs."Why is my life so pitiful?" she cried miserably.


On one hand, she felt secretly proud that her best friend was such an important figure. But on the other hand, whenever Eleanor's work called, she was gone without a trace.



How unlucky was she to have a best friend like that?Lillian's chest ached with grievances, and she couldn't help but feel wronged.
###Chapter 98 My Most Prized Protégé
For the next two days, Eleanor and Lillian lived without restraint, chasing every thrill they could find.


They raced across the waves on jet skis, watched fireworks paint the night sky over the ocean, and ended their nights with smoky barbecues by the shore.It was the kind of carefree fun they had always dreamed about.



But their joyride was cut short. On their way back from the beach, their car hadn't even pulled up to Eleanor's apartment when a seek black Volkswagen suddenly swerved in front of them, blocking the road.



The door flew open, and out hopped a sprightly old man.Without hesitation, he yanked Eleanor's car door wide.



"Quick, Eleanor, come with me!" he blurted,practically dragging her out. "I've got an interview,and I can't go alone. I'm too nervous!"


Lillian sat frozen in the passenger seat, too shocked to even react as Eleanor was swept away.


Half an hour later, Eleanor found herself in a television station dressing room. Dyer planted her firmly into a chair and wagged his finger like a stern grandfather.



"Stay here. Don't even think about running. You know how easily I get rattled in front of cameras. Without you nearby, I'll lose my nerve," Dyer insisted with exaggerated seriousness.



Eleanor bit back a laugh.


This was the same man who once marched alone into a freshly unearthed tomb to examine relics no one dared touch, yet now he claimed to be scared of a few cameras.



Even a child wouldn't buy such a flimsy excuse.



But Eleanor had no choice.



Dyer was her mentor, and she knew when to yield.



With a sigh, she gave him a reluctant nod.


That was all it took. Dyer, pleased, straightened his jacket and headed out cheerfully towards the stage.


Soon, the live broadcast kicked off.



After greeting the viewers, the host leaned in with a bright smile. "Mr. Curtis, the discovery of the Blackwind Catacombs is groundbreaking. We hear you'll personally be guiding the excavation?" Dyer stroked his graying beard, a mischievous sparkle in his eyes. "Of course. How could I miss such a momentous event?"



The host's curiosity sharpened as he pressed on. "And this time, which of your brilliant students will be accompanying you?"


At that, Dyer's smile grew even broader, pride filling his voice. "Isn't it obvious? My most prized protégé."


He turned slightly and gestured to the side.


The camera followed, and the nation's audience was caught off guard by the sudden reveal of a calm,striking figure stepping into frame.


Enigma.Or rather,Eleanor.


The Internet detonated on the spot.


Elepdon Museum's old comment section was dredged up within minutes, while the live-stream comments,after a stunned pause, exploded like fireworks.


"Am I seeing this right? That's Eleanor?"


"Enigma? No way. It's really her! My idol is actually on screen,live!"


"Hold up, why does her name sound familiar... oh my god, she's the same woman who casually donated the Queen's diamond tiara!"



"So you're telling me the legendary designer Enigma is the same Eleanor who threw a hundred million in artifacts at the museum like it was pocket change?"


"Too much information at once, my brain's crashing!"


"Forget that. Did you hear what Dyer just said? His most prized protégé!"


And then came the clincher.


The resurfaced Elepdon Museum comment, linedup perfectly with Dyer's words, sealed the theory in everyone's mind.


A brilliant archaeology disciple. A magnanimous artifact donor. Who else could Butterfly be, if not Eleanor?


Eleanor's expression was priceless.


She turned a glare on Dyer the second he returned.


"Didn't you say I wouldn't have to show my face?"Shoving her phone at him, she added, "Look at this madness. How am I supposed to quietly donate to Elepdon Museum now?"



The trending headlines blazed across her screen.

"Shocking! Enigma Revealed as Butterfly of the Collecting World!"



"Dyer Curtis Publicly Declares Eleanor Warren His Most Treasured Protégé!"



Dyer glanced at the words, then burst into a squinty-eyedgrin. "What's there to worry about? Let the world chatter. As long as you don't confirm it, everything stays in your hands."



To him, it was nothing but noise.


After all, he had had to watch David flaunt his star student day after day.


Eleanor might have studied under David first, before meeting Dyer, but because she had never formally bowed as Dyer's apprentice, he had carried the sting of being outdone for years.


And today,he finally got his payback.


Eleanor stared at his smug expression and instantly understood that this wasn't about her at all.


It was just another round in the endless duel between Dyer and David.



Two old men, with nearly two centuries of life between them, were still bickering like children.Honestly,it was exhausting.
###Chapter 99 You've Got A Deal!
Plenty of people celebrated the news, but there were just as many who met it with disbelief and outrage.


Lainey,upon catching sight of the headline, froze in shock.



It read,"Enigma is Butterfly."


She could read every character in that headline,yet somehow, the meaning just wouldn't click for her.



What other secrets was Eleanor hiding? And why did she get to live such a dazzling life?



Jealousy twisted inside Lainey, and she resolved to put an end to Eleanor's time in the spotlight.


Clenching her jaw, she dug out a phone with an old,unused number and made a call.


Soon after, a man answered, his tone teasing. "Baby,I thought you'd already settled down. What's made you call me out of the blue?"


Swallowing her disgust,Lainey put on a syrupy sweet voice. "Horace, I need you to take care of someone  for me. Whatever it costs, I'll pay."


Horace Boyd came with a reputation, and he sounded interested. "Really now? Who's foolish enough to get on your bad side?"


Hatred burned in Lainey's eyes as she bit down on her lip. "I'll message you the specifics soon. Just say if you're up for the job."


Horace let out a deep, amused laugh. "There's nothing I can't handle. As long as you can get me in with the Benton family, I'll take care of anyone you point me toward."



Horace operated in the criminal underworld, while the Benton family had always built their reputation on strictly lawful business.


Linking those two worlds wouldn't be simple, but it was definitely within reach.



As the self-proclaimed star of the Benton family,Lainey believed she was more than capable of making it happen.


Without another thought, she agreed right, away,"You've got a deal!"



Meanwhile,Eleanor was blissfully unaware of Lainey's schemes. All her attention was on calming down David.


"Eleanor! You went to appear on TV with Dyer? Do l even matter to you as a teacher anymore?" David's angry voice blasted through the phone.


With a weary sigh, Eleanor pressed her fingers to her temple and pushed the phone away from her ear.


Her voice softened as she tried to reassure him."David,'I know l made a mistake. It won't happen again,I swear. Please don't get worked up, or I'll start to worry."


She then continued, "Dyer's only acting this way because he's jealous of you. Honestly, he wishes he had a student like me, so he's just trying to stir things up. Don't let him get under your skin."


A little patience and reassurance was all it took for David's anger to melt away.



He muttered a few last complaints before offering some advice to Eleanor. "Otrad's got a harsh, dry climate, and sandstorms aren't uncommon. Look after yourself. Don't think you can just ignore these things because you're still young."


A gentle warmth blossomed in Eleanor's chest, and a small smile broke across her face. "I will, I promise." Once the call ended, she let out a long sigh and sank into the sofa.



At last, everyone was settled for now.



It struck her that she really needed to be more cautious going forward and keep her other lives a secret,or else she would have more trouble than she could handle.



After taking a few moments to recharge, Eleanor begansorting her things for the journey to Otrad.


Out of nowhere, her phone lit up with a text from Nolan. "When are you heading out?"


A faint smile played on Eleanor's lips as she tapped out her response. "I'm catching a flight tomorrow morning."



Nolan didn't make her wait long. "Let me know the moment you land. I'm going to miss you."


Those final words touched her more than she expected, prompting Eleanor to reply, "I will. The connection isn't great over there, but I'll text you the moment I get a better signal."


Thinking that would be the end of their exchange,Eleanor set her phone aside, until it buzzed once more. Nolan had sent another message. "Look outside.I'm downstairs."



That made Eleanor freeze for a second.


She hurried to the window, pulling the curtain aside just enoughto peek outside.


Bathed in the glow of the streetlamp, Nolan's Bentley was parked below. He was there, leaning casually against the car, his eyes fixed on her window.
###Chapter 100 And Don't Forget To Miss Me
Eleanor didn't even stop to think. She just snatched her jacket, flew down the stairs, and nearly collided with Nola.



Breathless,she stammered, "You...why are you-"



But she didn't get to finish. He pulled her straight into his arms and held her so tightly that she was able to feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.


His chin restedlightly on her hair, his breath brushing her face.



When he finally let her go,his voice was soft but sure."Safe travels. And don't forget to miss me."


Eleanor blinked. That was it? He had come all the way here just to say something like that?


She was torn between laughter and exasperation.



Nolan really was hopeless-an unapologetic romantic through and through.


After exchanging a few words, she returned upstairs,collapsed into bed, and slept straight through without  a single dream.


The following morning, she was on her way to the airport with Dyer.


The moment they stepped out of the car, chaos erupted.


"Eleanor,look this way!"


"Eleanor,are you really Butterfly?"



"I'm such a big fan,Eleanor!"


The endless shouting was starting to drill into Eleanor's skull, each cheer making her temples throb.


She turned toward Dyer, who was soaking in the attention.



Her glare could have set fire to him, but the old man only raised his brows in smug amusement.


With a booming laugh, he lifted a hand for silence,and to her disbelief, the chaotic noise melted into silence.



Clearing his throat with exaggerated gravity, he announced in a mock-serious tone, "The only thing you all need to know is that she is my most prized student. As for Butterfly, or whatever name you're tossing around, I've never even heard of such a person." His explanation was so half-hearted it practically dripped with insincerity.


The moment the words left his mouth, the crowd burst into laughter, booing and tossing playful jabs his way,clearly amused by the flimsy denial.


"Come on, Dyer, who'd believe that?"


"Exactly, that's basically admitting it!"


"Confirmed! Enigma is Butterfly!"


As the shouts grew louder and the path ahead clogged with eager fans, Dyer grabbed Eleanor's wrist and made a break for the terminal.


Just before disappearing inside, he turned and barked,"I never admitted anything! Remember, this is all your own wild speculation!"







Once the plane took off smoothly and things calmed down, Dyer leaned back in his seat, looking very pleased with himself. He shot Eleanor a sideways grin,smug as ever. "So? Pretty smooth, right? Didn't I handle that just fine?"


Eleanor gave him a flat look, his playful tone not surprising her in the least.Without a word, she unlocked her phone, pulled up the trending topics, and handed it over to him. "Want to see what people are saying online?"


Still wearing that self-satisfied smile, Dyer took the phone.



But the moment his eyes landed on the glaring headline, his grin stiffened. "Dyer confirms Butterfly is Enigma at the airport."


He skimmed the articles, saw the flood of giddy comments, and though his eyes lit with amusement,he still muttered with annoyance, "Ridiculous! These shameless reporters! They're just lying through their teeth, twisting every word! Just wait till I'm back from Otrad, I'm suing every last one of them!"


Eleanor calmly took her phone back, propped her chin in her hand, and chose silence over fueling his theatrics.
###Chapter  101 I'm Flying To Otrad!





Due to the relentless workload in Otrad, Eleanor and Dyer barely had a spare moment to relax, let alone argue.



The days blurred together, each one so packed that their phones sat untouched for ages.



Meanwhile, Nolan kept glancing at his screen, waiting for a reply that never came, his irritation starting to grow.



"Not even a single message when she's done working," he grumbled, planning to stash his phone away for good.



Before he could, a breaking news alert flashed across the screen.



"Breaking News! Partial Collapse at Blackwind Catacombs,Rescue Operations Underway!" Nolan's eyes widened in alarm.


His hands shook as he tapped into the article.


The story detailed how famed archaeologist Dyer Curtis and his apprentice had been excavating in the Blackwind Catacombs when disaster struck. Both had lost all contact with the outside world, and their condition was now uncertain.


Every word hit Nolan like a punch to the gut.


No way.


That couldn't be.


Eleanor was strong and resourceful, always full of surprises. Nothing should be able to touch her.


Perhaps the news reports were simply making the situation sound worse than it actually was.


Still, that brief moment of optimism faded fast, giving way to a rising sense of panic.


Fear overtook him, and he called out desperately,"Erick! Get the jet ready, right now! I'm flying to Otrad!"



Erick, stunned by Nolan's panic, moved without hesitation. "Right away, Mr. Stewart!"


Two hours later, Nolan's car screeched to a halt at the disaster site.



Whatever hope he had left instantly shattered.


He found himself staring into a wasteland of thick,yellow dust, the swirling sand blotting out any sign of daylight.


The Blackwind Catacombs had vanished completely.There wasn't a single structure left, not even a trace of where the entrance had been.



Right then, devastation hit Nolan like a tidal wave.


Driven by desperation, he lunged at the site manager, grabbing him by the collar, eyes wild with anguish."Tell me where Eleanor is! Where did she go?"


The site manager trembled in fear, barely able to form the words. "The whole site caved in without warning. There was a massive collapse... Miss Warren and Mr. Curtis... they... they got trapped inside. There wasn't enough time to get out..."



Terror kept him from saying anything more, worried this man might snap completely.


Nolan did just that, breaking free from reason.He sprinted straight for the rubble, heart pounding wvith fear.



Eleanor was trapped somewhere in that chaos.He couldn't let her face it alone!



Thankfully, Erick reacted fast and pulled him back."Please, Mr. Stewart, stay put! There's still hope.They've only been trapped for two hours."


Only then did Nolan snap out of it.


Right.


Panic had clouded his judgment.



Just two hours had passed; there had to be air left.

She could still be alive!


That flicker of hope pushed him into action, and he immediately joined the rescue team, desperate to carve out a new passage.


Every pocket of fresh air they could create might be the difference between life and death.


Unfortunately, Otrad's harsh, dry climate made the soil as tough as stone.


Shovel blades snapped one after another.


Nolan's palms were soon covered in raw blisters.


No matter how hard they worked, the tunnel still hadn't broken through.


Frustrated, Nolan hurled his shovel aside and stormed over to the site manager, grabbing him by the collar. "Where's your equipment? Bring in the excavators now! If anything goes wrong, I'll take the blame!"


Antiques and relics were valuable, but not more than someone's life. The site manager knew that.


Still, he hesitated, worry etched on his face. "It's risky. The ground underneath is hollow. If we use heavy machinery, everything could cave in completely, and then there'll be no chance at all!"


That left them with just two choices: keep digging by hand or wait for the professional rescue team to show up with more precise gear.


When he heard this, Nolan's glare grew even sharper,his eyes burning with accusation. "Why wasn't safety guaranteed from the start?"



If he had had any idea how risky this was,he never would have allowed Eleanor to set foot near the site.



The site manager, shrinking under Nolan's fierce stare, finally spoke up. "We did a full safety inspection before anyone went down. Everything was cleared, and there were no signs of danger. No one could have predicted..."

 
Such a massive collapse happened without warning. He didn't get a chance to finish before rushing to add, "Mr. Stewart, the rescue team will be here in thirty minutes. Please believe me, we're doing everything possible to get them out."


It was only at that moment that Nolan released his grip, turning back in silence to join the rescue team.


But no matter how much they struggled, it wasn't enough.


Every effort felt useless.


Their hands alone just couldn't break through.


Relief finally came thirty minutes later, when the expert rescue squad reached the scene.


Smaller, specialized tools were put to work immediately.


But then, something happened that lefteveryone in shock.
###Chapter  102 She's Going To Make It!





Digging through the tunnel proved to be an uphill battle. Each time they broke through, only more yellow sand greeted Nolan and the recue team.


This could mean only one thing: the collapse was far more severe than anyone had guessed.



Refusing to give up, the rescue team consulted the site's blueprints and started excavating a different path.



Yet again, their efforts unearthed nothing but more sand.



Doubts crept in among the rescuers, and they started to fear that the entire underground structure had already caved in.


The site manager, face drained of color, shook his head. "That's impossible. This tomb complex is massive. If everything below had given way, we'd see a crater on the surface. The ground's still holding steady."


Still, no amount of technical talk could change the truth that the danger inside was far greater than anyone expected.


All the conversation around him became a distant blur as Nolan's mind could no longer process what anyone was saying.


Any sense of,pain had vanished. He was completely numb.



The only thought left in his mind was that Eleanor was trapped somewhere in the darkness.


He would search until he found her, no matter what it took.



Time dragged on, hours blurred into days and nights.


Wave after wave of rescue teams came and went.


But each effort ended the same way, no sign of a way in,and no trace of the missing. Nolan barely registered anything around him, clawing at the sand with raw, bloodied hands, desperate to dig his way closer, inch by agonizing inch.


At last, Ryland showed up, leaping from his car and pulling Nolan back from the rubble.


"Nolan! You have to stop! This isn't helping! If you keep going, you'll destroy your hands," Ryland pleaded, desperation in his voice.


But Nolan seemed deaf to his friend's cries.



Determination burned in his reddened eyes, leaving room for nothing else.


He couldn't pause for even a second.



Stopping wasn't an option.


Eleanor was somewhere beneath the wreckage, and only he could reach her.


Fueled by sheer willpower, Nolan broke free from Ryland's grip and charged toward the ruins yet again.


Not far away, Lillian stood quietly, her vision clouded by tears.


She wept for Nolan, for Eleanor, and for the emptiness looming over her own heart.


The thought of losing Eleanor felt unbearable. She couldn't even picture life without her.


Despair spread like a slow poison through the crowd.


One expert team after another showed up,but not a single group managed to devise a workable rescue plan.


The reason soon became clear: this catastrophe hadn't been an accident, and it was orchestrated.


All their expertise and training suddenly seemed pointless in the face of sabotage.


With science offering no solutions, people began to seek comfort in prayers.


Across the Internet, #PrayForButterfly rocketed to the top of the trending list.


Fans everywhere swapped out their profile photos for images of hope and filled their timelines with glowing virtual candles, pouring heartfelt words into prayers and wishing with all their might for a miracle.


Yet, no miracle appeared.


The critical first 24 hours slipped away with nothing but uncertainty.


Nature offered no mercy, and a gentle rain started to fall, making everything even more grim.


Every passing minute chipped away at any remaining hope.


Cries of anguish hung in the air, echoing from both the officials who had come to help and the devoted fans who could do nothing but pray.


Lillian had long since run out of tears, slumped against Ryland, drained and hollow.


Nolan, meanwhile, stayed rooted before the wreckage.


Rain ran down his face, soaking him through, his clothes smeared with mud and streaked with blood.



He stood motionless.



There had never even been a real chance for Nolan to tell Eleanor how he truly felt. He hadn't wanted her because of what happened three years ago, or because of some passing fascination-but because his whole world needed her and her alone.



Now, that confession would remain locked in his heart forever.



Just then, a young fan who had traveled from miles away stepped forward, her hands trembling as she clung to a bouquet of flowers, fighting to hold back her tears.



For the first time in hours, a flicker of life returned to Nolan's empty gaze.


He sprang toward her, yanked the flowers from her grip, and slammed them to the ground.


"Enough! Get out of here! All of you! Eleanor will be fine! She's going to make it! Don't you dare jinx her with your pity!" he yelled, voice ragged with desperation.


The crowd around him recoiled at his outburst, a stunned hush settling over them. No one dared move any closer.


Everyone felt the tragedy of it.


A brilliant businessman and a legendary archaeologist, a match that seemed destined for greatness, were cruelly torn apart by life and death.


Suddenly, through the oppressive silence, a piercing scream erupted from somewhere on the edge of the gathering.
###Chapter  103 | Didn't See Anything!




"Wait, over there! Isn't that MMiss Warren and Mr.Curtis?"



Everyone immediately turned around, eyes searching in the direction of the cry.


From the tunnel the rescue team had excavated earlier, they spotted a spray of dirt; something was moving from within.


Moments later, a slender silhouette emerged,supporting an older man with steady determination.


It was Eleanor, alive and unbroken.


As soon as Nolan recognized her, he sprinted forward without a second thought.



He barely registered anything else, crushing her in a desperate hug, holding on as if he would never let her slip away again. The sudden embrace caught Eleanor off guard nearly knocking her off balance.


She gently steadied herself and eased Nolan's arms away, quickly guiding Dyer onto a waiting stretcher."Don't worry about me. I'm alright. But Dyer needs help.He's hurt."



The medical team immediately carried Dyer away to the emergencytent for treatment.


Only. after the doctors assured her that Dyer would recover did Eleanor finally allow herself to breathe.


When she glanced up, her gaze met Nolan's tear-reddened eyes, all his worry still etched across his face.



She opened her mouth to say something, but before a word could escape, Nolan swept her up into his arms.



A startled breath escaped her lips, and she instinctively clung to his neck.


Nolan said nothing as he carried her away to a  nearby tent.



A doctor rushed in right behind them.


Under Nolan's fierce, unblinking stare, the doctor quickly checked Eleanor over and announced that she had only a few minor scrapes, nothing to worry about.



That was the moment Nolan's tightly wound nerves finally began to unwind.


"Thank goodness," he murmured, wrapping her in another fierce hug, the words tumbling out in relief.


Eleanor glanced down at Nolan, feeling a gentle warmth unfurl in her chest. "I've spent a lot of time in the field with Dyer. I know what to do when things go wrong. As soon as the collapse started, I got Dyer to a chamber with fresh air."


The doctor quietly slipped out, leaving them alone.


Nolan still didn't speak.


Instead, he clung to her even tighter, his whole body trembling with pent-up emotion.


Eleanor noticed a damp patch spreading across her shoulder.


Could those really be tears? Was Nolan actually crying?


A soft ache welled up in Eleanor's chest, a bittersweet blend of affection and sorrow.


She parted her lips, ready to speak.


"YOU-"was all she got out before Nolan pressed his mouth to hers, cutting her off with a kiss.


His kiss was a tidal wave of everything he felt.


It burned with longing, overflowed with relief.


Every second made her feel treasured,wanted,held close.



For a fleeting instant, Eleanor froze.


But the last of her hesitation slipped away.


Her eyes fluttered shut, surrendering to the moment, letting his love envelop her completely.


It was fierce, consuming, maybe even too much,but somehow, she didn't want him to stop.



When the kiss finally broke, Nolan pressed his forehead to hers, his voice ragged and low. "I've already told Erick to start digging into this. The archaeological site was supposed to be airtight for safety; there's no way it would collapse like that unless someone interfered."



A steely determination flashed in Eleanor's eyes.


She had reached the same conclusion herself.


Right then, Erick burst into the tent, visibly rattled."Boss! I just found-"


He abruptly cut himself off, caught in the crossfire of Nolan's lethal glare.



That was when he noticed the obvious evidence of their heated moment. Both of their lips were noticeably still swollen. The awkward truth hit him instantly. He had just barged in on something private. Erick stood rooted to the spot, stammering, "Um, sorry! I didn't see anything! Please, just pretend I was never here."


A vivid flush spread across Eleanor's cheeks.



She shot a sharp look at Nolan, silently urging him to let her go.


Only then did Nolan finally loosen his hold, giving Erick a cool, expectant glance.


His gaze all but said, "This had better be worth the interruption."


Erick hesitated, torn between fleeing and doing his job.


Finally, Eleanor cleared her throat, snapping the tension.



That gave Erick the green light to continue, though he still looked like he might bolt. "Boss, Miss Warren,we actually uncovered some clues."
###Chapter  104 You Scared Me Half To Death!
Erick only wanted to spit out his report and get outof there. "It was one of the workers hired for the ancient tomb project. He messed with the materials and swapped the support beams for cheap ones, and that's what caused the collapse. I checked his bank accounts, and there's a huge deposit in there. It came from the Fist Guild, the gang that runs Zerovia."



The Fist Guild?



Eleanor frowned.



Those thugs were Zerovia's local bullies, but she had never crossed paths with them.



Why would they be after her?



Nolan's thoughts lined up with hers. There was no reason for the Fist Guild to target her unless someone else was pulling the strings.



His eyes narrowed, a sharp coldness flashing across his face.



"Keep digging. I want the truth," Nolan ordered.


"Yes, sir!" Erick bobbed his head and practically bolted out of the tent, tripping over his own feet in his hurry.


He knew he had barged in at the wrong time, and the only way to make up for it was to find the person behind this mess.



Once he was gone, the air between Eleanor and Nolan grew heavier, almost charged.


Nolan's stare was burning with something she couldn't face.



As she felt that intensity, Eleanor's chest tightened.She broke eye contact quickly.


"I... I should go check on Dyer," she muttered, then slipped out of the tent.



Nolan didn't stop her.



He simply watched her leave, lifting his hand to brush his lips with his fingertip, as though her taste was still there.



It had been his first real kiss, and it left him wanting more.



A slow, satisfied smile tugged at his lips until it hardened in the next instant.


Whoever had dared to target his girl, he would hunt them down and make them regret it.


As Eleanor stepped out of the tent, she almost bumped into Lillian,who looked worried.


Lillian immediately reached for her, scanning her from head to toe. "Eleanor, are you alright? You're not hurt, are you? You scared me half to death!"


Eleanor forced a steady smile, trying not to give anything away. "I'm fine. Really, don't worry." Lillian let out a breath of relief, but then her gaze froze on Eleanor's lips. Her eyes widened in shock."Eleanor! What happened to your mouth? It's all red and swollen. Did some insect bite you in there? Oh no, what if it was one of those tomb bugs? Those can be dangerous! You need ointment, quickly!"


"I..." Eleanor parted her lips, but no excuse came to mind.



She couldn't exactly admit Nolan had kissed her,could she?



Ryland, picking up on the situation faster than Lillian,gave a dry cough and stepped in.



"That's enough fussing. Didn't the doctor already check her? If something was wrong, it would've been handled. Let her rest. Come on, we've got other things to take care of."


Still reluctant, Lillian allowed herself to be tugged away by her brother.


Even so, she glanced back and shouted, "Don't brush it off, Eleanor! I'll have someone send you proper ointment!"


Back inside, Nolan's face darkened as he overheard every word.


Later, when Eleanor entered Dyer's tent, a doctor had just finished examining him.


"He's not in immediate danger," the doctor explained, "but the situation isn't ideal. His recovery will take time. It's lucky he was brought out when he was... any later, and he might not have made it."


Eleanor's expression hardened, and her clear eyes turned sharp and cold.


Dyer was like family to her.


If people wanted to mess with her, she didn't care.But dragging him into it was something she couldn't accept.
###Chapter  105 Nothing Matters More To Me Than You
Eleanor left the tent only after finishing the work of easing Dyer's pressure points.


Pulling out her phone, she typed in Lainey's full name, and sent it to a number she hadn't used in ages.



Erick's reports had suggested Zerovia, yet she couldn't shake the feeling that Lainey was the one at the heart of it.



If her suspicion proved true, Lainey would have to pay the price.



That hunch showed its sharpness soon enough.



A reply arrived almost instantly. "Boss,while studying in Zerovia, Lainey was Horace Boyd's mistress. He's the leader of the Fist Guild." Eleanor sat in silence for a beat, then began typing with sharp intent. "Send me every single detail."


When the files arrived, she copied them all without hesitation. After that, she yanked Jonny off her blacklist and passed the information along.



It was only the opening move.


Sooner or later, she would strike at the very heart of what Lainey held dear.


Because of Dyer's influence and the weight of the ancient tombs, the authorities launched a serious inquiry.


By the following morning, the investigation had been completed.


The findings matched almost perfectly with the intelligence Eleanor's subordinate had provided.



Everyone involved was immediately taken into custody.


Even so, Lainey remained untouched, since nothing concrete tied her to the case.



Nolan caught Eleanor's hand, his gaze steady and tender. "Don't worry. I won't let anyone who wronged you slip away."


He shifted his eyes toward Erick and spoke with authority. "Spread the word. My family will cut ties with both the Gilbert and the Todd families, as well as the Benton family."


Eleanor cut in, "You don't need to go that far. Cut ties with the Gilberts and the Todds if you must, but keep the Bentons close. The Benton name still holds weight abroad. If an opportunity comes up, backing them could put your firm in a much stronger position."



Her words had barely settled when Nolan tightened his hold. His eyes blazed with fierce devotion."Nothing matters more to me than you."


Before Eleanor could react, Lillian charged in with her usual energy. "Eleanor! I'm coming home!"  Eleanor pulled her hand back quíckly, worried her friend might notice.



Instead of backing off, Lillian let out a playful chuckle. "Come on, you're a couple. Nobody's shocked if you get a little close."



When Eleanor's face darkened, Lillian quickly changed the subject. "Anyway, my mom's not letting me stay here any longer. She thinks I'll just get in your way. According to her, you're out here serving the country, so I should head home. You wouldn't believe it-she's basically your biggest fan now."



Joanne Brooks, her mother, had once served in the military and carried an unshakable sense of loyalty to her country.


People like Eleanor, who gave everything for the nation, had always earned her admiration.


If she hadn't worried about intruding, Joanne probably would have shown up in person just to beg for an autograph. The thought of her softened Eleanor's expression,and she finally smiled. "Alright then. You and Ryland take care on the way back."


Nolan added in a firm tone, "And when you're home,tell your grandfather I send my regards."


The Brooks family's military ties had been key to speeding up the case.


Normally, international matters dragged on in endless layers of bureaucracy.


For that, Nolan knew he owed them more than just gratitude.


Lillian gave a cheerful nod, then shot them both a sly look. "I'll stop bothering you now. Enjoy your alone time!"


Before either of them could answer, she bounded off,leaving Eleanor and Nolan alone.
###Chapter  106 You're Sending Me Away
Eleanor inched away from Nolan, but no matter how much space she tried to put between them, his eyes stayed fixed on her.


Every so often, the staff would come in, catch sight of the two of them together, and immediately slip back out with,a knowing grin.



Each time it happened, Eleanor wanted to bury herself in the floor.


The longer it went on, the harder it became to stay calm and focused.



Finally, she couldn't take it anymore and turned to him with a look of frustration. "With you sitting here,everyone's giving me that look. Why don't you head back first? Security's tight, so I'll be fine."



The smile on Nolan's face faltered. His lashes lowered slightly, giving him that wounded look that made her feel like she had just kicked a puppy. "You're sending me away?" he asked quietly.


Eleanor let out a long breath, trying to soften her tone. "I'm not chasing you off. It's just that you being here makes it hard for me to think straight."


Hard for her to think? Ah, he knew that feeling all too well. Whenever she was near, he felt the same way.


As he thought of this, Nolan's lips curved into a quiet smile.


"Alright," he agreed without protest, almost too easily.


Eleanor eyed him suspiciously, sensing something off, but chose to let it slide.


Instead, her gaze dropped to his hands, and with a hint of worry, she said softly, "Once you're back change the bandage. If your hands get worse because of me, I'll feel terrible."


Her caring words washed away any lingering sulkiness he felt. His mood lifted instantly, and he teased with a soft grin, "As you wish,baby."


The way he addressed her made Eleanor's cheeks burn red.



He was getting far too good at this-too smooth,too practiced.


The next day, after Eleanor's care, Dyer finally woke from his coma and was soon escorted back to the Elepdon Sanatorium on a private plane.


Nolan, too, had to prepare to leave.


The thought of being away from her made him feel heavy inside, and the sadness showed quietly on his face.



Eleanor noticed, and her heart softened. She reached for his sleeve, giving it a gentle tug. "Hey,don't look so miserable. I'll be back in just a few days."



His eyes dropped to her delicate hand resting against him, and much of the heaviness in his chest lifted. Bending down, he pressed a soft, measured kiss against her forehead. "Alright. I'll wait for you."


With that, he pulled back, turned, and slipped into the car.



The car had barely left the sandy lot when his phone buzzed. As soon as he picked up, Norwood's harsh voice snapped through the line like a whip.


"Reckless! You threw away a valuable alliance with the Benton family for a woman? Is this what I taught you?"


Sure, the Benton family was a lucrative option,but Nolan didn't see them as his only option.



And more importantly, he wasn't about to let anyone weigh the people he cared about on the scales of profit and loss.



He said everything directly.


However, Norwood's fury only flared hotter. "You've completely lost your head over that woman," he retorted. Nolan, on the other side, had no patience for a fight He brushed it off with a few indifferent words and ended the call.


Not long after, the screen lit up again, not with another scolding, but with a message from Fannie.


"Nolan, just focus on winning Eleanor over.I'll handle Grandpa."


Nolan chuckled softly. For the first time that evening,his chest felt lighter. Eleanor saving Fannie earlier really had been worth it.
###Chapter  107 You Disgust Me




Ever since that text, Jonny had been burning with rage.


He couldn't wrap his head around it. Lainey, the woman he once saw as perfect, turned out to be nothing but disgraceful.


For her, he had thrown Eleanor aside. He had even gotten her a job at the Todd Group.



And what had she done? She had been another man's mistress while overseas, yet came back and acted like she was head over heels for him.



The thought nearly choked him.


He stormed down the stairs, grabbed Lainey off the sofa, and spat, "Lainey, you disgust me."


Lainey didn't care about Jonny anymore, but being insulted for no reason was something she wouldn't let slide.


She pulled her hand free, calmly wiped it with a wet tissue, tossed it into the trash, and shot back,"What's wrong with you now?"


Jonny let out a harsh laugh while mocking her."Drop the act. I know all about you and Horace Boyd.I've seen the photos. Lainey, I'm filing for divorce."


Lainey froze for a second, and her stomach twisted in panic.


That was the one part of her past she never wanted anyone to dig up.


He had really gone behind her back to investigate?


But so what if he knew?



Soon she would be recognized as a Benton. Jonny wasn't worthy of her.


With that thought, her arrogance quickly returned.She lifted her chin and sneered. "Fine, let's divorce.We'll settle the papers tomorrow." Jonny stared at her, completely thrown off. He hadn't expected her to agree so quickly.



Then it hit him.



No, they couldn't split.


He still needed her and the Benton family that stood behind her.


At least for now, letting her go was out of the question.


Swallowing his anger, he looked away and forced his tone to ease. "Forget it. I will let that slide."


His weak retreat only made Lainey see right through him.



So, he wanted to back out now? Not happening.


Her voice turned cold as steel. "From tonight, I'll be staying on the third floor until my parents return. But let me make this clear, this marriage will end.Whether you're ready or not, it's only a matter of time." If it weren't for her reluctance to face the Gilbert family, she would have left Jonny long ago. Just being near him made her skín crawl.


She had been waiting for the right moment to say it,and now, he had handed her the chance himself.


Feeling satisfied, Lainey gathered her things,humming softly under her breath as she moved upstairs.


Once she locked the third-floor door behind her, her phone vibrated with a message from Horace."Someone's aggressively digging into the ancient tomb collapse incident."



Lainey's heart dropped.



Only one person came to mind.



Nolan. If he uncovered her involvement, everything would be over.



With the Benton family still overseas, she couldn't afford even the smallest mistake. Her pulse steadied as she forced herself to think clearly.


Then, without hesitation, she called Horace. "Listen,if you can clean this up and make sure it never points back to me, I'll introduce you to the Bentons. I'll even give you a piece of the Benton Group's stocks. How does that sound?"


Horace's chuckle was slow and calculating. "E'll do it if you give me five percent of the shares."


Five percent? Lainey's jaw clenched. That was an outrageous demand.


The Benton Group wasn't just a company; it was a titan in Breoqua. Five percent meant tens of billions.


He was practically robbing her.


But when she thought of Nolan's cold, unrelenting nature, she realized she couldn't risk pushing her luck.



Money could always be made again, but if Nolan uncovered any evidence against her, prison would be her reality for the rest of her life.


Cornered by the thought, Lainey clenched her jaw and spat out one word. "Deal."
###Chapter  108 No Kissing Me In Public
With Horace stepping in and covering things up,Eleanor didn't manage to pin down any hard proof against Lainey, even after wrapping up her work in Otrad.



Not that it mattered.


She already knew in her gut Lainey was behind it,and that was enough.


Evidence could wait. She had all the time in the world to deal with her when the moment was right.


With the last artifact sealed and handed over,Eleanor finally straightened her back, groaning at the stiffness that came from days of near-constant work underground.


She had been pushing herself without rest just to make the deadline. Her phone had been shut off that whole time too, her own doing.


When she finally powered it back on, a flood of notifications nearly overwhelmed her.


Most of them were from Nolan.



The instant his familiar profile picture popped up, her heart gave a little jolt.


She opened the chat and started scrolling through the messages, one after another.


"Don't forget to reply when you get this."


"Is your signal acting up?"


"Eleanor, take care of yourself."


"Good night."



The last one was from late last night. It read, "I miss you."


Her chest tightened. She could almost still feel the warmth of his kiss on her forehead, and those words hit her like a slow burn searing into her heart.


Guilt settled in heavy.


Nolan wasn't the type to reach out easily,yet here he was, sending her message after message, waiting in silence for a reply that never came.


She could imagine the letdown he must have felt every time her silence greeted him.


Eleanor's grip on the phone tightened as she started typing.


"Sorry, I just saw this."


She stared at the words, then backspaced. Too flat.Too dismissive.


She then typed another reply. "I didn't have signal here. I wasn't avoiding you."


Delete. That sounded like an excuse.



She rewrote and erased again. Nothing sounded right; everything came out too light, too shallow,never close to what she truly wanted to say. In the end, she settled on something short but certain. "I'm coming back now."


Sliding the phone back into her pocket, she headed straight for her tent, packed up her things, and made her way to the airport.


Hours later, when she finally stepped off the plane in Elepdon, the first thing she spotted was Nolan's ridiculously handsome face.


Her footsteps faltered without her meaning to, and before she could even collect herself, Nolan was already striding over.


Without saying a word, he caught her wrist and steered her straight toward the Bentley parked outside the terminal.


The second the door shut behind them, he pulled her into a kiss that left her breathless.


Eleanor tried to shove at his chest, muttering against his lips, "Someone might see..."


But when her eyes flicked forward, she noticed the partition had been raised, sealing them off from the driver.



She had the sudden suspicion this whole thing was no spur-of-the-moment act-he had thought it through.


Ever since their first kiss, it was like Nolan had flipped a switch inside himself-unstoppable,relentless, like he had been holding back for far too long.


Still, he knew just when to ease off.


After stealing a few deep kisses, he finally let her go.


Eleanor sat up quickly, smoothing her hair and forcing a calm expression. "From now on, no kissing me in public."


Nolan didn't look the least bit sorry; instead, his lips curved in a slow smile.



He leaned in, pressing his forehead lightly to hers, his breath warm as he murmured, "So what you're saying is that I'm allowed to kiss you at home?" Without thinking, she blurted, "Yes."


Her own answer hit her a second later. She had walked right into that one.


Flustered, she clenched her teeth and shot him a glare. "Either way, you still need my permission first."


Nolan only chuckled softly, watching her sulky expression with clear amusement.


He brushed his fingers across her lips and whispered in a tone that promised more, "Okay. Whatever you say."
###Chapter  109 Who Said You Could Walk Off
Nolan had turned into a hopeless romantic ever since Eleanor's trip to Otrad, his devotion making him blind to everything else.


For several days straight, aside from the moments he absolutely needed for himself, he hardly left her side.


It was as if work no longer existed in his world.


Eventually, Eleanor had enough and used business matters as her excuse to escape to the store.


Just as she reached the entrance, she came face-to-face with Emma and Vickie, who were stepping out of the neighboring shop.


Emma lifted her shopping bags high, her face glowing with excitement. "Mom, Lainey is unbelievable. She only had to speak once, and Jonny handed over his unlimited credit card." Vickie shot her a sly look, her smile sharp at the edges. "Obviously he did. Lainey's a Benton by blood. Who else would he suck up to? It's not like he'd waste his time on some walking jinx dragging this family through the mud."



Emma was ready to agree when her eyes suddenly caught Eleanor standing nearby.


The sight of her left Emma momentarily stunned.


With Jonny and Lainey locked in constant arguments lately, she was convinced Eleanor had stirred the trouble.



She had been waiting for the perfect chance to put Eleanor in her place, and now it seemed the opportunity had delivered itself.


Marching forward with her chin high, Emma sneered,"Listen carefully, Eleanor. Don't think your little schemes can tear Jonny and Lainey apart. Lainey is Benton blood, and my sister-in-law will always be her. As for you..." Her gaze swept Eleanor up and down with cruel disdain. "You're nothing more than a girl raised in an orphanage. No matter how talented you think you are, you'll only ever end up as someone's toy."


Eleanor couldn't help but think Emma had completely lost her senses.


Why in the world would she leave someone like Nolan for Jonny?


But she didn't voice her thoughts. To her, silence and indifference were the sharpest answers.


Without sparing Emma so much as a glance, she simply walked past her.


Emma's temper boiled over when Eleanor walked away as if she didn't exist. She lunged forward,hand outstretched to grab Eleanor. "Hold it! Who said you could walk off?"



The attempt never landed. Instead, a sharp crack rang out as Eleanor's palm struck her cheek.


For a second, Emma froze in disbelief. Had this weak, spineless girl really hit her?


Three years of bullying and not once had Eleanor fought back, yet now she dared to raise a hand?


Didn't she realize she could run to Jonny and make him despise her forever?


Eleanor offered no explanation, no apology. She simply lowered her arm and rolled her wrist,loosening the sting.


Her gaze cut like ice as it slid to Vickie and then back to Emma. "Next time you try that, it won't stop with a slap."


With her warning delivered, Eleanor strode calmly into her store, her composure untouched.


Only when her silhouette vanished did Emma's voice return, shrill with outrage.


"Mom! She hit me! She has crossed a line!"


Vickie's anger already simmered to the surface.


If it weren't for the people nearby, she might have clawed Eleanor's face to pieces on the spot.


"Unbelievable. That little tramp dares to raise her hand? She needs to be taught a lesson!" Vickie muttered under her breath.


Her mind spun with fury. Since when did Eleanor find the courage?


It had to be Nolan.


Ever since she latched onto him, she walked around with a new arrogance.


The thought made Vickie's stomach churn. She couldn't stand the humiliation her daughter had suffered.


She made up her mind to go to Lainey, certain that Lainey wouldn't let what happened to Emma slide and would make sure Eleanor paid forit.
###Chapter  110 What Do You Even Want





Lainey had no time to worry about Vickie's complaints, because her own world was starting to collapse.



No sooner had she glanced at Vickie's message than a new notification popped up on her screen-a video from an unlisted number.


The recording opened with her sliding into a cafébooth, Denny seated across from her like nothing was amiss.



Next came the image of her hand pulling strands of hair from a sealed plastic bag.



The final shot showed her slipping into the restroom,eyes sharp as she spied on Denny.



Every second of the footage was sharp, leaving no room for denial. Her phone slipped from her fingers and hit the floor with a heavy thud.


Lainey's face went pale as she clutched her mouth in horror. No... how was this possible? Where did this come from?"



That night replayed in her mind-she had personally watched the manager erase the surveillance and even sweetened the deal with a thick envelope of cash.



But what if someone had copied it before the deletion?



What if there had been eyes on her the entire time?


The more her thoughts unraveled, the colder she felt,fear spreading through her veins.


Right now, her identity as a Benton was the only weapon she had left, the only card that could secure her place again.


Losing that meant losing everything. Lainey grabbed the phone off the floor, struggling to calm the tight rhythm of her breath. Her hands trembled as she punched in the words.


"Why are you doing this? What do you even want?"


The reply landed almost instantly. "My identity doesn't matter. What matters is I know exactly what you did. Hand over five percent of the Benton Group's shares."


Her chest tightened. Five percent. Again. She had already promised Horace five, and now another five?That was ten percent of the company's worth. Tens of billions slipping right through her fingers before she even had the chance to hold them.



Denny's words from earlier echoed in her mind-twenty percent. That was supposed to be hers.


But now, before she even got the chance to hold onto them, half had already slipped through her fingers.


It didn't sit right with her. No matter how she tried to reason with it, she just couldn't make peace with it.


But refusal wasn't an option.


Her teeth sank into her lower lip until she nearly drew blood, and she forced her trembling hand to type a single word."Fine."


In her heart, however, she made a vow. Once she secured her place as Benton blood, she would hunt this person down and make them regret crossing her.


She quickly sent another message, saying, "Give me your name and your bank account details. I'll arrange the transfer."



Her plan was clear-learn who they were, then erase them completely.


The response was just as cold as the last. "Who l am doesn't matter. When you see your family again that night, make sure the transfer papers are signed. And don't get any ideas. If you try to be smart, the Bentons will see this video before the night's over." As her eyes stayed fixed on the screen, the weight of the message shattered what little calm Lainey had left.



Her scream tore through the room as she hurled the phone against the wall.


"Why? Damn it! Why does Eleanor glide through life while every step I take feels like walking into a trap?"


Now she had no choice but to charm the Benton family into granting her back the ten percent she had just given away.


Denny had told her the family would return in a week.


That gave her seven days to become the ideal daughter they longed for-sweet, attentive,irreplaceable.


If she succeeded, the shares would fall into her hands willingly, and she wouldn't have to claw for them piece by piece in the years ahead.
###Chapter  111| Won't Cause Any More Fuss
While Lainey was busy scheming her way into high society,Eleanor was running herself ragged, so much so that both Nolan and Lillian had started grumbling about her neglect.


The moment she came back from Otrad, her phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Invitations poured in from TV stations left and right,all begging for interviews.


Her first instinct was to turn them all down.Unfortunately, Dyer had other ideas. He cheerfully accepted several on her behalf, patting his chest as though he had done her a huge favor.


"Eleanor, this is for your own good," he explained,smug as ever. "If you keep showing up on the big respectable platforms, people will think twice before causing you trouble. Consider it insurance." Eleanor was left speechless. Insurance? For him maybe.


For her, it meant endless camera lights, rehearsed answers, and no sleep.


Forget about relaxing with Nolan or shopping with Lillian; her calendar was packed solid.


When David heard about this, he nearly exploded at the Elepdon Sanatorium. His cane struck the floor with a sharp crack as he shouted at Dyer. "You sly old fox! Don't think I don't know your intentions.You're just trying to parade her around as your apprentice, aren't you?"


He slammed his cane against the floor for emphasis."Eleanor belongs to me. She's my apprentice, not yours, and she hasn't taken you as her teacher!"


Dyer only smoothed down his beard with infuriating calm and chuckled. "So what? Everyone out there already believes she's mine. Nobody even knows who you are. If you've got the guts, why don't you announce it publicly?" David turned red enough to pop a blood vessel.


He whirled toward Eleanor, ready to declare her status loud and clear. "Eleanor, you're my apprentice,and I want the world to-"


However, before he could finish, Eleanor slapped a hand over his mouth. "Don't! Please, David, I'm begging you. I still want to live!"


Because if her true identity as the infamous Soul Surgeon got out, she might as well start carving her own tombstone.



That name wasn't something she could carry lightly.


Once people with rare and difficult illnesses came flooding in from all corners of the country, what would she do?



Help them or turn them away? She cared deeply, but she wasn't some all-powerful savior. She couldn't possibly save everyone.


The very thought made her scalp go numb David understood, but his glare at Dyer could have burned holes through the wall.


Finally, he pushed Eleanor's hand away and said gruffly, "Fine. But this won't end here. From now on,aside from what you donate, every collection you work on belongs to me!"


Eleanor bobbed her head so quickly it was a wonder it stayed attached. "Yes, yes, of course, they're all yours."


It still took an hour of back massages, sweet words,and endless cups of coffee before David finally calmed down.



But one storm down didn't mean she was in the clear.


She turned to find Dyer still looking unbearably pleased with himself. Her patience snapped.Narrowing her eyes, she warned, "If you stir up trouble for me again, I'll stop making those pills for you next month." That hit him right where it hurt. Dyer had carried a nagging leg injury ever since his early digs.


Though not life-threatening, it was excruciating during rainy days, making sleep impossible.


The pills Eleanor specially prepared for him were the only relief he had.


The moment she threatened to cut it off, his grin faded. He raised his hands in surrender. "Alright,alright! I won't cause any more fuss."


And just like that, the two old men, between them almost two hundred years old, were pacified at last.


Eleanor let out a long sigh of relief, dusted off her hands, and headed for the door. "I'm going now. You two behave yourselves. And remember, no more accepting jobs for me!"


She waited until both men nodded, and only then escaped.


Outside, Nolan was waiting, leaning against his car like a man out of a magazine-straight-backed and  effortlessly elegant.


The instant he saw her, he pushed off the car and strode forward. "What kept you so long?"


Eleanor's heart gave a tiny jolt. She couldn't let him know about David, nor risk him connecting the dots to the Soul Surgeon.


So she blinked, forced a casual smile, and fibbed,"Oh, Dyer wouldn't stop talking. Took me forever to get away."



Nolan's gaze lingered on her face. He knew she was lying, but instead of calling her out, he only curved his lips faintly and pulled open the car door, bowing slightly in mock formnality. "Your ride awaits, my lady."


If it weren't for David's and Dyer's mischievous faces poking out from the window behind her, he might have almost bought her story.


What a crafty little fox, hiding her secrets so tightly.


But Nolan knew better than to expose her fib. She would only get defensive, and he wasn't about to push her away.


Subtly, he shifted his stance to block her view of the two troublemakers. "Erick, let's go," he ordered once they were inside.



Only after the car rolled away did David and Dyer duck their heads back in.



They traded a long look and, for once, shared the same thought: they would never let Nolan steal away their precious treasure.



As for Nolan, he had no idea that, thanks to those few glances, he had just earned himself not one, but two determined rivals standing between him and Eleanor's heart.



But that, well, was a storm waiting for another day.
###Chapter  112 We'll Stay Here In Elepdon With You
Once Eleanor wrapped up her interview in a single,confident sweep, the spotlight shifted. Lainey's turn to step into the Benton family's world had come.


Sitting alone with the television's glow flickering across her face, Lainey could barely hide her jealousy watching Eleanor bask in the attention.


But she reassured herself that soon,her new status would eclipse anything Eleanor could ever hope for.


The thought brought a tight, triumphant smile to her lips.


With her phone tucked away, she smoothed out her designer dress and moved toward the VIP lounge with purpose.


As the door swung open, Lainey summoned a surge of emotion, making her eyes glisten and releasing tears right on cue. "Dad, Mom... I finally found my way back to you."


Jeff Benton and his wife, Hilda Benton, lit up for a heartbeat when Lainey appeared, but their excitement faded as soon as they took a good look at her.


Something about her seemed off. Their real daughter shouldn't appear this calculating. She was striking,yes, but the look in her eyes was nothing like the open warmth the Benton family recognized as their own.



Lainey sensed the shift right away.


Still, facts were on her side-the DNA results were indisputable.



She just had to smooth things over and win their trust.



So she brushed away a perfect tear, her voice tremulous and soft. "Is there something about me that makes you uneasy? I know I grew up far from  home, and maybe I picked up a few bad habits. But if I have, just tell me and I'll do my best to change."


The words landed just as she intended, an apology that tugged at their hearts while quietly reminding them of her years apart.


Sure enough, Jeff's hesitation began to fade.


Lainey knew deep down that her sharp edges and calculating mind were not entirely her fault. If they hadn't lost her all those years ago, she would never have grown up learning to survive with such cunning.


Jeff's heart lurched the moment he saw her dabbing at her tears. His voice cracked with guilt as he leaned toward her. "Don't cry, sweetheart. None of this is your doing. We failed you. We're not upset with you.We're just... overwhelmed with joy."


He then turned to his wife, urging her to speak."Isn't that right,honey?"


Hilda swallowed her doubts, forcing a smile as she remarked softly, "Yes, too happy for words." Lainey kept her expression soft and graceful, but beneath that calm exterior, exhilaration threatened to consume her.



She was finally seated among the Benton family-the most powerful and untouchable family in all of Zerovia.



From this moment forward, their fortune, their prestige, their influence, would all become hers to claim.


Once the small talk faded, Lainey leaned in, sensing the moment was right. Her voice softened,trembling with hope as she begged, "Dad, Mom,will you stay in Elepdon with me instead of going back to Breoqua?This is the place I know, the city where I grew up.1don't want to leave. I want to be here, with you."


In her mind, there was no comparison. Wealth overseas meant anonymity-no one would know her name, no one would bow to her presence.


But here in Elepdon, things would be different. She could crush Eleanor's pride, belittle Lillian in pub  and even turn Nolan's heart her way.


Here,she could crown herself as the most admired,envied, and untouchable woman Elepdon had ever seen.


A dangerous glimmer flickered in Lainey's eyes, a spark of triumph edged with madness.


Hilda caught it at once, and the sight made her stomach twist with unease.


Something was wrong-deeply wrong.


Her little girl had once mirrored her in every way.


As a child, her smile bent her eyes into crescent moons,bright and innocent.

Even as an adult, she should have carried that same warmth.


Yet the woman before her radiated something entirely different.


Still, the DNA test had been undeniable. So why did her instincts scream otherwise?  A sudden thought struck Hilda like a bolt of lightning -what if this girl wasn't the daughter they had lost,but rather the key to finding the real one?


Jeff, on the other hand, showed no such hesitation.His voice was gentle, reassuring. "Very well. We won't go back. We'll stay here in Elepdon with you."


Hilda plastered on a smile, forcing her doubts beneath the surface. "Yes, darling, we'll stay.Tomorrow we'll have the estate cleaned and ready.You can move in with us right away, doesn't that sound wonderful?"


Inwardly, she resolved to keep Lainey close, watching carefully until the truth revealed itself.


Lainey, blind to the suspicion in Hilda's heart, could barely contain her joy at their affection. Her pulse quickened, and excitement surged so strongly she almost trembled.



In her mind, the victory was already sealed. She believed she had fooled the mighty Benton family at last, and from this day forward, she was their rightful  daughter.
###Chapter  113 Have You Heard Of Enigma
Dinner ended with polite smiles and hollow words,each side hiding thoughts they dared not voice.


The moment Lainey stepped back into the Todd family's villa, Jonny came barreling toward her like an eager puppy. "Baby, tell me-did your parents agree?Will they put money into the Todd Group?"


His hopeful face made her sick. Investment? From the Benton family? He actually thought she would beg for his sake?


Before she left, he had pressed her again and again to push the subject at the very first meeting.


But she wasn't that naive.



Bringing up money too soon would only sour the Bentons' impression of her, and she couldn't risk that. She kept her mouth shut, knowing better than to say it straight to him.


Stirring him up now would only bring trouble she didn't need.


Determined to hold her ground, Lainey lifted her chin and looked down at him with cold detachment. "already brought it up. They told me they'd make a decision once the Benton family is officially back in the domestic market."


It wasn't the confirmation he craved, but even that sliver of hope was enough to send Jonny into a frenzy of excitement.


Disgusted by the sight, Lainey brushed past him and climbed the stairs without another word.


She refused to waste any more of her time on him,not when only one day remained.


By tomorrow, she would finally walk out of the Todd family's villa for good.


She was certain that once the welcome-home banquet concluded, the Benton family w/ould stand by her side when she filed for divorce.


And at last, she would be rid of all the irritating people clinging to her.


The next morning brought Jeff and Hilda to the Todd family's villa right on schedule.


As their car waited, Jonny and Vickie as well as Emma stepped outside to see Lainey off.


Vickie clutched Lainey's hand tightly, her reluctance written across her face. "Lainey, I'm glad that you've found your parents now. I hope you won't forget about me."



Emma wasted no time looping her arm through Lainey's, her voice rising with playful insistence."Count me in too, Lainey! You're not allowed to forget me either."


The cheer in her tone only sharpened Jonny's scowl as he shot both women a wary look, afraid they might plant the wrong words in Lainey's ears. 
He jumped in hastily, eager to smooth things over."Stop saying things like that. Lainey's thoughtful and kindhearted. She'd never turn her back on us."



Their cloying attention made Lainey's stomach twist but she kept her lips curved in a practiced smile,offering only the smallest nod in return.


Relief washed over her once she finally slipped into the gleaming Rolls-Royce.



What a farce.,



She had risen too high to ever look back.


The Todd family weren't even fit to polish her shoes,much less earn her forgiveness.


Every bit of her loathing sat heavy behind her poised expression.


Sitting beside her, Hilda caught the flicker of disdain in Lainey's eyes. Her fingers tightened against her lap, and a quiet certainty bloomed inside her chest.


That girl wasn't hers. She could feel it in her bones. Her real daughter would never be so calculating.


Jeff, blind to it all, carried on without suspicion.


A night of brooding had chased away every doubt in his mind, and now he gazed at Lainey with wide-eyed joy, convinced he had finally found the daughter he lost.



When the car rolled to a stop, he sprang out with energy, hurrying to the other side. "Here, Lainey. Let me carry youur things. Careful now, watch your step."


Lainey basked in the warmth of affection that was never truly hers, her lips curving as she remarked,"Thanks, Dad."


When she turned, her eyes landed on Hilda, still seated in the car with a faraway look clouding her face. Stepping closer, Lainey slipped her hand around Hilda's arm. "Mom, what's on your mind?"


The sudden touch jolted Hilda back to herself.She masked the unease in her eyes with a practiced smile. "It's nothing, dear. I was only wondering what we should wear to the welcome-home banquet next week."



An idea flickered through Lainey's mind. "Mom, have you heard of Enigma? Everyone's talking about her right now. Why don't we ask her to design something special for the two of us?"



Hilda's brows knitted as she recalled the name. She had heard of the designer's strict rules, and worry tugged at her expression. "But the banquet is in just a week. Can'she even do it in time? Besides, she doesn't usually take custom dress orders."



Lainey's confidence never wavered. Her smile carried a knowing edge. "That doesn't matter. If the money is right, she'll agree. People always do."


Faced with her certainty, Hilda gave in with a small nod. "Very well. Handle it yourself. Just let me know the cost, and I'll wire it to you."


Leaning in, Lainey pressed against her with an affectionate tilt of her head. "Mom, you really are the sweetest." Inside, a thrill sparked through Lainey's veins. Her chance for revenge against Eleanor was close at hand.



Soon, she would walk into that banquet draped in a gown crafted by Eleanor's own hands, standing proudly among Eleanor's true relatives, dazzling as the center of attention. The image of Eleanor's humiliation brought a rush of excitement.


Nolan might stand at Eleanor's side, but Lainey believed one truth above all-bloodlines and family prestige would always eclipse borrowed power. And in that arena, Eleanor would never measure up.
###Chapter  114 Money Isn't The Issue





Two days after settling into the Benton family's estate, Lainey draped herself in a crisp Atelier Veyron suit and strutted into the Enigma store as though she owned the place.



Her heels clicked with sharp rhythm as she marched straight to Besty's office and knocked at the door.


Inside, Besty sat behind her desk, eyes locked on the stack of reports in front of her. Without glancing up,she called out, "Come in."



The door swung open, and the air was instantly saturated with Lainey's overpowering perfume.



Besty's brow twitched as she finally raised her gaze.



There stood Lainey, smiling that polished smile that looked pleasant at first glance but carried nothing but disdain beneath it. Having seen Lainey's manipulative tricks before,Besty already held her in contempt.



"Mrs. Todd, what business do you have with us today?" Her tone stayed even and professional.


Lainey didn't flinch. She strolled in, dropped her designer bag on the sofa like it belonged there, and made herself comfortable in the chair opposite.Crossing one leg over the other, she announced, "I'm here for your boss, Enigma."



Besty laid her pen aside, her face impassive."Unfortunately, she doesn't have time to meet with you."


A soft laugh slipped from Lainey, low and mocking,as though she had just heard an absurd joke. "No time for me?"



From her bag, she produced a check and slid it across the desk with casual flair. "Here's $20 million.Have her design a mother-daughter ensemble for me and my mother." Besty's gaze slid to the check, but her expression stayed cold. "MMoney isn't the issue. Our boss has a standing rule-she doesn't accept private requests."


Unbothered, Lainey reached once more into her bag,scribbled on her checkbook, and pushed forward a fresh slip of paper. Her voice carried a sharper edge now. "$60 million. That should do it."



The figure made Besty's chest tighten. She wanted to spit out her disgust, furious that Lainey thought Enigma could be bought like any common designer.Yet sixty million was no small sum.


That memory of Eleanor's tendency to prize money tugged at her mind. If anyone could be swayed,maybe it would be her.


So Besty pressed down her irritation, pasting on a thin smile. "Fine. I'll bring it up to her."


Her politeness was forced, but Lainey couldn't care less.


Lainey had her sights set on Eleanor, not on someone like Besty, who didn't deserve her time.


Besty's position wasn't random-Eleanor had picked her personally.


Her taste matched what Eleanor valued most.


When the offer of sixty million reached her, Eleanor let out a dry laugh. "Take the offer."


Money was still money, and it could be turned into meals for children who went to bed hungry.


If Lainey wanted to flaunt her wealth,then so be it.


Carrying out the instructions, Besty turned back with a firm reply. "Our boss has agreed."


Lainey's smug smile said she had seen this coming.She grabbed her bag and strolled toward the door with lazy confidence.


At the threshold, she paused and looked over her shoulder. "One more thing-make sure your boss knows I expect the gowns finished by Sunday night.On Monday, my parents are holding a reunion banquet in my honor."


She didn't bother to wait for acknowledgment.Instead, she flicked a golden-edged invitation onto the desk as if it were nothing.


"Give this to her. As for you..." Her gaze swept Besty from head to toe before she added with a dismissive smirk, "Well, your presence isn't required."


Her heels clicked away as she departed, radiating the kind of elegance only she believed in.


The moment she was out of sight, curious staff clustered together in hushed chatter.


"Did you see that? Besty, she's unbearable with that attitude!"


"Wait, isn't she supposed to be the Benton family's long-lost daughter? How could she behave like that?"



"The Benton family is as influential as the Stewart family. Families like that pride themselves on class.And that's what they raised?" Sliding the invitation into her bag without the slightest change in expression, Besty replied casually, "Let her act however she wants. We have our boss on our side, and she's not someone who can be pushed around."


The others had no clue, but Besty did.


Eleanor's influence reached much deeper than the surface ever showed.


With a flick of her wrist, she dismissed their whispers. "Enough gossip. Everyone, back to work.I've got a client contract to wrap up."


Gathering the necessary file, she left the office without another glance.


But when she stepped into the client's office, she was met with uneasy faces. "Ms. Juarez, I'm afraid have to apologize. Word has been going around that you've somehow upset the Benton family's newly acknowledged daughter. Because of that, it may be best if we call off this partnership. Unless, of course,Enigma is willing to come in person to finalize the agreement, and in that case, we might be open to changing our decision."


Besty didn't spare him the courtesy of a reply. She turned on her heel and walked out, her disdain sharp and unshaken. If he thought he could cozy up to Lainey by disrespecting Eleanor, then he was nothing more than a fool chasing fantasies.
###Chapter  115 Are You Planning To Go
Besty marched into the garage, her frustration plain as day, and found her car sitting on four flat tires.


Shit!



She clenched her jaw, certain it was the same man she had just met. he was going out of his way to impress Lainey.



What a moron.



Someone as conniving as Lainey couldn't possibly be the real daughter of the Benton family.



She would get what she deserved.


Still, Besty couldn't ignore the deep sense of disgust churning in her chest.



Before she could leave the car behind, a flash of headlights cut through the dim garage. A sleek car pulled up. The window slid down,revealing a relatively striking face. It was no doubt Ryland.


"Having car trouble?" Ryland asked, his arm resting casually over the steering wheel as he gave her a knowing look.


He hadn't forgotten Besty, the director at Eleanor's store and a favorite topic in Lillian's stories, always described as lovely, warm-hearted, and capable.


Because of Lillian and out of respect for Nolan,Ryland felt compelled to step in to help.


Relief softened Besty's stiff posture as she recognized him. "Yes. Could you just take me to the store? I'll handle the car situation later."


Ryland kept silent, reaching over to unlock the passenger door without another word.


After offering a quick thanks, Besty slid into the seat beside him.


They made their way to the shop, and as Besty was about to step out, something popped into her mind.She rummaged through her purse, pulled out a fancy invitation stamped with gold, and held it out. "Oh almost forgot, Mr. Brooks. Lainey wanted me to give this to Eleanor. I'm not sure when Eleanor will drop by, so can you pass it along? I appreciate it."


Ryland accepted the invitation.


Running his thumb over the elegant gold details, he let out a low scoff.


He thought to himself that Lainey had some nerve,always trying to agitate Eleanor.


Later on, Nolan ended up handing the invitation to Eleanor.



He drummed his fingers on the tabletop and gave Eleanor a sly grin. "So, are you planning to go?"


Eleanor picked up the envelope, barely glanced at it,and set it back down with little interest.



She answered evenly, "Of course. Why wouldn't I? If Lainey wants to put on a performance for me, I'll play along.Besides, it's a perfect opportunity to connect with people and line up new sponsors for my foundation."



Even though she had a certain reputation as Enigma,there were still plenty of affluent people she hadn't reached.



Fan support could only go so far. In the end,everything hinged in the favor of influential socialites and business leaders.



With that in mind, Eleanor saw no downside to attending the event.



If Lainey wanted to parade around and flaunt her status, Eleanor was happy to let her have the spotlight.


Nolan listened to her calm reasoning, and the chill in his gaze faded, replaced by a warm, affectionate grin. "In that case, let's go pick out some matching clothes. That way, everyone will know we're together." He hated the thought of strangers, unaware of their relationship, setting their sights on her.


With her charm, he felt the urge to make sure everyone knew she was spoken for.


Eleanor blinked in surprise at his suggestion, but realization quickly dawned on her.


Who would have guessed that the mighty CEO of the Stewart Group could have such a heightened sense of crisis?


The whole thing struck her as both funny and a little endearing.


"Sure," she agreed with a smile.


She had actually hoped to make her own dress this time.


However, Lainey's urgent request for a set of mother-daughter outfits had completely filled up her schedule.


That being the case, she figured picking up  something from a boutique would be more than enough.


It had been ages since Nolan enjoyed a real date with her.


The moment she gave her consent, he wasted no time dropping his paperwork as he eagerly took her by the hand and led her out the door.


They made quite the impression, drawing glances and whispers from nearly everyone they passed.


After snagging their coordinated outfits, they suddenly found themselves at the center of a fan gathering.


"Is that really Nolan with Enigma? I can't believe it!"


"ls this a date? You two look so cute together!"


"Would you mind if we took a picture with you guys?"


Their supporters were clearly thrilled but made sure to keep a polite distance, content to simply be close.


The cheerful buzz was soon interrupted by someone shouting over the crowd. "Move aside! Mrs. Todd needs to get through!"
###Chapter  116 It's Much Too Loud





The crowd followed the direction of the voice and saw Lainey approaching. She was flanked by two bodyguards who parted the crowd for her, with her confidence bordering on smugness.



Seriously? What an ostentatious display! Anyone would think she wanted the world to know she was the long-lost daughter of the Bentons.


Most of the onlookers were rich girls, and some were even the daughters of influential officials.


Yet not a single one of them arrived with half the fanfare Lainey brought.


Truthfully, most people dismissed Lainey's flashiness, though not a single person was bold enough to say so aloud.


As the Benton family's fortune soared, so did their sway in Elepdon. No one wanted to tempt fate or risk crossing them over something petty.


With that in mind, the crowd instinctively stepped aside, creating a path that left Eleanor and Nolan right in Lainey's line of sight.


Running into Eleanor there was clearly not part of Lainey's plan.


She meant to pretend Eleanor didn't exist, but her attention caught on the man standing next to her.


Nolan stood by Eleanor's side-a man with a reputation in Elepdon that rivaled her own.


He might have been clueless, especially since he had ended up falling for someone like Eleanor.


Still, Lainey didn't let it bother her. Her own standing had risen, and she was convinced Nolan would recognize her value soon enough.


With that thought, Lainey slid off her oversized sunglasses and, projecting polished confidence,strolled toward them. "Mr. Stewart! What a surprise running into you tonight. My father mentioned how

hectic you've been lately. I didn't expect to see you here."



She pretended just then to spot Eleanor and let out an exaggerated gasp. "Oh, Miss Warren! I hardly recognized you. Honestly, a place like this usually draws the social elite, so it took me a second to realize it was you. Hope you don't take it the wrong way?"



Giving a theatrical little tap to her lips, she continued,"Listen to me going on and on. Since you're with Mr.Stewart, it makes perfect sense you're here. Sorry for not realizing it sooner."


Lainey's entire act was staged not just for the people nearby,but especially for Nolan.


She wanted to make it crystal clear that, as the Benton family's daughter, she was the only one who truly fit by his side.



Much to her irritation, Nolan never even looked her way. His attention belonged entirely to Eleanor.  He reached out and tucked a loose strand of Eleanor's hair behind her ear in a gentle, familiar way."Let's get out of here. It's much too loud."



With their shopping done, Eleanor felt no reason to stick around.



She blushed and nodded lightly, feeling equal parts embarrassed and flustered.



This man... Why did he always have to make her heart race in front of an audience?



The man was impossible.



Nolan saw nothing wrong with showing affection in public; if anything, he thought it wasn't nearly enough.



He confidently wrapped an arm around Eleanor's waist and guided her through the mall, shutting out everyone else as if the world had faded away.


Not once did he glance in anyone else's direction,least of all Lainey. A ripple of barely stifled laughter swept through the crowd.



Lainey, famous for sucking up to those at the top and snubbing everyone beneath her, had been completely overlooked by Nolan.


Should gossip start to spread, her humiliation would be the punchline at every gathering.



Unable to endure the humiliating stares any longer,Lainey bolted for the exit.



"Damn it!" she snapped, hurling her purse onto the car seat as soon as the door slammed shut.



Eleanor!



It was always Eleanor!



That bitch was the reason Nolan never looked her way.



What did that bitch have that she didn't?



Lainey realized head-on challenges were pointless. Nolan wouldn't budge for her usual games.


If she wanted to win, she would need to change her approach.


A single name suddenly leapt to mind-Norwood!


Of course! The gossip mill never stopped spinning tales of Nolan's endless clashes with his grandfather,all because of Eleanor.


If she herself could get on Norwood's good side...



Wouldn't that clear the way for her?


For a household as distinguished as the Stewarts,marrying someone of equal status was seen as crucial.


How could Norwood ever approve of Eleanor, a divorced woman with no connections?


She herself, on the other hand, had just reclaimed her place as the Benton family's daughter, her impeccable background, her social standing secure.


She and Nolan were the perfect match on pape Surely, Norwood would recognize that, unless he had lost all sense.


Fueled by this realization, Lainey immediately turned to her bodyguards, who had just caught up. "Get me Norwood Stewart's itinerary. I want every detail.Don't miss a thing."


"Understood."


Eleanor, she had better watch out. The title of Nolan's wife would belong to her soon enough.

###Chapter  117 That's Very Considerate Of You
Two days later, Lainey made her way to the Stewart family's estate for her much-anticipated visit.


Lainey had carefully selected a luxurious set of coffee accessories to offer as a gift.


Dressed in a crisp white gown, with flawless yet subtle makeup, she moved with the elegance and grace expected of someone raised among high society.


Winning Norwood's favor was her only goal.


The Stewart family's butler ushered her into the living room.


Norwood sat on the couch, his demeanor serious, an elegant watch gleaming on his wrist.


Lainey presented the elegant coffee set in front of Norwood, then offered a courteous introduction, "Mr.Stewart, I'm Lainey. I was born into the Benton family from Breoqua. I've only recently been reunited with my parents. Knowing how much you appreciate coffee, I searched for this set just for you. I hope it suits your taste."


By emphasizing her distinguished family roots while presenting herself with humility, she hoped to win Norwood's approval.


But Norwood was not easily won over.


He could see through her charm; her intentions weren't as innocent as she pretended.


His gaze swept over the coffee set before turning back to her, his words measured and neutral. "That's very considerate of you."


A flicker of unease passed through Lainey, but she kept her calm. He was proving more challenging than she expected.


Even so, she remained confident in her ability to play  the long game.


She settled gracefully into the arm chair nearby lifting a delicate cup and pouring Norwood a fresh serving of coffee. "I've admired your accomplishments since I was a child. The Stewart Group has thrived under your leadership, and Nolan's talent has only helped the company reach even greater heights."


Most grandparents, she assumed, enjoyed hearing their grandchildren praised.


After offering her compliments, Lainey's voice took on a tone of concern as she continued, "But lately, I can't help but notice he's been going against your wishes-all because of a woman with such a questionable past."


She put on an innocent look. "Forgive me for bringing this up, but as a Stewart, Nolan deserves a wife with an impeccable reputation, someone who can strengthen both your legacy and his future. Instead,Miss Warren comes from nothing-she's an orphan who once married into the Todd family for money and  is still entangled with her ex-husband, even after her divorce. If she marries into the Stewarts, wouldn't people talk?"


Her words sounded heartfelt and genuine on the surface.



Norwood gave her little more than a passing glance as she spoke.



He had spent a lifetime reading people and motives.


Regardless of his feelings about Eleanor, decisions involving the Stewart family belonged to them alone.


When did it become this young woman's business?


And she was not related to Benton family by blood.


Norwood lost all desire for further conversation,choosing instead to lift his coffee and blow across its surface. "Nolan can handle his own affairs. Our family doesn't need to cling to marriage alliances for security."

  
The message behind his words couldn't have been clearer-this was not her concern.



Color drained from Lainey's face, leaving her both furious and humiliated.


She never expected that all her careful planning would fall flat; Norwood remained completely indifferent.



Had he really decided to accept Eleanor?



Impossible!



She couldn't let that happen!



Nolan's wife was supposed to be her!


Still determined, Lainey tried to speak up, but Norwood placed his cup down with finality. "I'm tired.Butler, please show her out."


His refusal came sharp and final, shutting down any chance for further discussion.



There was nothing left for Lainey but to get up and leave, anger boiling beneath her composed exterior That stubborn old man!



He wouldn't recognize kindness if it stared him in the face!





But she would have her way soon enough. Once she married Nolan, she would make sure Norwood met his maker.
###Chapter  118 We're Not Friends





Since she couldn't convince Norwood, Lainey realized she would have to shift her focus to Nolan.


In a man's world, professional achievement and long-term gains always outweighed any feelings of affection.



Romance was little more than a pleasant afterthought.


Lainey doubted Nolan would choose love over such significant benefits.


With her resolve renewed, Lainey drove straight to Stewart Group headquarters.


She timed her arrival perfectly, catching Nolan just as he was about to get into his car.


"Nolan," she called, her voice soft and inviting, so different from the composed confidence she showed at the Stewart family's residence.


The moment Nolan laid eyes on her, his expression hardened with open contempt.


He quickly stepped around her, heading for the opposite car door.


Lainey, suddenly desperate, rushed to block his path.


"Nolan!" she called out again, her tone sharpening with impatience. "Remember, I'm the daughter of the Bentons now! With me by your side, we could rule the entire business world!"



She raised her voice, nearly shouting, "What I can give you is something Eleanor could never dream of!She's just an orphan. I surpass her in background,looks, or ability."


She was unable to understand where she had fallen short.When it came to lineage, appearance, or talent, what did Eleanor have that she didn't?



Nolan finally came to a stop. He turned slowly, his gaze freezing cold and impossible to read.


"Are you finished?" he said, his voice low, barely more than a whisper, but each word laced with pure disdain as he took a step closer.


"Let's get one thing straight-we're not friends, so don't act like we are. It's revolting. My relationships aren't any of your business. And one more thing." His tone dropped even further. "If you so much as bother Eleanor again, I'll make sure the Benton family disappears from Elepdon entirely."


The prestige of the Benton family from Breoqua meant nothing to him. Power or no power, they all bowed their heads to him in Elepdon.


Without another glance, Nolan slid into his car and drove off, leaving Lainey standing in the aftermath of his warning.


Had he really threatened her like that? So be it! If Nolan and Eleanor wanted to be her enemies,they would have no one but themselves to blame for what happened next!


A wild, almost unhinged smile stretched across Lainey's lips.


She would see to it that Eleanor's name was dragged through the mud! Nolan would be forced to witness the utter humiliation of the woman he tried so hard to protect!


She would make sure Eleanor never recovered from the disgrace. Everyone would learn firsthand what it meant to stand in her way.


Sitting in her car, Lainey's eyes landed on the event flyer for the upcoming art exhibition at Ashford Gallery.Eleanor's name was listed as an attendee.


Perfect!



Talk about great timing!


An event like that was the ideal stage for a scandal. If something happened there, Eleanor would become the butt of every joke, her reputation shattered in a single night. Fueled by this plan, Lainey pulled out her phone and made a quick, cold call, rattling off a list of orders.


A wicked smile then crept across her face.


There was no way Eleanor had any realartistic ability.She had no idea what was about to hit her.


Driven by her resolve, Lainey paid no heed to the cautions from the Bentons.



It was really Hilda's warning she ignored.


Hilda had told her to stay out of trouble and keep a low profile until the welcome-home banquet.


Hilda worried that Lainey would mistreat her biological daughter behind closed doors.


There was no way she would listen to Hilda. After working so hard to climb into high society, how could she keep it to herself? 
###Chapter  119 What Held You Up





Friday arrived, bringing with it the exclusive event at Ashford Gallery.


A private art show was quietly unfolding,reserved for the city's most prominent elite.



The moment Lainey stepped inside, her eyes landed on Eleanor.



She found Eleanor absorbed in an impressionist canvas, her focus unbroken.


Nolan was nowhere in sight.


Luck seemed to be tipping in Lainey's favor; with Nolan absent, she had free rein to make her move.


With that thought, Lainey accepted a glass of champagne from a passing server and crossed the floor in elegant strides. "Eleanor, what a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect to see you at the gallery tonight."


Eleanor glanced over at the sound of her voice, her expression tightening with recognition. "Hmm."


Paying no mind to Eleanor's cool indifference,Lainey deliberately placed herself right in front of her. "With your reputation in design, I'm sure your art knowledge is just as impressive. Since you seem so taken with this painting, why not tell us what makes it special?"



Her words immediately piqued the curiosity of nearby guests.


Most people there knew Enigma's real story. She was an orphan with a background in clinical studies and finance,with no formal connection to the art world.


Lainey's challenge was thinly veiled, a provocation in plain sight.


Even so, nobody stepped forward to defend Eleanor.


Everyone knew how much the Benton family doted on Lainey; she even walked with bodyguards clearing the way. Crossing her was simply out of the question.


Of course, there were plenty in the crowd who held grudges against Enigma, some still bitter they couldn't get their hands on her designs, all hoping to see her trip up tonight.


One of them chimed in, "That's right. Enigma, you're not going to claim you know nothing, are you? That would be pretty humiliating."


Eleanor let her eyes drift over the group, her tone detached as if watching a circus. "Does Nolan know you're bullying me?"


The room fell instantly silent.


Those who had been eager to see drama quickly lost their nerve, their faces turning pale.


Nolan's very name carried enough weight to make anyone think twice; even the most brazen guests knew better than to cross him.


It was sheer foolishness to pick a fight with Eleanor,especially knowing she was the one Nolan cared for. Lainey's anger flared. How dared this bitch hide behind Nolan's name yet again?


Her grip tightened on her dress as she shot Eleanor a look. "Nolan's own grandfather hasn't even accepted you, but you think it's okay to act all high and mighty just because of him?"


Eleanor just let out a dry laugh, her eyes cold and dismissive as she looked at Lainey. "Nolan? Oh,please. Did he ever say you could call him that?"


Hardly had Eleanor finished speaking when a calm,deep male voice echoed from the entrance. "She's right, I never did."


The once-busy hall fell eerily quiet.


All heads turned toward the doorway.


Nolan stood there, hands tucked casually in his pockets, radiating effortless confidence. His presence commanded attention, as if he owned the room.


Despite her anger, Lainey felt her heart flutter. He was breathtaking. She would do anything to stand by his side, no matter the cost.


She quickly smoothed her hair, arranging her expression into what she hoped was a winning smile,and prepared to step toward him.


But the hopeful look vanished almost instantly.


Nolan strode straight past everyone, not sparing Lainey a single glance. All eyes followed him as he made his way,directly to Eleanor.


Without hesitation, he slipped off his jacket and gently settled it over Eleanor's shoulders.


The gesture caught Eleanor off guard.


She lifted her head to meet his gaze. "What held you up?"


Nolan's expression softened, and a small smile tugged at the corners of his lips. "Sorry. Something came up on the way."


Then, with quiet confidence, he wrapped an arm around her waist and drew her close.
###Chapter  120 You're Certainly In Luck!
Lainey's composure slipped the moment she witnessed Nolan's display.


Unbelievable.


Had Nolan really chosen to humiliate her in front of everyone?


It was one thing to be ignored, but for him to openly show affection for someone else?



He ought to realize she was the only one fit to stand at his side.


And as for Eleanor, she was certain that the woman had done it all on purpose.


That bitch had baited Nolan into making a scene just to put her down.


If that was how they wanted to play, then she had no intention of playing nice! Lainey's eyes hardened, and she made a subtle signal toward the shadows near the gallery's edge.



Almost immediately, a clear male voice echoed through the hall. "Welcome, distinguished guests.I'm Emmett Mendez, your host for today's art event. As a token of gratitude for your presence, the organizers have arranged a small game.


After pausing for a moment, he continued, "Very soon, we'll randomly pick one attendee to interpret a painting of their choice. Should their explanation impress everyone, the guest will get to bring the artwork home-yes, an original worth millions,absolutely free. Of course, there's no penalty if your answer misses the mark. This is all for good fun."



As Emmett finished outlining the rules, an uneasy feeling crept over Eleanor.



Her fears proved right.


A spotlight swept the room and landed directly on her. There was no doubt in her mind.



Lainey was behind this setup.



With practiced sweetness, Lainey congratulated her."Eleanor, you're certainly in luck! Any one of these paintings would be worth a fortune."


Beneath her pleasant tone, she thought, "Let's see you worm your way out of this one,you bitch."


She was dead set on watching Eleanor fall flat on her face tonight, right in front of everyone!


Right then, Emmett soon approached, extending a hand and gesturing toward a specific canvas. "Miss Warren, this way, please."


All eyes turned, and a collective gasp swept the room.



The painting he indicated was pure abstraction.


Splashes of wild color and jagged lines dominated the canvas, and anyone could mistake it for a child's scribble, leaving no clue about the artist's original  intent.



To make matters worse, it was the exhibition's most debated work.



Endless theories had been offered, but no explanation was ever confirmed.


Word was, only the artist knew the real story.


No matter what Eleanor said, there was simply no way to land on the correct answer.


Lainey's trap was perfectly set.



If ever there was a moment for Enigma to stumble, it was now.



Yet Nolan broke the tension in an unexpected way.He leaned down, his voice soft as he looked at Eleanor."Ready to leave?"


Though he phrased it as if she had a choice, there was no room for negotiation in his tone.


Eleanor was his girl. She didn't have to play along with their petty games.


He had her back.



To Nolan's surprise, Eleanor shook her head.


A faint smile played on her lips as she replied with a laid-back, almost teasing rhythm, "That's all right.I actually know exactly what this painting means."


Lainey could barely keep from laughing out loud.


She thought Eleanor was afool,always desperate to keep up appearances, even if it meant embarrassing herself.


Even now, this bitch was boasting?


If the top critics in the field were left scratching their heads, what could an outsider like Eleanor possibly claim to know?



Folding her arms and lifting her chin with a superior air, Lainey sneered, "There's no need to act tough.Just admit you don't know, and people will understand. But if you pretend otherwise, you'll just end up being a laughingstock."


Eleanor looked up, meeting her gaze with a hint of lazy amusement. "Really? Then maybe you'd like to enlighten us. I'd love to hear your interpretation."


The question wiped the smugness right off Lainey's face.


She didn't have any ideal.


If she could interpret the painting, she would have been on that stage herself instead of springing this trap on Eleanor.


This bitch actually had the nerve to flip the whole setup on her!


Unwilling to let herself be cornered, Lainey stiffened and snapped back, "You're the one who was picked,not me."
###Chapter  121 Do Everyone A Favor And Stay Quiet


Eleanor let out a dismissive snort, her gaze brimming with disdain. "If you're clueless, do everyone a favor and stay quiet."

Without sparing Lainey another look, she accepted the microphone from Emmett.

She said, "This piece is called First Light. At first glance, the painter uses warm tones and upward strokes,as if capturing the moment hope breaks through the dark, like sunrise bringing everything back to life."

She went on, "But look deeper, and you'll see the artist hasn't found true peace. He's longing for hope,desperate for strength, but hasn't reached it yet. So he waits, hoping someone will pull him from despair.The painting is titled First Light, but you could just as easily call it Deliverance."

Most guests weren't art experts, and her interpretation left them a bit puzzled.

Still, something in her description rang true. It carried an unexpected depth and elegance, as if it could very well be the artist's intent.

Given that the artwork had no official interpretation, Eleanor's ability to express her insights already put her leagues ahead of nearly everyone in the room.

A wave of tentative applause spread through the crowd.

Still, Lainey refused to let Eleanor baskin the spotlight.

One cold glare from her stopped several guests mid-clap, and they quickly let their hands fal to their sides.

When the clapping faded, Lainey strode over, her expression dripping with scorn. "Unbelievable. Honestly,that's nonsense. This artwork obviously stands for chasing after the light. That's what all the world's top critics have said. How did you manage to spin it-into something so contradictory?"

She moved a step closer and sneered, "You're just pretending to be insightful to steal the spotlight."

Turning toward Nolan, she put on a look of disappointment. "Mr. Stewart, this is who she really is-fake, shallow, and totally unfit for you. Isn't that right, everyone?"

A handful of socialites, still stinging from Lainey's earlier glare, nodded along, afraid to risk crossing her now that she held so much power.

Usually,they were the ones doing the intimidating, but today, Lainey had them under her thumb.

Now that she was the daughter of the Benton family, defying her simply wasn't an option.

Seeing which way the wind was blowing, people in the crowd began to murmur all sorts of unpleasant remarks.

"That's right, Mr. Stewart. Only a woman like Lainey, with her family name and talent, is truly a match for you."

"Miss WVarren, your explanation made no sense to us. Maybe you should just admit you can't do it."

"Exactly. It's only a painting, even if it's worth a fortune; you have more than enough money. Why make a scene over something so trivial?"

That was simply how ruthless this social circle could be.

People always sided with whoever held the most power. In their world, authority determined what was true or right.

But in their rush to please Lainey, they seemed to forget one crucial fact that Nolan, the embodiment of true power,was seeing Eleanor.

A coldness crept into Nolan's eyes, his earlier warmth vanishing. He spoke, his words razor-sharp. "Trying to bully my girl while I'm here?"

The same socialites who had just echoed Lainey's words turned ghostly pale.

Nolan was Eleanor's boyfriend.

If he held resentment at what they said, it wouldn't just be themselves, but their entire families could suffer as well. Crossing the Stewart family was unthinkable, yet offending the Benton family carried its own risks. They were trapped between two giants.

Just as the tension became unbearable, a male voice with a hint of a foreign accent rang out from the entrance. "And who dares to bully others in my place?"
###Chapter  122 Your Boyfriend Is Far Too Intimidating


A murmur swept through the crowd as heads turned toward the source of the voice.

Striding toward them with an easygoing attitude, a blond man in a bright floral shirt and slipped his hands into his pockets.

Everyone quickly recognized him as Stephen Rowe, the celebrated host of the evening and the internationally acclaimed artist responsible for First Light.

Spotting a new chance to seize the spotlight, Lainey wasted no time replacing her furious look by a soft,almost fragile one as she hurried over to welcome him.

From several paces away, she jabbed her finger in Eleanor's direction and called out, "Mr. Rowe, you got here at the perfect moment! That's the one! She's the troublemaker. She's been making a scene at your event, hiding behind her boyfriend's status. During the interactive game, she trashed your artwork and made everyone else pretend to agree with her just because her boyfriend is influential."

Her entire story was a convincing show, cleverly twisting the facts to fit her own agenda.

Most of the other socialitês watched her performance with disbelief, but no one dared to intervene.

Stephen's expression darkened, his brows knitting together as clear distaste flashed across his features.

He had no patience for people who threw their weight around. To him, that was the ultimate disrespect to his art.

"I want to hear what she has to say," Stephen replied.

Hearing this, Lainey could barely contain her excitement.

She was certain Stephen, with his refined taste, would have nothing but contempt for Eleanor,whom he considered shallow and shallow.

Eager to drive her point, Lainey dramatically retold everything Eleanor had said before, blowing every detail out of proportion.

Lainey wasted no time twisting the story. "You know what she said? According to her, your painting ought to be called Deliverance, because apparently, you're just sitting around hoping for redemption."

She punctuated her words with a mocking laugh. "Honestly, can you believe it? It's ridiculous! Anyone with sense knows your artwork celebrates new beginnings, the beauty of the sunrise, and a fresh start."

Intent on dragging Eleanor's name through the mud, Lainey remained unaware of the shift in Stephen's expression, his eyes shining brighter with every word. He looked as if he had discovered a soulmate at last.

The second Lainey finished and thrown a smug glance Eleanor's way, Stephen raced across the room toward Eleanor, nearly tripping over himself in excitement. "Incredible! You, my dear, are the first person who's ever truly grasped the meaning behind my art!"

Years of searching had led him to this moment, a genuine connection with someone who saw straight to his soul.

When he saw this unfold, Nolan's expression turned thunderous.

Moving without hesitation, he wrapped his arm protectively around Eleanor, holding her close as he fixed Stephen with a glare as cold as ice.

He spoke with a quiet warning in his voice. "I'd appreciate it if you showed a little more respect."

With a flair for theatrics, Stephen pressed a hand to his heart, feigning deep distress. His vivid blue eyes practically shimmered with a sense of betrayal. "Miss Warren, I'm absolutely devastated. Your boyfriend is far too intimidating."

Nolan's scowl only deepened.

What a sly piece of work!

Eleanor refused to let anyone stain Nolan's image.

Gently slipping from Nolan's hold, she offered Stephen a measured, courteous smile. "Please don't take offense, Mr.Rowe. My boyfriend's only looking out for me, and he meant no harm. As for your idea that l understand you, but I wouldn't go that far. I just gave my interpretation of what you tried to express on canvas. There's really no reason to make such a big deal of it."

Her message was unmistakable-there was no special bond, and he ought to keep his distance.

Stephen looked even more crestfallen at her response, but he straightened up and, with artistic grace,dipped into a formal bow. "As you wish, Miss Warren. Still, if you two ever split up, let me be the first to know.I'll be here waiting."

A storm brewed in Nolan's gaze, and it looked like he wás just a moment away from snapping.

Noticing his growing irritation, Eleanor squeezed his hand gently, then turned to Stephen and politely shut him down. "Thank you for the flattery, but that's never going to happen."

The entire room fell into stunned silence.

Nobody had expected Eleanor to have such a genuine understanding of art, let alone be the first to decode its true meaning!

It became clear that Eleanor's appreciation surpassed that of even the so-called internationally renowned experts.

Did Lainey even bother to do her homework before launching her little scheme?

All she had really done was set herself up as the punchline.

Absolutely nothing had gone according to Lainey's plan.

Regret hit her so hard it felt like a punch to the gut!

She had shown up hoping to humiliate Eleanor, not hand her the spotlight.

What a nightmare!

It was almost unbearable for her to accept!

"Eleanor,you infuriating bitch! Just you wait! One day, you'll regret ever crossing me!" Cursing Eleanor under her breath, Lainey simmered with rage. She wouldd remember every humiliating second of this disaster.

When she finally took control of the Benton family, Eleanor would be the first on her list!

She would see to it that Eleanor never had another chance to shine!
###Chapter  123 You Owe Me Big Time!


Eleanor genuinely couldn't understand the depths of Lainey's resentment.

Truthfully, it made no difference to her.

Lainey's tricks were unimaginative and predictable, never leaving any real mark.

Once Eleanor left the gallery and slid into the car, Nolan's low voice cut through the silence. "Eleanor, I want you to know that I like you just for being yourself. Nothing else matters to me."

The message was clear: no matter how impressive someone else seemed, he had no interest in a relationship built on convenience.

But what urged him to suddenly say this?

Eleanor, a little caught off guard, looked at him and asked what he meant.

Picking up on her confusion, Nolan hesitated before replying, his voice laced with tension, "Lainey has been reaching out to both my grandfather and to me over the last few days."

A trace of nervousness appeared as he rushed to add, "I didn't give her the time of day,you know."

Watching him scramble to set the record straight, Eleanor couldn't hold back a grin. "Nolan, you're really setting the boyfriend standard high right now."

Rather than easing up, Nolan tugged her closer, sounding both possessive and jealous. "I'm completely yours, so don't go giving anyone else a second thought."

Well,well. This man was still sulking over Stephen's stunt from earlier.

With a playful glint in her eye, Eleanor straightened up and planted a soft kiss on Nolan's chin. "Don't worry.There's nobody out there who could ever measure up to you."

Nolan lit up at her words, a wide grin spreading across his face. Meanwhile, Erick, stuck behind the wheel, was practically drowning in their sweetness.

The whole display was almost too much for a single guy to handle.

Unable to hold back, he sneakily pulled out his phone and fired off a text. "Mr. Brooks, rescue me! Mr.Stewart and his girlfriend drown me in romance! These two are way too lovey-dovey for me to handle!"

While Ryland was effortlessly sinking shots at the billiards table in the club, he glanced at his phone and raised an eyebrow at the odd message.

Hmm?

Lovey-dovey?

Was Erick really talking about Nolan and Eleanor?

Honestly, Ryland had no intention of getting involved in that mess.

For a guy like Nolan, the famous lifelong bachelor, falling for someone was monumental, and now that he had, nothing was going to stand in his way.

Ryland knew better than to interfere with something like that.

Erick just had to live with it.1

Decades of bachelorhood should have taught him to endure, but maybe being around all this romance would finally rub off on him, or better yet, give him a shot at finding someone special.

Shrugging off the text, Ryland tossed his phone aside and got back to his game, not bothering to reply.

That left Erick staring at his silent screen, feeling even more left out.

Seeing the lack of response, Erick realized even his single buddy had left him to fend for himself.

Unbelievable!

Was everyone just out to torment the single these days?

Forget pride. As soon as he got some time off, he would sign up for a blind date, no questions asked!

There was nothing embarrassing about it.

What really stung was being single for this long!

Frustration all over his face, Erick grumbled to himself, completely unnoticed by the happy couple in the backseat.

Eleanor got right back to her usual grind after thé art exhibition, splitting her time between her studio and her home, barely making room for any social interaction in her schedule.

And of course, there wasn't a spare moment left for sweet moments with Nolan.

Only by Sunday afternoon did she finally put the finishing touches on the gowns and pass them along to Besty.

As soon as Besty left, Eleanor dropped onto the couch and started sorting through her mountain of unread messages.

Nolan, as always, had sent his usual flood of texts, check-ins, reminders, and his whole daily schedule.

Lillian had sent even more messages than Nolan.

Eleanor had to swipe up several times just to get back to the start of their chat.

The most recent message had popped up only a few minutes earlier.

"Eleanor! If you keep ignoring me, I'll think you've been kidnapped!" The threat was followed by a row of bloody knife emojis.

First, Eleanor fired off a quick apology emoji to Nolan, letting him know she had just finished her workload,then she set out for the Brooks family's estate.

The moment her car rolled up to the Brooks' estate, someone burst out of the front entrance at full.speed.

"You heartless woman! About time you showed your face!" Lillian threw her arms around Eleanor in an exaggerated display of being hurt. "You swore we'd go shopping, and then you ghosted me. You owe me big time!"

Eleanor, torn between laughing and rolling her eyes, let Lillian squeeze her tight. "Fine, I'Il make it up to you however you want. The truth is, I've been busy making two gowns and couldn't step away for even a minute."

The second her friend brought up work, Lillian let go instantly. "Gowns? You took another custom order?"

"$60 million! Straight from Lainey," Eleanor replied.

Lillianglared in amazement. "You've gotta be kidding! Most people would have snapped. Sometimes I think you're some sort of angel, always forgiving and never asking for anything in return."

Suddenly,she snapped her fingers and grinned. "Hold on, there's still one thing you want, isn't there?"

Eleanor couldn't help but laugh, gently flicking Lillian on the forehead. "Come on, enough with the teasing.
Seriously,are you really planning to show up to Lainey's welcome-home party tomorrow?"

Lillian lifted her chin, looking determined."Obviously, I'm going! And you're going with me."

Eleanor nodded in agreement.

Missing the event wasn't even an option in Lillian's mind. If she showed up, maybe she could take some of the heat off Eleanor and give Lainey something else to focus on.

Otherwise,Lainey would make Eleanor her sole target.

With Nolan or not, that didn't sit right with her.

When it came to dealing with drama, relying on men was pointless.

Sometimes she had to handle things yourself!
###Chapter  124 Nolan's Not Here To Protect You Today


Eleanor hadn't expected that she would end up standing Lillian up once more.

Right before she was about to head to the Benton family's party, a call came through with news that Sallie was in critical condition.

Though Eleanor no longer owed the Todd family anything, she could never ignore Sallie.

The woman had once been warm and kind to her. That debt was one she couldn't forget.

With a short sigh, Eleanor typed out a quick message to Lillian, saying, "Sorry, something urgent came up.I can't make it."

Then, without waiting for a reply, she flagged down a cab and rushed straight to the Todd family'sestate.

The house was unnervingly quiet when she arrived.

Not a single Todd family member in sight.

Today was Lainey's grand recognition banquet, so everyone would be busy fawning over her.

That suited Eleanor just fine.

Fewer questions, fewer complications.

She slipped into Sallie's room, where several maids stood crowding the bedside. "Leave us. I'll handle it from here."

The women exchanged looks, but knowing how generous Eleanor had always been, they obeyed and filed out.

Eleanor pulled a chair to the bedside and carefully examined Sallie.

Her pulse was weak, her breathing faint, and her body so frail it was almost translucent. Eleanor's chest tightened. Sallie's heart was failing, and the anger she had recently suffered had pushed her to the brink.

Eleanor could guess the source of that fury.

Jonny. Or Lainey. Likely both.

But that was Todd's family business. She had no place in their quarrels.

All she could do was fulfill her duty as a doctor, and give Sallie more time, however little that might be.

With a quiet breath, she pulled her special kit from her bag and set to work.

An hour later, the treatment was done.

Eleanor tidied her tools and stepped out into the crisp evening air, only to nearly collide with someone at the entrance.It was Jonny.

He had been sulking ever since Lainey ordered him to stay awayfrom the banquet. But the moment he spotted Eleanor, his simmering anger twisted into something darker, more possessive.

His eyes lit up with a dangerous gleam. "So that's it," he sneered. "You knew everyone would be gone, so you came here to find me?"

Guess she couldn't live without him.

His eyes roamed over her with unrestrained arrogance. "Come on, let's go upstairs. The banquet won't be over for hours. We'll have plenty of time."

He reached for her, already imagining her giving in.

But Eleanor shifted just enough that his hand sliced through empty air. Her voice was ice. "Scram."

Her rejection made his blood boil. He clenched his fists, fury twisting his features. "Oh, come on. You came here yourself, now stop acting so pure! I'm telling you, Eleanor, don't reject a good thing and regret it later!Nolan's not here to protect you today. No one is. And I will have you, whether you want it or not!"

With that, he lunged straight at her. Damn it.

Lainey hadn't let him touch her in weeks, and he didn't dare find another woman.

HHis restraint had worn thin, and he was determined to take Eleanor by force.

But he seemed to have forgotten that Eleanor, after the divorce, was no longer the docile woman he once knew.

Her hand flicked with precise speed, and in an instant, needles slipped into his body at vital points.

Jonny froze on the spot, his limbs refusing to obey him. Shock spread across his face. "What? What did you do? Some kind of trick?"

His voice cracked.

Three years of marriage, and he had never known she possessed such terrifying skill.

Eleanor didn't bother explaining.

She retrieved her needles with practiced calm and turned away, not sparing him another glance.
"Remember this, Jonny. Next time you see me, walk the other way. Or you'll end up exactly like this again."

Without another look, she walked past him, leaving him paralyzed and seething.

"Damn you, Eleanor!" Jonny roared after her.

He stumbled to the ground, helpless fury burning in his chest.

That woman, once obsessed with him, was now colder than a stranger.

And Lainey?

She hadn't even let him attend the banquet, claiming the Bentons would disapprove.

In truth, she was embarrassed by him, thinking he wasn't worthy.

His pride writhed in humiliation. He was Jonny Todd, the CEO of a listed company! Maybe not Nolan, but still a man of status.

How dared they look down on him?

Gritting his teeth, he swore under his breath. Someday, both women would crawl back to him. He would make them pay, make them beg, and restore his dignity as a man.

When the paralysis finally wore off, he dragged himself into the house, only to learn the truth that Eleanor hadn't come looking for him at all.

She had come to visit Sallie, who miraculously stabilized after her departure.

Jonny clenched his fists, remembering the precision of those needles and the calm confidence in her hands.

Who was Eleanor,really?

What else was she hiding?

But he shoved the thought away.

It didn't matter who she was.

In the end, she would always be his woman, someone he could discard at will.

A cold light flashed in his eyes as he pulled out his phone. "Did you get what I asked for?"

The man on the other end let out a lazy chuckle. "Rare stuff like that doesn't just fall into your lap. Be patient."

With that, the line went dead.

Jonny exhaled, seething.

He then calmed down. He had time. For now, he would keep Lainey appeased. But soon... soon, Eleanor would learn exactly what it meant to be under his control.
###Chapter  125 Isn't Having A Husband Enough For You


With so many eyes and ears around, it didn't take long for word of what happened at the Todd famnily's villa to reach Lainey.

Instead of being upset, she felt a rush of excitement.

If Jonny patched things up with Eleanor, that meant Nolan would be single, and all hers! Trading someone useless for a real catch felt like the ultimate win!

So, when she spotted Nolan's tall frame making his way into the banquet hall alone, her spirits soared.

Holding up the elegant skirt of her designer dress, she strutted toward him. "Nolan!"

Nolan was already in a foul mood after being ditched by Eleanor, and seeing Lainey, queen of manipulation,only made things worse, with his scowl deepening.

Without a word, he stepped aside, making sure to steer clear of her path.

Right then, Lainey stumbled, completely losing her balance, and ended up sprawled awkwardly on the floor.

Guests nearby let out a few stifled laughs, unable to hide their amusement, though none dared to do it openly.

Lillian, on the other hand, didn't bother hiding her reaction.

With arms folded and an unimpressed look, she scoffed, "Well, if it isn't the star of the evening. What's wrong, Lainey? Isn't having a husband enough for you? Or are you so desperate that you have to chase after someone else's boyfriend just because his girIfriend isn't here? That's downright disgraceful!"

Her blunt words left Lainey completely exposed, her pride shattered in front of everyone.

Rage burned inside Lainey.

She,however, had changed. Gone was the version of the timid girl from before. In the past, she would have been forced to swallow Lillian's insults.

Now, as the Benton family's only daughter, why should she tolerate any of this?

Her gaze grew cold, and she braced herself to fire back, until she caught sight of Jeff and Hilda making their way over.

Immediately, all traces of anger disappeared.

Tears welled up in her eyes, and she let them spill over."Ms. Brooks, I know you've never been fond of me.But today marks my official return to my family. Even if you can't stand me, did you really have to humiliate me in front of everyone?"

Just as her voice broke, Jeff arrived by her side.

Spotting his daughter looking utterly defeated, he rushed to help her up, worry written all over his face."Sweetheart, what's going on?"

Trying to keep her composure, Lainey wiped her tears and forced a gentle smile. "Dad, really, it's nothing.1don't blame Ms. Brooks for anything. I'm probably just difficult to be liked. Please, don't take it out on her."

Seeing Lainey's gentle nature on display, willing to defend the very person who had hurt he, even after being humiliated, Jeff felt a surge of pride and frustration. Her patience was admirable, but in his eyes,nobody had the right to mistreat his beloved daughter this way.

Jeff gave Lainey's hand a reassuring squeeze and let out a weary sigh. "You're far too forgivingfor your own good. You can't just let others treat you however they want."

Hilda, on the other hand, barely glanced at Lainey. Her gaze remained locked on Lillian,her expression soft yet unreadable.

Was Lainey targeting this girl?

Did she dislike her for some reason?

Maybe there was something more to it... But after she watched Lillian closely for a while, Hilda's hope faded. She didn't resemble her at all.

This wasn't the child she had lost.

Even all grown up, her own daughter would still look like her.

Lillian shifted uncomfortably under Hilda's intense gaze.

When Lillian finally got a good look at Hilda's face, she grew even more confused.

Seriously?

Wasn't this Lainey's birth mother?

How could she resemble Eleanor so much?

The resemblance wasn't exact, but their eyes were uncannily similar.
###Chapter  126 | Won't Let Anyone Wrong You


How could that even be true?

It had to be some sort of mistake.

Eleanor was an orphan, and not only that, she had always been such a kind and admirable person. How could she possibly have parents like that?

At that thought, Lillian's temper flared. Her spine straightened, and with both hands planted on her waist like an angry lioness ready to pounce, she snapped, "What are you all glaring at me for? Let me make this clear! I didn't lay a single finger on your precious daughter. She's the one who crossed the line,trying to flirt with my friend's boyfriend. When she couldn't succeed, she tripped on her own! If you don't take my word for it, ask anyone who was standing nearby."

Lainey already had a husband.

The accusation was so absurd that Jeff could hardly believe it.

His face grew dark, his presence suddenly sharp and commanding, making those around him feel small."Nonsense! Out of respect for the old ties between our families, I'll overlook this matter today. But if anything like this happens again...

He paused for a moment before continuing,"Don't expect us to be polite! Our family may not be based here, but we won't be stepped on by just anyone!"

Benton family? Big deal!

Lillian had never been humiliated like this before.

She was about to argue again when Ryland quickly covered her mouth. Holding her close, he spoke softly."Lillian, calm down. The Benton family isn't easy to deal with. We can't create problems for Nolan."

If the Bentons turned against the Brooks family, Nolan would be forced to step in, and he didn't want things to reach that point.

Lillian's fire faded all at once. Her shoulders slumped, and her eyes stung with frustrated tears.

Lainey, on the other hand, caught the scene from the corner of her eye and smirked proudly.

Look at Lillian now... so powerless.

If not for the need to act innocent in front of the Bentons, Lillian would havebeen finished today.

Lucky her.

The situation seemed ready to settle when suddenly, a calm and clear voice cut through the air."What if|said I can prove it?"

Jeff blinked, thinking he misheard. But then Nolan raised his eyes, calm and cold, and said with complete seriousness, "Mr. Benton, please keep your daughter away from me. I already have a girlfriend, and I don't want her to get the wrong idea."

With those words, he gave Ryland a meaningful glance before walking away with his usual composed grace.

Ryland caught on right away and hurriedly pulled the still-fuming Lillian along.

Jeff,however,stood frozen.

He had watched Nolan grow up, and Nolan wasn't the type to throw accusations around recklessly.

Did Lainey really have a crush on him?

But she was already married...

The thought only deepened Jeff's confusion.

Sensing his wavering, Lainey wasted no time: She collapsed into his arms, with tears streaming down her face.

"Dad, you have to believe me. I never did anything wrong. I only admired Nolan and wanted to learn from him. I didn't think he'd twist things like this. But I should've known... he's close with the Brooks siblings. They've always hated me because of their family's power. They used to pick on me constantly. How could Nolan ever see me kindly? I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't mean to bring shame on you."

Every word was carefully chosen, and it hit its mark.

Jeff's chest tightened, and sternness melted away as he held her tighter."Don't cry, sweetheart. I'll protect you.Iwon't let anyone wrong you."

From the side, Hilda watched silently, her gaze cold.

Lainey was no ordinary girl; she knew exactly how to twist emotions, how to win Jeff's trust with just a few tears. And it was working.

But Hilda didn't speak up for the time being.

Someone in the Benton family needed to play along, to let Lainey think she was safe. That was the only way not to scare her off.

And when the time was right, Hilda would finally uncover the truth. She would find her real daughter.
###Chapter  127 Can't | Stay Over


Lillian hurried after Nolan once they left the Benton family's estate, flashing him a big thumbs-up.

"Nolan,that was incredible. Eleanor really knew what she was doing when she chose you."

Nolan shot her a sideways glance, his expression flat and unreadable.

He didn't say a word, but the tension radiating off him was obvious.

Ryland, quick to catch on, tugged Lillian back before she could ramble on and make things worse.

Nolan slid into the car by himself, though he didn't immediately tell the driver where to go.

It wasn't anger holding him back, but it was the thoughts running through his head.

Before, he had only noticed that Eleanor and Hilda carried the same kind of presence.

But after he saw Hilda up close at the banquet, the resemblance was unmistakable. They didn't just feel alike-they looked alike too.

Eleanor had grown up in an orphanage.The Benton family had lost a daughter.

Could it be...

A daring thought began to take shape.

His eyes lifted to Erick in the driver's seat. His voice was calm but carried weight. "Dig into the Benton couple's background. And I want every detail about their missing daughter."

Erick was taken aback. "But Mr. Stewart, hasn't their daughter already been found?"

Nolan's gaze flicked up to the rearview mirror, sharp and cold.

Erick instantly shut his mouth. "Yes, sir," Erick quickly corrected, not daring to probe further. "Where would you like to go now?"

Nolan didn't bother answering. One look was enough, and Erick understood immediately.

Minutes later, the car rolled to a stop in front of Eleanor's apartment.

Nolan's expression had softened just slightly, and Erick mentally applauded himself for reading the situation right.

When Nolan walked in, Eleanor had just gotten home too.

She had just washed up and changed into something comfortable. Seeing him there, she looked a little surprised and asked, "What brings you here?"

He stepped inside without hesitation and closed the door behind him.

His eyes settled on her, and in a low voice that carried a hint of teasing complaint, he said, "I was tempted again...but | resisted."

Eleanor couldn't help but laugh at his dramatics."Congratulations, you passed the test of gentlemanly restraint."

But Nolan wasn't after verbal praise.

He leaned closer, tilting down until his breath brushed against her cheek. His tone was soft, yet full of intent."Then,what about my reward?"

Eleanor immediately caught his meaning.

Arching a brow, she rose on her toes and brushed a light kiss across his forehead.

For a split second, Nolan forgot to breathe. Up close, her face blurred with the memory of Hilda's. The resemblance was uncanny, unsettling even.

After a moment of silence, he finallysaid, "At the banquet, I saw Mrs. Benton. She looks a lot like you."

Eleanor waved it off, casually handing him a bottle of water. "Lillian already mentioned it. But lookalikes aren't that rare. And the Benton family/isn't careless. They must have verified everything before accepting Lainey back."

Her voice softened, carrying a trace of irony. "When Myah found me, she told me there was a note tucked in my swaddle. It said my parents were gone. So no matter the resemblance, it doesn't matter.It can't be."

Nolan studied her quietly, the weight in his gaze unspoken. He didn't argue. Instead, he hummed a faint acknowledgment.

Still, in his mind, the possibility lingered. This wasn't something he could just let go.

Eleanor, unwilling to dwell on it, turned toward her study. "Enough of that. I've got work. You should head back."

But Nolan leaned against the doorway, unbothered. "Can't I stay over?"

She spun around, and ushered him out with a calm but absolute′′no.′′

The door locked behind him with a decisive click. Inside, Eleanor's phone buzzed nonstop with orders.Demand for the pills on the Underground Network was surging again.

She had to get another batch ready quickly.

Money mattered more than anything.

Men could wait. Orphans depending on her couldn't.

Nolan, oblivious to her real concerns, didn't take offense.

That kiss alone was more than he expected tonight.

He left with a faint smile tugging at his lips.

Erick caught sight of it in the rearview mirror and nearly choked.

Was this really the same cold, ruthless Nolan Stewart?

He almost wanted to rub his eyes to make sure he wasn't seeing things.

Of course, Erick kept his mouth shut and started the engine, playing the silent chauffeur. But inside, he was groaning.

Working for Nolan had never been easy, but working for a Nolan smitten with love? Now that was brutal.
###Chapter  128 | Was Just Fooling You


Nolan and the Brooks siblings' departure barely made a dent in the atmosphere of the party

The welcome-home banquet wrapped up successfully shortly after.

Lainey stepped back into the room, carefully arranged by the Benton couple, still feeling like she was living in a dream.

She stretched out on the plush bed, her eyes tracing the gleaming crystal chandelier above her, unable to hide the smile creeping onto her face.

Today marked the start of a new ###Chapter . She was now the sole daughter of the Benton family, and no one would dare cross her.

Her next mission?

To win Nolan away from Eleanor.Once that was done, her life would be nothing short of success and luxury.

She couldn't help but laugh out loud at the thought.

The sound of her own laughter was interrupted when her phone buzzed with an anonymous message. "Now that the recognition banquet is done, where are my shares?"

The smile on Lainey's face vanished instantly.

Not long ago, the threat of Horace exposing her secrets had terrified her.

But now, with Jeff standing firmly behind her, how could a simple video ever shake his confidence in her?

The demand was still open for negotiation, considering that five percent was clearly excessive.

She composed her reply, but the response came almost immediately. "No way. Pay up the 5% like we agreed, or you know what's coming!"

With a fierce determination in her eyes, Lainey fixed her gaze on the screen. If Horace was so stubborn, she wouldn't hesitate to act.

Contracts could be manipulated, just like her own identity, with blurred lines between what was real and what was fabricated.

Who could truly tell the difference?

With her decision settled, Lainey stood and headed downstairs.

In the living room, Jeff and Hilda were sitting on the couch, watching TV.

When he saw her, Jeff looked up with concern. "Baby, it's so late.Where are you headed?"

With a warm, charming smile, Lainey replied in a gentle tone, "A friend invited me to celebrate, and I couldn't say no."

Without a second thought, Jeff instructed the driver to get the car ready.

After stopping by the law firm, Lainey placed a contract, which held no legal weight, at the designated spot.

Once that was done, Lainey returned to the Benton family's home, feeling a sense of relief wash over her.

Her plan was to wait for the right moment to deal with Horace. Once that was handled, nothing would stand in her way.

As for Eleanor, she would never know that the Bentons were her real parents.

What Lainey didn't know was that Hilda doubted that she was her own flesh and blood.

Lainey reveled in her newfound wealth, her ego swelling every day.

Within a matter of days, she had gathered more than ten designer bags, and her wardrobe was now stocked with the latest high-fashion pieces.

She hadn't bothered to visit the Todd family once.

Jonny,growing more anxious by the day, finally decided he couldn't wait any longer.

Feeling a nagging unease, he drove directly to the Benton family's villa. Relaxing on the sofa with a face mask after her beauty treatment, Lainey shot him an impatient look. "What are you doing here?" she asked.

The look in her eyes didn't escape Jonny's notice.

Gritting his teeth, he stared at her. "You're my wife. You've been gone for days. Don't you think you owe me an explanation?"

Lainey erupted into laughter, sitting up straight. "An explanation? What are you even talking about? Don't tell me you actually thought I would have my dad invest in your firm?"

Her laughter echoed as she removed the mask, revealing a face that was both beautiful and dripping with mockery. "I was just fooling you."
###Chapter  129 | Can Explain


Lainey rose to her feet, regarding Jonny with a scornful glare.

"Do you even realize the gap between us now?" she taunted. "The sooner you divorce me, the better. If I'm in a good mood, I might even convince my parents to throw a little money into your failing company.But if you keep dragging this on, don't expect a single cent."

Her words cut sharp, and her eyes carried the same contempt one might reserve for a beggar on the street.

Jonny had never been humiliated like this in his life, least of all by the woman he had married.

His whole body trembled with fury until he snapped, grabbing her by the throat. His voice was hoarse with rage. "Lainey, you bitch! I gave up Eleanor for you! I gave you everything you wanted, and this is how you repay me?"

Lainey gasped, choking for air.

She hit his arms with all the strength she had, but it did nothing. The tight grip left her gasping, the air leaving her lungs.

Just when the suffocating pressure seemed unbearable, a voice thundered from the doorway."Let her go!"

Jeff had returned home, and the sight before him sent flames of fury through his eyes. Without hesitation,he charged forward and slammed his foot into Jonny's chest, knocking him to the floor.

Lainey crumpled,coughing violently as she clutched at her throat.

When she finally managed to breathe, her voice cracked with urgency. "Dad! I want a divorce! I can't stay with him anymore. I want a divorce!"

There was no room for hesitation.
 
If she delayed, Jonny might actually kill her one day. He was a lunatic.

Jonny, shocked back into his senses at Jeff's presence, scrambled to defend himself. "Mr. Benton, no, Jeff,listen to me, I can explain, I-"

His words were cut short when Jeff's fist slammed into his face, knocking the air from his lungs and leaving him doubled over in pain.

Jeff didn't spare him another glance. He bellowed for the security guards at the entrance, and within moments, Jonny was dragged out like trash.

Lainey flung herself into Jeff's arms, sobbing as though her whole world had crumbled."Dad, you saw it yourself! This is how he treats me. Life with him has been nothing but misery..."

She poured everything out in a torrent of tears, stretching and twisting every detail, turning Jonny into the very image of a heartless villain.

Jeff's chest tightened as he listened, his eyes catching the angry red marks circling her neck. The sight pierced him.

His precious daughter was hurt like this, all because of a man who didn't deserve her.

He pulled her close and gently patted her back. "Don't cry, sweetheart. It's my fault for letting you go through this. This marriage ends here. I'll make sure you walk away from it."

Lainey pressed her face into his chest, letting tears roll down her cheeks. Yet, hidden from his view, a victorious smile curled at the edges of her lips.

Jonny was finally out of the picture.

Next came Nolan. Soon, he would be hers.

Outside, Jonny stood before the imposing Benton family's villa.

Was this truly the same Lainey he had known? The woman who once smiled softly, yielded easily, and never raised her voice? But now she was cold, sharp, and calculating.

Or perhaps she had always been this way, and he had been too blind to see it.

Regret crashed over him. He should never have left Eleanor for her.

Eleanor might not have had Lainey's status, but she was Enigma and she had been warm, kind, and sincere.
If he were still with Eleanor, the Todd Group wouldn't be teetering on the edge of collapse.

It was clear now.

Back then, if Todd Group had faced ruin, Eleanor would have stood by him. She would have fought for him,even if it meant saving the company with everything she had. But that was years ago, and time couldn't be rewound.

Eleanor was gone from his life, and there was no going back.

She had only married him out of gratitude, and their debt to each other was already repaid.

Yet deep down, he refused to accept it.

He clung to the fragile hope that if he admitted his mistakes, if he really begged forgiveness, Eleanor might give him another chance.

After all, she had once loved him.

With that desperate thought driving him, he stumbled home.

There was still one person who might help-Sallie. Eleanor always listened to her.

If Sallie spoke on his behalf, maybe, just maybe, she would come back.
###Chapter  130 You Lost Your Chance


Jonny's mind was set as he marched off in search of Sallie.

The moment he finished speaking, Sallie's fury erupted. Her entire body shook as she pointed at him,scolding loudly, "Now you want Eleanor back? Tell me, what about those three years you spent treating her like nothing more than a servat and someone to blame? You only see her value now that Lainey wants nothing to do with you?"

Locking eye with him, she continued, "Jonny, listen closely. You lost your chance. Eleanor deserved better,and you let her slip away!"

He hadn't come for a lecture. He wanted help, not accusations.

Annoyance surged inside him.

How could it be his fault?

What crime had he committed?

Lainey was the one who tricked him!

It felt so unfair.

He just wanted to go back to how things were before; surely, there was nothing wrong with that.

He didn't believe he was at fault.

With a glare that could cut through steel, he spat back, his words cold and biting, "I'm your own grandson. If you won't take my side, then go ahead and stand with everyone else!"

Jonny spun around and stormed off, not sparing another look at Sallie, who sat there nearly shaking with rage.

The maids rushed to Sallie's side, helping her with calming medicine and a glass of water, working for a while before she finally calmed down.

None of the other Todds bothered to care.

From the corner, Emma watched the scene unfold.

How could that possibly be true?

Was Lainey really the type to walk away from Jonny?

More likely, Jonny had gone too far and pushed Lainey past her limit.

That explanation made sense.

Even though she tried to brace herself, Emma's nerves refused to settle. In the end, she grabbed her bag and hurried out the door, determined to find Lainey and figure out what was really happening.

But when Emma made it to the Benton family's home, the guard blocked her way. "I'm sorry, Miss Todd. Mr.Benton's orders are clear. No visitors from the Todd family are allowed inside."

That left Emma standing there, completely taken aback. "How can that be? Lainey is my sister-in-law.She cares about me. If you just tell her I'm here, she'll come out for sure."

She didn't have a single doubt in her mind.

But the guard repeated his message without a trace of emotion, "Apologies, Miss Todd."

Anger and frustration flooded her.

This useless guard!

Once she met up with Lainey, she would see to it that he lost his job.

Lainey always looked out for her; there was no way she would refuse to see her.

And Jonny, why did he always have to upset Lainey?

Because of him, her own parents were furious, and now she was stuck right in the middle. Right then, a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up to the gate.

Lainey stepped out, dressed in head-to-toe designer clothes.

Emma couldn't help but marvel.

Lainey looked so elegant and so wealthy.

She rushed over, waving excitedly. "Lainey!"

Catching sight of her, Lainey gave a discreet roll of her eyes.

Anything connected to the Todd family left her feeling nothing but shame.

Still, Lainey understood Emma's nature far too well.

Acting rashly would only invite more headaches.

It made more sense to stir things up and distract her.

With this approach, she could keep Emma busy and at the same time unsettle Eleanor, a win on both fronts.

Putting on a sorrowful expression, Lainey softened her eyes and let her voice tremble slightly. "Emma, I don't think I can be your sister-in-law anymore. Jonny... he still can't let go of Eleanor. He told me he never cared about me, that I was just convenient for him. He even grabbed me by the neck right in front of my parents, all because of Eleanor. That's why my parents are so upset."

As she finished, Lainey pulled her collar aside to reveal a mark on her neck.

One glance was all it took for Emma to buy the whole story. She had suspected all along that Eleanor was to blame for this mess.

"Lainey, don't cry! Jonny's just not thinking straight right now. I promise, I won't let Eleanor off!"

###Chapter  131 Use Your Head Before You Act


Emma had no idea she was being strung along like a puppet.

Fuming, she stormed into the Enigma store, her heels clicking like gunfire across the polished floor.

As luck would have it, Eleanor was inside, quietly going over the accounts. Emma wasted no time. She marched straight over and blocked her path.

"Eleanor!" she shouted, her voice trembling with rage. "You shameless bitch! Can't rely on your own abilities, so you seduce someone else's husband instead?"

Eleanor blinked, utterly baffled by the sudden outburst.

Her lips curved in the faintest trace of irony as she lifted her gaze to Emma."Tell me,"she asked mildly,"who do you think is more impressive? Your brother, or Nolan?"

The question caught Emma off guard. She was crazy about Nolan. Of course, she thought he was better than her own brother. But admitting it was out of the question.

"You!" she sputtered, scrambling for words. "You're despicable! Whether it's my brother or Nolan, you've lured them in. Otherwise, why on earth would they be drawn to you?"

Eleanor had met plenty of unreasonable people before, but Emma was in a league of her own.

She couldn't decide if she should sigh in helplessness or feel a bit of pity.

With a small chuckle, she said in a steady tone, "Use your head before you act. Don't let yourself get played like a pawn without even noticing."

Emma barely registered the warning.

What stuck like a thorn was that Eleanor had implied she wasn't thinking at all.

Her temper snapped. "Don't be so smug! Nolan isn't serious about you! A woman like you,raised without proper upbringing, how could he ever seriously want you?"

The insult rolled off Eleanor like water off stone. She stayed composed, her voice cool. "And yet, you think Nolan would want you? Security, please see her out."

There was no point in trading barbs with someone like her. It was simply a waste of energy.

Emma balked when two burly security guards began walking over. Her bravado shriveled, and she backed away, muttering, "Just wait! I'll tell Lainey about this. She's got more power than you could ever dream of,and she'l put you in your place!"

With that threat, she spun on her heel and left.

Lainey was now the daughter of the Benton family, carrying influence and status that Eleanor couldn't hope to match.

Once Lainey stepped in, Eleanor wouldn't stand a chance.

Seething,Emma made her way back to the Benton family's estate, only to be greeted by a maid who, with perfect politeness, told her that Lainey was away at an important event.

Emma didn't even get a glimpse of her. Left with no choice, she left a message and dragged herself home,her fury dimmed by disappointment.

The truth, however, was very different. Lainey hadn't gone anywhere. Upstairs in her bedroom, she was sitting ather vanity, flipping through a thick stack of documents.

Her mind was already moving ahead, calculating. She wondered how to talk Jeff into working with the Stewart Group.

Only with shared business interests could she force Nolan to realize she was perfect for him.

Her gaze landed on one file in particular-the renewable energy project.

It was the future, and whoever controlled it would hold enormous influence.

But it wasn't something the Benton family could dominate alone. If they teamed up with the Stewart Group, they could secure a stronghold not just in the country but overseas too.

The profits would be staggering, and Nolan would be forced to acknowledge her worth.

Decision made, Lainey gathered the papers and made her way downstairs. Moving with her usual grace, she settled beside Jeff, who was reading the financial section.

"Dad," she began lightly, "I heard from Denny that our first domestic project will focus on renewable energy.I've done some research, and I don't think it's something we should handle alone. Have you thought about partnering with the Stewart Group?"

Jeff frowned a little at her words and lowered his newspaper to look at her."I won't even consider it. After the way Nolan disrespected me before, that's out of the question."

Once, he had admired Nolan's poise, his ambition, and his capability.

But the memory of Nolan humiliating his cherished daughter in public had soured every impression.To him now, Nolan was reckless and unworthy.
###Chapter  132| Love Challenges


Lainey slipped closer and wrapped her hand around Jeff's arm, speaking in a soft, playful tone. "Dad, I already told you, Nolan only acted that way because the Brooks siblings poisoned his mind. He's actually a good man. Please, just give him a chance and work with him, won't you?"

Jeff didn't push further into why Lainey seemed so fixated on this idea of partnering with Nolan.

After a moment of contemplation, his fondness for his daughter won out over his doubts."Alright.We'll talk about it."

As she saw Jeff so agreeable, Lainey's eyes lit up, and she quickly added, "Could you let me be the project director of Benton Group at home? You know I'm divorcing Jonny, which means I can't stay at the Todd Group. I should have something of my own to focus on."

Jeff was just about to give his approval when a firm voice cut through from the doorway."No."

It was Hilda, who had just walked up and happened to overhear everything.

Lainey really was ambitious.

First, she wanted to step into her real daughter's place, and now she wanted to get a job in Benton Group?

Over her dead body.

Still, Hilda couldn't outright reject her too harshly, or Lainey might start suspecting something.

So she softened her tone and explained as though she were being reasonable. "Lainey, you can be a team leader, but not the project director. That position has already been promised to someone we brought back from Breoqua. He's very experienced with the new energy projects. With him guiding you, you'll definitely learn faster and do even better."

Just a team leader? To Lainey, that was far beneath the dignity of a Benton.

How could she pull strings or exert any real authority from such a low position? Lainey's expression soured when she heard that.

Once again, Eleanor had ruined everything. That woman was becoming a thorn too dangerous to leave alone.

Hatred boiled inside her, but she didn't notice Hilda watching her closely from the side.

Now Hilda understood that apart from Lillian, Lainey also had a grudge against Nolan's girlfriend.

That little detail was far too important to forget, and Hilda mentally tucked it away for later use.

By then, Lainey had already covered up her scowl, replacing it with a bright, determined look. "Dad, I love challenges. Why don't you let me handle it?"

Jeff hesitated, NNolan's warning still echoing in his mind."There's no need. Our family already stands as equals with the Stewarts. You don't need to put yourself through unnecessary disrespect on our behalf."

But Lainey refused to back down. She leaned in, her voice steady but persuasive. "This deal with the Stewart Group is critical for where we're headed. I don't want to let personal grudges ruin such a chance. If enduring a little discomfort can help the family, then it's worth it."

Jeff was genuinely touched by her words. With a nod, he softened. "Alright then, if that's how you feel,go ahead and give it a try."

In his eyes, his daughter wasn't just exceptional-her thoughtfulness and understanding made her truly remarkable.
###Chapter  133 He Belongs To Me
Lainey had already suffered setbacks because of Nolan before.

This time, she wasn't coming empty-handed. She carried with her a contract worth a staggering sum.

The deal she prepared between the Benton and the Stewart families looked balanced on the surface, with both sides splitting the responsibilities equally. But the profit share was another story. The Bentons would only get 30%, while the Stewarts would walk away with 70%. In essence, it was like handing the Stewart family free money.

Lainey was convinced that no one, not even Nolan, could turn down such a lucrative offer.

However, the moment she arrived at the Stewart Group's front desk, she was stopped. "Miss, do you have an appointment?" the receptionist asked politely.

Lifting her chin with pride, Lainey declared, "I'm from the Benton family. If you've been keeping up with the news,you should recognize me. I'm here to meet Nolan. Inform him immediately."

The receptionist's smile never wavered. "I'm sorry. Mr. Stewart doesn't have you on his schedule."

Lainey's temper flared. "How dare you dare block me? Do you even realize who I am? My name opens doors. Step aside. I'm going up today whether you like it or not."

Brimming with confidence, she strode straight toward the elevators, convinced the receptionist wouldn't dare stand in her way.

To her surprise, the receptionist, clearly experienced in handling all kinds of guests regardless of their status, stepped in and firmly repeated the rule. "Apologies, but without an appointment, you won't be allowed upstairs, no exceptions."

Lainey's rage burned so hot she nearly raised her hand at the receptionist. Just then, her eyes caught sight of Eleanor walking in from outside. Dressed simply in jeans and a T-shirt, carrying nothing but a thermal lunchbox, she walked straight toward the elevator. No one stopped her.

Lainey's nails dug into her palm.

Why was she barred while Eleanor strolled through like she owned the place?

She quickly rushed forward, stepping in front of Eleanor to block her way. "Eleanor! Stop right there!"

But Eleanor didn't even pause. She just gave a small smile and walked past without a word, as if Lainey wasn't worth the trouble.

Determined not to lose face, Lainey straightened her back and hissed, "Don't come to see Nolan again. He belongs to me."

Eleanor arched a brow, amusement lacing her voice. "Really? Funny, I must have missed the memo.How come his actual girlfriend wasn't informed about this?"

Choosing to ignore Eleanor's sarcasm, Lainey pulled out a thick contract and waved it like a trophy. "See this? A ten-billion-dollar deal. If I place it in front of him, do you think he'll refuse? Once our families join forces, marriage will be inevitable. I suggest you walk away now so you don't get tossed aside again and humiliated."

Before Eleanor could even reply, a cold, authoritative voice came from the elevator. "The one who should leave is you."

No one had noticed Nolan stepping out of the elevator, but in a fewN long strides, he was at Eleanor's side.

He didn't hesitate fora second, and took the lunch box right out of her hands. His voice held a hint of warmth as he asked, "What made you drop by all of a sudden?"

Eleanor pouted. "If I don't show up once in a while, you'll probably start complaining on Facebook about being neglected."

And honestly, that was something Nolan might pull off.

The moment Lainey saw him, she ignored everything else and rushed forward, presenting the contract with both hands. "Nolan, look. This is the contract I secured for you. Our families can collaborate, and Stewart Group will get seventy percent. My condition is simple-just break up with Eleanor, and the deal is yours."

As if he needed her money.

Nolan didn't even bother responding. He simply gave her a look that made it clear he found her ridiculous.

Lainey paled, her voice trembling."NO,that's impossible. You can't give up a ten-billion-dollar deal for Eleanor. Tell me that's not true!"

But instead of dignifying her with a reply, he bent down and, in front of everyone, swept Eleanor into his arms.

Lainey froze, her contract shaking in her hands as Nolan carried Eleanor straight toward the private elevator.

Eleanor blinked in shock.

What on earth was he thinking?

Rejecting Lainey was one matter, but holding her so openly in front of everyone?

Nolan offered no explanation.

Only when the doors closed did he answer her confusion with a kiss.

This was the first time Eleanor had come looking for him on her own.

To Nolan, that was reason enough to show his appreciation.

Eleanor suddenly understood why he would act like this.

###Chapter  134 Walk Away From My Grandson


Lainey stood in the hall, feeling embarrassed.

She didn't expect things to get even worse, but they did.

Not even thirty minutes later, a single post sent all of Elepdon's social media into a frenzy.

The Stewart Group's official Twitter account tagged Benton Group and issued a statement. "Control Lainey and stop her from harassing our boss. And for the record, we have no interest in partnering with a company that lacks basic integrity."

The comment section exploded instantly.

So this was the reason? Lainey's bold attempt at seduction had actually blown up into a public scandal, and worse, it had supposedly ruined ties between two major families. The gossip was too juicy to ignore.

While Lainey was too distraught to even eat, Norwood was seething just as much. His face was flushed with fury.

"This is outrageous! Completely outrageous!" he shouted, slamming his palm against the armrest. "Risking our family name over some woman? Treating a deal worth billions like pocket change? That boy is getting more reckless by the day!"

In Norwood's mind, it became crystal clear that Eleanor was trouble.

If she stayed, Nolan would only be led astray, and the Stewart family's future would be at risk.

Without wasting time, he turned to the butler. "Dig up everything you can on Eleanor Warren. I want a meeting with her arranged immediately.".

When Eleanor got the call, she was caught off guard but accepted.

The moment she stepped into the café, however, she realized what kind of meeting it was. Norwood slid a check across the table, his expression as cold as stone. "$100 million. Walk away from my grandson." Eleanor froze for a second.

She didn't touch the check.

Instead,she calmly raised her cup and took a sip of coffee.

Norwood's eyes narrowed. His voice was sharp, like he was delivering a verdict. "I looked into your past.You're capable, yes, but at the end of the day, you're still an orphan with no background. Someone like you doesn't belong in our family. This money is your best choice."

Eleanor set her cup back down, her gaze steady and unflnching as it met his."Mr. Stewart," she said evenly,"do you really believe Nolan is looking for a partner with the right family name?"

Norwood had braced himself for her to either grab the money or flat-out refuseit.

But her pointed question... he hadn't seen that coming. The idea made his eyes burn with sudden anger.

Eleanor,however, wasn't the least bit shaken. She met his stare with a calm smile.

"If you really love him, then think about what he actually needs," she told him. "Stop treating him like a tool to keep your family's interests alive."

She then rose from her seat, giving him a small nod as if closing the matter. "That's all I came to say."

With that, she walked out of the café. The sunlight outside was blinding, beating down on her skin, yet it couldn't explain the weight pressing on her chest.

Nolan, always so composed and admired by everyone, had grown up carrying this emptiness. NNobody had ever stopped to ask if he was exhausted or if he was happy.

Even his grandfather's affection came tangled with strings.

No wonder he seemed so alone.

Once Eleanor was gone, Norwood's calm cracked completely.

He turned to the butler standing by and issued his order without hesitation. "Reach out to the Reed famnily.Tell them I'll accept their marriage proposal." The Reeds were ranked ninth in Elepdon, far from the most powerful choice, not the match he had dreamed of.

But they had a daughter of marriageable age, and they had been circling for years, eager for this chance.

If so, let them have it. A ninth-ranked family was still miles above Eleanor's.

Her background alone made her unsuitable. Worse, she had already gotten into Nolan's head.

If he let her in any further, Nolan would end up no different than Colson, dragging the Stewart family into ruin.

Eleanor had been right about one thing.

He did measure every option, weighing gains and losses.

But that was because he had Nolan's future in mind.

What could one woman possibly give that mattered more than power, stability, and influence that lasted a lifetime?

One day,Nolan would understand. One day, he would thank him.

For now, his wishes didn't matter.
###Chapter  135 This Picture Goes Straight To Eleanor


The Reed family wasted no time giving ther response the very next morning.

Norwood didn't hesitate before dialing Nolan's number. "There's a project that needs your attention. Meet me at the Highland Brew House in thirty minutes."

Nolan barely paused before agreeing, then hung up and told Erick to get the car ready.

Right on schedule, he walked into the Highland Brew House.

His eyes swept the place, searching for Norwood, but instead, Arya Reed, clad in a sparkling champagne dress, started waving at him with enthusiasm.

The truth hit Nolan instantly.

Norwood had set him up, using the excuse of work to lure him into a blind date.

Catching on, he immediately turned on his heel to leave.

Arya, eager and determined not to let the opportunity slip away, hurried after him. She threw her arms wvide,trying to catch him from behind. "Nolan, we finally get to see each other again. Please stay. I'm not here to force you into anything. I've had feelings for you since we were little. I'd settle for being your lover if that's what it takes. I even got a hotel room. No one needs to know."

Once she got Nolan into bed, she knew exactly how to lock him in.

He would come back for more.

Winning him over wouldn't be a problem.

But her hopes crumbled in an instant.

When she closed the gap, Nolan stepped aside effortlessly, avoiding her entirely.

He fixed her with a look of utter contempt and spoke in a chilling tone. "If you don't stop pestering me, I'll make sure your family pays for it."

Despite bracing herself, Arya felt a chill of fear run through her.

All she could do was watch Nolan disappear out the door, powerless to stop him.

Giving up never crossed her mind.

With Norwood's support behind her, Arya was convinced that she belonged by Nolan's side.

If seduction had failed today, then another approach would be needed.

Hiding her disappointment, Arya left the café.

Not long after Arya walked out, Lainey, who had been sitting quietly nearby, glanced down at her phone and studied the photo she had just snapped.

In the image, it looked as if Arya was wrapping her arms around Nolan from behind. Arya was all smiles,while Nolan's face gave nothing away.

That would be enough to make Eleanor loses her temper if she saw it.

However, just as Lainey was about to send it, a different plan occurred to her.

Sharing this picture with Eleanor would only spark a fight, but sending it to Nolan might open up a chance for blackmail.

Since he was so protective of Eleanor, he would do anything to keep her from seeing it.

All Lainey needed was a reason for him to meet her, and that would be enough for now.

Whatever happened after,she could handle.

Even if Nolan wanted to retaliate, she wasn't the least bit worried.

Lainey's excitement grew with each passing second as her plan took shape.

Wasting no time, she attached the photo to a message. "Meet me at the café across from Stewart Group in an hour. If you don't show up, this picture goes straight to Eleanor." Meanwhile, Nolan had just settled into the backseat when his phone lit up.

His gaze narrowed at the image, a shot taken at just the right angle to cause trouble.

Of course, it was Lainey stirring things up again.

She never seemed to quit.

There was no fear that Eleanor would be fooled. Their trust ran deep.

What bothered him was Lainey's never-ending interference and her determination to drag Eleanor into the drama.

He glanced up, expression icy cold. "Take me back to Stewart Group."
###Chapter  136 Don't Touch Me!


Once she sent off the message, Lainey stopped by her place, picked up a candle box, and headed straight for the café.

As she waited for things to play out, a new scheme formed in her mind, prompting her to fire off a text to Eleanor. "That man you're convinced will always be loyal? He's meeting another woman in private."

If Eleanor happened to walk in and catch her and Nolan together, even in a compromising position, that would be exactly what Lainey wanted!

Meanwhile, Eleanor sat at her desk, double-checking the most recent quarterly fabric shipments on her computer.

Her phone lit up with a notification, and she barely glanced at the screen.

After skimming the message, Eleanor just scoffed, dropped her phone onto the desk, and dismissed the whole thing.

So now Lainey was done threatening and wanted to stir up drama?

How immature.

How dull.

When Eleanor never wrote back, Lainey started to get irritated.

Did Eleanor honestly not believe her?

Or perhaps she just didn't give a damn.

Lainey clenched her jaw and sent another message. "Nova Lounge. It's across from the Stewart Group.Think I'm lying? Come see it for yourself."

When Eleanor saw the address, her usual detached look wavered ever so slightly. Lainey's air of certainty made it obvious Nolan planned to show up.

Nolan wasn't naive; if he recognized the setup, he probably had a plan of his own, maybe even hoping to put Lainey's meddling to rest finally.

But Lainey had a knack for scheming, and she would never shy away from bending the rules to her advantage.

A sense of unease crept in for Eleanor.

Instead of getting tangled in her own suspicions, she figured it was smarter to see what was really happening.

Besides, she genuinely wanted to know what Lainey was plotting this time.

Without hesitation, Eleanor memorized the location, locked her phone, and stepped outside.

Nolan, on the other hand, was totally oblivious to Lainey's latest manipulations.

Even if the truth hit him in the face, he would brush it off.

He had faith that Eleanor would understand his motives.

Snapping back to the moment, Nolan fixed his gaze on Lainey and delivered his warning. "I'm only here to say this once. Leave Eleanor alone. If you keep pestering her, I won't hesitate to let your parents hear all about what you've been hiding abroad, and I'm not just talking about Horace Boyd."

Fear didn't grip Lainey at first.

But when Nolan brought up that last bit, she couldn't help but panic.

Where had Nolan picked up details about what happened in Zerovia?

She had erased every trace!

Just how much did he really know?

Was he aware of her history with drugs or, even worse, her role in those murders with Horace?
No way!

There was no chance he could have known about all that, right?

A look of utter disgust crossed Nolan's face as he finished what he had to say and turned to go.

As he took a step, a sudden wave of dizziness swept over him, and a strange heat started building in his veins.

Something was wrong.

He hadn't eaten or drunk anything here.

What could possibly be causing this?

While he was struggling to steady himself, Nolan's gaze flickered to the candle quietly burning on the table.

Realization hit him like a punch. The candle. That was where he had let his guard down.

The moment Nolan staggered, Lainey's fear melted away, replaced by a surge of triumph.

Everything had fallen into place, just as she had hoped!

If she could pull Nolan into her bed, every one of her troubles would vanish.

Predatory excitement lit up her gaze. "Come with me, Nolan. Let's go relax in the lounge upstairs."

While she made her move to seize his arm, he jerked away and snapped, "Don't touch me!"

He stumbled back, but even after he pulled away, the wave of discomfort kept building inside him.

Without a second thought, Nolan quickly grabbed a nearby knife and opened a wound on his palm.

Right then, crimson fluid immediately flowed out, gaining him the clarity he desperately needed.

An unspeakable pain churned inside Lainey's heart as she witnessed this.

He would rather harm himself than have sex with her? Well then.

This was how he liked it?

A wild, frenzied look tóok over Lainey's eyes as she turned around and yelled at the servants lurking behind her, "Why are you just standing there? Get over here and help me grab him!"
###Chapter  137 There Isn't A Direct Antidote


A sudden jolt of fear raced through the two servants.

Had Lainey completely lost her mind?

Was she seriously planning to kidnap someone for everyone to see?

Hesitation hovered on their lips, but Lainey's glare sent a cold warning through them, reminding both of all the ruthless things she had pulled off in the villa recently.

With a silent, uneasy exchange of looks, the servants moved toward Nolan, dread weighing on every step.

Before they could lay a finger on him, the sound of footsteps broke the tension-Eleanor strode toward them.

Holding her phone aloft for everyone to see, she announced in a bold, clear voice, "The police are on their way.I've already made the call."

The screen was lit up with the emergency number, leaving no doubt she was serious.

Lainey was seconds from getting her way, but Eleanor's sudden intervention sent a surge of anger through her.

"Eleanor! Why would you mess everything up for me?" Lainey shrieked, losing control as she rushed straight at Eleanor.

Calm and collected, Eleanor stood her ground.

Just as Lainey lunged, Eleanor sidestepped and, with a burst of speed, kicked Lainey hard in the knees.

Lainey's scream echoed as she crashed to the floor, pain robbing her of any words.

"Don't just standthere-grab her!" Lainey gasped out the order, desperate and breathless.

Having thought they could stay out of trouble, the two servants hesitantly boxed Eleanor in just as Lainey It made no difference to Eleanor whether they wanted to or not-she took them down without breaking a sweat.

Mere seconds later, both men were sprawled on the floor, defeated.

Eleanor gently guided Nolan to a nearby chair, then made her way over to Lainey with quiet determination.

She lowered herself to meet Lainey's gaze, her voice steady and cold enough to make Lainey shiver. "I caught everything on video. You drugged Nolan and tried to hurt him. There's no way out of this. The police can hear your side later, but l've got all the proof they need."

Leaning even closer, her words barely above a whisper, she added, "Honestly, I can't wait to see how your new family reacts when they finally realize who you are behind their backs."

With nothing more to say, Eleanor rose to her feet, completely dismissing Lainey, whose fear had left her speechless.

Terror gripped Lainey-she couldn't stop imagining herself behind bars, or the Benton family cutting her off and leaving her with nothing.

She would have done anything to go back and change her choices.

If only Eleanor hadn't come in when she did, she would have pulled it off!

Regret gnawed at Lainey, heavier than ever.

The sound of sirens brought the moment to an end as police officers entered and took Lainey and both servants into custody.

When Eleanor got Nolan settled in his Bentley, Erick's nerves were shot.

He glanced back at Nolan, who looked like he was clinging to consciousness out of sheer determination.

Flushed cheeks and glassy eyes left no doubt-Nolan had been drugged.

This was a disaster, and Erick couldn't shake the guilt for not forcing his way inside sooner.

Would Nolan blame him for what happened?

But no one spared a thought for Erick's worries.

As Eleanor checked over Nolan's wounds, she noticed the fresh blood and couldn't hide her frustration."Seriously, Nolan? Are you trying to win some kind of award for bad decisions?"

Even in his delirious state, Nolan picked up on her genuine worry.

Letting his head fall against her shoulder, he whispered, his breath burning against her skin, "Everything I did...was for you."

Somehow, he still found a way to tease her?

Eleanor shot him an incredulous look and quickly told Erick up front, "Get us to a hospital. Fast."

They wasted no time getting Nolan admitted. The doctor examined him, then delivered the bad news with a heavy sigh.

"He's been given something strong. There isn't a direct antidote. The only way through this is for him to fight it off himself... unless..." The doctor trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid, but everyone knew exactly what he meant.
###Chapter  138 You're Coming To My Apartment


Nolan fought to sit up, reaching for Eleanor's handas if it were his last anchor. His gaze, soft and hazy wvith affection, made him look heartbreakingly defenseless.

"Eleanor, listen... You should go. Please don't bother with me. Just let me handle this on my own." He finished his little performance by tossing her hand aside with exaggerated flair.

Eleanor nearly laughed out loud at his theatrics.

He was such a convincing performer, she thought he could have made a fortune in movies.

But how could she just leave him in a hospital bed?

Who knew what kind of trouble he would get into?

Bringing him to the Stewart family's estate would hand Norwood exactly what he wanted.

Eleanor's options had run out.

Jaw clenched in reluctant resignation, Eleanor announced, "You're coming to my apartment."

The split second of victory that flickered across Nolan's face vanished before anyone else could catch it.

After returning home, Eleanor guided Nolan over and eased him onto the bed.

Without hesitation, Nolan clung to her, his body burning with fever as he pulled her close. His uneven breaths and unwavering gaze made it seem like she was the only thing anchoring him to reality.

At last, he had gotten what he wanted: to sleep over at Eleanor's place, basking in her warmth and the comfort of her familiar scent.

A restless heat surged through Nolan, desperate for release.

What would Eleanor do? Would she use her hands to offer relief... or take things in another direction entirely?

While Nolan's thoughts ran wild with fantasies, Eleanor silently pulled out a sleek metal box from her bag.

She popped i open, revealing an array of needles lined up neatly inside.

The sight made Nolan's bravado vanish.

What in the world was she planning?

Before panic could set in, Eleanor selected a needle and, with practiced precision, pressed it into his skin.

Nolan's cry filled the room, but within moments, sleep overtook him, pulling him under.

Just before he lost consciousness, he caught a glimpse of Eleanor's playful smirk.

Heartless,he thought.

She really was something else, absolutely ruthless.

Daylight was streaming in when Nolan finally regained consciousness.

Nolan blinked the haze from his eyes, mind surprisingly clear, though a sharp ache pulsed through his left palm.

He pushed himself upright, scanning his surroundings.

Eleanor's familiar bedroom greeted him, still wrapped in her soft, unmistakable scent.

Yet, the space felt empty as she was nowhere in sight.

Where had she gone?

After tossing aside the blanket, Nolan wandered into the living room, but it was just as empty.

A neatly prepared breakfast, sandwich, and a glass of milk waited on the table, accompanied by a handwritten note.

"I've gone to meet with the Benton family. Don't skip breakfast." The mention of the Benton family sent a chill through him.

Nolan's expression hardened instantly.

How dared the Benton family reach out to Eleanor after what Lainey had done?

Did they really believe his family was so easy to provoke?

There was no way he would sit by and do nothing.

Since their return, the Benton family had been making power plays at every turn. What if they picked on Eleanor?



At the same time, inside a high-end restaurant in WNesthaven, a man sat quietly in a private booth, middle-aged, composed, carrying himself with effortless poise. It was none other than Jeff.

His phone had rung late last night, and on the other end, Lainey's voice was thick with tears. She said that she had been set up, blaming a woman named Eleanor Warren for everything.According to Lainey, Eleanor was ruthless, hell-bent on destroying her reputation and determined to see her locked away.

He had done everything in his power to get Lainey out, only to be told that the charges were far too serious for any chance at bail.

Watching Lainey sob helplessly tore at his heart.

He and Hilda had spent more than two decades searching for their lost daughter, and now that they had finally reunited, he would never let anyone push her around.

As far as he was concerned, Eleanor probably just wanted a payout.

Any problem that could be settled with money wasn't really a problem at all.

Yet,the moment Jeff lifted his head and saw Eleanor standing there, every harsh accusation died on his lips.

He was struck by the uncanny resemblance. The shape of her eyes, the arch of her brows, so much like Hilda's when she was young. Even her aura matched as well.

What was happening here?
###Chapter  139 Don't Let Greed Cloud Your Judgment


Eleanor's brows drew together as she caught the sharp intensity in Jeff's eyes, though she schooled her face into cool indifference as she sat across from him.

The scrape of the chair seemed to snap Jeff from his thoughts.

Without hesitation, he dug into his pocket, drew out a check, and slid it across the table with a practiced hand.

"Miss Warren, let's not waste time," he said flatly. "Here's $10 million. All I ask is that you tell the police it was a misunderstanding. Take it, and the matter ends here. If that figure isn't enough,name your price-we'll work something out."

To him, it didn't matter who sat opposite.

The only thing that mattered was Lainey's freedom.

How could a girl so spoiled, so sheltered, survive behind prison walls?

Eleanor reclined lazily into her chair, not even sparing the check a glance.

So this was Lainey's father?

Not impressive at all.

He hadn't even done the bare minimum of finding out who she was.

Did he really believe she could be bought off with ten million, like some cheap pawn?

Jeff was blind to the disdain flickering in her eyes.

He mistook her silence for dissatisfaction with the amount, assuming she was holding out for more.

What a greedy woman! "Miss Warren, don't let greed cloud your judgment," he warned, his tone laced with irritation.

At last, Eleanor let out a soft, amused laugh. "Mr. Benton, tell me-did you even bother to review the surveillance footage with the police before coming here?"

Had he done so, he would never have dared to speak to her this way.

The truth was, Jeff hadn't looked.

And if he couldn't bring himself to trust his own daughter, what right did he have to call himself her father?

His jaw tightened as he glared across the table, anger rising. "The amount can change. That's notthe issue.What I want to know is simple-are you willing to negotiate with me or not?"

Eleanor's laughter rang again, light and mocking, her eyes narrowing with playful curves.

But as the sound faded, her expression snapped cold. "No, Mr. Benton. I'm not interested."

He should have erupted at her blunt refusal, yet something in the effortless curve of her smile pulled him in,unsettling him in ways he hadn't expected.

His daughter had once smiled like that as a child.

And Hilda had ever worn that same expression when joy filled her.

Jeff blinked, disoriented, the face in front of him blurring until it overlapped with Hilda's in his memory.

The words tumbled out in a stammer."Who-"

Before he could finish, the door burst open.

Nolan strode in, his expression set in grim lines. His gaze went straight to Eleanor, sweeping over her with sharp intensity until he confirmed she was unharmed. The rigid set of his jaw eased, the relief in his eyes unmistakable.

That unguarded concern sent a faint ripple through Eleanor's chest, something she couldn't quite name.

She was still caught in the warmth of it when Nolan reached down, grasped her hand, and pulled her up from her chair.

"Come on," he said quietly, his voice low but firm.

Only then did Eleanor break from her reverie, her steps falling in sync as she followed him out.

For Jeff, it was a humiliation unlike any he had endured before.

He shoved himself up from his seat, palms slamming against the table, rage burning through him."You arrogant Stewart brat-how dare you walk out on me like that?"

Jeff's fury shifted, lashing toward Eleanor now.

His eyes swept over her, hard and cold, and his words dripped with scorn."And you-don't think Nolan's protection gives you the right to run wild. You can afford to cross us. Once I get Lainey out, I'll make sure you regret this."

Eleanor stopped in her tracks, then slowly turned to face him. Her voice was calm, but every word struck sharp. "Mr. Benton, your opinion of me means nothing. My rule is simple-l never pick a fight, but if one comes to me, I'll end it. Instead of wasting your breath threatening me, perhaps you should spend your energy keeping your daughter in line."

Without waiting for his reply, she slipped her hand into Nolan's and walked out with him, not sparing Jeff another glance.

"You-" Jeff's voice broke, his entire body shaking with fury, yet no words followed.

The certainty in their demeanor gnawed at him.

Could Lainey really have done something wrong?

No,impossible.

His daughter had always been gentle, obedient.-There was no way she had crossed the line of the law.

Eleanor must have set this trap.

Grinding down his anger, Jeff steeled himself. He needed to call in favors, reach out to his connections,and make sure Lainey was treated with care inside.

With that thought burning in his mind, he turned and strode out of the room.
###Chapter  140 | Still Want To Be With Nolan


Eleanor had barely closed the car door when Nolan slid in beside her, an eager spark in his eyes.

Without Erick there to play chauffeur, Nolan was left to his own devices. It gave him a certain boldness that was impossible to miss.

Letting his head rest on Eleanor's shoulder, he showed off his wrapped hand like a kid hoping for sympathy,putting on a performance so dramatic that no one could possibly miss it.

Trying to make sense of his theatrics, Eleanor shot him a puzzled look.

If there was a record for changing moods, Nolan would shatter it.

Just a moment ago, he had that fierce, untouchable vibe. NNow, he acted like the world's most tragic figure,begging for a littleaffection.

His knack for switching it up could put any award-winning actor to shame.

She moved to shove him away, but he caught her wrist with practiced ease.

With a wounded pout, he said, "You left me alone at your place. Don't you think you should make it up to me?"

His face drifted closer, his tone shifting into something soft and dangerously sweet.

Eleanor slid away from him, her gaze flickingto the window as if looking for an escape.

Trying to steady her nerves, she cleared her throat. "You do realize you just picked a fight with Jeff Benton,right? What if he goes straight to your grandfather with this?"

The moment Norwood's name was mentioned, Nolan straightened up. His polished expression darkened,shadowed by something unreadable.

A heartbeat passed before he met her gaze. "If I'm being honest, my grandpa might end up liking you even less than he already does. But I promise you this-I won't let anything get in the way of marrying you. Not even him."

He delivered those words like a promise set in stone.

Caught off guard, Eleanor blinked before turning away, searching for anything to look at except him.

"I never said I wanted to marry you," she blurted, voice shaky. "Would you quit messing around? Just drive.I've got a lot to handle today."

Nolan let out a laugh and rested his hands on the wheel. "Whatever you say, baby."

After leaving the restaurant, Jeff did everything he could to bail Lainey out.

Two days crawled by before Lainey finally returned.

Seeing how pale and exhausted she was, Jeff felt something in his chest twist painfully.

He shrugged out of his suit jacket and gently placed it over her shoulders. "Come with me to Breoqua,sweetheart. Things at home are too messy for you to deal with."

The suggestion hit her like a cold wind.

Leave now?

That would mean letting Nolan slip straight into Eleanor's arms.

Why should she make it that easy?

Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks the moment the thought hit, making her look even more fragile."I can't leave, Dad. I've cared about Nolan for so long," she whispered, grabbing hold of his sleeve. Her voice trembled, her eyes pleading with him. "Can you help me? I just want a chance with Nolan.Please?"

At the sight of her crying, he forgot how much he resented Nolan and that Lainey was still married to Jonny

He was seconds away from agreeing when Hilda appeared with a plate of fruit, her words slicing through his moment of weakness. "Jeff, Nolan already has a girlfriend." Reality snapped back into focus for him.

She was right.

Obviously Eleanor and Nolan were deep in love with each other. She wouldn't let go without a fight.

Jeff's thoughts drifted to Hilda, his eyes softening as he studied her features.

He kept seeing Eleanor's face in his mind.

The resemblance to Hilda was almost uncanny.

How could two people look so much alike?

A strange discomfort settled in Jeff's chest.

Lainey noticed how far away he seemed, so she gave his hand a quick squeeze. "It doesn't matter to me,Dad. I still want to be with Nolan," she insisted.

Pretending to be the perfect daughter was pointless now.

After everything that happened, nobody could blame her for showing a little stubbornness.

Wiping her tears, she turned to Hilda with a pleading look. "Mom, that girl isn't anything serious to Nolan.She's just... just a passing distraction."

She caught herself before saying more. It felt smarter to hold back, especially since she knew Eleanor was the Bentons' real daughter.

Instead, she continued, her tone shifting, "Nolan's grandfather would never accept her anyway.Since there's no way for them to end up together, I'm not really doing anything wrong by trying to win him over,aml?"
###Chapter 141 But You're Still Married,Lainey.
Hilda could hardly believe how shameless Lainey had become.


She kept her face calm, though inside she felt completely drained. With a weary sigh, she said, "But you're still married,Lainey."


Hearing that snapped Jeff out of his daze.


He met Hilda's gaze and jumped right into a dramatic rundown of every scandal he had dug up.


Finishing his tirade, he added, "Jonny's no match for Lainey. I've already started leaning on the Todd Group. If he won't sign the divorce papers, he's got another thing coming."



Turning to Lainey, he gave her hand a gentle pat."You don't have to worry, baby. If you've set your heart on Nolan, then I'll back you up all the way-  even if it costs me my reputation."


The resemblance between Eleanor and Hilda didn't matter anymore. All he could see was the daughter he had finally found after years of searching, the one a DNA test had confirmed.



The guilt he carried for the lost years would never go away.


Whatever she asked for, he would make sure she had it.



Lainey's spirits soared, as if she could already see herself stepping into the role of Nolan's wife.


Poor Eleanor.



She had already taken Jonny fromn her once.


Now, she had Eleanor's parents, and soon, she would have the man Eleanor loved too.



No matter how hard Eleanor tried, she would always come up short.


Lost in her own world, Lainey let a flash of bitterness  show in her eyes.



Jeff stayed focused on soothing her worries, missing the shift in her mood, but Hilda caught it right away.



Bitterness?



And all this animosity pointed toward Nolan's girlfriend.



What had happened between the two of them?



There had to be more beneath the surface, and Hilda made a mental note to get to the bottom of it.



Lainey remained completely oblivious to Hilda's curiosity, far too wrapped up in her own satisfaction.


The following morning found her up before sunrise,ready for a shopping spree.


Norwood's birthday was coming fast, and Lainey,who considered herself Nolan's bride-to-be, wanted to make a statement. She needed a gift that screamed prestige, something that would leave no doubt about her place beside Nolan-and set her  apart from any rival.


While she browsed through an antique shop, her phone buzzed unexpectedly with a new message from an unknown number.


"A fake contract, huh? You're not worried I'll send that video straight to the Bentons?"


Lainey's grin faded in an instant.


How could they have uncovered that so fast?


Despite winning over the Benton family, she still did not have her hands on that 20%. If her cover was blown now, she would lose everything she had now.


A wave of regret hit her. Why hadn't she just turned in the real contract from the start?



Her phone vibrated again with a fresh message. "You have twenty-four hours. Bring me the real transfer papers by tonight, or you'll regret it."


Threats-always more threats.


Why did this person keep making things difficult for her?



Why couldn't they just vanish?


The thought triggered a dark impulse inside her.


An audacious,dangerous plan began to take shape.


She typed furiously, crafting à message dripping with fake desperation. "Please, I made a mistake. I swear I'll make it right."


It did not take long for the response to come through. "Meet me at the Nova Lounge front desk at eleven."


"Fine. I'll be there." After Lainey slipped her phone back into her purse, a glint of steely resolve flickered in her eyes.


With the Nova Lounge's front desk already working for her, Lainey knew she had the upper hand.


She didn't even need to make an appearance to uncover her blackmailer.



Let them try to steal from her-she could not wait to see who would dare step into her trap, and whether they would walk out again.
###Chapter 142 You Crossed The Wrong Person

Darleen made her way to pick up the contract,keeping herself disguised from head to toe.


Yet Lainey knew her too well. The minute the receptionist sent over a clip from the lobby cameras,Lainey recognized Darleen with barely a glance.


So it was Darleen. That bitch. If she wanted trouble,she had found it.



Hatred boiled in Lainey's chest as she snapped her phone shut and wasted no time dialing Horace. "I want Darleen Faulkner handled. She's in Elepdon right now. Take care of her for me, and I'll add 2% to your cut when it's done."


Horace lived outside the law. Jobos like this were just another day for him.

 
He saw the upside, so he didn't hesitate. "Alright,"he  responded.


Meanwhile, Darleen had no clue what was brewing behind her back.



She left the law firm with a spring in her step, feeling like the world had just handed her a crown.



Clutching the authentic share transfer papers, she could hardly believe her luck. She had just secured a fortune, and nobody in the Faulkner family could look down on her now. The future was hers-she would be the one calling the shots.


Lost in her triumph, Darleen never saw the danger coming. A coarse sack landed over her head out of nowhere,cutting off her vision in a blink.


Within seconds, she was shoved into a waiting van.


By the timne the sack was removed, she was choking on the smell of dust and decay.


She glanced around and realized she had been dumped in a derelict factory. Rough ropes dug into her wrists and ankles, leaving her completely at the  mercy of her captors.



Footsteps echoed through the emptiness as a burly man stalked toward her, a wicked-looking knife catching the light.


Terror took over, making her voice shake. "Who are you? What do you want from me? I'm from the Faulkner family! If you lay a finger on me, you'll regret it-my family won't let this slide!"


The man only laughed, flashing a mouth full of stained teeth. His eyes glinted with cruel amusement. "Faulkner, huh? That's exactly why you're here. You crossed the wrong person,sweetheart."



Her mind raced as she tried to make sense of his words.



Only one name came to mind.



Lainey.



It had to be that snake. So she was willing to go this far? That two-faced bitch had betrayed her without a second thought!


The moment Darleen stayed quiet, the man smirked -he could tell she had pieced everything together.


Without warning, he tossed a notepad and pen at her feet. "Go on, write a confession. Say Eleanor Warren kidnappedyou and planned to kill you for money."


Darleen recoiled in horror. "No, absolutely not!Eleanor is with Nolan. If he hears about this, I'm finished!"



He clearly had no interest in hearing her protest.


With a dark chuckle, he slashed through the rope around her wrists and pressed the cold blade against her neck. "You've got two options. Write what I told you,or you won't leave this place alive."


The knife dug into her skin, and warm blood trickled down her neck, sending a jolt of pain straight through her.



Having lived a sheltered life, Darleen had never faced  anything so terrifying. Fear took over.


Her voice shook as she surrendered. "I-I'll do it."


Her hands barely stopped trembling as she gripped the pen.


Each word took everything out of her, and it was a long,agonizing few minutes before she managed to scrawl the forced confession across the page.



As soon as Darleen finished scribbling, the man yanked the notepad from her grasp with barely contained impatience.



He scanned her shaky handwriting, lips curling into a satisfied grin once he saw everything was in order.


When she saw that, Darleen's voice broke as she tried to bargain. "I did what you asked. Can I leave now?"



His response was a mocking snicker. "Do you think I'll let you off so easily?"


"What are you talking about?" Darleen stammered,  confusion clouding her features. Panic surged as realization dawned in her wide, terrified eyes. "Wait,you're not-no, don't-"


She never got to plead for mercy. The man's blade flashed,striking before she could react.


Bound and helpless, she had no way to run. Agony ripped through her, hot and sharp, as the blood drained from her body.


Her vision blurred. Somewhere in the haze, she heard the man's voice, low and businesslike, making a call to Horace to confirm the job was done.


After that,everything faded into black.
###Chapter 143 The Police Just Took Eleanor Away
Unbeknownst to her, Eleanor had been set up again.


After they left the restaurant, Nolan shadowed her every step, refusing to let her slip away, his persistence bordering on comical.


Eventually, she gave in and accompanied him to the Stewart Group building. The two shared the same space, but their minds wandered down different paths.


It would have been a stretch to call it quality time together-they worked in silence, each absorbed in their own world.



Once Nolan set aside the last of his paperwork, his attention drifted across the room, softening the moment his eyes landed on Eleanor.


She was sketching quietly, her movements so fluid they seemed effortless, a picture of elegance and concentration.



Most people whispered that he was out of her league, but he never believed that. Deep down, he believed he was the one who didn't deserve her.



She had fought her way up from nothing. She was Enigma and Butterfly-always hinting at mysteries yet untold.


He, by contrast, had been cushioned by family privilege his entire life. Had their lives been switched,he doubted he would have made it half as far.



Feeling his lingering gaze, Eleanor glanced up, their eyes meeting in a gentle, wordless exchange.


The tension that once lingered between them had faded,replaced by genuine warmth.


She tilted her head, curious. "Is there something you want to say?"


He set his pen aside and closed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around her with  quiet affection. "Honestly, I just keep thinking how beautiful you are."


Eleanor batted his hand away, letting out an exasperated sigh. "Go back to your work and stop hovering. I'm in the middle of something important here."



Having her this close made it hard for Nolan to let go so easily.


With a mischievous glint, he tapped his cheek and gave her a playful look. "A little incentive, and maybe I'll behave."



She knew if she ignored him, he would never leave her alone. So Eleanor leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. "Happy now? Give me some space -I need to finish this drawing."



That did the trick. Nolan strolled back to his desk,grinning like he had just won the lottery.


At that moment, Erick walked in and caught sight of Nolan's lovestruck expression.  He fought the urge to roll his eyes. Pushing aside any comments, he got straight to business. "Boss, we've got a situation-Darleen Faulkner's been kidnapped,badly hurt, and she's out cold."


Nolan's security team always kept an eye on the big families in Elepdon, so news like this never slipped through the cracks.


Nolan gave a nod to show he had heard.


Erick turned on his heel and left, silently grateful he hadn't interrupted his boss and Eleanor.


Neither Nolan nor Eleanor gave Erick's update a second thought.


Darleen wasn't someone who crossed their minds often, let alone someone they felt any attachment to.


But neither of them could have predicted that the very next morning, everything would be turned upside down by a knock at the door.


Eleanor was spending the day at Hope House,surrounded by the children, when two police officers walked in with somber faces.



"Excuse me. Which one of you is Eleanor Warren?"one of them said, scanning the room.



Eleanor rose to her feet and quietly gestured for the children to head inside before she answered, "I'm Eleanor."



Both officers stepped closer, flashing their badges."We're here regarding an incident from yesterday.Darleen Faulkner was abducted and assaulted. She's in critical condition and hasn't regained consciousness. At the scene, there was a note naming you as the suspect. We'll need you to come down to the station and answer a few questions."



Myah,having caught wind of the disturbance, hurried over, her face etched with worry. "There must be some mistake! Eleanor is gentle-she'd never hurt anyone."



Eleanor reached for Myah's hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze.  There was nothing for the innocent to hide.


If someone was trying to set her up, she intended to face it head-on and see just how deep the scheme ran.



Eleanor met theofficers' eyes calmly and nodded."Of course. I'm ready whenever you are."


As Eleanor walked out with the police, Myah's anxiety boiled over. She paced back and forth, wringing her hands as worry took hold.


This couldn't be happening. She refused to let Eleanor become a scapegoat.


With fingers shaking, Myah fumbled for her phone and dialed in a hurry. "Mr. Stewart,you have to help!The police just took Eleanor away-something's really wrong!"
###Chapter 144 This Is Better Thanl Imagined!

Word of Eleanor's arrest by the police raced through high society in no time at all.


At the Benton family's villa, Lainey was in the middle of a pampering session, a face mask in place, when the news reached her. She couldn't help but burst into laughter, thoroughly pleased with herself.


She snatched up her phone, her tone giddy with praise. "Horace,you absolute genius! Two birds with one stone-this is better than l imagined!"


Darleen had made the mistake of crossing her and paid the ultimate price.


Eleanor was locked up and facing charges.


Now behind the bars, she would never get in her way.


But Lainey's celebration came to a screeching halt. A new update hit her phone-Eleanor had already been cleared and let go.


Nolan had acted fast, sending his team to collect every scrap of surveillance footage from Eleanor's whereabouts yesterday. The evidence proved she could not have possibly been involved.


With a furious crash, Lainey hurled her phone to the floor,her eyes burning with rage.


That woman had gotten away again.


No matter-she knew the Faulkner family wouldn't let this slide.



With them stirring up trouble, Eleanor's problems were only just beginning.







Eleanor barely made it home from the police station before a barrage of fists on her door shattered her short-lived peace.


A quick glance through the peephole revealed half  the Faulkner family gathered outside, their anger barely contained.


No one was sure how they managed to slip past the neighborhood's tight security, but here they were,causing a scene.


"Open up, Eleanor! Murderer! Show your face!"


"How dare you rest easy while my daughter's fighting for her life in a hospital bed?"



"Someone like you-who tramples the law-shouldn't get away with it!"



With a weary sigh, Eleanor pressed her fingers to her temples before swinging open the door.She lounged in the doorway, her eyes cold.



"If you're looking for justice, y/ou should talk to the police. They let me go. That should tell you everything. Stop wasting your breath here and find out who actually hurt Darleen."


But reason fell on deaf ears. Rosita Faulkner,Darleen's mother, had no patience left for
 explanations.


The doctors had already painted a grim picture-Darleen might never recover, her life and any hopes of family alliances destroyed. Nothing Eleanor could say would change her mind now.


Since Darleen was still unconscious, Eleanor became the only one the Faulkner family could blame.


Letting her go was never an option for them.


Rosita had already decided-she would wring every ounce of compensation she could.


Fueled by anger, Rosita's voice cut through the air,rising with every word. "I don't care what the police say! My daughter's life is ruined because of you. You owe us an explanation,right now!"


Darleen's brother, impatient and hotheaded, rolled his shoulders and stepped forward. "Forget talking,Mom. Let's grab her. Nolan will cough up a fortune to keep her safe."


Eleanor tried to interject, her tone warning, but one of them lunged at her before she could finish.



Her eyes flashed with icy resolve as she sidestepped the grab, but the crowd pressed in. In the struggle,her arm scraped along the wall, a sharp burn marking her skin.



Before Eleanor could fight back, a familiar figure burst into the fray.



Erick planted himself squarely between her and the Faulkner family, his voice calm but authoritative. "I'l remind you all-creating chaos in someone's home is against the law. Disturbing the peace like this can land you five to ten days in detention, plus a five-hundred-dollar fine."



That threat was enough to make most of them back away, their anger suddenly cooled.



But Darleen's brother was too stubborn to quit. He raised his voice, full of confidence. "She's the one who hurt my sister! We're here for justice, not trouble. Why should you threaten us?" Erick, ever the skilled problem-solver at Nolan's side,couldn't help but let out a dry, mocking laugh.


"Do you honestly believe Mr. Stewart's girlfriend is responsible for your sister's injuries? The authorities have already cleared her. Yet here you are, looking to cause trouble. Tell me, are you here for justice-or for something else entirely?"


He made a point of calling Eleanor Nolan's girlfriend,letting everyone know exactly where she stood.


A few members of the Faulkner family glanced nervously at Nolan, who stood silent behind Erick.With no support and no hope of winning, they muttered curses, traded uneasy looks, and slunk away in frustration.
###Chapter 145 | Refuse To Leave Her





As soon as the Faulkners were gone, Erick's hard look melted into a lopsided grin. "You doing alright?"



Eleanor's lips parted just enough for her to breathe out a quiet word of gratitude.


To her surprise, Erick quickly waved her off and nodded toward Nolan, standing a little distance away.


"If you're grateful, you should be thanking Mr.Stewart," Erick said before ducking out of sight.


Left standing there, Eleanor said nothing as her gaze landed on Nolan, who made his way over at a relaxed pace.


He stopped right in front of her, eyes zeroing in on her lips, a sly smile flickering. "I thought you had something to say to me. I'm listening."


Catching the mischievous glint in his eyes, Eleanor instantly understood what he was angling for.



Her eyes flicked upward in exasperation. "Forget it.If you keep pushing, I'll walk away right now."


Nolan's teasing look vanished in a flash. His attention shifted to the angry red mark on her arm, and his expression turned icy.


The Faulkner family. They would pay dearly for touching her.


After carefully cleaning her wound and placing a fresh bandage, Nolan pulled out his phone and fired off a message when she didn't notice.



Within moments, Erick sent back a quick reply."Already on it!"


Nolan wasn't usually harsh, but the Faulkners had overstepped. They had no idea what kind of trouble they had brought on themselves.







The following day, the Faulkner family's underhanded  attempt to trap their competitors with bogus contracts was exposed for all to see.


The IRS moved in without delay.



By the afternoon, the entire Faulkner empire was under investigation, and their tax evasion alone was enough to destroy everything they owned.



Once considered one of Elepdon's most powerful families, the Faulkner family were forced to declare bankruptcy.



That the Faulkner family caused trouble for Eleanor and ended up ruined was hardly a coincidence.


Everyone quickly connected the dots. Nolan had been the architect behind their downfall.


A wave of panic swept through the city's social elite.



Wealthy families scrambled to review their own affairs,terrified that one careless relative might have crossed Eleanor or Nolan.



Even the slightest suspicion of a misstep sent family leaders rushing their members to the Stewart family's estate, eager to beg forgiveness in person and desperate not to be next on the chopping block.


The moment Norwood uncovered the whole truuth,rage overtook him. He smashed his favorite mug in a fit of anger and demanded Nolan's return that same night.



The second Nolan walked inside, Norwood swung his cane at him.



"What on earth were you thinking?" Norwood snapped.



With his head lowered, Nolan took the blow without protest.


Norwood, voice trembling with rage, jabbed a finger at Nolan. "Our family name carries weight in Elepdon,but you'd risk making enemies out of every family in town for the sake of one woman? What do you think will become of us then?"


He had been right about Eleanor. She had always attracted trouble, and a woman with so many enemies could only drag Nolan down. In his mind, someone like that could never become his grandson's wife.


The longer Norwood dwelled on it, the more his fury hardened into resolve. His hands shook as he leveled a finger at Nolan, the very man he had raised, and issued a final warning. "End things with that woman now, or I'll take matters into my own hands."


Nolan's eyes turned steely.


He drew himself upright and locked eyes with Norwood, defiance written in his stare. "Grandpa, I did nothing wrong. The Faulkners were rotten, and their end was coming either way. I only sped up the process. As for my relationship with Eleanor..."


After a brief silence, he spoke with unwavering resolve. "I refuse to leave her. If you deny me the chance to marry her, then I'll stay single for the rest of my life."


For the Stewart family, with wealth and legacy on the line, such words carried heavy weight.


Norwood struggled for air as his cane slammed hard against the floorboards. "That woman's bewitched you! Someone, take him away! Lock him in the basement. He's not leaving until he's done five hours of penance.
###Chapter 146 Don't Ever Do Something Like This Again
Nolan offered no resistance.



His posture only grew more rigid as he followed the butler down the hallway and into the basement,getting down on his knees without uttering a word.


The butler lingered nearby, hesitating before finally breaking the silence. "Mr. Stewart,why put yourself through this? Your grandfather only wants what's best for you."



Nolan kept his eyes fixed ahead, refusing to respond.


With a heavy sigh, the butler shook his head and stepped away, worry lining his features.



Such misfortune.



Two decades ago, Norwood's own son had been punished over a woman.  Now,twenty years later, history repeated itself with his grandson.


The Stewarts-forever captives of their own hopeless romantic streak.



Would their legacy survive another generation like this?



Of course, the butler's concerns missed the mark.


If he had truly understood Eleanor's worth,he would have thought Nolan wasn't good for her, not the other way around.



But he didn't know.


All the butler knew was that Nlorwood hadn't slept in days, his health slipping with every restless night.


It looked like another call to the Underground Network was in order-he would need to stock up on those pills, just in case.



Five hours later.



Darkness had settled in. Still stubborn, Nolan lingered in the basement, lips twisting into a wry smile before he finally stood and slipped out of the house.



Eleanor had just wrapped up her work when a knock echoed through her apartment.



At this hour?



She felt a flicker of curiosity as she went to the door.


On her doorstep stood Nolan, rain-soaked, his black shirt plastered to his skin and outlining every hard line of muscle across his shoulders and down his narrow waist.


He looked like a mess, but his eyes were startlingly bright. He fixed her with a plaintive stare. "Baby,you have to let me stay. I got punished by my grandpa-stuck in the basement for hours. And now I'm out on the street, all boecause of you."


It was only haIf the truth. He had been sentenced to hours of reflection, yes. But as for being thrown out-Norwood would never have the heart to send him  away, especially if he suspected Nolan might run straight to Eleanor.


And Eleanor, of course, saw right through it.


But as she saw Nolan dripping wet and looking so defeated, Eleanor's resolve melted.


With a sigh and a roll of her eyes, she stepped aside and tugged him in by the arm, feigning annoyance."Come on, troublemaker. Get inside."


She fetched a fresh towel and the first-aid kit, then motioned for him to settle on the sofa. Kneeling down, she gently rolled up his pant legs, frowning at the angry swelling on his knees-evidence of hours spent standing in silence, enduring punishment.


A pang of sympathy twisted in Eleanor's chest.


Her hands moved even more carefully. "Don't ever do something like this again."


Norwood never hid his disapproval of her.


But if Nolan had just played along-offered a few  placating words, even if they were lies-Norwood never would have punished him like that.



Nolan must have gone head-to-head with his grandfather, stubborn as ever.


Love really did make people foolish.



Was there even a cure for it?



Nolan caught the look in her eyes-the worry, the tenderness-and suddenly, every ache in his body felt worth it.



He didn't say a word. He just watched her, quietly memorizing the moment.


While things were quiet and calm in Eleanor's apartment, everything at the Stewart family's estate was unraveling.



Norwood, glancing at the time and realizing Nolan had missed dinner,finally relented.



A trace of concern slipped into his stern expression as he set his book aside. "Go fetch Nolan," he  instructed the butler.



The butler hesitated, shifting from foot to foot."Mr.Stewart..."


Norwood's frown deepened. "What is it? Is he still refusing to admit his mistake?"


Shaking his head, the butler replied even more quietly, "No, sir. He slipped out the moment his five hours were up."


Heading out so late could only mean one thing-Nolan had gone running straight to Eleanor.


The image of his proud grandson lowering himself for that woman set Norwood's temper ablaze. He slammed his fist down. "Wonderful.Just wonderful!"



He had given up on Arya, that hopeless woman. But he had a long list of eligible candidates. He would definitely find a woman both worthy of their name and winning Nolan over.
###Chapter 147 | Would Never Lie To You





Lainey had never thought the Faulkner family would crumble so easily. Just a single hit from Nolan, and they were wiped out overnight.


She was livid, clenching her phone so tightly her knuckles turned pale. Once again, Eleanor had walked away untouched.


Just then, her screen lit up with a new message from the informant she had planted inside the Stewart household. "Nolan was punished by Norwood. He's been sent to reflect in the basement."



Lainey's frustration instantly transformed into excitement.



If Nolan was being disciplined, then surely it was because of the Faulkners' downfall. And at the core of that matter was Eleanor.



Norwood must already loathe Eleanor, and now he would despise her even more.



If Lainey seized the chance to stand out now,Norwood might finally acknowledge her.


Heart racing, she rushed downstairs and found Jeff in the study, poring over documents.



"Dad! Nolan's being punished by his grandfather,and it's because of Eleanor! Didn't yousay you'd help me? The opportunity is right in front of us!"



She didn't bother to sugarcoat her words, relying fully on her father's indulgence.



Jeff wasn't offended in the least. All he saw was the bright spark of determination in his daughter's eyes.His tone softened as he nodded. "Alright. I'll reach out to Norwood sincerely in the next few days. By his birthday banquet, I'll make sure your wish comes true."



In truth, he had already crafted a plan long ago.



He was simply waiting for the right timing.Now,with the stage set, success was only a matter of execution.


At his reassurance, Lainey's face lit up with delight."Really,Dad?"


Jeff smiled warmly, patting her head with fatherly pride. "I would never lie to you."


To him, Lainey was a priceless treasure he had gotten back, and he was determined to stand by her no matter what.



So what if she was a little spoiled?


With a joyful laugh, Lainey threw herself into his arms. "Dad, you're the best!"


In her mind, everything was falling into place.


Soon Nolan would be hers, and she couldn't wait to see how Eleanor would dare challenge her then.



But at the doorway, Hilda stood frozen, having heard everything.


Nolan's girlfriend. It was the third time she had heard Lainey say that name. Eleanor.


Hilda felt her heart skip for reasons she couldn't explain.


Pushing down her unease, she hurried back to her room and quickly dialed Denny.


Her voice was rushed and urgent as she said, "I need a full background check on Nolan's girlfriend,Eleanor Warren. Everything you can find. Don't let Lainey hear a word of this."



Though puzzled, Denny didn't question her. "Yes,Madam."



He was quick.


The notification buzzed, and within minutes Hilda had the photos in hand.


She tapped them open, and the moment the first one loaded, her whole body went rigid.


Her grip on the phone nearly slipped.


The girl staring back at her had eyes that curved when she smiled, the faintest hint of dimples, a sharp little nose, and lips that curled just so at the corners.


Hilda's breath caught. She knew that face.



It was like looking into a mirror from years ago.


Even in a picture, the resemblance was undeniable.


In person? It would be impossible to miss.



Her chest tightened as her eyes welled up.


She didn't need a second opinion.


That was her daughter.


But then a bitter thought struck her. Jeff must have seen her before, so why didn't he recognize her?



The second Jeff stepped into the room, Hilda didn't hesitate.



She stormed up, grabbed him by the collar, and stared at him with blazing eyes. "Jeff," she said, her voice trembling with both fury and heartbreak, "how could you fail to recognize your own daughter? How  could you?"


Her anger only burned hotter as she thought about the contrast.



Lainey walked around like she owned the world,lording her so-called status over everyone, while her real daughter was left out there, struggling. It was unbearable.
###Chapter 148 Those Can't Be Fake





Jeff was confused at first, not really grasping what Hilda was trying to say. But once she showed him the photos on her phone, things started to make sense.


He slowly let go of her hand, guided her to sit at the edge of the bed, and gave a bitter laugh before speaking. "The first time I saw Eleanor, I thought the same thing you're thinking now. That's why I went straight to the orphanage she grew up in. The director told me that when they found her, there was a note tucked into her swaddling blanket. It clearly said her parents had passed away."


He paused, then added in a lower voice, "And besides, the DNA test results confirmed Lainey was our flesh and blood... those can't be fake, right?"


Eleanor's parents had passed away?


Hilda shot to her feet as the words sank in. She stumbled back a few steps, repeating it over and over in a daze.Her parents had died?


How could that be true?


Eleanor looked so much like her, so how could she not be her daughter?


No, it didn't add up.


Someone must have twisted the truth.


Someone must have tampered with it. She had to find Eleanor; she had to see her with her own eyes.She wanted her real daughter back.


The thought consumed her. Before Jeff could stop her,she was out the door.


He didn't chase after her.



Maybe it was better this way.


Maybe once she saw the truth for herself, she would finally let go.


But when Hilda arrived at Hope House, Eleanor wasn't there.



Desperate, she turned to Myah for answers.


Myah wished wvith all her heart that Eleanor could find her family, but she couldn't make up lies just to ease Hilda's pain.


The note really did exist. It clearly listed Eleanor's birth date and the fact that both her parents had passed away.


Hope crumbled inside Hilda as she left the orphanage, her heart heavy with despair.


Could it really be true? Was Eleanor not her child after all?



No,she refused to accept it.


Deep down, she felt it, a pull too strong to ignore.


Eleanor was her daughter. She had to be.


Hilda just needed to find out the truth, no matter what it took. Only then could she tell Eleanor that she was her mother. But even in her desperation, she knew she couldn't recklessly drag Eleanor into this without proof.


She couldn't risk disrupting her life or worse, alerting the wrong people and putting Eleanor in danger.


So, with trembling restraint, Hilda decided not to seek Eleanor out.



Jeff, seeing her quiet down, thought she had finally given up.



Relieved, he let the matter rest.


Before long, Norwood's birthday banquet came around.



As one of the old pillars of power in Elepdon, his standing was unmatched, and naturally, his celebration was far more extravagant than the Benton family's welcome-home banquet.


Business elites filled the hall, and even key political figures, too busy to attend in person, had gifts delivered to honor him. For an event like this, every detail had to be flawless.


That was why Norwood had pulled Nolan aside the day before and made himself perfectly clear-do not bring Eleanor.



When the sleek Bentley rolled up to the Stewart family's estate and Nolan stepped out with Eleanor on his arm, the crowd rippled with shock.


Whispers spread instantly.


This was Norwood's birthday, yet Nolan was openly bringing Eleanor here? Did this mean wedding bells were on the horizon?


Upstairs, Norwood's temper nearly snapped. His fingers clenched so tightly around his phone it almost shattered.



He had warned Nolan more than once, but his grandson had gone ahead anyway.



How was he supposed to face the Benton family now? He had already committed to a marriage alliance with them, and whether he liked Lainey or not, he had to show the Bentons some level of respect.


Personally, he found Lainey sly and untrustworthy,but breaking Nolan and Eleanor apart camne first.


Once that was handled, he could find someone better suited for Nolan.



With a face hard as stone, Norwood leaned toward the butler at his side and gave curt instructions.


Not long after, a servant made his way to Nolan and bowed politely. "Mr. Stewart, your grandfather would like to see you in the study upstairs."
###Chapter 149 | Have A Joyful Announcement
Nolan hesitated for a moment, then let go of Eleanor's hand. His voice dropped to a whisper meant only for her. "Wait for me. I'll come back."


The second he stepped away, Lillian swooped in like she had been waiting for her chance. Mischief sparkled in her eyes as she folded her arms, her tone laced with mock outrage. "So,when exactly were you planning to tell me you're getting married? Some best friend you are!"


Eleanor blinked at her, caught between rolling her eyes and laughing. She reached out and gave Lillian a playful tap on the forehead. "Cut it out. Don't listen to all that gossip. We're nowhere near that stage."


The lighthearted teasing ended the moment a cold,arrogant voice cut through the air. "Stop fooling yourself. The title of Nolan's wife belongs to me. As for you, Eleanor, you'd better know your place." Lainey strolled over with calculated grace, a glass of red wine balanced perfectly in her hand. Her eyes were filled with disdain as she looked Eleanor up and down.


Lillian bristled immediately. She hated that smug tone of Lainey's more than anything. "Lainey, last I checked, you're still married to Jonny. And yet here you are, throwing yourself at someone else's boyfriend? Honestly, do you even know the meaning of shame?"



The words hit hard. For a second, Lainey's practiced smile faltered, and raw anger flickered in her eyes.



That useless Jonny!



She had wanted to dump him ages ago, but he wouldn't sign the divorce papers.



If Jeff hadn't promised to step in and handle it for her, she might have taken care of Jonny already. But none of that was going to stop her from making things difficult for Eleanor. And certainly not from claiming Nolan for herself.


Within seconds, Lainey smoothed her expression back into a smile. "Believe what you want. Just wait and see."


With a sway of her hips, she sauntered off.


Eleanor frowned.


Something was off.


Lainey wasn't the type to toss out a few words and retreat so easily.


Did this mean the Stewarts and the Bentons had actually struck a deal?


Lillian caught the worry clouding Eleanor's face and immediately tried to reassure her. "Don't let her nonsense get to you. She's just bitter, can't stand seeing you happy. Trust me, I know Nolan, and he's not the type to dance on strings pulled by his family.The only one pushing this kind of thing is his grandfather-"


Her words died in her throat. The hall had gone silent.



Everyone's attention shifted to the staircase, where Norwood and Jeff were making their way down.


Their faces were serious, and the way they moved in step told everyone this was no casual appearance.Something important was about to be announced.


Lillian's heart sank like a stone.



Oh no.



This couldn't be good.


Her fears proved right a moment later when Norwood's gravelly voice carried across the hall.


"Tonight, on my birthday, I have a joyful announcement. We and the Bentons will be joining through marriage. Since Nolan and Lainey aren't ready to rush into a wedding, we'll begin with an engagement ceremony instead. I hope everyone will celebrate with us on that day."


There had been some back and forth-Benton wanted a wedding right away, but Norwood insisted on an engagement first.


In the end, they agreed to set it for the first of next month.



Of course, the details didn't matter to the guests. To them, the only thing that mattered was the alliance.


Some whispered that this alliance wouldn't just control the city;it could sway the entire nation.



Norwood, clearly delighted by the murmurs of approval, decided to drive the point home. His gaze swept the hall before stopping deliberately on Eleanor. "Now that everything is settled, I hope some woman will stop clinging to foolish dreams and spare herself further humiliation."



Though he hadn't said Eleanor's name, everyone knew who he meant.


A ripple of pity passed through the crowd. "What a shame. She's such a capable woman, but in the end, the rich never choose talent."


"She's fun company, sure, but thinking she could marry into the Stewarts? That was just a dream."
###Chapter 150 Don't Be Reckless





The crowd's hushed voices and judgmental glances didn't faze Eleanor. She remained completely unbothered.



She moved her eyes from face to face, hoping Nolan would appear.



He was nowhere to be found.



Perhaps Norwood had taken him away, maybe even locked him up somewhere.



Norwood always liked having the upper hand.


So what?



She refused to budge.


If Nolan couldn't break through for her, she would let him go.


She never wanted love to feel like a cage. Meanwhile, Lillian looked like she was about to explode. She was seconds away from starting a fight."Norwood's totally out of line! He..."


Before she could take a step, someone grabbed her arm.



Ryland appeared at her side, his expression more serious than usual. "Lillian, don't be reckless."


Even though the Stewart and the Brooks families were close, this mess still belonged to the Stewarts.It wasn't their place to get involved.



The tension in the room snapped when a loud crash echoed from the floor above.



Every head turned to see what happened.


The study door upstairs had been slammed open from inside.



At the threshold, Nolan lingered, his once crisp black suit now looking rumpled and worn.


There was a fierceness in his eyes that no one had seen before, and the air around him seemed to darken.



Without a word, he marched down the stairs. He made a beeline for Eleanor, wrapped his arms around her, and stood between her and everyone else.


Finally, he looked up, his eyes cold as he locked eyes with Norwood.



"I'm making this official as head of the Stewart family, the engagement with the Benton family is null and void. From now on, Eleanor is the only woman I'll call my wife."


After saying that, he paid no mind to anyone else. He reached for Eleanor's hand and walked out without another glance.


Everyone watched, stunned. No one had time to process what happened.


Norwood's anger boiled over. "Nolan! Come back here!"



He shook so hard that his cane wobbled as he pointed it at Nolan's back.


Nolan didn't slow down or look back.



The two of them disappeared in moments.


Suddenly, Norwood's rage caught up with him, and he collapsed to the floor.


"Mr.Stewart!"


"Somebody call for help!"


Chaos erupted throughout the room.


Jeff's face soured.



If Lainey hadn't been so determined to marry Nolan,he would never have put up with all the shame the Stewart family made him swallow.


If he didn't get a clear answer today, he was ready to end things for good.


Lainey read Jeff's mood and rushed to reassure him."Dad, please don't get upset. Nolan just learned the truth, so of course, he's going to push back. But the



engagement's already public, and there's no undoing it now. Just let him cool off. He'll comne to terms with it soon enough and let Eleanor go."


She was terrified that Jeff might break off the engagement in a fit of anger.


She couldn't allow that.



After everything she had done, she refused to give up now.



Nolan's anger meant nothing as long as Norwood stood by her.


She believed she would become Nolan's wife, no matter what.


Frustration burned inside Jeff. This was public humiliation for the Benton family.


But when he saw Lainey's cheer, he decided to hold his tongue.


No one noticed Hilda staring at the girl whose hand Nolan clutched so firmly. She didn't need proof anymore.


That was her daughter.


The photos hadn't prepared her for the sharp, gut-wrenching pain that hit now.


It was worse.



Her child had been humiliated today, and she hadn't been able to defend her.



Watching her husband fawn over the imposter made it even harder to breathe.



She couldn't waste any more time.


She needed to uncover the truth; she needed her daughter back.
###Chapter 151 This Is Truly A Medical Miracle!
Eleanor sensed someone was watching her, though she didn't bother to look back.


She stayed focused on Nolan's hand, taking in the lines of his knuckles.



Redness spread across his skin, and a few scrapes still oozed blood.


He must have hurt himself when he broke through that door.


From the car's emergency k<it, she grabbed some antiseptic swabs and drew his hand toward her. "Are you in pain?"


Nolan glanced down, taking in how careful and gentle she was.


Instead of answering, he flipped his hand so he could hold hers, brushed his lips over her knuckles, then lifted his eyes. They were full of quiet hurt. "It does,but nothing compares to the ache I feel inside."


She hadn't defended herself back there, and he could tell she was about to let go of him.


He blamed himself for mishandling everything,making her suffer because of his family.He couldn't really blame her if she wanted to give up.


Those words, and the memory of what she had been thinking earlier, made Eleanor's heart twist with guilt.


While dabbing at his wound, she kept her eyes elsewhere, careful not to meet his stare.


After a long pause, she finally tried to explain, "Don't get the wrong idea.I just..."


Before she could finish, Ryland's urgent voice cut in from outside the car. "Nolan, something's happened.Your grandpa collapsed, and they took him to the hospital!"


Nolan's hand closed tighter around hers. She caught the worry on his face, so she gave his hand a gentle pat. "Don't stress. We'll go check on him together."


He looked at her then, emotion flickering in his eyes.


No matter what happened, he couldn't bring himself to resent Norwood.



A few seconds passed before he finally spoke, his voice low and deliberate."Alright."


At the hospitall, Norwood still hadn't woken up.


A team of doctors crowded the bed, their faces grim.


As soon as Nolan stepped inside, the doctors ushered him out of the room for a quiet conversation in the office.



Back in the hospital room, only Eleanor and Norwood remained. He lay there, silent and unmoving.


Eleanor moved closer to the bed and checked the monitor before studying Norwood's face.


 
He looked weak, with pale lips and an angry flush across his forehead.


His body had clearly reacted badly to the shock of all the emotional turmoil.


If nobody stepped in quickly, theconsequences could be dire, even fatal.


He was still Nolan's grandfather.


She couldn't bring herself to just stand by and do nothing.


With that thought, Eleanor quietly reached into her bag for a compact medical kit.


She picked out the needles and started working without hesitation.


Bit by bit, the erratic lines on the screen started to settle.



Norwood's eyelids fluttered before he finally opened his eyes.


When he caught sight of Eleanor by his bedside, he erupted at once. "Get out! Our family will never  accept someone like you!"


Nolan heard the uproar and entered in a rush, the doctors right on his heels.


The medical team stared at the monitor, then at Norwood, shocked to see him conscious and yelling.


"This is truly a medical miracle! By all accounts, the patient shouldn't have woken up this easily. He shouldn't be talking right now, let alone shouting.Can anyone explain what just happened?"


Nolan's attention shifted from the stable readings to his grandfather's face, then landed on Eleanor. He understood immediately what she had done.


Eleanor barely reacted. She gave Norwood a calm look and, in an even voice, said, "He's out of danger now, so l'll go."


Her only reason for being there was Nolan. Now that his grandfather was safe, her job was done.


Whatever insults Norwood hurled at her didn't bother her anymore. Without another word, she left the hospital room.
###Chapter 152 Go After Her, And I'll Disown You
"Eleanor!" Nolan called out, following her without hesitating for a moment.


He had barely taken a step when harsh coughing rang out behind him. Norwood's furious voice cut through the air. "Nolan, go after her, and I'll disown you,do you hear me?"


Nolan stopped in place, refusing to look back.


Hle stood there, rigid and cold as stone.


Norwood caught the hesitation and thought he had finally gotten through to his grandson. With labored breaths, he played his last hand. "This is the last time I'll ask. Will you be engaged to Lainey or not? Refuse,and I'll move into a nursing home tomorrow!"


Just outside the room, Eleanor heard every word as she left. She paused for a split second, but she didn't turn around or wait. She simply walked into the elevator and disappeared.


The echo of her footsteps left Nolan's heart aching.


He turned to face his grandfather at last, his voice turning icy. "Grandpa, Eleanor is the only person I'll ever love. That will never change."


There was no room for argument in the way he spoke. "And if you want to move out and find some peace, I'll make sure you get the quietest, most comfortable place possible. No one will disturb you."


The entire room went silent.



Even the doctors seemed to hold their breath in shock.



Everyone could see this wasn't obedience; it was Nolan standing his ground.



"You're such a disappointment!" Norwood shouted so furious that the edges of his sight turned hazy. He never thought the grandson he raised would turn against himn like this. All for the sake of a woman.


Nolan didn't bother to say anything else. He glanced at the attending doctor, giving him a silent message.


The doctor caught on right away. He hurried over to check Norwood's vitals, speaking softly tocalm him down. "Mr. Stewart, please try to relax. You've just regained consciousness, and getting worked up isn't good for your recovery."


Nolan sent a final look in Norwood's direction,then walked out of the room.



Norwood's desperate voice trailed after him. "What did I do to deserve a grandson like him?!"


Meanwhile, Hilda had arrived at the hospital. As she turned down the hallway, she spotted Eleanor leaving, every step purposeful. Her heart squeezed with recognition; her daughter was right there.


She almost moved to go after her, acting on pure instinct. A soft voice pulled her back.


"Mom, where are you headed?"


Lainey had slipped up beside her, slipping an arm through hers with an affectionate smile.


Hilda stopped short, holding back the words she wanted to say.



She glanced at Lainey and forced a smile. "I left the supplements I got for Norwood in the car. I'll go and get them."



Lainey shook her head. "Forget about the supplements for now. Let's see Norwood first and show him we care. We can bring the supplements after we've checked on him."



Without waiting for an answer, she steered Hilda toward the elevator.



With no other choice, Hilda followed along, her chest tight with regret over missing another chance to connect with her daughter. When they stepped into Norwood's room, he was propped up against the pillows, his face still dark and worn.



At the sight of Lainey, he seemed to relax a little.There was finally a trace of approval in his tired eyes.


At least this girl knew to visit first.


He gave Hilda a brief nod before focsing on Lainey."Keep working at it. If you manage to get Nolan to let go of Eleanor, I'll see to it myself that you two get married."



As she heard this, Lainey's heart soared. To her, this sounded like a promise from Norwood.


Everything she hoped for was finally within reach.


She did her best to hide her excitement and answered with a gentle nod, "I'll give it everything l have,Norwood."



Norwood felt even more pleased.


In his eyes, Lainey had the composure and charm a  proper lady should possess.


Eleanor was a different story. She always struck him as wild and headstrong, clearly not the type to settle down.


Meanwhile, Hilda lingered by the side, completely distracted. She couldn't·stop thinking about Eleanor's distant figure, the image haunting her thoughts. She barely registered the conversation between Norwood and Lainey.


After a moment, she made up an excuse to step out.


Finding Denny waiting in the hallway, she leaned in close and spoke quietly. "Look into everything Eleanor Warren's been up to lately. I want details.Keep this between us, and don't say a word to Jeff."


Denny,who had served the Bentons for years, looked surprised by her tone.


He nodded respectfully. "Understood, Mrs. Benton."
###Chapter 153 You're Never Getting Rid Of Me
 Lainey waited until Norwood had dozed off before slipping out of the hospital room.


The moment the door closed behind her, the sweet,gentle look she wore disappeared completely,replaced by the hungry ambition burning inside her.



It was only a matter of time before she became Nolan's wife.



Her top priority was to get rid of Jonny.



Her current marriage would only drag her down.Even if she managed to push Eleanor out of the picture,being married to a man like Jonny would ruin her chances.



With that thought, she pulled out her phone and quietly removed Jonny from her block list. Days later, Jonny nearly thought he was hallucinating when a message from Lainey popped up, inviting him out.



Overjoyed, he took extra care in dressing that day,even stopping by a florist to pick up a bouquet of fresh roses before heading to the café she had chosen.



"Lainey, you finally agreed to see me," he said, voice thick with longing.



For a brief second, Lainey's gaze flicked to the flowers. Then, with a sneer, she pulled a folder from her bag and tossed it across the table. "Sign it."


Jonny froze, staring down at the papers.


When his eyes landed on the bold words at the top,anger instantly flashed across his face. "Lainey, are you kidding me?"


She had texted him saying she missed him, but what she gave him was a divorce agreement.


Lainey reclined lazily in her seat, her expression  laced with ridicule. She lifted her cup gracefully,sipping with deliberate poise.


"lf I hadn't said that, do you think you'd be sitting here now? Let's not drag this out. It's pointless. If you sign now, you'll still walk away with something. But if you wait until my father steps in, neither you nor Todd Group will have a way out," she said.


His pride, already hanging by a thread, snapped in that instant.



His hands shook as he clenched his teeth. "Keep dreaming!"



Lainey laughed softly, as though his defiance amused her. "Don't be so hasty. Look at the terms first."



Of course, she had come prepared. She wouldn't have staged this meeting otherwise.


And sure enough, when Jonny's eyes landed on the figures written in black and white, his confidence wavered. A billion dollars.



The agreement offered him a billion.


With that money, Todd Group could rise again from the ashes.



But then the other side of the scale tipped into his mind-Lainey's new position as the Benton family's daughter. That identity alone was worth far more than the billion sitting on the table.



Even just ten percent of the Benton Group's shares wouuld amount to tens of billions.



With Jeff's doting nature, Lainey could easily gain such a share, and as long as they remained married,it would all count as marital assets.


One billion might have tempted him for a moment,but compared to tens of billions? The choice was a no-brainer.


And on top of that, he still had a bit of dirt on Lainey he could use against her. He leaned forward, his lips curving into a threatening grin. "Lainey, what do you suppose your parents or Norwood would say if I let slip what you did abroad?"

The color drained from her face in an instant. Her fingers trembled as she snatched up the coffee cup,ready to hurl it at him in a blind burst of rage.

But Jonny was quicker. He caught her wrist firmly, his voice cutting like ice. "Face it, sweetheart. You're never getting rid of me. Not in this lifetime."


He released her with a shove, adjusted the collar of his suit, and walked away wearing the smug air of a man who believed he had already won.


Lainey's body gave out, and she crumpled against the chair, her chest heaving with fury and terror.


Damn him.


If she had to, she would make him pay with his life.


By the time she got back to the Benton family's estate, Lainey had already put on her act. She messed up her hair, smudged her makeup a little, and made herself look weak and pitiful before walking in.


The moment Jeff saw her, his chest tightened in pain.





"Lainey!" he called out, rushing toward her. "Tell me,who did this to you?"


Lainey flinched at his tone, shrinking back like a frightened child. Her lips trembled as she whispered,"Dad, l-I'm fine. I just... I just fell. That's all."
###Chapter 154 | Just Want To Know Her Better
Rage filled Jeff's eyes, and his voice shook. "Lainey,tell me exactly what happened. I promise, I'll fight for you."


He felt ready to take on anyone, even royalty, if it meant avenging his daughter.


Lainey slipped easily into her usual act.



She kept insisting she had only slipped and fallen.


After Jeff pressed her with question after question,she finally gave in, her tone wavering. "It was Jonny.He claimed the Todd Group was in trouble and wanted me to get money from you. I refused him,and that's when he..."


Her sentence faded, but the sadness on her face was unmistakable. A man who would lay a hand on his own wife for money, Jeff thought he was the lowest of the low.


Fury made Jeff's whole body tremble, veins throbbing at his temples.



"Jonny crossed the line!" he shouted. "Where is he?I'll handle this mnyself!"


He made to leave, but Lainey caught his arm.


"Dad, don't! Please stay here." She clung to him,desperate. "He said all sorts of lies, calling me reckless while I was abroad. If those rumors start to spread, especially to the Stewarts, what am l supposed to do?"


Jeff lost what little patience he had left.


Jonny had crossed every line, first with violence,then by dragging Lainey's name through the mud.


Absolutely shameless!



There was no way he would ever let his daughter  stay mixed up with someone that foul.

Gripping Lainey's hand, he promised, "Don't worry.I'll end your marriage to him myself. I'll hire the best lawyer in the city and make sure Jonny leaves empty-handed."


He gave her a reassuring look. "And about the Stewarts? As long as I'm around, no one's going to lay a finger on you."


Feeling comforted, Lainey leaned against his shoulder and whispered, "You really are the best,Dad."



While the two of them were busy planning the divorce, Hilda had already made her way to the entrance of Hope House.



Seeing Eleanor even for a second at the hospital had shaken her to her core.



She couldn't wait any longer. She had to see her daughter, even if it meant nothing more than a brief meeting.



Every bit of caution and advice about biding her time faded away.


None of that mattered.



Eleanor was her child.


She needed no proof, no one else's permission, no more waiting.


Her heart knew the truth, and that was enough.


Word had reached Hilda that Eleanor had come straight here after leaving the hospital.


She planned to go in right away and seek her out.


To her surprise, Myah explained that Eleanor had just left, heading out with Fannie only afew minutes before.



Disappointment washed over Hilda all over again,heavy and familiar.


She forced herself to smile, hiding her regret. "That's unfortunate,"she said softly.


After a brief silence, a thought came to her, and she continued, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but...Could you tell me about Eleanor when she was little?I'd love to hear about her favorite foods, what she liked to wear, what she played with, anything at all.I just want to know her better."



Worried she might seem strange, she quickly added,"It's just, | feel such a connection to her. Even if we aren't related, I'd still like to understand who she is."


Myah gave Hilda a long look, suddenly struck by how much she resembled Eleanor.


The last time they had met, it had been in passing and easy to miss.


But now, the similarities were hard to ignore. Maybe,just maybe, there was something more to it. Guided by a sense of fate, Myah began sharing stories from Eleanor's childhood.



Nostalgia colored her words, while Hilda listened in silence, her heart aching with every memory, and the conversation lingered on and on.
###Chapter 155 Jonny's Been Charged With Domestic Violence
Eleanor remained unaware of everything unfolding at the Hope House.


Once Fannie swept her away from Hope House, she soon found herself standing in a villa she had never seen before.



Even so, something about the furnishings gave her a sense of déjà vu.



The moment they stepped inside, Fannie smacked her own forehead and bolted upstairs. "Oh no,Eleanor! I totally forgot, I still have homework I need to finish!"



So this must be another one of the Stewart family's properties.


Clearly, Fannie had brought her here on Nolan's behalf. Eleanor's guess proved right. No sooner had Fannie disappeared upstairs than Nolan emerged from the study.



A few days had passed since their paths last crossed at the hospital.


Nolan hadn't been avoiding her; Eleanor simply thought Norwood's recovery should come first.There would be time to reconnect once his health was no longer hanging in the balance.



Waiting around wasn't something Nolan could stand.



He moved in close, every bit of his confidence on display. "Did you miss me these past few days?"


Eleanor edged away, keeping her tone as cool as ever. "If there's nothing important, I should get going."


To her surprise, Nolan raised his hand, putting on an exaggeratedly wounded look. "You really have changed, haven't you? You don't even care anymore." She almost teased him for being over the top, but then she caught sight of his swollen, red hand, a sure sign of infection.



Had he done this just for sympathy?



That would be just like him.



He noticed her skepticism and made himself look even more pathetic.



"When I got back, Grandpa punished me again. I've barely eaten or slept since then, just thinking about you. My hand got worse. I never thought you'd be the one to doubt me."



A gentle mix of woodsy cologne and medicine clung to the air around him.



Guilt washed over Eleanor, and her voice softened."Maybe... I should make dinner tonight to make it up to you."



No sooner had the words left her mouth than an arm wrapped tightly around her waist.  The world spun for a moment and suddenly she was sitting on his lap.


Nolan bent close, his breath warm against her ear.


"My heart's in pieces. Do you really think one meal would be enough to fix that?" he said, moving in for a kiss.



At that moment, Ryland burst through the door,waving a bottle of wine and grinning from ear to ear."Nolan, tonight we drink until we can't stand!"


Erick followed close behind, calm as always.



Eleanor,flustered, scrambled to slip off Nolan's lap.


It dawned on Ryland that he had barged in at exactly the wrong time.


He shot Erick a look and mumbled, "So, do you think we're too early or way too late?"


Not wanting to get caught up in the mess, Erick grabbed Ryland by the wrist and started hauling him toward the door. "Let's leave. Now."  Just as they arrived at the entrance, Erick paused, as if something had clicked in his mind. With clear hesitation, he turned back. "Boss, this is the information you asked for."



Without waiting for a response, he turned and rushed out.



Nolan stared at the empty doorway, looking utterly defeated.



Just his luck., The one time he got Eleanor close, his friends had to ruin the moment.



Eleanor found his glum face too funny to ignore.


She sauntered over and slipped her fingers under his tie, giving it a gentle pull.


They ended up just inches apart.



Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she looked up."So this is your idea of missing me so much you can't eat or sleep? You invite the whole crew to a party?"



She couldn't hide the teasing in her voice. Nolan opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say a word, someone slowly poked their head through the doorway, eyes scanning the room with care.



Coming back into view was Ryland, making yet another appearance.


Ryland kept his gaze fixed anywhere but on Nolan.


"Oh, almost forgot. Jonny's been charged with domestic violence. Lainey's lawyer is handling the divorce now. Just thought you'd want to know. Sorry for the interruption,again!" He took off in a hurry, not wanting to give Nolan the chance to get even.
###Chapter 156 Here's Her Number





Quiet settled over the living room once again.


A small, amused smile played on Eleanor's lips.


Lainey and Jonny were battling it out in court?


None of it mattered to her anymore.


She let go of Nolan's tie and stepped away, putting some space between them. "I'm heading to the kitchen. Don't move from there," she said.



Before she could take a step, his hand slipped around her wrist, gentle but unyielding.


Nolan wouldn't let go, clinging as if the slightest gap would make her disappear.



With a weary sigh, Eleanor gave in. "Changed your mind about dinner?" she asked, eyebrow raised.


Only then did Nolan finally release her hand. Downstairs again, Fannie appeared out of nowhere,filling the space with her cheerful chatter.


Because Nolan was still recovering, Eleanor stuck to cooking light, homemade dishes that were easy on the stomach.



While Fannie savored every bite, Nolan barely noticed his plate; his thoughts were elsewhere.



He found himself stealing glances at Eleanor again and again.



Simple food, shared company, Nolan realized this was what home truly felt like.


Even after the meal, he refused to part with Eleanor,insisting that she keep him company while he worked through some papers.


Eleanor, with no other choice, waited patiently by his side.



Not until the night had stretched on did Nolan finally give in, choosing to drive Eleanor home himself. They pulled up in front of her apartment building, the car rolling to a quiet stop.


Eleanor clicked off her seatbelt, eased the door open, and stepped out. "Get home safe, okay?"


Nolan stayed quiet, not moving an inch.


She glanced back, confused, and found him watching her with the saddest eyes-a look that could melt anyone's resolve.


Light from the streetlamp spilled through the window, softening his features and leaving him with the expression of a lonely pup watching someone walk away.


Here he went again with those sad eyes.


Eleanor couldn't help feeling a mix of annoyance and affection. She leaned across the console, pressed a quick kiss to his lips, and said, "There, now head home."



Before Nolan could process what had happened,she slipped out of the car, closed the door behind her, and hurried into the apartment building.


She moved with quick, seamless grace.


Nolan sat there, watching her figure disappear into the distance. His fingers brushed his lips, lingering on the warmth she left behind.



Her scent and the feel of her kiss lingered, refusing to fade.


He.stayed frozen for a moment, then an involuntary smile crept across his face.


He couldn't wait for the day when they would be married, then he could watch her walk in beside him instead of leaving him behind.


Still, he knew Eleanor valued her independence.


She wasn't the type to settle for anything that felt like a cage. Convincing her to take that step with him wouldn't be easy, and the journey ahead promised to be anything but simple. The night passed in peaceful silence.


By morning, Eleanor slipped back into her routine,heading to Hope House to see the children.



Life had been hectic, leaving her with little time for them.



Just yesterday, the kids had clung to her,complaining that she didn't care for them anymore.


With her schedule finally clear, she made up her mind to spend the whole day there.


Eleanor started her day at the mall, picking out bags full of toys, then hopped into a cab and headed straight for Hope House.



No sooner had she set the bags down than Myah called her over, "Eleanor, a woman came asking about you yesterday. She's been here before, and l think she has something important to discuss. Here's her number. Reach out whenever you have time."


Myah didn't bring up their striking resemblance To her, nothing revealed the truth quite like meeting face-to-face.



If Hilda really was Eleanor's mother,they would feel it in their hearts the moment they met.


If not, there was no point in stirring up anxiety with guesses.


Eleanor, completely unaware that the woman was Hilda,saved the contact without a second thought.


She flashed Myah a quick smile. "Thanks, Myah. I'm going to play with the kids now."


The morning passed in a blur of games and laughter.Just before lunch,Eleanor sent a quick message to the number, arranging a meeting at Verdant Crest.
###Chapter 157 What's With The Fancy Getup
Hilda could hardly contain her excitement when the message arrived, tears of joy welled up in her eyes.


Her daughter Had finally reached for her.


They were finally going to see each other, what outfit would feel right for such a moment?


And what gift could possibly match the weight of the occasion?


The nerves were clearly getting to her, so she brought in a personal stylist to help craft a look that reflected warmth and quiet grace, something fitting for a poised, loving mother.


Jeff's eyes landed on Hilda's polished look, and confusion crept in. "What's with the fancy getup?You didn't even go all out like this for Lainey's recognition event." Too distracted to engage, Hilda brushed him off with a quick excuse. "I'm heading to Verdant Crest to catch up with an old friend. Don't worry, it's just another woman."



She was careful with her answer, worried that Jeff might want to tag along if he sensed anything was amiss.



Jeff fully believed in Lainey, and seeing her alongside Eleanor could shatter that trust in an instant.


With her plans set, Hilda left the house in high spirits,leaving Jeff with no option but to watch her go.


Not long after, Lainey came downstairs, stretching and stifling a yawn. "Where's Mom?" she asked.


Jeff nodded toward the door, still puzzled. "She just left. Said she's meeting an old friend at Verdant Crest. I've never seen her that happy, not even on our wedding day."


Without much thought, Lainey gave a shrug and dismissed it. She had wanted to borrow some jewelry from Hilda,planning a spa day with her friends.


Being a Benton meant always looking the part, so she needed something suitable.


Hilda's absence didn't faze her. She was happy to help herself.


She explained things to Jeff, then went straight to her parents' room.


Inside, she found drawers overflowing with glittering jewelry.


Lainey's eyes widened with delight as she sifted through the treasures.


It felt like a goldmine.


All of this would eventually belong to her once Hilda was gone.


And even now, while Hilda still breathed, there was no harm in slowly making it hers.


As her daughter, slipping on a few pieces of jewelry  didn't seem unreasonable, did it?


With a spark of excitement, Lainey eagerly picked out a few pieces she deemed just right.



Right before turning to go, her eyes caught a glimpse of a photo hidden underneath the jewelry box.


Curiosity getting the better of her, she picked it up.


The image sent a jolt through her.


It was Eleanor.



Eleanor's face stared up at her from the photo.


Jeff had mentioned how cheerful Hilda seemed as she left earlier. Could Hilda actually be meeting Eleanor?



The idea rattled Lainey.



No. She wouldn't let things spiral out of her control.


True or not, she needed answers.


She hoped that Hilda wasn't meeting Eleanor. But if Hilda was, then she had to act fast and figure out her next move.



One thing was certain. There was no way she would let anyone take her place as a Benton.


Without hesitation, Lainey messaged her friends to cancel their spa plans, then made her way to the door in a rush.


Before stepping out, she doubled back to her room,opened a small safe in the corner, and pulled out a packet of white powder.


After handling that, she dashed out of the house,leaving Jeff baffled by the sudden chaos.



What was with everyone today?


As Jeff remained deep in thought, Hilda had already made it to Verdant Crest.



She got there thirty minutes early, unable to contain her nerves.



Taking a seat by the window, she gazed outside,  anticipation growing with every minute.


Then, at last, she saw the familiar silhouette appear at the entrance. The sight brought tears to her eyes.


After all this time, she had found her daughter. The pain of losing her never left.


More than twenty years of waiting, longing, and regret had weighed on her heart every day.


She had kept up a strong front for the sake of her three sons, but each night, loneliness and sorrow closed in, the memories of her lost-daughter haunting her.


No one could possibly understand what it meant.


This was her daughter, her own flesh and blood, the baby she had cradled through endless nights.
###Chapter 158 Didn't You Already Find Your Daughter

It seemed that Eleanor sensed Hilda's gaze.


Almost unconsciously, she lifted her eyes and froze when they locked with Hilda's. For a beat, neither of them moved.



Eleanor, especially, needed a second to steady herself. Hilda? The name clicked in her mind, and she suddenly remembered Lillian and Nolan once saying how much she looked like Hilda.



Back then, she had brushed it off, but standing face-to-face with the woman now, even she was unsettled. The resemblance was undeniable.



But how could that be?



Weren't her parents long gone? Was it pure coincidence, or was there something more? Her thoughts scattered when Hilda suddenly rose from her seat and hurried toward her, grasping her hand with trembling fingers.


"My dear, have you been well all these years?" Her voice cracked, gentle but weighed down with pain.


Eleanor was taken aback. Well? How could life have possibly been well?


An orphanage, no matter how decent, could never replace a home.



A daughter who should have grown up surrounded by comfort had instead spent over two decades in hardship.


And even after building a future for herself, she had been dragged through heartbreak and humiliation,al because of her origins.


Hilda's chest ached with regret. This was her fault,hers alone.



She should never have insisted on returning to the country. If she hadn't, her child would never have been lost.


Eleanor could feel the rush of emotion in Hilda's voice, but she didn't quite know how to respond.


Realizing she had gone too far, Hilda quickly let go of Eleanor's hand. "Forgive me. I don't know what came over me. You simply feel so familiar. Almost like the daughter | lost. Please don't think badly of me...I just...miss her."


As she looked at her, Eleanor's heart wavered.


Even with countless questions running through her mind, she cautiously asked, "But Mrs. Benton, didn't you already find your daughter?"


As she thought of Lainey, Hilda's face twisted with disdain.



"That girl? Impossible. My daughter looked just like me when she was little. And as she grew up, there's no way she would turn out looking nothing like me."


Hilda's eyes softened as they fell on Eleanor. In a low murmur, she added, "If anything, she should've  grown up to resemble me the way you do."


The words lingered, and the space between them fell into an awkward silence.



Eleanor's heart pounded in confusion. Unable to withstand Hilda's searching eyes, she abruptly rose to her feet. "I... excuse me. I need to use the restroom."



Hilda, realizing she had let her eagerness show too plainly, did not stop her.


She simply sat back and watched her go.


From the corner of the hall, Lainey had been observing.



So that explained why Hilda had been treating her so strangely all this time. From the very beginning, Hilda hadn't believed that she was her daughter.



Lainey's pulse quickened. She didn't know how Eleanor and Hilda had managed to cross paths, but from the looks of it, this had been their first meeting. With that cold reassurance, her eyes grew darker and more dangerous.
###Chapter 159 You Should Prepare YourseIf For The Worst
Danger was quietly closing in, and Hilda had no idea.


Not long after, a waitress walked over with a cup of steaming coffee, her smile polite and professional."Ma'am, the coffee you had earlier has been sitting for a while. It might have gone cold. I've brought you a fresh one."



Her tone was warm, and her reasoning sounded perfectly normal.


Hilda didn't think twice. She nodded, accepting the offer.



The waitress set the cup down and placed it in front of her. "Please enjoy," she said softly before heading back toward the front desk.



Feeling thirsty, Hilda lifted the cup and took a sip.The taste was fine, so she had a few more. But within moments, her body gave way. Darkness swallowed her, and she collapsed on the table before she could call out for help.


Gasps and shouts erupted from nearby diners.


"Oh my God! What happened?"


A few rushed to dial 911, while others crowded around in shock.



The commotion grew, drawing the attention of the waitress who had served her.



When her eyes landed on Hilda, lying motionless on the table, her blood ran cold.


This wasn't what she signed up for.


She had been told the drug would only upset the woman's stomach, and nothing life-threatening.


But looking at her now, so still and pale... what if she had really killed her?


Her hands shook as panic set in. No money in the world was worth this.She bolted out of the restaurant, disappearing before anyone could question her.


Minutes later, an ambulance pulled up. Inside the restroom, Eleanor heard the noise outside but didn't think much of it.



She splashed some cold water on her face,steadying her emotions, and finally stepped back out.


But when she returned to the dining area, the table where Hilda had been sitting was empty.


She frowned and quickly stopped a waiter passing by. "Excuse me, the lady who was just sitting here,where did she go?"


The waiter was still rattled, patting his chest before answering. "She had some kind of medical emergency. They rushed her off in an ambulance.Honestly, it didn't look good. Her face was pale,almost bluish. I don't think she'll make it."


Eleanor didn't wait to hear more. Her stomach dropped as she grabbed her bag and sprinted out of the restaurant.



By the time she reached the hospital, her nerves were frayed. Spotting a doctor stepping out of the emergency room, she rushed forward. "Hello, please,can you tell me if a lady named Hilda Benton was just brought in? How is she?"



Her voice trembled with urgency, edged with fear.


The doctor, assuming she was family, let out a heavy sigh. "Her condition is very serious. She was brought in too late... you should prepare yourself for the worst."



Eleanor slowly let go of the doctor's hand, her mind spinning.



Hilda was going to die?


They had only met once, and before she could find the truth, Hilda might be gone forever?


The thought of never seeing her again squeezed Eleanor's chest tight.  No.



Hilda couldn't die.



She had to save her.



She had to do something, anything.


Her hand was just about to reach for the emergency room door when Jeff and Lainey rushed in.


Jeff, thinking she was about to cause trouble, yanked her back several steps. "What do you think you're doing? Why are you here?"


Eleanor barely managed to steady herself, her lips parting, but no words came out.


Lainey, standing close by, covered her mouth in shock. "Did my mom go to see you? Otherwise,why would you be here?"



Jeff froze at her words, then glanced at Eleanor's pale, stunned face. Suddenly, his eyes filled with rage.


"You hurt Lainey, and now you're after my wife too?  How could you be this heartless?" His voice rose as he jabbed a finger at her. "Get out! Don't stand in the doctors' way. If anything happens to my wife, I swear I'll make you and the Stewart family pay for it!"


With that, he shoved her toward the side.


Eleanor's throat tightened. She opened her mouth,but not a single explanation came out.


Why did it sting so much? Weren't they just strangers?
###Chapter 160 | Won't Leave You,Eleanor
Eleanor, lost in her thoughts, stumbled a few steps.


However, before she could fall, a firm, steady hand reached out and caught her.



It was Nolan. She hadn't even noticed when he arrived, but now he was standing in front of her,shielding her like a wall. His presence was sharp and intimidating as his cold eyes cut across to Jeff. "Mr.Benton, until the truth is clear, you'd better hold off on throwing accusations."



Jeff opened his mouth to argue, but justthen,the doors of the emergency room burst open.



He rushed forward, grabbing the doctor's hand anxiously. "Doctor, how's my wife? Is she okay?"


"She's out of immediate danger..." the doctor began. Eleanor didn't hear the rest.


Nolan gently guided her toward the elevator.


Inside, he ignored the curious stares. His only concern was her, holding her close until they reached his villa in Regal Heights.


Eleanor was still in shock.


Hilda's face kept flashing in her mind again and again. The resemblance was so unsettling, it left her rattled.



Once home, Nolan led her to the master bedroom upstairs. He tucked her in carefully, his voice low and steady. "Don't think about anything right now. Leave it to me."



He leaned down, pressed a soft kiss to her forehead,and walked out.



Eleanor stared blankly at his retreating back, then finally shut her eyes.


By the time Nolan reached the first floor, his gentle expression had hardened into steel. "Investigate," he ordered flatly. "Every staff member at Verdant Crest today, every second of surveillance footage, inside and out. I want the full picture."


Erick didn't dare hesitate. "I'm on it, Mr. Stewart."


Knowing how fragile Eleanor was, Nolan had her stay in the villa that night.


He kept his distance, not wanting to disturb her.


The next morning, he entered the bedroom with a glass of milk in hand, his tone soft with worry. "You're awake? Wash up first, then drink this."


Eleanor sat up slowly, but her appetite wasn't there.Meeting his gaze, she said quietly, "I want to go to the hospital to see Mrs.Benton."


She knew she probably shouldn't, but her emotions were all over the place.


For the first time in her life, she felt like she was losing control, letting her heart lead instead of her mind. No matter how much she tried, she couldn't shake the memory of the way Hilda had looked at her, with such warmth, with such love.


She thought maybe she could use her medical skills to help Hilda somehow, to do something, anything,for her.



Nolan seemed to catch the shift in her expression.He gave her hand a light squeeze. "Alright. Eat something first, then I'll go with you."


Eleanor nodded and quietly got out of bed, following his lead.



The drive to the hospital was wrapped in silence.



Eleanor kept her gaze fixed on the window,watching the world rush by in a blur. But her thoughts wouldn't stay quiet. "Nolan," she finally said, her voice low,"do you think is it possible I'm really their daughter?"


She didn't wait for his answer. The words poured out on their own.



"When I was little, I used to imagine what my parents looked like. I'd tell myself they must have loved me a lot...they just lost me by accident. Sometimes I even dreamed they'd walk into Hope House one day and take me home."



Sadness laced her voice as she continued, "But then one day, Myah told me... both my parents had already passed away. After that, I stopped dreaming about them. I forced myself to be strong, to depend on no one but myself. And then yesterday, I saw Mrs.Benton."



The pain in her words was clear. Nolan listened without interrupting, his chest tight with ache.


He held her cold hand firmly and spoke softly. "We'll find out the truth. And no matter what it is, I'll be right here. I won't leave you, Eleanor. Not ever."


Her eyes lingered on his for a long moment before a faint smile finally broke through. "Okay."


The Regal Heights wasn't far from the hospital.


Before long, their car pulled into the underground garage.


Eleanor drew a slow breath, steeling herself as she stepped into the elevator.


But the moment the doors slid open and she walked out, her steps faltered.


Right in front of her was a face that felt strangely familiar.


It wasn't the exact same as hers, but the resemblance was uncanny. If he hadn't been a man,she thought, the similarity between them might have been even stronger
###Chapter 161 This Is Your Eldest Brother


The man froze at the sight of Eleanor, clearly taken aback. For a moment, he just stared before steadying himself."You must be-"

Bofore he couldfinish, Jeff appeared with Lainey at his side.

Jeff's eyes swept over Eleanor and Nolan with clear disdain, but he ignored themn and turned to Lainey."Lainey, this is your eldest brother, Fraser."

Lainey's expression softened instantly into a timid, pitiful look. "Fraser,"she whispered.

Her voice quivered as if weighed down by guilt."I'm so sorry, Fraser. This is all because of me. If it weren't for me, Mom never would've come back to the country. If she hadn't returned, maybe none of this would've happened."

Her voice trembled as she spoke, her head sinking lower and lower until her expression was hidden. Behind that soft demeanor, though, her thoughts were far darker.

She had believed the medicine would be enough to end Hilda's life.

But Hilda somehow had survived.

That meant she had to come up with a new plan,and one that would make sure Hilda never opened her eyes again.

Only then would she truly secure her place as a Benton.

Fraser Benton let out a faint frown and answered with a casual "hmm."

His eyes moved to Lainey, yet he felt no real connection with her.

Strangely, it was Eleanor who caught his attention right away.

Her face looked so much like Hilda's in her old photos that it stirred a surprising sense of closeness, almost like family.

Lainey immediately caught on to where his attention had drifted, and her heart skipped. A prickle of unease shot through her. Quickly, she piped up, "Fraser, no matter what she said, don't believe her. Mom fell sick right after meeting her yesterday!"

Jeff's tone was heavy with accusation as he added, "Miss Warren, isn't that why you came today? Just to check if my wife managed to survive?"

His words nearly branded Eleanor a murderer.

But Eleanor didn't flinch. Meeting his gaze, she spoke evenly. "Mr. Benton, I know you're worried about your wife, but I won't admit to something I didn't do. It's true, I met Mrs. Benton yesterday. But when the incident happened, I was in the restroom. I don't know what took place. If you doubt me, check the restaurant's security footage or report it to the police. Let them investigate."

At the mention of the police, Lainey's composure cracked for a spli second, and she quickly grabbed Jeff's sleeve. "Dad, don't waste time on her. Right now, Mom's health comes first. We can deal with this after she wakes up."

Jeff scoffed, his tone cold as he looked away. "My daughter knows what's important. Not like some people who only know how to make excuses."

Nolan, who had been silent until now, stepped forward.

He positioned himself in front of Eleanor, his eyes turning sharp, his voice low and cutting.. Benton, I'd advise you to mind your words when speaking to my girlfriend."

Jeff's jaw tightened. He wasn't the type to back down. "Respect is earned, not handed out."

The tension between them thickened, ready to spark into something bigger. But before it could, Eleanor tugged lightly at Nolan's sleeve. "Forget it. Let's go."

She couldn't let Nolan, with his reputation and standing, get dragged into this because of her.

Besides, with the Benton family standing guard, she couldn't even get near Hilda, let alone treat her. Just as the two were about to enter the elevator, Jeff's voice suddenly came from Hilda's hospital room.

"Baby, you're awake! How are you feeling?"

Eleanor froze for a heartbeat. Her steps faltered, yet she forced herself to step inside the elevator without looking back.
###Chapter 162 Set A Meeting With Eleanor Warren


Inside the hospital room, Hilda slowly opened her eyes, though her vision was still hazy.

Her gaze swept across the room, searching for someone. When she realized Eleanor wasn't there, her chest tightened. That brief spark of hope she had held onto dimmed almost instantly,leaving behind only disappointment.

A doctor soon walked in, brisk and professional, giving her a careful checkup.

"Her vitals are stable, and she's fully conscious," he explained as he removed his stethoscope, addressing the Benton family gathered nearby. "For now, she's out of immediate danger. But her condition is fragile.She must avoid stress or any strong emotional shocks."

Jeff let out a long breath of relief at those words. His shoulders finally loosened, and he clasped Hilda's hand tightly, his voice thick with emotion. "Honey, you don't know how terrified I was. I thought I'd lost you."

Not far away, Lainey's fingers curled so tightly against her palm that her knuckles turned white.

She hadn't expected Hilda to wake up this soon. She hadn't even had the chance to take further steps.

No,this was dangerous.

If Hilda had the chance to talk about Eleanor or, worse, see her again, everything Lainey had fought for would crumble.

With so many people around, she couldn't risk doing anything reckless just yet. Still, she had to move fast,because if Hilda managed to tell Jeff and Fraser about Eleanor, it would all be over.

Forcing herself to stay composed, Lainey quickly put on a mask of sorrow and concern. She let her eyes brim with tears as she stepped closer to the bed. "Mom, you don't know how worried we were. We've been so scared for you."

She sat down gently at the bedside, brushing her hand over Hilda's in a tender gesture. 
But Hilda subtly pulled her hand away and, feigning fatigue, shut her eyes. She didn't want to waste a single word on Lainey.

If it weren't for Lainey's interference, she would have already reunited with Eleanor.

Now, with her energy so weak, the only way to guard her heart was through silence.

Jeff, oblivious to the quiet rejection, assumed Hilda was simply drained.

He busied himself adjusting her pillow, holding a glass of water near her lips, and fussing over every little detail.

Fraser, however, was standing a little apart, looking worried.

His gaze lingered on his mother for a moment before he followed the attending doctor out into the quieter hallway.

"Doctor," he asked in a low voice, "what exactly triggered my mother's attack this time?"

The doctor paused, gathering his thoughts. "Mr. Benton, the test results point to an acute asthma episode.Most likely, it was set off by a strong allergen."

Fraser's frown deepened. "A strong allergen?"

He knew his mother had a history of asthma, but that was long ago.

She hadn't had a single attack in years. So why had it suddenly flared up again, and so violently,the very moment she returned home?

His instincts told him something at the restaurant wasn't right.

But was it really possible that the girl who looked so much like his mother when she was young was behind it?

No, that didn't add up.

If she had anything to hide, she never would have been the first to suggest pulling the surveillance tapes or calling in the police. Lainey, on the other hand, had looked visibly shaken at her suggestion.

Fraser exhaled slowly and stepped over to the window. Pulling out his phone, he dialed his assistant.

"Pull every bit of surveillance from Verdant Crest yesterday at noon. Cross-check every staff member who was working," he instructed, his tone dropping like ice. "I need a full account of everyone my mother saw and everything that happened from the moment she walked into that restaurant until the incident."

"I'm on it, Mr. Benton," came the reply, but Fraser didn't end the call right away.

His fingers drummed lightly against the cold window ledge as his mind circled back to those eyes, the ones that mirrored his mother's so vividly. The image burned sharper and sharper in his thoughts.

Was it really just coincidence?

Still lost in thought, he added another order."Also, set a meeting with Eleanor Warren."

Only then did he end the call.

As he turned back toward the hospital room, his expression hardened with resolve.

Whatever this was, he wouldn't rest until he uncovered the truth himself.
###Chapter 163 Want To Add Me On Facebook


Night had settled over the city.

A call from someone who introduced themselves as Fraser's assistant left Eleanor more curious than concerned.

Fraser Benton?

What on earth could he want with her now?

Lillian, never one to mince words, swept into the living room and planted her hands on her hips. "Honestly,the Benton family just doesn't know when to quit! After everything they pulled at the hospital, now they're asking for a meeting? Trust me, this is nothing but trouble."

Before Eleanor could protest, Lillian yanked her off the couch. "But we're going, no question. I want to see what tricks they're playing at this time. Don't worry. I'm with you, and if anyone steps out of line, they'll answer to me!"

Arm in arm, the two women headed out, and Lillian bundled Eleanor into her car, then drove away.

They reached the café in no time.

Lillian pulled into the parking spot, took a steadying breath like a soldier bracing for battle, then marched straight through the doors with purpose in her stride.

The moment she stepped inside, her eyes landed on Fraser, seated beside the window with the light catching his profile.

He wore a black suuit that fit him like it had been crafted just for him. There was a quiet elegance in the way he carried himself, a polished charm wrapped in an air of steady composure.

The man,was dangerously handsome, exactly her weakness.

For a split second, Lillian's irritation wavered, but she quickly remembered Eleanor's earlier humiliation and Handsome or not, this was the enemy. Fraser was here for a reason, and she wasn't about to let down her guard.

With determination burning in her eyes, Lillian marched straight to the table.

But the moment she drew close enough to catch the depth in Fraser's eyes, something in her eased,and her expression lost some of its sharp edge.

"You. Tell me what business you have with Eleanor." Her voice betrayed a hint of uncertainty.

Fraser barely acknowledged Lillian, his focus shifting straight to Eleanor.

Rising from his seat, he spoke in a low, even tone. "Miss Warren, my father acted out of line earlier at the hospital. He lost his temper and said things he shouldn't have. I'd like to apologize for him, and I hope you won't take it to heart."

Lillian blinked, momentarily stunned.

Was this really happening?

Was a Benton actually offering an apology?

She had walked in braced for fireworks, not courtesy. Maybe the Benton family.wasn't all bad, after all.

Before she could chime in, Eleanor nudged her into a chair and took a seat herself.

Eleanor's voice was smooth, almost offhand. "It's fine. I was wondering how your mother's been lately."

Mentioning Hilda brought a flicker of emotion to Fraser's usually steady face.

He lingered on Eleanor's features; she looked so much like Hilda, it caught him off guard."She's awake, but still very weak," he replied.

A faint smile crossed Eleanor's lips, relief evident in her eyes.

She reached into her bag and pulled out a small bottle, passing it to him. "These are from a friend, a remedy for asthma. Once a day with warm water."

She paused to make things clear. "If you're uncertain, have your doctor check them first."

For a moment, Fraser seemed unsure, then nodded and accepted the bottle. "Thank you, truly."

With her message delivered, Eleanor stood up, tugging Lillian to her feet. "We should get going."

Lillian,however, found herself wavering.

She cast an uncertain glance at Fraser, then at Eleanor; as if torn between outrage and somnething far more distracted.

Was she really just supposed to walk out now? She hadn't said half of what she wanted, and she certainly hadn't finished appreciating the view. and she certainly hadn't finished appreciating the view.

Just as they were about to leave, Lillian spun around and darted back to Fraser. She offered a sheepish grin,holding up her phone. "Hey, um... you're kind of hard to forget. Mind if we connect?"

She took out her phone and brought up the QR code without missing a moment. "Want to add me on Facebook?"

Fraser seemed ready to decline, but after catching Eleanor's eye, he relented and scanned the code.

Lillian smiled, all her inner turmoil vanishing as she finally followed Eleanor out the door.
###Chapter 164 My Mother's Having An Asthma Attack!


The moment Eleanor and Lillian left the coffee shop, Fraser hurried back to the hospital room.

As soon as he pushed the door open, his eyes landed on Lainey. Her back was facing him, her body leaning awkwardly over the bedside.Something about her posture looked off, almost secretive.

At the creak of the door, her shoulders jerked stiffly.

"What are you doing?" Fraser's voice was sharp and cold.

Lainey whipped around in a hurry, shoving her hands behind her as if she had been caught red-handed.

"N-nothing," she stuttered.

Forcing herself to calm down, she put on a soft look and tried to sound gentle. "Fraser, you're back."

Fraser gave her a doubtful glance, then looked past her at Hilda.

Something wasn't right.

Hilda's face looked normal, but her breathing was too fast.

Alarm shot through him, and he rushed forward, forgetting everything else. "Mom? Can you hear me?"

Hilda's brows were knitted in pain, and her lips were tinged faintly blue.

She tried to respond, but no. words came out.

Fraser's heart pounded. Slamming his hand against the nurse button, he shouted, "Doctor! My mother's having an asthma attack! Get in here, now!"

Lainey widened her eyes, mimicking panic, but inside her chest was a knot of dread.

If the doctors saved Hilda, all the trouble she had gone through would mean nothing. Still, she knew better than to stand there frozen. She needed to look convincing; she couldn't let Fraser doubt her.

With that thought, her eyes quickly filled with tears, and she threw herself against Hilda, crying out, "Mom,what's wrong? Please don't scare me!"

Then she turned to Fraser, her voice breaking as she explained, "Fraser, it's my fault. I was just about to press the nurse button, but when you came in, I panicked and forgot. If I'd called earlier, maybe Mom wouldn't be suffering so badly right now."

The excuse was neat. It covered what he had seen and painted her as a concerned daughter at the same time.

Fraser, however, wasn't buying her story.

His eyes went straight to the doctor rushing in. "How is my mom? Will she be alright?"

The doctor's face darkened. He stopped what he was doing and shook his head. "There's nothing more we can do. Even with intubation, her chance of recovery is less than twenty percent. It would be kinder to let her go peacefully..."

Before he could finish, Fraser grabbed him by the collar, his voice shaking with rage. "No! That's impossible.She didn't seem that bad just now!"

The doctor didn't fíght back. His eyes carried only regret. "She never fully recovered. This attack made things worse. On the outside she may look fine, but inside, her body's giving out. I'm afraid... there's no hope."

Lainey's heart leapt with joy at those words.

Finally, no one would be in her way.

She forced the feeling down and put on a heartbreaking display, throwing herself on the bed with sobs."Mom, nọ! Don't leave me! I can't live without you!"

Her tears looked so real that even the doctor's eyes grew wet. But Fraser didn't spare her a glance. In that desperate moment, he suddenly remembered the bottle of medicine Eleanor had given him. His hands shook as he dug it out of his pocket.

Something inside him told him Eleanor would never harm his mother.

He carefully helped Hilda sit up, slipped the pill into her mouth, and held a cup of warm water to her lips.

Minutes passed, and then, like a miracle, her brows eased, her breathing slowed, and a bit of color returned to her pale face.

Fraser finally let out the breath he had been holding.

His tense body gave out, and he slumped against the bedside, utterly exhausted.

He didn't dare imagine what would have happened if it weren't for that pill, or how empty their lives would be without Hilda.

In that moment, the usually calmn Fraser felt like a helpless child, breathing hard with relief.
###Chapter 165 You'll HHandle One Last Thing For Me


Lainey's eyes widened in shock, her hands hidden behind her back curling into tight fists.

She couldn't believe what she was seeing.How could this happen?

The pollen she had sprinkled on Hilda's pillow wasn't ordinary. It had cost her a fortune from the Underground Network. It was supposed to be undetectable, without color or smell, and deadly enough to trigger an asthma attack that would end Hilda quietly in her sleep.

Yet here she was, saved by a single pill?

Lainey couldn't believe it. And apparently, neither could the doctor, who had just finished checking on Hilda.He muttered in awe, "This... this is a miracle!"

Without wasting another second, he hurried out of the room, clearly eager to record the incident in detail.

Something like this had to go straight intothe medical records immediately.

Once the doctor was gone, Fraser got up and pulled Lainey out of the ward.

His eyes bored into her, filled with a hostility that made her skin crawl.

Lainey's heart pounded as she scrambled for words.

"Fraser, I think I know what happened! When I came in earlier, I saw Mom's medicine still sitting on the table.Maybe the nurse forgot to give it to her, so that's why-"

"Enough." Fraser cut her off, his tone final. "I'll have it checked. For your sake, it had better be the way you claim or..."

He didn't need to finish the sentence; the warning in his voice said it all.

Lainey's heart thudded painfully, but she forced herself to stay composed. "Fraser, whether you trust me or not, the doctor will clear this up. I swear I didn't do anything. I wNas about to hit the nurse button myself." She clung to her story because she knew as long as she never admitted anything, there was no proof.

She had only used a little bit of pollen, so there was no way Fraser could ever trace it back to her.

Fraser narrowed his eyes, staring at her for what felt like an eternity.

Had he been wrong about her?

Was it really just an unfortunate coincidence?

After all, who would be bold enough to try something like murder?

Even so, he wasn't about to take chances. From now on, Lainey would not be left alone with his mother.

"Go home," he ordered flatly. "I'll stay with Mom."

Relief washed over Lainey, though she forced a reluctant look, as if she hated leaving. She cast one last glance at Hilda through the doorway and said softly,"Alright. Please take good care of Mom. If you get tired,let me know and I'll come back to help."

Acting the part of the caring daughter, she stepped into the elevator.

Fraser, however, wasn't fooled. His suspicion might have eased for the moment, but deep down he knew Lainey wasn't truly his sister.

He doubted his sister would wear masks so easily or act with such calculated sweetness.

Lainey, on the other hand, could feel his gaze shadowing her every move.

She walked out of the elevator with shaky steps, her mind in a haze.

Fraser must have started doubting her!

She might cover up this mess, but what about the one before?

If he dug ,up the truth and linked it back to that waitress...there would be no way out.

Lainey forced herself to toughen up, but once she sat inside her car,her nerves settled. No, killing again would only be a last resort.

Besides, mistakes could sometimes be turned into chances.

With fresh thoughts spinning into a plan, she drove off from the hospital.

She roamed the streets aimlessly for a bit before finally steering toward the Verdant Crest dorms,looking for that waitress.

There, Millie Ruiz was in a frenzy, shoving a few worn clothes into an old suitcase. She was preparing to disappear.

When Lainey appeared at the door, Millie froze in terror. The bundle of clothes slipped from her hands.

"Lainey," she stuttered, her voice trembling with fear.

Lainey didn't speak and only stared at her in silence.

Slowly, she stepped closer. From her bag, she pulled out her phone, scrolled to her photo album, and held the screen up for Millie to see.

The image showed Millie's elderly parents and her little brother, stil in elementary school, all of them smiling innocently.

Millie's face drained of color instantly.

"Planning to run?" Lainey's voice sounded calm, but every word carried a poisonous edge. "That's fine."

She slid her phone back into her bag as if she had all the time in the world.

"But before you disappear, you'Il handle one last thing for me." Lainey locked her eyes on Millie and spoke each word slowly. "If not, do you really think you and your family will get away unharmed, even with the money?"

Millie's knees buckled, and she fell helplessly to the floor.

Lainey then leaned closer with a chilling smile, whispering her plan into her ear.
###Chapter 166 Who Put You Up To This


Fraser remained clueless about the secret meeting between Lainey and Millie, who had already come together and settled on a single version of events.

Meanwhile, his phone buzzed with two fresh surveillance clips from Denny.

In the first video, Millie, dressed in her server uniform, was caught on camera slipping something suspicious into a cup of coffee.

The second video captured her dashing out of the cafe, clearly frantic, moments before the ambulance pulled up.

Damn it!

That proved it. Someone had messed with the coffee.

Fraser felt the weight of suspicion grow heavier.

Life rarely played out so straightforward-no waitress would risk everything to target his mother, not without a push.

Rage threatened to send him storming off to find answers, but a glance at his mother, pale and motionless in her hospital bed, anchored him in place.

He couldn't just leave her behind and hope nothing else happened.

The only choice was to stay by her side, counting the minutes until his father arrived to relieve him.

Night crawled by, every hour stretching painfully long.

At sunrise, Jeff finally showed up to take over. Fraser wasted no time heading for the door.

Before stepping out, he shot Jeff astern look. "Don't let Lainey get anywhere near Mom by herself.I mean it. I'll fill you in once I'm back." Jeff couldn't shake the uneasy feeling in his gut.

Fraser's warning seemed strange, but after the doctor filled him in that his wife might not have made it last night, fear gripped him.

Was it possible that Lainey had a hand in what happened to Hilda?

No. That didn't make sense.

Maybe Fraser was just worried that Lainey would freeze up in an emergency, unable to cope if something went wrong.

Yeah,that explanation felt safer.

As he clung to that thought, Jeff's nerves settled a bit.

Fraser soon pulled up to Verdant Crest with a small group of bodyguards in tow.

He wasted no time storming into the kitchen, where Millie was scrubbing dishes. "Tell me the truth. Who put you up to this?"

Millie nearly dropped the plate in her hands, her face drained of color. She crumpled, sobbing and begging for mercy."Mr. Benton, please! I'm begging you! I swear, I didn't want any part of this! I never meant to hurt anyone!"

Between frantic tears, she repeated the story Lainey had coached her on. "It was a woman, I swear. She paid me and said she'd go after my family if I didn't do what she asked. I didn't have a choice-please believe me!"

A storm gathered in Fraser's eyes, his suspicion now all but confirmed.

He cut straight to the point, barely containing his irritation. "Keep going. Did you get a look at this woman's face?"

Millie's whole body shook as she put on her act, hesitating for effect. Her gaze darted to the floor. "E.. 1can't remember very well. She had on a big hat, and there were sunglasses covering her face." After a moment, she acted as if something suddenly clicked. "But wait! I did hear something.The woman with her, she called her Eleanor."

At that moment, Lainey entered the kitchen.

She peeked down at her phone, noticing the fresh audio file with a glint of triumph barely hidden in her smile.

Armed with this recording, she knew Jeff would be convinced that Eleanor was responsible for Hilda's incident.

She made her way to Fraser in a rush."See? I told you she was behind it! That woman's always hated me,and she never misses a chance to hurt Mom. Fraser, let's not wait. We need to call the police now. Mom deserves justice!"

Fraser's frowNn deepened, a heavy silence settling over him.

In truth, he doubted Eleanor could ever hurt Hilda, but Millie didn't have a motive to pin this on her out of thin air.

While Fraser wrestled with what to do, Lainey stepped in, her voice smooth and persuasive. "I get that you always want to give people the benefit of the doubt. But Mom deserves better than this-don't let kindness blind you to the truth. Here's an idea: instead of calling the cops, why don't we take Millie and speak to Eleanor face to face?"

It was exactly what Lainey had wanted from the start.

She counted on Fraser's reluctance to drag Eleanor into a police matter.

As for the showdown itself?

She was more than ready.

This time, Eleanor wouldn't slip away.

After weighing it for a few seconds, Fraser gave the bodyguards a signal. They moved swiftly, hoisting Millie to her feet.

Lainey dropped her gaze, unable to hide a trace of a smile.

Victory felt close-Eleanor wouldn't walk away unscathed.
###Chapter 167 Please, Just Confess Everything!


Eleanor, completely unaware that she had been set up, had just wrapped things up at the Hope House and was preparing to head-back.

The moment she stepped outside, her eyes fell on the familiar black Bentley quietly parked by the curb.

Without a second thought, she walked over, pulled the door open, and slipped inside.

Nolan's gaze instantly shifted toward her. His eyes lingered on her face, noticing the faint tiredness etched across her features.

But instead of speaking, he just kept staring.

Eleanor adjusted her posture in the seat and suddenly let out a soft laugh. "Nolan, you've been watching me so intently. What is it? Are you afraid I'll suddenly vanish on you?"

Her words were meant as a lighthearted tease, but in the blink of an eye, Nolan flipped the tables on her.

His lips curved into the faintest smile as he leaned in, closing the distance until his breath brushed against her lips. "Of course. You're so breathtaking.. if I lost you, where in this world could I ever find another like you?"

Eleanor shot him a glare, though her eyes betrayed more amusement than anger."Can't you talk properly for once?"

She wanted to scold him, but deep down, being cherished so openly warmed her in ways she didn't expect.

The only problem was this man was growing more and more sentimental by the day.

Nolan,however,was captivated.

That playful glare of hers lit something inside him, and he couldn't help but wonder how he had overlooked this side of her for so long. He was just about to close the distance and claim her lips when a black sedan screeched to a stop right in front of them, and a familiar figure stepped out of the car.

Jeff.

What on earth was he doing here?

Before they could process it, Jeff stormed over, his face twisted in rage. He yanked open the car door and raised his hand, ready to slap Eleanor across the face.

But before the blow could land, a strong hand caught his wrist mid-air.

Nolan had already stepped out without anyone noticing. His presence was like a sudden chill, his gaze cutting through the air with deadly calm.

A jolt of pain shot through Jeff's wrist as Nolan tightened his hold.

How dared he try to raise a hand against Eleanor?

Nolan's cold stare was enough to freeze anyone in place, and a surge of anger bubbled under his calm.

With just a little more force, he could easily disable Jeff's hand.

"Where are your manners?" Nolan's voice was dangerously calm."Or have you thrown away every shred of dignity you had, Mr. Benton?"

Jeff's face went pale from the pain, but Nolan's words only made his own anger flare hotter.

Dignity?

He didn't need dignity.

According to the recording Lainey had sent, Eleanor was the one who had tried to hurt Hilda.

Fury had driven him straight here without even waiting for Fraser.

Not killing Eleanor already felt merciful. Dignity was the last thing on his mind.

Eleanor noticed the hatred in Jeff's eyes and frowned in confusion. However, before she could ask anything, more cars pulled up.

Lainey was the first to leapo out, rushing toward the scene.

Right behind her came Fraser, followed by a woman being held back by a couple of bodyguards.

The guards soon forced the woman to her knees.

The moment she caught sight of Eleanor, she acted like she had found a lifeline, dropping to her knees and bowing desperately. Her face was wet with tears and streaked with snot.

"Miss Warren! I can't hide it fromn you any longer! Please, just confess everything! You told me to-"

Eleanor listened quietly and then smirked.

She gently released Nolan's hand and took a few calm steps forward.

Among the furious and puzzled stares of the crowd, she crouched down slowly, meeting Millie's terrified eyes."Do you realize that framing someone is against the law?"

Eleanor's voice was soft, but each word made Millie shiver uncontrollably.

All at once, the threats Lainey had made, the promises of safety for her family, and her own fear collided in Millie's mind.

Yet in the end, the strongest instinct won out-the will to survive.

Taking a shaky breath, Millie found her voice. "Miss Warren, you told me to do it! I got caught because of you.How can you just turn your back on me now?"
###Chapter 168 Lainey Would Never Hurt Her Own Mother


Eleanor's smile grew sharper, a flicker of amusement in her eyes as she listened. "So,remind me, what exactly did I promise you for attacking Mrs. Benton?" she asked, her tone light.

She swept a lazy glance from Jeff's scowl to Lainey's frantic performance. "Let's get real. That was the first time I ever spoke to Mrs. Benton. We didn't have any conflicts. Why would I plot against her?"

Before Millie could say anything, Eleanor continued, "Don't drag out this tired feud with Lainey either.Although she stole Jonny from me, I've already let it go. Now, I'm seeing Nolan."

Her meaning couldn't have been plainer. Nolan outshone Jonny in every way, and she had no reason to create trouble over a man she had already left behind.

Fraser had been skeptical of her involvement before, and when he heard this, his doubts vanished completely.

Eleanor had no reason at all to harm his mother.

Besides, if she had really meant to hurt his mother, then why would she have gone out of her way to hand him those pills?

HHis father's anger had clouded his judgment, but he steadied himself, determined to stay clear-headed.

He couldn't shake the feeling that Millie had been bribed into this mess.

Nolan had come to the same conclusion.

He moved closer, and the weight of his presence seemed to close in around Millie. "Let me be clear. Lying now means crossing the Stewart family. Are yo sure that's a risk you want to take?"

The threat hit its mark, and Millie's nerves frayed.

Everyone knew the Stewart family could destroy a person's future with a single call. If she crossed them, it wouldn't matter how far she ran or how much money she carried; peace would never follow.

But Lainey had a ruthless streak of her own, and if she decided to reveal the truth, life would become just as unbearable.

Cornered, Millie drew in a shaky breath and made her decision. "Alright, I lied. None of this has anything to do with Miss Warren. I did it. Mrs. Benton bumped into me once, made me spill a tray, and the manager cut my pay.I wanted payback, so l acted on my own."·

With her confession out, Millie squeezed her eyes shut and slumped to the floor, pretending to faint.

To Jeff, it looked like Millie had been scared witless by Nolan's warning.

He turned on Nolan, voice icy with anger. "You threaten a witness right in front of me? Do you have no respect for me? Is protecting Eleanor really worth crossing us?"

Nolan said nothing at first, his gaze flickering past Jeff and settling on Lainey, whose composure was slipping fast.

A cold, amused smile played at his lips as he retorted, "It's funny, isn't it? You're ready to paint Eleanor as the villain based on nothing but hearsay. Why are you so desperate to put this on my girlfriend? Tell me,are you really after the truth, or are you just covering for your family? Maybe take a closer look at your family.You might be surprised by what you find."

He almost called Lainey out by name.

A wave of panic rushed across Lainey's face, clear as day.

How in the world would Nolan have any way of knowing about all this?

Was he just putting on a show, or had he actually uncovered something real?

Fear made her shrink back, refusing to meet his eyes.

At first, Jeff seemed oblivious. Then, realization dawned, and his anger spiked. "You can't be serious! Lainey would never hurt her own mother. If you're going to shift blame, try to come up with something that isn't ridiculous!"

Nolan, unfazed, met his outrage with a smirk. "Unless, of course, she's not really your daughter after all.Ever think about that?"

He didn't wait for a reply. Without looking back, he took Eleanor by the hand and led her away.

The car pulled off, leaving only the echoes of Nolan's words behind.

Fraser,silent throughout, caught every flicker of fear on Laiey's face.

The truth was plain enough: Lainey had probably bought Millie off.

So she wasn't just impersonating his sister; she had even attempted to murder his mother.
###Chapter 169 Keep Telling Yourself That, Nolan


A chill settled in Fraser's eyes as he pieced together what had likely unfolded.

Jeff, oblivious to the real reason behind Fraser's silence, took it as a sign that his son had let Nolan's words get to him. He puffed up with indignation and jumped to Lainey's defense. "Fraser, don't you dare start doubting your own sister just because of a strangér's wild claims! If you let outsiders plant suspicion in your heart, then maybe you shouldn't call me Dad at all!"

Scared at first, Lainey quickly played her part when she saw Jeff rallying behind her."|t′Salright,Dad.I understand. Fraser and I haven't spent much time together, so I can't blame him for being cautious. Please don't be angry with him."

Jeff's frustration only deepened.

He shot Fraser a glare, as if scolding a child who had disappointed him."You see? Lainey's still thinking about you,even now."

Fraser looked from Jeff to Lainey, studying them both for a long moment.

He offered only a noncommittal "Hmm," and said nothing more.

Trying to reason with his father was pointless; he was too deeply entrenched in Lainey's web of lies.

Only undeniable proof would ever open his eyes.

When it came to Lainey, Fraser had no interest in wasting another word on her.

Convinced her little act had erased all suspicion, Lainey clung cheerfully to Jeff's arm, calling over her shoulder. "Come on, Dad, Fraser. Eleanor's got Nolan in her corner now, so she won't admit that she is guilty. Let's go. Mom's waiting alone at the hospital."

With a sweet smile, she twisted the blame back onto Eleanor and tried to hurry them along, earning herself another long, thoughtful look from Fraser. He still said nothing, letting his silence speak for him.

Meanwhile, Eleanor rolled her eyes.

And for good reason, Nolan was grinning, completely unfazed by the drama.

When she pressed him for an explanation, he replied, "I'm thrilled that you admitted that we're dating in front of them."

"Is this really the time for you to get all sentimental?" she grumbled.

Nolan wasn't bothered at all. Drawing her close, he leaned in and murmured,"Let me handle everything.Erick will dig up the truth, and Lainey won't get away with this. No one from the Benton family will trouble you again,I promise."

Eleanor glanced over, catching Nolan's profile in the half-light.

Tension showed in the sharp set of his jaw, belying his calm tone; he was anything but unfazed.

A mischievous glint sparked in her eyes. She leaned in, voice light and teasing, "So you trust me that completely, NNolan? What if I were the mastermind, the one who put Millie up to it?"

Without missing a beat, Nolan met her gaze and replied, "That's impossible. You're not capable of something like that."

His conviction stunned her for a second.

Nobody had ever given her that kind of faith, unquestioning, absolute.

The Todd family had treated her like a servant, and everyone else saw her as nothing more than a scheming orphan.

Only Nolan seemed able to see right through the masks she wore, past every rumor and every scar.

A gentle warmth crept into her chest.

Eleanor looked away, settling deeper into the seat. For the first time all day, she let herself relax. The passing scenery caught her attention. Suddenly, she realized they were pulling up to the ornate iron gates of Nolan's estate in Regal Heights.

Nolan had slipped away and quietly made his way back to his house.

Eleanor couldn't decide whether to laugh or sigh at Nolan's constant scheming.

Nolan cut the engine, yet he lingered in the driver's seat instead of stepping out right away.

He glanced her way and spoke in a low, steady voice, trying to defend himself. "Look, you're exhausted, and if I took you back to your apartment, it'd be a long drive. This way is easier. You need rest more than anything else."

He made it sound considerate, but the excuse was transparent.

She shot him a look, rolling her eyes. "Keep telling yourself that, NNolan."

Still, she let it go. After the day she had had, fighting him on this felt pointless.
###Chapter 170 Aren't You The One Causing Problems


Just as Eleanor and Nolan were about to step out of the car, his phone rang with Erick's call.

She didn't catch the details of the conversation, but Nolan's expression darkened noticeably.

A few moments later, he hung up and faced her. "Something's come up at the office. I need to head back.Stay here and wait for me,okay?"

So,that was it.

She was officially left alone to watch the house.

Eleanor gave a small, resigned nod and watched him drive off before stepping into the villa.

What greeted her inside was unexpected. Norwood was sitting on the living room sofa, looking like he had been waiting a while.

Normally, he should have been at the Stewart family's residence.

Had he deliberately led Nolan away?

Eleanor squared her shoulders and kept tone even. "Good evening, Mr. Stewart."

Norwood snorted. "Good evening? Huh."

In just a few days, this little troublemaker had managed to stir up a storm. If it weren't for Jeff's urgent call,he might still have been in the dark about all this.

He slammed his cane on the floor, making his presence even more formidable.

"Listen, I don't care about where you come from or your past. But you're educated, so you should know the basics of decency. You're divorced. If you really care about Nolan and want what's best for him, you should step aside. His partner should lift him up, not drag him down." Was he trying to soften it a bit? Eleanor wasn't about to be swayed either.

She tilted her head slightly, sat comfortably across from him, and casually sipped her coffee. "Mr. Stewart,I think you've got it wrong," she said smoothly. "My relationship with Nolan isn't at all what you think, and l've never been a burden to him."

She paused, meeting his sharp stare directly. "Actually, it's you, under the guise of looking out for him,who keeps bringing in women you think are right for him, without thinking about the mess it creates. Aren't you the one causing problems?"

Her words hit Norwood hard.

He felt a sudden tightness in his chest, as if he couldn't breathe.

In his whole life, his words had been law. No one had ever talked back like this.

He was Nolan's grandfather-wasn't it his right to guide him?

"You!." he fumed, stumbling over his words in sheer rage.

Just then, Nolan, who had sensed something was wrong, returned and stepped into the living room.

Seeing Nolan seemed to give Norwood an outlet for his fury. His hand trembled as he pointed at Eleanor."Look at her! This is who you've chosen! And she has the audacity to say I'm the problem. She'll be the death of me!"

And then, just like that, his vision blurred and he collapsed backward.

"Grandpa!" Nolan shouted, rushing forward. He caught Norwood carefully and gently lowered him onto the sofa.

"Call his private doctor," he ordered at once, and a nearby maid hurried off to make the call.

Eleanor, on the other hand, froze for a moment. She hadn't expected Norwood to actually pass out from anger."Uh,1-"she started, but Nolan shook his head, signaling her to stay silent.

She immediately swallowed back her words, and the room fell into a tense silence.
###Chapter 171 I'd Appreciate The Ride


Nolan's private doctor arrived in no time, his black bag in hand.

After checking Norwood thoroughly, he slipped off his stethoscope and gave Nolan a polite nod.

"Mr.Stewart, there's no major cause for alarm. Your grandfather's blood pressure spiked from too much agitation, which made him faint. I've given him something to help him rest and stabilize. With a bit of quiet,he should wake up soon."

Relief swept over the room at the diagnosis.

Everyone seemed to relax. Norwood would be alright, and that was what mattered most.

After the doctor walked out, the living room settled back into quiet calm.

Nolan slowly turned, his eyes carrying an apology as they came to rest on Eleanor.

But before he could get a word out, Eleanor beat him to it.

"You should take care of your grandfather. I won't bother you anymore tonight," she said softly, already turning toward the door.

Alarm jolted Nolan, and he hurried after her. "Let me at least walk you out."

His steps halted when Norwood's voice, faint but cutting, rang out behind him.

"If you so much as set foot outside after her, you can plan my funeral right now! You're determined to break my heart, aren't you? A girl with secrets and schemes, and you think she's fit for you?"

Every word dripped with harsh scorn.

Nolan didn't flinch. His expression stayed calm and impassive, only deepening Norwood's frustration.

Where Norwood expected a defense or a placating word, Nolan simply met his gaze; voice unwavering. "If anyone's not good enough here, Grandpa, it's me." In his eyes, Eleanor was far beyond what others could ever see. She was Enigma, she was Butterfly, she was the Soul Surgeon. To him, she embodied strength woven with grace, warmth paired with sharp intellect.

She carried both compassion and shrewdness, resilience clothed in beauty. A woman so extraordinary that even gazing at her felt like a gift. And to call himself her boyfriend was the greatest stroke of luck he could ever know.

But he knew none of that would sway Norwood.

All his grandfather saw was a girl with no family, no title, and a knack for inviting trouble.

Norwood could hardly believe his ears. How could his own grandson claim to be unworthy of a divorced woman?

Nolan's remark did nothing but pour oil on the flames, making the situation burn even hotter.

The effect hit harder than anything Eleanor had said before, and it left Norwood's face burning red with fury.

The maid rushed to his side, desperate to calm him before his anger spiraled out of control.

Without a flicker of emotion, Nolan watched to make sure his grandfather was stable, then turned and left the room.

The night outside was thick and silent.

Down at the entrance of the villa, Eleanor lingered under the streetlights, feeling unexpectedly adrift.

The Regal Heights was an affluent neighborhood, set against the mountainside, with a view that was both peaceful and strikingly beautiful.

Most people living here relied on their own cars to get around, while taxi drivers usually avoided coming this far from the city.

Pulling out her phone, she saw the ride-hailing queue was endless. Any hope of a quick escape vanished.

A faint trace of regret stirred in Eleanor's heart.

If she had realized what awaited her, she never would have insisted on handling things alone and leaving by She was utterly lost, her poor sense of direction turning the winding streets of this place into a maze she couldn't escape.

With a sigh, she wrapped her coat tighter and started down the main avenue, hoping she would figure out her way eventually.

Headlights suddenly swept over her, cutting through the dark.

A glossy black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a stop right in front of her.

The back window slid down at a measured pace, and there appeared a face of calm elegance. It was Fraser.

His gaze fell on the slender figure standing beneath the streetlight, and for a moment, surprise flickered in his eyes. "Miss Warren? What brings you out here so late? Let me take you home; it's not safe to wander around here alone."

Eleanor blinked, just as surprised to see him. But then she realized that his presence made sense. The Benton family were practically royalty; it was not surprising that they had an estate in Regal Heights.

She checked her phone one last time before offering a faint smile. "Thank you. I'd appreciate the ride."

Meanwhile, Nolan raced out of the villa only to catch the last glimmer of taillights vanishing into the night.

He lingered on the driveway, a rare shadow of fatigue flickering across his face.

After what felt lie an eternity, he turned and made his way toward the villa, the lights stretched his solitary figure across the quiet road.

###Chapter 172 How About A Drink


About half an hour later, a Rolls-Royce pulled up in front of the Podium Apartments.

Eleanor unbuckled her seatbelt and gave Fraser a polite nod. "Thanks for the ride, Mr. Benton," she said softly.

Fraser returned a gentle smile. "No problem. Glad to help."

As he noticed her slightly reserved air, his expression softened.

"You know," he said, "my mom isn't very good with directions. She tends to get lost if she's out alone."

Eleanor paused, a flutter stirring in her chest at his words.

She pressed her lips together, then decided to speak. "About Mrs. Benton..."

Fraser turned his head toward her, his eyes clear behind the gold-rimmed glasses. "No need to explain.I trust you."

Eleanor paused for a moment with her hand on the car door, then whispered her farewell and stepped out.

Just as she steadied herself, a familiar purple roadster skidded in and came to a dramatic stop beside her.

The door flung open, and Lillian stepped out, her heels clicking energetically as she strode over.

"Eleanor! You're finally back!" she exclaimed, her eyes immediately darting toward the Rolls-Royce.

For just a second, her face lit up.

"Oh wow, it's him again," she thought.

She couldn't resist.

Whoever he was, she would charm him first and worry about the rest later. Letting go of Eleanor's arm, she moved closer to the car, leaned on the door with one hand,and bent slightly to give him a playful whistle.

"Well, hello there. Fancy meeting you here. How about a drink?"

Her tone was bold, and completely unrestrained.

Eleanor groaned quietly, pinching the bridge of her nose.

Lillian was perfectin so many ways, but when it came to a good-looking man, she couldn't help herself.

Fraser, seated inside, raised an eyebrow at the bold display.

The vibrant young woman in front of him was Lillian, a member of the Brooks family and Eleanor's college roommate.

According to the information he had gathered, she was bold and always shielded those close to her.

He had only met her briefly before, and he had to admit that she lived up to her reputation.

He probably should have ignored her forward approach, but it was actually a good chance to learn more about Eleanor's life.

A subtle smile formed as he studied her over his glasses. "Sure," he replied, keeping his voice calm.

The grin that spread across Lillian's face was instant.

She dashed off to park her car, then came bouncing back, hopping straight into the passenger seat as if nothing could slow her down.

Before driving off, she threw Eleanor a cheeky look. "My beautiful Eleanor! Looks like tonight's all yours!"

Eleanor wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry at her friend's antics.

By the end of the night, Lillian got nothing out of her little stunt, and she ended up utterly drunk instead.

Fraser didn't fare any better. He had hoped to sneak some details about Eleanor's past from Lillian, but she kept rambling about how much she respected Eleanor and how she was rooting for her and Nolan. Not exactly the intel he had wanted.

Still, he couldn't help but feel a bit reassured knowing Lillian genuinely cared about Eleanor.

Loosening his tie, Fraser got out of the car,the scent of alcohol strong around him.

The driver hurried out to help him. "Sir, be careful," he said.

Fraser waved him off, insisting he was fine, even though each step wobbled slightly.

As he rubbed his forehead and headed toward the villa, movement in the shadows caught his eye.

Instantly alert, he froze. Something wasn't right. He gave a sharp nod to the head of security behind him.

"Get them," he commanded.
###Chapter 173 You'll Regret This!


Someone was dragged out in a hurry.

Fraser narrowed his eyes and recognized the man.

It was Jonny, the head of Todd Group. He used to be married to Eleanor. Now, he was Lainey's husband.

Fraser had already heard whispers about him while he was staying in Breoqua. Lainey planned to leave Jonny because he mistreated her.

He wondered if Eleanor had gone through the same thing.

The possibility chilled Fraser. His gaze hardened.

Meanwhile, Jonny had no idea he was not welcome there. He fought against the head of security and shouted threats at him. "You idiot better let me go! Do you even know who you're dealing with? I'm Lainey's husband, and I run the Todd Group!"

The head of security did not even flinch at his outburst.

Fraser made his way down the steps, pausing right in front of Jonny.

His expression was cold behind those gold-rimmed glasses. "Is it true you hit Lainey?".

Jonny lifted his eyes and caught sight of a man whose features carried a trace of Hilda's likeness. At.once,he realized it was Fraser. Hlis resistance faded, and his face lit up with joy. "You're Lainey's brother, right?Fraser, isn't it? I'm Jonny Todd!"

Eager to clear his name, he rushed to explain, eyes wide and voice pleading. "No, you have to believe me.1never laid a hand on her. You can ask my ex-wife; we were married for three years, and I never laid a hand on her. I haven't even been with Lainey that long. There's no way I would have hit her. Lainey just got mad at me and twisted the story."

Without wasting any time, Jonny blurted out what he wanted. "Fraser, I want to see Lainey.I need to talk to her, even if it's just for a minute. Please. I won't cause any trouble."

After hearing Jonny's request, Fraser could not be bothered to keep talking.

He turned icy, cutting the conversation short with a look at security. "Get him out of here."

"Understood, Mr. Benton." The head of security stepped forward, pulling Jonny away.

The harshness caught Jonny off guard. He shot Fraser a bitter glare, his words turning venomous. "Your family really is heartless! None of you understands Lainey at all!"

Fraser paused for just a second as he started to walk away.

Sensing an.opening, Jonny yelled louder, voice cracking with desperation, "Lainey's the problem, not me! l wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for her! Let me in and I'Il tell you everything about what she's done!"

There was no way Fraser would let Jonny in.

It wasn't about defending Lainey.

The Benton family never welcomed just anyone ito their home.

With a simple gesture, Fraser signaled for the head of security to keep going, and the latter tightened his grip,hauling Jonny toward the gates.

When he realized Fraser would not budge, Jonny's frustration boiled over. "You'll regret this! Every one of you will!"

...

His rant faded into the distance as the heavy iron gate closed with a final, echoing thud.

A haze of smoke curled around Fraser as he settled into the old gazebo and lit a cigarette.

Even with all he knew about Lainey's sharp edges, Jonny's accusations suggested there was a hidden side to her.

It seemed Lainey was a hell of a lot more than mnet the eye. He pulled out his phone and dialed his assistant, voice steady but urgent. "Dig into everything about Lainey's time overseas. I want a full report, down to the smallest detail."

"Right away, Mr. Benton."

He had already looked into her life here. Other than the possibility she was impersonating his sister and an attitude that bordered on arrogant, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

There was that stretch of time she spent abroad. She didn't seem to be the type to devote herself to her studies.

Maybe she had gotten into something she shouldn't have.

He needed proof.

The more dirt he had on Lainey, the easier it would be to convince his father that she wasn't their family.

Otherwise, as long as his father felt anything for her, he might always keep her close, even if it turned out she was never really his daughter.

He would never allow that.
###Chapter 174 | Shouldn't Have Let You Feel Hurt


Late that night, when Fraser was making his move, a knock echoed at Eleanor's door.

Eleanor froze for a moment. Who would come at this hour?

She cautiously walked over and peeked through the peephole.

Under the dim corridor light, she could see that two men were standing.

The taller one, barely managing to stay upright, leaned almost completely against the other.

Her brows drew together the instant she recognized them. It was Nolan. And beside him was Erick.

The minute she opened the door, the strong smell of alcohol hit her nose.

Erick's face looked like he'd finally found a lifeline. "Miss Warren, Mr. Stewart got himself drunk and insisted he had to see you."

His words carried both complaint and helplessness as he nudged Nolan forward.

Nolan stumbled straight into her, and Eleanor caught him instinctively.

Heat pulsed through his body, searing her fingertips even through his clothes.

Just how much had he been drinking?

Erick, relieved to have unloaded his burden, immediately backed away. "Then I'll leave him with you, Miss Warren!"

He slipped out almost at once, even pulling the door shut neatly behind him.

Clearly, in his mind, he had done all he could.

Eleanor,however, was left staring at the man slumped against her, completely unconscious. being pushed into this situation? With no other choice, she dragged him step by step toward the sofa.
Nolan was heavier than she expected, and her balance faltered. The next second, both of them toppled onto the cushions, with Nolan landing squarely on top of her.
In his drunken haze, Nolan seemed to catch a familiar scent, one he had longed for endlessly.
He pried his eyes open, blurred as they were, and locked on to the face before him.
Eleanor.
The thought alone consumed him.
Without hesitation, he lowered his head and kissed her.
The taste of strong alcohol mixed with the heat of his mouth stole her breath.
Eleanor stiffened, startled by how sudden it was.
His kiss wasn't skilled, but there was a gentleness to it, like he was both unsure and wanting more at the same time.
When she was almost out of air, he finally let go, but instead of pulling back, he leaned into the curve of her neck, rubbing against her skin like someone finally finding a safe haven after being lost.
Her heart thudded wildly,her cheeks burning hot.
She pressed at his shoulder weakly. "Nolan, you're heavy. I can't breathe."
But the moment she spoke, his arms only.poulled her in closer.
His words came muffled, thick with drink, yet achingly vulnerable. "Eleanor, why didn't you wait for me today? I shouldn't have let you feel hurt."
When she heard this, the faint sweetness that had bloomed in her chest vanished. She pushed at him again, just enough to make space. "Hurt? How could I be hurt? Nolan, I'm not the kind of woman people pity. I never had a proper family. I've been on my own since I can remember. If anything, I'm the troublemaker, not the one who gets pushed around."

Nolan flinched at her words. Hearing her belittle herself like that was unbearable.

He lifted his head, gaze steady despite the alcohol clouding his eyes. "Don't say that. To me, you're the best person I know."

His sudden sincerity unsettled her.

She quickly looked away and slipped out from under him to stand. "I'll go make you some warm milk. Maybe it'll help clear your head."

She had boarely taken a step when Nolan's hand caught her wrist.

In the next second, she was back under him on the sofa, his body hovering above hers.

He still carried the faint smell of alcohol, but it was his closeness, his warmth, and his intent that made the air feel heavy, almost electric. "I mean it," he whispered.

His eyes lingered on her flushed cheeks and the slight wideness in her gaze, his throat moving as he swallowed hard.

Lowering his head until his lips were just a breath away from hers, he asked softly, almost like a spell, "Can !?"

Two simple words, but the weight of them was undeniable.

It wasn't just a kiss he wanted. It was her.

The thought made Eleanor's mind spin, her reason and emotions pulling her in opposite directions. For a heartbeat, she almost gave in.

But in the end, clarity won.

Just as Nolan leaned in to kiss her, Eleanor's fingers shifted ever so slightly. A needle slipped quietly into her hand.

In one quick move, she pressed it into his skin that forced his body into sleep.

His eyes, once burning with desire, dulled in an instant, and he slumped heavily against her.

Eleanor didn't move and stayed still under his weight.

For a long moment, the only sound in the room was his steady breathing and her own erratic heartbeat.

At last, she lifted a shaky hand, covering her eyes.

Everything was slipping out of control. Completely, utterly out of control.
###Chapter 175 Let's Do Another Test


Days passed uneventfully.

Hilda was feeling better, and the doctor finally cleared her to leave the hospital. After finishing up the paperwork, Jeff made his way back to her room and quietly began gathering her things.

He moved with a gentle focus, making sure her coat was fastened all the way and tucking a soft scarf around her neck.

Hilda let him fuss over her, but her gaze drifted. Her energy seemed low, as if she were lost in thought.

Silence stretched between them until she finally spoke, voice soft but determined. "Jeff, I'd like to see Eleanor. Could you bring her to me?"

Jeff, halfway through pouring a glass of water, hesitated for a moment at her request.

He passed her the cup and tried to keep his tone light. "The doctor wants you to rest. Let's not get distracted with worries that aren't helpful right now."

"You älready know what's weighing on me." Instead of accepting the water, Hilda kept her eyes on him,refusing to back down. "There's something about her..."

"About what? You already know the answer." Jeff cut her off. His patience was wearing thin, a frown appearing on his face. "Lainey filled me in. Eleanor's been plotting from the start."

He gave her the short version, how Eleanor supposedly schemed her way close, how she got fixated on their money and status the moment she realized she looked like her.

Not once did Hilda interrupt. She just listened in silence, letting him say his piece.

Only after he finished did she slowly shake her head. "I don't buy it."

A lifetime of meeting people had sharpened her judgment. Eleanor's eyes told her everything. There was a kid of honest clarity there, like water untouched by anything false.

That just wasn't the kind of person Jeff described.

Seeing that he couldn't convince her, Jeff grew frustrated. "Why are you so sure I'm wrong? Lainey is our daughter, and she wouldn't lie to us. Plus, l've checked into Eleanor myself. There's more to her than she lets on."

"I still won't believe it," Hilda said, her voice trembling.with something she could not quite name. "When I look at her, it's like looking into a mirror of my younger self. How could that be a simple coincidence?"

It went beyond just the way they looked. There wasa familiar spirit there, a kind of silent connection that went deeper than appearances.

And especially her eyes, they brought back memories of her own reflection from years ago.

Some things, Hilda thought, only a mother could feel.

Jeff froze in place. He shifted his gaze to the world beyond the window, letting silence fill the space between them.

Doubts had been simmering beneath the surface for a long time.

Every encounter with Eleanor had left him shaken, stirring emotions he couldn't quite explain.

But the DNA results were right there, as black-and-white as anything could be.①

Science didn't care about feelings, and Myah would never fake the truth.

He forced himself to bury all uncertainty, clinging to logic over heart.

Still,everything that had happened recently only made things messier inside.

No matter how hard he tried, the likeness was impossible to ignore.

Hilda caught his arm, her grip fierce, her eyes wet with emotion. "You see it too, don't you? She's just like me," she said, her voice trembling with hope and fear. Desperation crept in as Hilda leaned in, refusing to let go. "That's our daughter, Jeff. I know it in my bones!"

Those tearful eyes broke his heart.

Old doubts clawed their way back to the surface.

Turning back to her, Jeff took her icy hand in both of his, his voice steady and sincere.

"Hilda, listen, if we both feel something's not right, let's do another test. This time, I'll take care of everything myself. I want to make sure we know the truth, once and for all. Does that sound fair?"

Dragging her through endless questions was no way to live. He needed real answers.

Whatever came next, they deserved clarity.

The suggestion stunned Hilda.

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she nodded, clinging to his hand like it was her only anchor.

"Okay," she whispered.

Neither of them realized someone was eavesdropping just beyond the door.

Lainey stood there, fists balled up, her glare sharp as broken glass.

She cursed under her breath.

She had known that old woman to ruin everything.

If they went through with another test, she would lose it all.

She had to act,and fast.
###Chapter 176 You Know Me Better Than That


Lainey hadn't made it three steps from the door before her phone rang, sharp and unexpected.

Heart racing, she slipped into the stairwell, her hands clammy and her face drained of color.

The caller ID flashed across the screen, making her gri her teeth. She answered, irritation sharp in her voice, "What now? Didn't I tell you not to call unless it was urgent?"

A low, mocking laugh echoed from the other end.

"Such a handful, aren't you? I went out of my way to help you, and instead of figuring out how to show a little gratitude, this is how you choose to talk to me. Truly, I'm heartbroken," Horace remarked, each word lazily taunting, pressing against Lainey's nerves.

She retorted, "What are you talking about?"

Help?

She hadn't asked him for anything. Not recently.

Before she could piece it together, Horace's tone changed, smooth but laced with quiet threat."Your brother Fraser sent some people to Zerovia, digging around for dirt on you. Good thing for you, my team intercepted them before they got anywhere."

He let the words linger, slow and deadly. "They al died."

Lainey's thoughts erupted in chaos.

She pressed her back to the cold wall, trying not to sink to the floor.

Fraser was on her trail-he had sent people halfway around the world to find out what she had done.

What did he already know? What evidence was in his hands?

No. This couldn't be happening.  Sitting around and waiting to be found out was never an option.

If she let Fraser keep digging, every last secret she had fought to hide would spill out into the open.

Fooling Jeff and his wife wouldn't save her-she needed something ironclad, a plan that couldn't fall apart.

Right now, Horace was the only person left she could count on.

Forcing herself to sound calm, Lainey let her voice turn soft, sweet as honey. "Horace, you know me better than that. I was just worried you might get caught up in this mess."

She let out a soft chuckle, as though she had never been the one who lost control. "You can count on me to remember what you've done for me. Would you mind lending me a hand again? Just help me take over the Benton family business. Once I've done that, I'll split everything I get from the Bentons with you. What do you think?"

The other side of the call stayed quiet.

Lainey could picture the greedy spark lighting up his eyes.

Half of the Benton family's fortune.

Nobody could walk away from a deal like that.

As expected, Horace's low laugh echoed after a pause.

"It's a deal," Horace replied,sounding pleased.

Lainey allowed herself to breathe easier.

Right now, she had to handle Fraser.

Getting rid of him completely wasn't an option.

Someone in his position would only cause more trouble if he died.

She just needed to keep him occupied and out of her way until her plan worked.

Once she had the old couple completely on her side, she could take her time figuring out how to handle him With that settled in her mind, Lainey gave a clear order. "I don't care what it takes. Just get Fraser to come back to Breoqua."

Horace did not like being bossed around, but thoughts of the Benton family's fortune were enough to make him agree. "Alright. But if you try anything after this-"

He always circled back to threats like that.

Lainey cut him off without missing a beat. "Horace, both of us are stuck in this together. There's no backing out now. If I go back on my word, I'll have nowhere to hide. Just do your part and trust me. Before long, the Benton family will belong to us!"

She knew exactly how to keep him interested, and her voice made that clear.

For the first time,Horace seemed truly convinced.

After ending the call, Lainey let her hand fall to her side and her smile vanished.

Her nails pressed into her palms until she felt a sting of pain.

That sharp sensation helped her focus and push aside any fear.

She would not let anyone block her path.

She had not survived everything she had been through just to end up losing again.

Everything the Benton family owned would one day be hers.

Masking the fire in her eyes, she turned and pressed the fire door open.

But she had barely stepped out when she collided with a broad chest.

She glanced up and met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes.

Fraser stood right in front of her.
###Chapter 177 You Two Should Spend More Time Talking


Fraser had just gotten a call from his assistant.

The team he had sent to Zerovia, four people in total, including the local contact, had vanished without a trace.

The last reports weren't just troubling-they were catastrophic. All of tem had been taken out.

As Fraser ran through the news in his mind, weighing his next move, he almost bumped into Lainey at the stairwell entrance.

Something about her was off. Her ambitious expression hadn't completely faded, and the way she moved suggested she was hiding something.

His eyes narrowed as he studied her carefully. "Why are you here?" he demanded.

What could possibly have brought her to the stairwell?

Lainey forced a casual shrug, brushing a strand of hair from her forehead to hide her panic.

"Well," she said lightly, "the elevator was packed, so l figured I'd take the stairs. Needed a bit of space to think."

Her tone was calm, but inside, her heart was pounding.

The conversation she had just had with Horace kept replaying in her mind.

When had Fraser arrived?

Had he heard even a single word?

One slip, and she would be in serious trouble.

Trying to sound casual, she tilted her head slightly. "Fraser, were you looking for me? Or did you just happen to pass by?" Her words danced between friendliness and careful probing.

Fraser, however, didn't answer immediately. He just watched her, silent and unblinking.

A chill ran down her spine under that steady stare, and for a moment, she felt herself nearly unravel.

Just then, Jeff stepped out of the hospital room.

Like a lifeline, Lainey rushed over, clutching his arm, her voice pitched with a whiny edge."Dad."

Jeff frowned at the tension in the air, glancing first at his pale-faced daughter, then at his serious son."Fraser, you're not giving your sister a hard time again, are you?"

"NO1"Fraser replied evenly, looking away. "I was just asking a few questions."

Jeff gave a small nod, satisfied with his son's answer.

He patted Lainey's hand gently, offering a reassuring squeeze. "You two should spend more time talking.It'll help you understand each other better."

Right when he turned to leave, something occurred to him, and he added, "Your mother mentioned she hadn't had a proper spa day in a while, so she went out with Denny. Discharge papers are all set, so unless you've got business here, head home quickly."

What Jeff didn't say was that Hilda hadn't gone for a spa. She had gone to gather hair samples from Eleanor.

He had hidden the truth.

Until the test results came out, any guesses were risky.

If Lainey really was their flesh and blood, those doubts would always hurt her deeply.

Once he was gone, Fraser and Lainey were left alone in the corridor.

Fraser was about to continue testing her when his phone rang.

He picked up the call, and his assistant's anxious voice came through immediately. "Mr. Benton, there's trouble at the company. A major shipment in Breoqua has been hijacked. They need you to handle it personally."

Fraser's brows drew together tightly. "I understand."

He ended the call and let his gaze fall on Lainey. Her wide, innocent eyes didn't fool him.

He refused to believe that she had nothing to do with these incidents.

But who was the powerful person supporting her?

How could someone have such control?

For now, though, the company's stability had to come first.

Once he got to Breoqua, he could use the resources there to investigate thoroughly.

With that decision made, he stepped a little closer to her, his voice low and edged with warning. "I don't know if any of this involves you, but know this-I will keep an eye on you."

With that, he turned and strode away, leaving Lainey standing in the corridor.
###Chapter 178 Please, Don't Tell Anyone About This


Lainey's heart pounded in her chest.

She didn't dare lift her gaze until she was certain Fraser had gone far enough for his figure to vanish from sight.

His words still echoed in her mind that he had probably figured out her little scheme to get him out of the way.

But that was hardly a concern.

With him gone, she could finally handle Jeff and Hilda however she wanted.

By the time Fraser returned from Breoqua, she would have everything under control.

Securing the shares was the priority. Being a Benton by blood was irrelevant; soon enough, she would be living a life of luxury regardless.

First, though, she had to make sure the paternity test was altered and any suspicion about Eleanor wiped away.

Only then could she pressure them into signing over the shares.

Jeff had claimed Hilda went out for a spa.

Lainey knew better.

Hilda had gone specifically to get Eleanor's hair samples. But it didn't matter.

Horace had ways to handle the labs.

She quickly sent him a text, saying, "Hilda is making her move. Make sure everything's in place to keep it smooth.".

She slipped the phone back into her purse and pressed the elevator button. When she reached the lobby, a loud voice stopped her in her tracks. A woman with a slightly rounded belly was arguing furiously at the Billing Department, hidden behind a mask, sunglasses, and a hat.

"Don't treat me like this! I come from a good family! I lost my wallet. I don't have cash! Just let me go. I'Il pay later!"

Lainey/'s eyes narrowed.

That voice belonged to Emma? Pregnant? How had that happened?

Lainey had no plan to get involved. She just gave a sarcastic smirk and started walking toward the exit.

But then an idea struck.

With Jonny tied up in his own matters, he probably hadn't been keeping an eye on his sister.

Emma, broke and expecting a child, was an easy target.

People in desperation could be manipulated, and with a little nudge, she might not be able to ruin Eleanor entirely, but she could certainly make things difficult.

A sly grin spread across Lainey's face.

She walked over, drew a card from her purse, and handed it to the nurse. "I'll take care of her bill."

Emma froze, her eyes widening in shock. "Lainey?"

Panic flashed across her face. If Lainey knew she was pregnant and told Jonny... she didn't even want to think about it.

Mumbling a quick, awkward thanks, she tried to slip away, but Lainey wasn't done with her.

She caught up effortlessly and called in a sweet, concerned tone, "Emma, do you need some help?"
Emma stopped and turned back slowly, feeling confused inside.

Her brother had warned her that Lainey was cunning, sly, and untrustworthy, but she had never believed it.

And now, in this moment of vulnerability, it was Lainey offering help. Could someone so thoughtful really be a bad person?

It had to be that Jonny had been misled by false rumors.

Seeing Lainey standing there, calm and gentle, Emma felt warmth bloom in her chest. Her eyes glistened,and her voice trembled as she whispered, "Please, don't tell anyone about this."

She bit her lip before continuing, "Could you...maybe lend me a bit more money?"

Lainey gave a soft, understanding nod, looking calm and harmless. "Emma, there's no need to be so formal between us. If you need anything, just say so. It's just..."

She paused, feigning a small sigh of embarrassment. "I don't really have much on me at the moment.
Eleanor's been interfering between me and my mom, and my allowance got cut because of it."

Emma's blood boiled instantly.

Eleanor!

That conniving woman had manipulated Jonny and now even tormented Lainey!

Lainey was a Benton, the pride of the Todd family!

No way was she going to sit by.

She needed to take some weight off Lainey's shoulders and make sure Eleanor never got the chance to hurt her again.

That way, when good opportunities came around, Lainey would think of her first.

Making a silent promise to herself, Emma looked at Lainey with determination. "Don't worry, Lainey. I'll make sure Eleanor doesn't get her way. She won't be able to cause much trouble for long."

Lainey immediately displayed a look of panic and grabbed Emma's hand. "Emma, don't do anything reckless,okay?"

But her caution didn't stop her from acting. With a quiet motion, she slid her bank card into Emma's palm."Take this $100, 000. It's all I have right now. Use it if you absolutely need it. And promise me you won't do anything risky. If you need me, I'll be there."

Emma stared at the card, touched by her gesture.

In that moment, she realized just how kind Lainey truly was. Her resentment toward Eleanor flared hotter than ever.

This time, Eleanor would truly pay for what she had done.
###Chapter 179 You've Endured So Much These Days


Eleanor hadn't imagined she would seek her out again.

Stepping out of her building, she froze at the sight of a sleek Rolls-Royce idling at the entrance.

The ca door opened, and Hilda stepped out gracefully.

Without hesitation, she reached for Eleanor's hand. Her own hands trembled as she held on tightly.

"My dear, you've endured so much these days," Hilda murmured, her eyes shimmering with unspoken tenderness.

A sharp ache tugged at Eleanor's chest, and her nose stung with a sour burn.

Was this what it felt like to be cared for by a mother?

It was gentle and warm, like being wrapped in a soft quilt on a cold night.

But this warmth was never truly meant for her.

Forcing back her emotions, she gave Hilda's hand a light pat and steered the moment away. "How have you been holding up lately?"

Hilda noticed theflicker of pain in her expression, and her own heart ached even more.

Even after carrying so many burdens, this child still thought of others first.

How could someone remain so kind through so much hardship?

She made a few light remarks about her health before carefully suggesting, "It's already late, so why don't we find a place to sit down, have a meal, and talk a little?"

Eleanor's first instinct was to decline, but the hope shining in Hilda's eyes made her swallow the refusal.

Half an hour later, the two of them were sitting insidea restaurant styled after Breoqua. The decor was tasteful, every detail carefully put together. Hilda ordered with ease, picking out several dishes she had once loved.

She wondered if Eleanor might like them as well.

The food was brought out quickly, and for a moment, Eleanor found herself dazed as she stared at the dishes laid out before her.

There was something oddly familiar about them, though she couldn't quite place why.

She took a bite of a piece of sweet and sour spare rib.

The burst of tangy sweetness lit up her taste buds.

Eleanor was never the type to fuss about food or show strong preferences, yet this dish struck a note of comfort.

Hilda's eyes turned misty as she watched Eleanor enjoy it.

Could this be a coincidence? Or something more?

Years ago, when Hilda was pregnant with her daughter, she could barely eat a thing. The only food she managed to stomach had been these very ribs.

Was this the pull of blood ties revealing itself in the smallest ways?

Neither woman spoke much as they ate, both lost in their own thoughts.

Just when the plates were nearly empty and the air between them was ready to shift into conversation,Eleanor's phone buzzed against the table.

She glanced at the anonymous text on the screen.

"Myah collapsed at the orphanage. Please come back quickly!"

Her breath caught. The moment she read the words, every muscle in her body went taut.

There was no time to wonder who had sent it. She pushed back her chair in haste. "Mrs. Benton, I'm so sorry... something urgent came up. I need to leave now."

Hilda, alarmed by her sudden distress, stood up as well. "What's wrong?"

"Myah fainted," Eleanor called over her shoulder as she hurried toward the door. "I have to check on her."

"Wait, let Denny take you," Hilda quickly offered.

Too worried to argue, Eleanor nodded and murmured her thanks before rushing out

Denny was already moving after her, catching up easily.

Watching them go, Hilda finally let out the breath she had been holding. Her eyes moved to Eleanor's chair,and she felt relieved to see a strand of hair on it.

Good. If it hadn't been there, she would have had to arrange another excuse to meet again.

She picked it up carefully with a tissue and put it into her handbag.

With this, the truth would soon be revealed.

Meanwhile,the Rolls-Royce raced down the road.

From the driver's seat, Denny kept glancing into the rearview mirror.

The more he looked at Eleanor, the more he saw shadows of Hilda's younger self in her face.

Could she really be the person they had been searching for all this time?

But the earlier DNA results gnawed at him.

He had collected that hair sample himself; there had been no mistake.

As his mind wrestled with questions, disaster struck.

Out of nowhere, a black truck shot out of a side street, moving far too fast, swerving as if it had no driver at all. It barreied straight toward them.

"Watch out!" Denny shouted,pulling the wheel hard. But the truck was already too close, and the crash came with a violent bang.

Denny slumped over the wheel, unresponsive.

Pain tore through Eleanor's body, her surroundings spinning wildly. Her vision blurred, fading fast, until everything slipped into darkness.

###Chapter 180 Is She Going To Be Alright


Nolan found out almost right away.

He raced to the hospital, but the entrance was already crawling with reporters who caught wind of the story.

A team of bodyguards had to shove their way through the crowd just so he could reach the emergency room doors.

Bright,almost harsh lights filled the hallway.

He could not tear his eyes away from the red light above the door. His eyes were starting to turn red, but he said nothing.

Gone was his usual poise and confidence. In its place was a storm of anger that threatened to spill over at any second.

He knew he had let his guard down.

He should have kept Eleanor safe and never allowed anyone to get close enough to hurt her.

If anything happened to her, he would make sure every single person responsible paid for it.

Lillian had gotten there just before him, and the second she spotted him, she ran over.

Tears rimmed her eyes as she grabbed his arm and started hitting him in frustration.

"This is your fault, Nolan! Every bit of it! If you had done your job and kept her safe, Eleanor wouldn't be in there fighting for her life! None of this would have happened!" she said in between sobs.

Ryland hurried to pull his shaken sister into his arms, holding her close.

He turned to Nolan, who seemed completely lost, and spoke in a softer voice. "Nolan, don't mind her.Lillian's just scared out of her mind."

To everyone else, Nolan was untouchable. He was the head of the Stewart family, someone people respected and even feared.

Now, he looked completely defeated.

Ryland understood better than anyone that nobody took Eleanor's car crash harder than Nolan did.

Nolan did not react to Lillian's anger.

He would not look at her. His focus never left the closed door in front of him.

A broken whisper left his lips. "I know. It's all because of me."

If he hadn't let things slide so many times, the people hiding in the dark would never have dared to go after Eleanor.

He really believed he could keep her safe, no matter what.

Even though he made careful plans, he still failed. She stil ended up hurt, and it crushed him.

He spun around and fixed his bloodshot eyes on Erick, who had been following close behind. There was no hiding the anger burning in his stare.

"Did you track down the truck driver yet?" he asked.

Erick looked like he might shrink under the pressure of that glare. He struggled to breathe as he answered,"We're still looking, boss. I'll bring in more people and find the driver as quickly as I can."

Right then, the emergency room doors swung open.

A doctor stepped out, white coat crisp, and his eyes were serious.

Nolan hurried over, anxiety clear in every movement. "Is she going to be alright?"

The doctor pulled down his mask. His face softened a little, but he didn't look hopeful. "The man in the crash got lucky. The airbags protected him, so his injuries are minor. Just a mild concussion. The woman took the worst of it. She broke two ribs and suffered a serious concussion. Right now, the biggest danger is how much blood she's lost." He let out a tired sigh before adding, "Her blood type is AB, and while it's not especially uncommon, we've completely run out of it in our supply. We just used the last of it on a pregnant woman who suffered an amniotic fluid embolism."

He frowned. "If we try to get more from the city's blood bank, it'll take no less than two hours. Even if we start collecting on-site donations now, we'd need at least twenty people willing to give blood, and that's almost impossible to manage in time."

All the hope Nolan felt slipped away.

He could not let Eleanor lie on that operating table for two hours without help.

Panic set in. He grabbed the doctor's arm, his eyes turning red. "Where can I find the hospital's broadcast room?"

The doctor froze for a moment, caught off guard by the sudden question.

After a second, he pointed down the hall. "Go that way and turn left at the end."

Nolan did not waste a second. He took off running, leaving everyone else staring in confusion, wondering what he planned to do.

Moments later, the sound of his voice filled the hospital as the intercom crackled to life.
###Chapter 181 It's Not Your Fault





Nolan's voice rang through the corridors, fast but sharp enough to be heard clearly. "Anyone with AB blood who qualifies to donate, please head to the emergency room on the second floor.Afterward,you can collect a reward of $10,000 from the Stewart Group."



At first, he had thought about offering a million, but the thought of people faking eligibility and overwhelming the medical staff made him hesitate.



Ten thousand was enough to draw a crowd without causing chaos.



He repeated the message again and again until he was sure it had reached every corner of the hospital.Only then did he leave the broadcast room and return to the doctor.



The doctor just stared at him, dumbfounded. Could something like this really work?


To his surprise, it did.



Within minutes, people rushed in from every direction.





After all, ten thousand dollars was no small sum.


To earn that much from a single blood donation was almost like stumbling on a once-in-a-lifetime windfall.


In less than five minutes, the nurses' station by/the emergency room was packed with volunteers ready to donate.



As the blood steadily made its way into the operating room, Nolan finally exhaled the breath he had been holding.


He grabbed the doctor's hand and asked quickly,"Will this be enough?"


The doctor blinked, as though snapping out of a daze, and nodded. "Yes. It's enough." Hearing that, Nolan made his way towards the operating room and waited outside.


At that moment, Jeff and Hilda arrived, having caught the announcement while entering the hospital.


The only reason Nolan would be this desperate... was Eleanor.



Hilda's chest tightened.


She shoved her husband toward the nurse station in panic. "Jeff, you're AB blood type too! Go donate!"


Jeff froze in shock.



Eleanor was AB too?



The blood type wasn't exactly rare, but it wasn't common either.


Was this really just coincidence?


But then, something inside him softened. All the bitterness and the judgment he had carried seemed to crumble. Yet, when they reached the nurses' station, the nurse informed them that the needed blood had already been collected.



Jeff stepped back, standing quietly by Hilda,who looked stricken with worry.


Nolan and Lillian saw them but said nothing.


For once, no one cared about grudges or misunderstandings. In that moment, all they wanted was the same thing-for Eleanor to survive.


Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the red light above the operating room door switched off.


Nolan shot forward instantly. "Doctor, how is she?"he asked anxiously.


The doctor pulled off his mask, looking tired but relieved. "Thanks to the timely blood transfusion, the patient was very lucky. She made it through. They'll be bringing her out shortly."


Nolan's knees buckled, and he staggered a few steps before managing to steady himself. Even though he was still a bit shaken, he also felt an immense sense of relief.


She was safe, and that was all that mattered.


Behind him, the others let out a collective breath.


Hilda almost fell over, but Jeff held her up just in time.



Lillian watched with a cold look but held back from making the usual sharp comments.


Their worry for Eleanor seemed real, and she didn't want to cause a scene right then.


Moments later, Eleanor was pushed out of the operating room, lying still on the hospital bed.


Her eyes were shut tight, her face pale as paper.


She looked fragile, breakable even, and the sight tugged painfully at everyone who cared for her.


Nolan walked alongside the gurney, gripping the rail as the doctors pushed her toward the VIP ward on the top floor. Right behind them was Denny, also being wheeled out.


Since he had served the Benton family for so many years, Jeff and Hilda immediately stepped forward,their voices anxious as they asked the doctor,"How is he?"


They hadn't been there earlier to hear the update, so the doctor replied calmly, "He's fine. The airbags spared him from serious injury. It's only a mild concussion. He fainted from the shock, but with some rest, he'll recover completely."


"Thank you, Doctor. Truly, thank you," Jeff and Hilda said over and over, their relief evident as they followed the staff escorting Denny to his ward.


Hilda wanted to go up to the top floor as well, to see Eleanor, but deep down she knew Nolan wouldn't allow it right now.


And honestly, how could she face Eleanor? If she hadn't asked her out that day, there wouldn't have been an accident. Guilt consumed her.


It was her fault, all of it.


Lost in these thoughts, Hilda broke down and rushed out of the room in tears.


Jeff quickly told a bodyguard to stay behind, then rushed after her.


He found her shaking with sobs, and he gently patted her shoulder, awkward in his attempt to comfort. "Sweetheart, don't do this to yourself. It's not your fault."


But Hilda couldn't be soothed.


She buried her face against his chest, crying until her body ached with exhaustion.


When she finally lifted her head, her eyes were red and swollen. "Jeff, I don't care whether you accept Eleanor or not. In my heart, she is my daughter.I'm not asking for your approval, but you can't stop me from seeing her again. Never again!" Her voice broke as she spoke. She had come close to losing Eleanor forever, and that kind of fear left no room for hesitation. From now on,she only wanted to stay by her side.


Seeing Hilda's determination, Jeff didn't argue and simply nodded.


His own chest felt heavy with emotions he couldn't sort out.
###Chapter 182 Why Are You Panicking





When Eleanor slowly opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was Nolan's tense face.


His usually perfect hair was messy, and a faint gray stubble had started to shadow his chin.



He rarely looked anything less than composed, and seeing him like this, vulnerable and exhausted,stirred a mix of emotions in her chest that she couldn't quite name.


The moment he noticed she was awake, Nolan bent to press gentle, repeated kisses to her hand, as though he were holding a treasure he thought he might have lost forever.


Finally, his voice came out hoarse, thick with emotion. "Just rest. Don't worry about anything, and don't ask questions. I'll take care of everything.Anyone who hurt you... they won't get away with it." The accident had shaken him to his core.


Watching her lie there so still, so fragile, had terrified him.


For a moment, he thought he was losing her, and the thought of continuing without her was unbearable.


Eleanor felt the warmth of his palm against hers, and after a long pause, she whispered, "Okay."


She realized, in a way that unsettled her, just how deep his love ran.


They hadn't been together long, yet the intensity of his care and the vulnerability he allowed himself to show were something she had never expected.


Suddenly, she felt the need to rethink everything about their relationship.


Meanwhile, the outside world remained oblivious to Eleanor's survival.


At the Benton family's villa, Lainey lounged on the sofa, swirling a glass of wine with slow, deliberate movements.



The TV repeatedly replayed the footage of the catastrophic car accident.


Her lips curled into a satisfied smirk as she watched the crushed Rolls-Royce.


If Eleanor weren't dead, she would certainly be crippled by now.


Or better yet... gone for good.


Her thoughts flicked to Emma, who had turned out to be far more useful than she had expected.


Just a few words, and the girl had fallen right into her hands, becoming her most obedient little pawn.


A disposable tool like that was always convenient.


Her phone buzzed repeatedly on the table, Emma's name flashing on the screen, but Lainey didn't even glance at it and muted it without a second thought.


Emma was so timid; freaking out over something so trivial. Lainey sipped her wine slowly, savoring the moment.She hadn't been involved in the crash at all.


Emma had planned and executed it completely on her own. If anyone could be blamed, it was only Emma.



Glancing at the clock, she noted it was time to get ready. Wine glass down, she headed upstairs.


After a long, luxurious bath, she slipped into a custom outfit, ready to meet her friends.


But when she opened the door, she was met with a panicked face.



Emma?



Lainey's eyes narrowed. How had she slipped past the security?


Such a nuisance.Lainey rolled her eyes inwardly.


Emma's hands trembled as she clutched Lainey's,her voice frantic. "Lainey, what do we do? The truck driver I arranged... he didn't die. He escaped. If anyone finds him and figures out it was me... I'm done for."


The plan had seemed foolproof. The driver was weak,and in such a violent crash, he was bound to die.


Dead men tell no tales, after all.


But she hadn't counted on the man surviving and cutting off all contact.


Now, he was a ticking time bomb.


Lainey gave her hand a dismissive shake, smoothing her sleeve as if swatting away a fly. "Why are you panicking? If anyone asks, just deny it."


Emma froze for a moment, then her eyes widened with a dawning realization.


"But Eleanor has Nolan backing her! He's not the type to just let it go if I deny it."


Emma had assumed Lainey would support her, that together they could get the Benton and the Todd families to cover their tracks. But now it was obvious that Lainey had never intended to help at all.


Fear hit her full force.


"If you don't help me, I'll tell everyone you made me do it!" Emma said.



Lainey laughed, calm and leisurely, as if Emma had just told the world's silliest joke.


"I never told you to do it," she said, twirling a freshly manicured nail between her fingers. "I've always warned you not to be reckless. You chose this path yourself.I can't stop you."



Emma's mind went blank.


Her brother had warned her, and now she finally understood why.



Lainey wasn't just ruthless-she was venomous.


Staggering back a few steps, Emma glared at Lainey."You manipulated me! And you think you'll get away with it? No way! Nolan cares for Eleanor,and whether there's proof or not, if I tell him you were involved,he won't let you off the hook!"
###Chapter 183 Why Do You Look So Upset

The moment Lainey heard Emma's word, her face turned livid.


Who did Emma think she was, throwing around threats like that?


"Where's security? Get her out of here right now!"Lainey snapped, her voice echoing across the lobby.


A few guards rushed over, alarm flickering in their eyes when they realized someone had gotten past them.



"Yes, ma'am!"


Without hesitation, they clamped a hand over Emma's mouth and hauled her away through a side exit.



Emma's eyes flashed with anger as she tried to  shout, her voice swallowed by the guards' grip.


No one so much as glanced in her direction.


Moments later, she found herself dumped on the pavement outside.


She sat for a second, her hair tangled and dress rumpled, but her gaze was fierce and unyielding.


"Lainey, you're not getting away with this," she vowed silently, squeezing her fists so tightly her knuckles turned white.


Inside, Lainey tossed her hair over her shoulder, a scornful look fixed on her face, and started to walk away.


Before she made it far,she collided with Hilda, who had just stepped through the door.


"Lainey, who was that? I could hear you yelling from outside," Hilda said.



A jolt of panic shot through Lainey.


Why did she have to show up now, of all times? Had she overheard everything?


Quickly, Lainey pasted on her sweetest smile and intended to link her arm with Hilda's. "Mom, you're home! Oh, that was just the property manager coming by to update our records."


Without missing a moment, she changed the topic."Is Dad with you? I didn't see him come in."


Hilda let out a grunt and didn't bother replying.


She brushed past Lainey and headed straight into the house.



Lainey's arm dropped to her side, and her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment.


After a second, she sulked and followed after her.


The villa soon filled with the sounds of bustling activity.


Servants darted back and forth in the kitchen, pots and pans clanging in a chorus.


Were they preparing for a party? No one had told her there would be guests.



She caught one of the staff as they hurried by.


The servant paused and answered respectfully, "Mrs.Benton gave orders for a special meal. She said Miss Warren was in a car accident but has finally pulled through. She wants to make sure she recovers well."


The instant the servant finished her explanation,Lainey's complexion turned pale.


How on earth did Eleanor make it out alive?



She should have been dead.


Anger kept building inside her, and her eyes turned cold and sharp.


The servant's shoulders tensed as he caught her glare, and he shrank back, afraid to say another word.



Hilda appeared on the staircase in a soft sweater and slacks, catching sight of the tense atmosphere in the foyer. She arched an eyebrow, suspicion clear as she asked, "Why do you look so upset? Shouldn't you be relieved that Eleanor pulled through?"


That question jolted Lainey, and she forced hersef to school her features."Mom, you've got it wrong. I just didn't know what to say for a second. Obviously, it's great news that Eleanor survived that accident."


Worried that Hilda would see through her act, she rushed to add, "We haven't always gotten along, but that doesn't mean I want anything bad to happen to her."



Saying those words nearly choked her.


Without another word, she mumbled a flimsy excuse and darted upstairs.


Hilda watched her retreat, the lines on her brow deepening.


When Lainey disappeared from sight, Hilda turned to the servant for the full story of what had just transpired. After she heard every detail, an icy unease crept over her.


Lainey's expression, when she heard about Eleanor's survival, was chilling.


Was it possible that Lainey had a hand in the accident?



As she thought back to the heated exchange she had overheard at the front door, the suspicion only grew.


Still, she kept her composure. Nolan had always approached problems with a level head.


He had already assigned someone to dig into the truth. The facts would surface soon enough.


Until then, she needed to keep Eleanor close and ensure nothing else could happen.


While Hilda made plans of her own, Lainey stormed into her bedroom and slammed the door.



Her hands wouldn't stop shaking.


A mix of dread and frustration churned in her stomach.



With someone like Emma out there, her secrets were at risk, especially if Nolan applied pressure.


Letting Emma roam free was too dangerous now.


She would have to silence her before things spiraled out of control.


For that, she would need Horace's help more than ever.
###Chapter 184 Out Of My Way!





Emma had no inkling of the storm brewing outside her world.



The moment she got home, she locked herself in her bedroom, shutting out everyone and everything. She wouldn't even touch the food left on her tray.


Hours slipped by, and darkness filled the corners of her mind. By sundown, though, her thoughts cleared and a new plan took shape.


It finally dawned on her, Lainey was just as trapped as she was. There was no way that woman would risk her own future with the Benton family just to cut her loose.


Walking away from all that money and influence?Lainey.wasn't that foolish.


The realization lifted a weight from her chest.Suddenly, the pieces clicked together. Maybe she could turn the situation to her advantage and squeeze some cash out of Lainey.


A sly grin tugged at her lips. Hope returned, and Emma slipped out the door with a renewed spring in her step.


She wanted to spend the evening at a bar, sipping a few drinks and toasting to her own little victory.


Lainey was loaded, and taking a few million off her would be easier than most people thought.



Hard times were about to become a thing of the past;she could almost taste the freedom.


Fate, however, had different plans. Emma's car sputtered and died on the way to the bar.


She couldn't keep driving, so she guided the car to a stop along the side of the road.


With a sigh of pure irritation, she pulled to the side of the road and yanked open the door, ready to curse her luck. Before she could even take a breath, two rough hands clamped over her mouth from behind.


She thrashed wildly, kicking at the ground and swinging her elbows, but the attacker barely flinched. In seconds, he dragged her off into the shadows, hidden by thick underbrush.


Her muffled cries grew faint, then vanished completely.


Miles away, a heavy silence filled a hospital room.Nolan sat at Eleanor's bedside, the weight of worry pressing into his brow as he watched her sleep.


Suddenly, his phone buzzed, cutting though the hush.



He checked the screen. Erick's name flashed back at him.



"Mr. Stewart, we tracked down the driver."


Nolan's expression hardened, and a chill settled in the air. "Don't hold back. Get him to talk. I want the truth about who ordered that hit."


There was no way a nobody truck driver just happened to ram into a Rolls-Royce. Nolan was certain the crash was orchestrated.



His gaze lingered on Eleanor's pale face, and something sharp twisted in his chest.


He would never forgive himself if harm found her again, and he couldn't stand the thought of her being wronged another moment.


While those worries chased each other through his mind, the hallway outside suddenly erupted with shouting.


"Out of my way! Who here thinks they can stop me?"a thunderous voice demanded.



Grandfather had arrived.


A muscle in Nolan's jaw ticked with annoyance.


He rose from his seat, gently tucking the blanket around Eleanor's shoulders before slipping quietly from the hospital room.


In the corridor, rows of bodyguards in dark suits stood like statues, each one radiating stern authority.


Not a single soul was allowed past their line; security was so tight, it felt suffocating.


Near the elevator, Norwood was locked in a standoff with the guards, cane gripped tight in his wrinkled fist.



The moment he spotted Nolan, he hurled the cane straight at him.


"You ungrateful brat! You'd barricade your own grandfather just to protect a girl? Are you really so determined to turn Elepdon upside down?"


Nolan let the cane strike his armn, refusing to so much as wince.



"Take my grandfather home," he said coldly,directing the servant who stood beside his grandfather. There wasn't a moment to spare for explanations.


The less anyone knew about Eleanor's whereabouts,the safer she would be until the real culprit was found.



Even so, when he looked his grandfather in the eye,the edge in his voice softened.


"Please, look after your health, Grandpa. When this is over, I'll come home and give you a proper apology."


Nolan's attitude lit a fire in Norwood, and his whole body trembled from how furious he had become.


He opened his mouth to speak again, but Nolan had already turned his back and was giving one last command to the bodyguards standing nearby.


He faced the bodyguards and gave one last command, his voice cutting through the tension. "No one comes through that door. Anyone who tries, deal with them, no exceptions."


Without another glance, Nolan strode to the elevator,his mind already moving on to the next threat.
###Chapter 185 You Don't Get Another Chance
Deep in the shadows of an old, forgotten warehouse on the city's edge, agonized screams bounced off rusted walls.



Erick watched the battered truck driver with cool detachment, not a flicker of emotion crossing his face. Two hulking guards kept the man upright,though he looked ready to collapse.



Slowly, Erick closed the distance, casting a long shadow over the trembling driver. "Let's make this easy for both of us. Give up the name of the person who hired you, or I promise you'll wish you hadn't kept quiet."



Blood dripped from the driver's mouth as he forced a crooked smile. "I'm not a snitch. The job's done, and I keep my word. Go ahead, do your worst." If law enforcement had him in their hands, he might have talked for a chance at parole.


But the way these people operated, they were taking justice into their own hands and dishing it out as they saw fit.


If he told the truth, he might as well dig his own grave.


Just as the questioning hit a dead end, the thick iron door of the factory burst open with a loud kick from the other side.



With a violent bang, the heavy door slammed open,sending a shockwave of fear through everyone in the room.



Nolan stepped inside, his silhouette framed by the harsh light behind him, radiating cold authority.


He paused to loosen his tie, every movement deliberate and menacing.


Nobody expected him to show up in person. Erick's heart skipped a beat as he rushed forward. "Mr.


Stewart, I was just about to-"


Still, Nolan acted as if he hadn't heard a word he said.



He moved past Erick without a word, his face set in a hard line, eyes locking onto the driver who, bruised and bloodied, still held his head high with defiance.


A look of pure contempt flickered across Nolan's face before he issued his chilling command. "Bring his family in. Now."



Without delay, Erick nodded and hurried to obey.



Sudden panic drained the color from the driver's cheeks.



He started thrashing against his captors, wild with fear,but there was no escaping their grip.


Desperation took hold as he pleaded, voice cracking,"Leave my family out of this! Please, they've done nothing wrong! My wife's sick, and my son's just a little kid!" Nolan closed the distance, leaning in until his presence was impossible to ignore.


There was something cold and unreadable in his eyes, and beneath it all burned a clear hunger for blood.



"What has my girlfriend done to deserve this? She never laid a hand on anyone. Doesn't that make her innocent?"



Eleanor, who used to light up every room,now lay trapped in pain, struggling just to breathe without wincing.


Yet this man had the gall to hide behind his loved ones,hoping for mercy.


Nolan's tone dropped lower, colder than before."Give me a name. You don't get another chance."


Panic twisted the driver's face. His eyes darted desperately, sweat and blood mixing on his brow as his resolve crumbled.



Fear clawed at him. Either his own life would end  here, or everything he loved would be destroyed.


Finally, defeat hollowed out his features. His shoulders slumped. The fight was gone from him.


"It was Emma Todd," he whispered.


Every trace of warmth vanished from Nolan's face."That's all I needed," he said, voice like ice.


Without waiting for another word, he spun around and strode for the door, as if the man before him wasn't worth another second of his time.



Erick stared after him, caught off guard, then scrambled to follow.



He rushed after his boss, trying to keep pace as he asked, "Mr. Stewart, what should we do about the driver?"



Nolan didn't slow down, his answer cutting through the gloom.


"Don't kill him. Make sure he's breathing, then drop him at the nearest police station." There would be no mercy tonight. His mind was already moving to the next target.


A storm gathered in his gaze. "As for the Todd Group,wipe them out. Emma's gotten away with too much for far too long."


Not a single member of that Todd family could claim innocence.



Nolan had once snapped up a hefty portion of Todd Group shares, thinking he might hand the whole business over to Eleanor someday. But he had changed his mind.


The Todd family wouldn't escape what was coming.


He paused and shot Erick a look so cold, it made the man's skin crawl.



"Track down Emma. I don't care if she's breathing when you find her. Check every person she's spoken to, every place she's been. I want to find out who put this plan in her head."


Erick swallowed hard, nerves prickling at the finality in his boss's tone.



There would be no second chances for Emma now.


He answered with careful respect, not daring to slip in the slightest, "Understood,sir."


Erick stood there, his eyes following the black Bentley as it tore off into the distance.


The night breeze swept past, but the cold that crept over him came from deep within.


This time, Nolan's fury was real, a force that wouldn't be held back.



It looked as though Elepdon was about to face a storm.
###Chapter 186 Run A DNA Test





As Nolan walked back to the hospital, a faint hint of cruelty lingered around him.


The sharp intensity of his presence made the bodyguards at the end of the hallway straighten instinctively, though their eyes kept flicking toward the ward.



Nolan suddenly stopped.


Had something happened to Eleanor?


The thought alone made his blood run cold.


He didn't allow himself to linger on it. With a sharp movement, he pushed open the ward door.


The room was calm.


Eleanor was awake, leaning slightly against the headboard,while Hilda was sitting beside her, gently feeding her soup. Hearing the door, Eleanor turned her head. Her eyes met Nolan's, and she noticed the worried look on his face.



Her delicate brows lifted in curiosity. "What happened?"


At the sound of her voice, Nolan's tension eased, and he drew in a steadying breath.


"Nothing," he replied smoothly, though his gaze lingered on Hilda with polite detachment. "Mrs.Benton, when did you get here?"



Hilda was one of the few people he allowed near Eleanor.


He trusted her because she genuinely cared.


Startled by his earlier intensity, Hilda took a deep breath and composed herself.


She set the soup bowl down and offered a gentle smile. "I just got here a little while ago," she said softly. "Seeing Eleanor safe is a relief." With a meaningful glance at Eleanor, Hilda added,"You two talk. I'll take my leave."


After Hilda quietly left, the room fell back into silence,leaving just Eleanor and Nolan.



After a pause, Eleanor's curiosity won out. "Who did it?"



She had caught bits of his earlier conversation while half-asleep, and from what she had heard, he had already gone to handle it.


Nolan pulled up a chair beside her bed, his expression serious. "It was Emma."



Eleanor's brows creased slightly.



Emma, the pampered fool of the Todd family, was good for nothing except picking on others. Could she really be behind something so sinister?



She replayed the events in her mind. The anonymous warning about Myah fainting, followed by the speeding truck aimed directly at her. Everything pointed to a carefully designed trap meant to end her life.


"Emma? Really?" Eleanor's tone was doubtful.


"I don't believe it either," Nolan admitted, his tone sharpening. "There's definitely someone pulling the strings behind her."



His gaze softened as he looked at her pale,tired face. "I've already sent people to investigate thoroughly.You just rest.



Leave everything else to me."


Eleanor nodded, choosing not to overextend herself.


This was a danger she could trust him to handle.


He adjusted the blanket around her shoulders before leaving the ward.


Outside, the bodyguards stood stiffly at attention.


The warmth in Nolan's face vanished as he turned serious again. He called over one of his most trusted men and held out two strands of hair he had collected."Take these to my private doctor," he instructed quietly. "Run a DNA test. Discreetly. No one else can know. Just you and me."


With so many outsiders coming into Elepdon lately,Nolan couldn't be certain which hospital staff might be compromised.


Any DNA test had to be completely reliable.


He silently hoped the results would give him the clarity he needed.


The bodyguard, understanding the gravity of the order , nodded without hesitation. "Yes, sir."
###Chapter 187 | Can't Thank You Enough
Barely had Nolan begun to make his moves when the Todd Group's stock nosedived within days.


Before long, headlines everywhere screamed about the Todd family's impending collapse.


In her bedroom, Lainey sprawled across the sofa,a glass of red wine spinning lazily in her hand while her phone screen lit up her satisfied grin.


She congratulated herself for being one step ahead.


Well before Nolan struck back, she had already ordered Horace's men to snatch up Emma.



Now the Todd family's name was drowning in public ridicule, and Emma had disappeared so cleanly that no one could dig up a single clue.


Even Nolan, with all his power, had nothing that tied back to her.


Lainey allowed herself to breathe easy at last.


Grabbing her phone, she tapped a familiar number without hesitation.


The moment the call went through, her voice melted into syrupy sweetness. "Horace, I can't thank you enough. I'll always remember how much you've done for me."


She twirled a strand of hair around her finger, her tone sliding into something more cautious. "But tell me, what about Emma? Are you sure you've handled her the way l asked?"


On the other end, Horace let out a rough, impatient chuckle."You still doubt me, you little fox? | shipped her off to the open sea just like you wanted, andl even rigged the DNA test. Now quit dancing around-when are you giving me the shares you promised?"


The smile on Lainey's face faltered at once.


Because of Fraser's meddling, she hadn't gotten her hands on any shares at all.


And if she didn't have them, she couldn't possibly hand anything over to Horace.


She also knew better than to reveal that.



If he learned she had no claim to the Benton family's assets, he might drop her altogether.


She hesitated, pretending to consider her options,though her heart was racing. "It can't happen overnight. If I hand off a big chunk of shares right after securing them, people will start asking questions. And if they trace the deal back to you,that won't end well."



Horace had never been the kind of man who could be easily tricked.


After three long years of dealing with Lainey, he understood every shade of her cunning.


"It better stay that way." His tone shifted abruptly,the warmth stripped away and replaced with an unspoken threat. "If you ever think of going back on your word, you already know what happens next."


Without another word, he ended the call, leaving dead silence behind.



Lainey's temper flared, and for a split second she almost hurled the phone across the room.



"Damn it!" she hissed through clenched teeth.


That filthy street rat had the audacity to threaten her?



He ought to be thankful she was giving him the shares. She was set to inherit the Benton legacy, a woman whose name alone would carry weight and earn respect from everyone in Elepdon.


And yet some gang leader thought he had the right to negotiate with her?



The moment her place in the Benton family was secured, she swore the first name on her list of enemies would be his.



Just as Lainey's anger ebbed and she sank toward  the bed, the faint creak of footsteps stirred the silence outside her room.


A sharp jolt of unease shot through her, and she forced her breathing steady as she tossed the phone onto the sofa with deliberate ease.


Seconds ticked by, yet no knock landed on her door.


Instead, the sound drifted farther down the corridor,leading straight toward the master bedroom.



Curiosity pricked at her nerves, and she slid to the door, easing it open just enough to spy.


There in the corridor, Jeff gripped a bulky brown envelope tight against his chest.


His posture screamed tension, his head snapping from side to side before he slipped into the master bedroom with haste.



Lainey's eyes narrowed, and the corner of her mouth lifted ever so slightly.


Jeff never carried himself like that unless he was guarding a secret.


Whatever lay inside that envelope had to be worth hiding.


Lainey made up her mind to trail after Jeff and find out for herself.


She had no intention of letting his tricks blindside her.




Jeff, however, had no idea a pair of watchful eyes was fixed on his back.



Right then, he was busy passing the envelope into his wife's hands, and she accepted it with a look of eager anticipation.
###Chapter 188 What Did You Do With My Sister!
Hilda slid the envelope open before fishing out the crisp sheet of paper tucked inside.


The moment her fingertips brushed the page, she jerked her hand back, as if the truth hidden there might scorch her.


Her heartbeat thundered in her ears, threatening to drown out every rational thought.


Gathering what courage she had left, Hilda forced herself to scan the section with the test results.



She froze. "Jeff Benton and Eleanor Warren, parent-child relationship-excluded?"


The words didn't make sense. How could Eleanor not be their daughter?


Her knees buckled. Hilda nearly collapsed on the No.


This couldn't be real.


Eleanor had always looked just like her at that age.


The connection she felt with that girl couldn't possibly be a lie.


Jeff's expression clouded with disappointment as he caught her, steadying Hilda's trembling frame. He reached into the envelope and pulled out another sheet. "Don't panic yet, sweetheart. To be sure, I had them run a test with Lainey and me as well."


Hilda barely processed his words, Hilda's eyes glazing over as she stared at the second report.


The phrase "99.99% probability of parent-child relationship" jumped out at her, sharp as a slap.


Her world spun out of control. Every ounce of strength seemed to drain from her.


This second piece of paper shattered her, leaving her  grasping for anything to hold on to.


Clutching Jeff's hand in a desperate, unyielding grip,she begged, "There has to be some kind of mistake,right? Please tell me that's all it is."


Jeff wrapped his arms around her, rubbing her back as he tried to soothe her panic.



His voice broke as he answered, "No mistake,Hilda.I made sure everything was supervised from start to finish. Nobody could have meddled with it."


He hesitated for a moment, then tried to offer some small comfort, as much for himself as for her. "Lainey really is ours. And about Eleanor-remember,your brother lost a daughter years ago. Maybe there's a connection we-"



His words trailed off, never making it to the end.


Hilda let herself drop onto the sofa, her gaze dull and unfocused.



She couldn't bring herself to accept what she had just learned. Eleanor's calm eyes, that familiar expression, so much like her own, kept flickering through her mind.


How could she not be her daughter?


Out in the corridor, Lainey had caught every word.


Honestly, those two were hopelessly trusting.


They thought having a guard oversee the tests would guarantee everything was real.


If only they realized the swap had happened before the samples ever left their sight.



Horace had pulled off the switch from the very beginning.



Only these two would put that much faith in their own bodyguard.


Still, their cluelessness worked in her favor.


Her place as a Benton was finally secure.


Next up was a divorce, a fat stack of shares, and marrying Nolan.  From that moment forward, her world would be wrapped in riches and comfort.


And Eleanor, what good was luck if she would never come out on top?


Lainey barely had time to bask in her victory when Jonny's furious shout echoed up the stairs. "Lainey!Get down here, now! What did you do with my sister?!"



A jolt of worry shot through her. Had Jonny uncovered something?



Why was he after her over Emma's disappearance?


She rushed to the door, anxious to head downstairs before he could cause more of a scene.



But Jeff was quicker. He stepped into her path,offering a reassuring look. "Don't worry, sweetheart.I'll take care of this."


With a determined glare, he stormed down the stairs.


Left with no choice, Lainey followed, her heart pounding as she braced herself for what was to come.
###Chapter 189 I'm Sorry For All You've Been Through
Jeff strode over to Jonny, his voice cutting through the air. "Do you really think our place is some circus where anyone can barge in and create chaos?"



Years of being in charge lent his presence a weight that was impossible to ignore.


Yet, that hardly mattered to Jonny right now.


Emma might have been a handful, but she was his little sister. He had looked out for her all his life.There was no way he could just let her vanish without demanding answers.


Jonny brushed past Jeff, locking eyes with Lainey.His voice was raw, worn down by worry. "Emma called you all the time before she went missing. You saw her the night she disappeared. She came home a wreck, wouldn't touch her dinner or even speak.
  Lainey, can you honestly say you had nothing to do with her vanishing?"


His stare never wavered, as if he could force the truth out of her.


Lainey,rattled, squirmed under his scrutiny.


She clung to Jeff's arm, her voice trembling, the very picture of innocence. "Dad, I swear I don't know anything about what happened.Emma came to me a few days ago. She was desperate for money. She looked so lost that I gave her $100, 000, just to help."


Seeing his daughter in tears tore at Jeff's heart,snapping the last thread of his patience.


He signaled to the security guards by the entrance,his tone sharp and final. "Get him out. I don't want Jonny Todd setting foot near this house again. If you can't handle that, you're out of a job."


His order carried real menace.



Feeling the tension, the head of security motioned for his team to close in on Jonny. But Jonny's attention never wavered from Lainey. His eyes held a mixture of disbelief and sorrow, as if the person standing in front of him was a complete stranger.


Two decades had passed with Jonny believing he understood Lainey better than anyone.


A decade spent as her boyfriend had made him confident he knew every side of her.


Recent events shattered that certainty. The truth hit him hard-he had never truly seen her atall.


He now recognized what he had missed. There was nothing but self-interest, cruelty, and lies beneath the surface. All this time, he had chosen to be blind.


Eleanor, he realized, was worth ten of her, though she didn't come from an influential family.


As these thoughts burned in his mind, the security team moved to escort him out.



Jonny stood his ground and kept his expression cold.He pinned Lainey with a glare sharp enough to cut. "You'll be answering to the police about Emma. If you had anything to do with her going missing, you'll regret it more than you can imagine."


Only those with nothing left were fearless-he would take Lainey down with him if it came to that.


The guards led him away, and Jonny left without protest.


All of this played out beneath Hilda's watchful gaze from upstairs. She pieced things together as she watched the confrontation.


That must have been Emma arguing with Lainey before-now Emma had vanished.


Given that Lainey had hid behind Jeff, looking shaken and guilty, Hilda's suspicions only grew stronger.Deep down, she was certain-Lainey was involved.


Everything Hilda believed about Lainey fell apart in a matter of moments.



Deception and greed were only part of what lay beneath the surface; a cold streak of cruelty was there as well.


The years of tension between Lainey and Eleanor suddenly seemed more threatening. If Lainey could turn on her so easily, what might she be capable of next?



Directly confronting her would be pointless.


If Hilda wanted to protect Eleanor, she needed to keep up appearances and watch Lainey closely for any signs of danger.



With her mind made up, Hilda descended the stairs.As Lainey entered, Hilda wrapped her in an embrace,offering warmth she had never shown before."Darling, that man was never good enough for you.I'm sorry for all you've been through."


Confidence blossomed inside Lainey as she believed Hilda finally trusted her after those test results.Victory felt almost sweet enough to taste.



She leaned into the embrace and played the dutiful daughter. "Mom, having you and Dad back in my life  everything worth it."


Anyone glancing in would have seen nothing but a picture-perfect family.


Jeff took in the scene with deep contentment.


Finally, it seemed, Hilda had accepted Lainey completely.




The prospect of all three sons returning from overseas only added to his satisfaction.


Soon,their family would feel whole again.


Eleanor resembled his wife, yes, but blood didn't lie.


Maybe, once they made it back to Breoqua,he would speak to Hilda's brother about Eleanor. If there wvas a reunion to be had, it was up to them to decide.
###Chapter 190 Why Are You Blaming Eleanor
Jonny left without a word after being thrown out,making his way back to the Todd family's house.


Shock hit him the instant he stepped inside.


The living room had been turned upside down.


Uniformed officers were scattered throughout,carefully itemizing everything in sight.


Vickie sat on the floor with her hair in wild disarray,pounding her fists and wailing. "This is a disaster!They're taking everything we own! How are we supposed to survive?"


When her eyes landed on Jonny, hopelit up her face.


She rushed to his side, clinging to him desperately."Jonny, thank goodness you're home! You have to make them stop!" Before Jonny could even respond, a man in glasses stepped forward, flashed his badge, and handed over a legal notice, his expression hard as stone.


"The Todd Group has been accused of unfair competition, buried in debt, and is now bankrupt. By law, we're freezing and seizing every asset in your name-including this property."


Jonny stared straight ahead, refusing to even touch the document.



Vickie looked like she might faint, her face growNing ashen.



She stammered, barely above a whisper, "Bankrupt?That can't be. The company was stable... How did this happen?"


A flicker of suspicion crossed her mind-was this somehow tied to Eleanor or Nolan?



Eleanor had to be the one behind this.

 
That woman must have pushed Nolan until he tore their family apart. She was ruthless to the core.



Vickie's thoughts spun wildly, and she grabbed Jonny in desperation. "Jonny, this has Eleanor written all over it. She must have told Nolan to destroy us.You have to go and beg him to stop."


Jonny tried to form an answer, but no words came.


An aged, steady voice cut through the air from the staircase.



"That's enough! Why are you blaming Eleanor?Everything that happened is because of your son's choices!"



Sallie appeared, moving carefully as someone steadied her down the steps.


Jonny froze, then a flicker of relief crossed his face when he saw her.


Clutching at hope, he dropped to his knees with a loud thud. "Grandma! I'm begging you! Please help.me. Go to Eleanor and talk to her. Ask her to speak to Nolan and give us one last chance. She's always respected you. If you stand up for us, she'll listen!"


Sallie's lips stayed pressed together as her eyes lingered on him. The weight of her disappointment was unmistakable. To her, he was still just as blind and selfish as ever.


From her pocket, she pulled out a bank card and pressed it into his hand. "There's $2 million left on this. It's everything l've saved. Take it and try to rebuild your life. Eleanor doesn't owe this family another thing. Even if I swallowed my pride and begged her, it wouldn't change a thing."


For most households, that amount would have been enough to live comfortably.


For Jonny, who had lived in excess for years,the thought of scaling back felt unbearable.


His fingers slipped from the card, and his knees gave out as he sank to the floor, his spirit broken.


Regret tore through him.


He cursed the day he ever got tangled up with  Lainey, that snake of a woman.


He cursed himself for letting Eleanor go.


But every chance he once had was gone.


Nothing could be undone now.


Watching him crumble stirred something in Sallie, but her sympathy wasn't enough to hold her back. She turned and started up the stairs.


Age had already stolen much of her strength, and she no longer had the power to rescue the ruined Todd Group or to bring Emma back.


The light at the top of the staircase stretched her shadow, making her look as though she had aged ten more years in a single night.
###Chapter 191 You Make It Look Effortless
News of the Todd Group's collapse exploded across the media, plastered on every headline.


Hot on its heels came the announcement that the Stewart Group had taken full control of the Usepsall project.


Propped up against the hospital bed, Eleanor let her gaze drift from the flashing television to the man beside her, who was carefully carving neat strips of apple skin.



Her lips curved with mischief as she remarked,"Nolan, you make it look effortless. Toppling a company in the stock market as if it were child's play."


Nolan's lashes lowered as he trimmed the last curl of peel, then brought the fruit to her lips with calm  precision. "It doesn't amount to much," he replied smoothly.


To him, the Todd Group had been nothing more than a small obstacle.


The Usepsall project, however, carried weight-because it was where he had first crossed paths with her,impressed by her.


The knife clinked softly against the tray as he set it aside, and then he leaned in close enough for his breath to stir her hair. "Tell me something.Watching Jonny fall this far-don't you feel even a trace of pity?"



Eleanor didn't bother lifting her eyes, though amusement sparked inside her.



Honestly, could he be any more transparent?Jealousy fit him like a second skin.



Deciding to messing with him, she let out a languid sigh and tipped her head back dramatically. "How could I not? I'll admit it-there's still a corner of my heart that remembers him."


Nolan only chuckled, easily recognizing her mischief.


Instead of bristling, he wrapped an arm around her shoulders and pressed a kiss against her forehead."That's fine. Because at the end of the day, I'm the one who gets to stay by your side."


Heat rushed to her cheeks, painting them a betraying shade of red.



Before she could fire back, the hospital door creaked open.


Erick slipped inside, his eyes landing instantly on the couple nestled together.


His face froze in horror.


Damn it, why did he always walk in at the worst possible moment?


Just his luck-another paycheck deduction was practically guaranteed.


The sudden silence shattered when Nolan's voice cut through, cold and unyielding. "Well? Spit it out."


Jolted back to himself, Erick straightened and blurted out, "Boss, your grandfather insists you come see him."



No reply came from Nolan.


Eleanor nudged his arm with quiet insistence. "You should go. If you keep Norwood waiting, it won't end well."



She already knew from Erick that Norwood had shown up in person earlier, only for Nolan to send him away without a word.


Since the old man had sent someone again, she understood it would only damage Nolan's standing if he refused a second time.



The last thing she wanted was for him to argue with his family because of her.


After weighing it for a moment, Nolan finally inclined his head, loosened his hold on her, and rose to his feet. He adjusted his collar with a precise motion, slipping back into his composed and authoritative demeanor.



Before turning away, he pressed her hand firmly. "Get some rest. The guards are stationed outside-call them if you need anything."


Eleanor offered a small nod, giving him reassurance.


Was he really treating her as though she couldn't fend for herself?



She was the Soul Surgeon, for heaven's sake. Taking care of her own injuries was the least of her skills.


The moment the door clicked shut behind him, she scanned the room to ensure no one lingered.Satisfied she was alone, she began administering her own treatment without hesitation.


Waiting for her body to recover naturally would take far too long. With her methods, the healing process would be swift and decisive.



None of this was seen by Nolan, who by then had already entered the study at the Stewart family's residence.


At Norwood's side stood a young man whose face was unfamiliar.



He appeared a touch younger than Nolan, his features polished and his bearing confident.


Norwood wasted no time on pleasantries. As soon as Nolan entered, his voice rang out. "This is Wray Stewart-one of our distant relatives. He graduated from Kingswell University, and his abilities are exceptional."


Wray rose quckly, extending his hand with smooth composure. "Nolan, it's an honor."


Nolan's eyes lingered on him, sharp and unreadable.Instead of reaching out, he gave a slight nod in acknowledgment.


Norwood ignored the tension, his cloudy eyes flashing with authority as he dropped his verdict."From this day forward, Wray will oversee the Usepsall project."
###Chapter 192 Grandpa Just Needs Entertainment
Nolan said nothing as he lowered himself onto the sofa.



Wray, unable to contain his excitement, bent forward in a deep bow. "Nolan, Norwood, you can count on me. I'll give it everything I have."


Norwood kept his face unreadable while signaling the butler to escort Wray out. "See that he gets some rest," he said.



The butler guided Wray away, and the weight of the wooden door echoed as it shut.



Norwood reached for the cup beside him and took a slow sip.


A thin veil of steam rose, briefly concealing the sharp edge in his gaze. "Cut ties with that woman, and the Usepsall project stays under your control. There's room to bargain,"Norwood said. "If not, then surrender half of the Stewart Group's shares."


He had no doubt how Nolan would choose the first option.


He had been the one to raise the boy. He knew Nolan's weaknesses, his sense of duty that often outweighed his own emotions.


The Stewart Group was the pride of his entire life.He would never allow another to take it from him.



If Nolan abandoned that woman, everything could return to the way it once was.


But Nolan's voice was calm and steady as he answered, "Grandpa, if you want to take the company back, I'll see to it immediately."


Norwood's hand trembled, sending hot coffee sloshing over the rim, though he barely noticed.


Nolan was ready to give up the Stewart Group for a Norwood studied his grandson's unnervingly calm expression, and for the first time, he felt as though the boy was a stranger.


His hand shot up, trembling as he tried to form words. "How could you-"


Nolan bent forward in a polite bow, his voice steady."If l've upset you, then I'll take my leave and not trouble you further," he said.


Without another word, he turned and walked away,showing no hint of hesitation.


Rage clouded Norwood's sight until the room spun,leaving him gasping for air.


How could he possibly manage a corporation when his body was failing him?


The harsh truth was that his threats had been nothing but a bluff.


Yet Nolan's stubbornness revealed he truly didn't care.



It was insanity.


Pure, reckless insanity.


Was a woman worth more than the Stewart Group itself?



By then, Nolan had already stepped outside and slid into the Bentley waiting by the curb.


A soft rap landed on the window.


Wray stood there, his posture bent in forced humility.


"Nolan, I look forward to working with you at the company. I just took charge of the Usepsall project,but I'm short-handed. Could you lend me the assistant who's been helping you?"


Erick gripped the steering wheel, his shoulders going rigid as unease prickled down his back. He couldn't believe how clueless the young man outside really was.


The window slid down with deliberate slowness, and  Nolan's eyes locked on Wray, sharp enough to cut."And you think you have the right to ask me that?"



The smile on Wray's face collapsed in an instant.


He stood there seething as the Bentley pulled away,its exhaust cloud swallowing him whole.


With a furious stomp, Wray cursed under his breath.


What gave Nolan the right to act so high and mighty?

If not for Norwood's favoritism, he would be nothing.


"Once I deliver results with the Usepsall project and prove my worth, let's see who truly runs the Stewart Group," he muttered to himself.


Inside the car, Erick glanced nervously at his employer through the mirror, words balancing on the tip of his tongue.


"Boss, are you really fine with your grandfather letting.Wray handle the Usepsall project?"


The project's weight was undeniable. It was too valuable to be trusted to anyone careless. Nolan reclined against the leather seat,drumming his fingers lightly on the armrest as though the matter were trivial.



A sudden laugh broke from him, but it carried no warmth, only coldness.


"Grandpa just needs entertainment. Let him toy around with that fool if it keeps him busy."


Erick caught the message right away. He nodded quickly and chose to keep silent.
###Chapter 193 That Makes Her Your Aunt
Two days later, Eleanor told the staff she was ready to leave the hospital.


The doctor stared at her like she had lost her mind."That's absurd. Your injuries were serious. You won't be fit to walk out of here for at least another month."



Her tone, however, left no room for debate.


Backed into a corner, the doctor tried another approach. "Fine. We'll let the tests decide. I'll run a complete examination. If your body meets the standard, you go. If not, you stay put without argument."



When the results came in, his jaw nearly hit the floor.


He checked once. He checked again.


Could he have misread the data? Injuries that should  have taken weeks, maybe even months, had practically vanished in just a few days.


The situation was unreal.


What he failed to understand was that Eleanor wasn't just any patient. She was the Soul Surgeon, a woman who could pull life back from the edge of the grave.For her, recovery was nothing out of the ordinary.


For him, it was beyond comprehension.


Still rubbing his eyes, he admitted defeat. The results were undeniable.



A promise was a promise, and he had to sign her dischargepapers.



News spread quickly, and Lillian burst into the room as soon as she heard.



While fussing with Eleanor's things, she mumbled,"You nearly scared me to death! If something had happened to you, l'd have hunted down that reckless driver myself." Eleanor let out a quiet laugh, her lips curving at Lillian's fiery outburst.


She opened her mouth to reassure her friend, but the door swung wide before she could speak.


Hilda and Jeff walked in.



The days of recovery had left Eleanor looking slimmer, her delicate features now carrying an almost breakable fragility.


Hilda's eyes softened with instant worry.


Why had she lost more weight?


Surely she hadn't been resting properly.


The heavy stare unsettled Eleanor, stirring an odd mixture of discomfort and yearning.


Maternal tenderness was something she had never truly known, yet a part of her longed for it.


Jeff's voice cut through the silence, steady and grave. "From what we've uncovered, there's a strong chance you're the daughter Hilda's brother lost years  ago. By blood, that makes her your aunt."


He spoke not just to clarify things but to smooth over the tension in the room.



For the first time, he had a reason that made sense of the strange bond between Hilda and Eleanor.


Still, he didn't let the moment linger. "But if you ever bring harm to Lainey again, I won't forgive you."


Turning to his wife, he added curtly, "I'm heading home. Lainey's probably frightened without me there."


Moments later, the room held only three women.


Lillian's fists clenched, her temper flaring. She almost ran after him.



That insufferable old man!



He had seemed reasonable before, but now it was clear-every word about family was nothing more than an excuse to shield Lainey.


Hilda, on the other hand, paid no mind to his harshness. Her resolve did not waver.



She stepped forward, clasped Eleanor's cold hand in her own, and tears streamed freely down her cheeks."Even if he refuses to accept you, I will. In my heart,you are already my child, and no one can take that away."



Eleanor's lips parted, but no words came.


The way Jeff carried himself told her everything-another DNA test had been done in secret, and the results must have confirmed Lainey was his flesh and blood.



Her heart ached with the weight of unspoken longing, and though every instinct told her to retreat,she couldn't bring herself to pull her hand away.


Sensing her struggle, Lillian shifted her gaze toward the window as if she had noticed something outside."Eleanor, Nolan's waiting. We should go."


Reluctance flickered across Hilda's face, but she slowly let Eleanor's hand slip free. Without hesitation, Lillian clasped Eleanor's wrist and guided her toward the door. The Benton family were an unusual group, each one more peculiar than the next. For Eleanor's sake, distance was the wisest choice.


Hilda didn't call after them. She simply stood rooted to the spot, her eyes following Eleanor until she disappeared from sight.


Despite the test results, she felt no doubt in her soul.That girl was hers. She had to be.


But then there was Lainey, the child who had stolen the life that should have belonged to Eleanor.


The few details Hilda had managed to uncover revealed a disturbing truth-Lainey's protectors were tied to Zerovia's criminal underworld.



For Eleanor's safety, she had to hold back for now.


As for Jeff, his stubbornness blinded him. If he refused to believe, then let him stay in denial.

 
One day, the truth would break through, and he would regret every word he spoke today.
###Chapter 194 You Have Our Full Support
The moment Jeff entered the house, he nearly collided with Lainey, who came flying down the staircase in a whirlwind of panic.



Her face was pale, her eyes wild, as though some vital piece of her had been stolen away.



"What on earth happened?" Jeff asked.


That morning, Lainey had woken early only to find the vast villa deserted except for a handful of servants.



Her questions revealed the truth-Jeff and Hilda had left at dawn to visit Eleanor.



A cold wave of dread had gripped her chest.


There was no telling what family bonds might lead to,and that made them all the more dangerous. She couldn't shake the unease that came with how quickly Hilda had grown attached to Eleanor.


If they kept seeing each other, it might stir up feelings best left untouched.


She couldn't take that risk.



What mattered now was locking down the future she had built for herself.


The smartest move would be to marry Nolan without delay.


If she could do that, then even if the truth came out and people discovered she wasn't truly a Benton, it wouldn't matter. She would still have everything she wanted-wealth, status, and a secure place in the world.



With effort, Lainey smothered her fear and curved her lips into a trembling smile that looked more like pain than joy.


She rushed forward, clutching Jeff's arm. "Dad, I was terrified being here alone. When you and Mom disappeared this morning, I felt abandoned all over again. Back living with the Gilbert family, I never belonged, never had a place. Now, I just want to stay by your side."


Her words cracked something inside Jeff's chest.


Lainey had suffered years of hardship, and it had taken everything to finally bring her back.



Of course she felt insecure.



The blame fell squarely on him-he had failed her as a father.



Sensing his softened resolve, Lainey continued,"Since the Todd family collapsed, I've been nothing but a target for gossip. Even though Jonny and I are in the middle of a divorce, people still whisper about me. They even claim-"


Her voice trailed off.


Jeff's brows knitted sharply, his tone heavy. "Claim what?" Lainey pressed her teeth into her lip, and tears slipped freely down her cheeks. "They're saying that no matter what, I'll never measure up to the three Benton boys who grew up in this family. They say/I'II always be the least important, and when the time comes, my share will be the smallest of all."


"Utter rubbish!" Jeff's temper erupted, his palm crashing down on the table with a sharp crack.


His fury blinded him to the glimmer of calculation that flashed in Lainey's eyes, mistaking it for pure hurt.



To him, she wasn't just a daughter-she was the long-lost jewel of the entire Benton family. No one had the right to belittle her worth.


He would prove to the world how much she meant to him.



With a voice thick with determination, Jeff promised,"I'll establish a new branch here at home and place you in charge as president. On top of that, I'll transfer an extra ten percent of shares from headquarters directly to you. Let's see who dares to sneer at my daughter then!"


The heavy front door creaked open at that very moment.


Hilda stepped inside, arriving just in time to catch every word.


Her gaze flickered as she noted the ambition burning behind Lainey's tears.


In only a handful of days back in the family, Lainey was already angling for power and shares. Clever,dangerous, and far too bold.


Eleanor's stubborn, unyielding face flashed through Hilda's mind before her eyes returned to Lainey,whose performance reeked of carefully staged desperation.


Her own determination became firm and unwavering.


With a serene smile, Hilda moved closer. "Baby,that's a wonderful decision. Lainey is bright and capable. She'll surely thrive as president." She reached out, resting her hand warmly over Lainey's. "Don't worry, Lainey. You have our full support."
###Chapter 195 Take The Bag If It Pleases You
Lainey was practically glowing with satisfaction.


In her mind, it already felt like the Benton Group's shares belonged to her.


With the Benton couple completely charmed byher,what could Eleanor possibly do to stop her now?


Buzzing with excitement, she slipped into a chic outfit and headed out for shopping.


The moment she entered a luxury boutique, she didn't bother sparing the price tags a single glance.


"I'll take this one, that one... oh, and that too," she said airily, tilting her chin toward the sales associate who was scurrying after her. "Wrap up those handbags for me. I'm buying them all."


Her bold display quickly drew attention. Shoppers paused mid-step, whispering and stealing glances filled with both envy and awe.


Lainey basked in it, soaking up every bit of admiration.



This was the moment she longed for.


She wanted everyone to see with their own eyes that she wasn't the useless Gilbert girl anymore, no longer someone who had to bow and scrape.


Now, she was part of the Benton family, standing tall and untouchable.


But just as she was reveling in her moment, a crisp voice broke through the chatter.


"Hi, I'm here to pick up the custom bag I ordered earlier."



The crowd parted slightly as Lillian walked in,heading straight toward the counter with her usual confident stride.



There stood Lainey, the center of attention,with eyes  glued to her from every side.



Dressed head-to-toe in luxury, she was trying so hard to flaunt her wealth.



To Lillian, it was gaudy and pathetic.



The sales associate, recognizing Lillian right away,hurried to the counter and pulled out an elegant box from under it. "Ms. Brooks, this is your custom piece.Please check if everything is in order."



Lainey's gaze locked on the box instantly.


The logo gave it away. It belonged to the brand's most exclusive line, the kind of product that couldn't just be bought with money.



She looked at Lillian, her eyes lighting up with an idea. Without thinking twice, she grabbed the box from the salesperson.


"This one's beautiful," she said smoothly, running her fingers over it as though it already belonged to her."Add it to my purchases too." The sales associate was caught off guard and stammered awkwardly, "This item was specially made for Ms. Brooks..."



Lillian's eyes went cold.


She wasn't surprised. Lainey was trouble.


"First come, first served, Lainey. Haven't you heard of that?"



Lainey threw back her head and laughed, as if someone had just told the worId's silliest joke.



"You're kidding, right?" She toyed with the box in her hands, her eyes flicking over Lillian with open disdain. "I want it, so I'll take it. What's the problem?"


It was clear she was just picking on Lillian.


The Brooks family was no longer a threat to her.


Once she cemented her position as the new branch CEO of the Benton Group, wiping out the Brooks family would be child's play.


Lillian stayed calm, completely ignoring Lainey's  smug expression, and let out a quiet chuckle.


She lifted her wrist to glance at her watch,uninterested in wasting her time on someone like Lainey.


"Some people can only show off in boutiques like this," Lillian said lightly. "No matter how loud she shouts, she still won't marry into the Stewart family,will she?"


Her gaze softened with quiet condescension. "Look at my friend Eleanor. She doesn't even have to make an effort, and Nolan's heart is already hers. Go ahead, take the bag if it pleases you."


She waved her hand casually, treating the bag like nothing valuable. "I'm feeling generous today, so think of it as a little gift from me out of pity."


With that, Lillian turned gracefully and walked away,leaving Lainey fuming.


Lainey's face burned red with fury.


How dared this woman humiliate her in public? Lainey clenched her fists, silently swearing that she

would one day make the Brooks family pay.
###Chapter 196 Eleanor Isn't To Die





With Lillian gone, Lainey's fury lingered with nowhere to go.


Her glare shifted to the sales associate, ready to unleash her frustration, when her phone buzzed loudly in her bag.


Horace's name flashed across the screen.


The onlookers still hovered nearby, whispering about the earlier scene.



Lainey hurried toward a deserted emergency exit,slipping out of sight before answering.


"What took you so long? I've got bad news-the Benton bodyguard I paid off has vanished," Horace said.



Her stomach dropped at once.


Horace had promised everything was under control. The bodyguard had been planning to quit anyway,and once the job was done, they would spirit him off to Zerovia under the pretense of a vacation. Now he was gone?


If he returned and confessed to Jeff, everything would collapse.


Her composure shattered, her voice cracked with panic. "You swore this was handled! How could you screw up something so simple? Do you have any idea what's at stake for me?"



A pause lingered on the other end before Horace's low laugh cut through, sharp as a blade.


He had intended to tell her the bodyguard was already dealt with, silenced before he could cause trouble.



But her fear had spilled out so quickly it annoyed him.



"Lainey, since when did you think it wise to raise your voice at me?" The indifference in his words jolted her back to herself.



Her spine went rigid, and a cold sweat trickled down her neck.


No-she couldn't push him too far. He was the only ally she had left, and without him, she was nothing.


Lillian's words replayed in her head like a curse she couldn't shake.



As long as Eleanor existed, Nolan would never truly see her.



And now Jeff and Hilda were visiting Eleanor too.What if repeated meetings stirred suspicions?


Worse still, that treacherous bodyguard remained a loose end, a ticking fuse ready to blow everything apart.


She couldn't delay any longer.



Eleanor had to disappear.


Only her death could erase the looming threats. Forcing her panic deep down, Lainey softened her voice to a tremble. "Horace, forgive me. I shouldn't have raised my voice. I was just... terrified. I didn't mean it."


Her apology flowed quickly into another proposal."Eleanor must be eliminated. If you handle it for me,I'll raise your cut-another one percent on top of what I already promised."


By her calculation, five percent plus the extra two and now another one made eight.


Jeff had only guaranteed her ten.


Surely this offer showed her sincerity.


But Horace's laugh was sharp and merciless, cutting straight through her scheme. "One percent? Lainey,you haven't delivered a single share yet. And you think dangling scraps will fool me again?"


The amusement in his voice vanished, replaced with menace."I want nine percent in total. Try to trick me one more time, and you won't live to regret it." Lainey's fists curled so tightly her nails broke skin,pain searing her palms.


This opportunistic jerk!


The moment she had power in her hands, he would be the first she destroyed.


Not nine percent. Not even one. He would get nothing.


Bitterness churned inside Lainey, but she swallowed it down and forced herself to bend.



"Fine," she hissed, the word dragged out between clenched teeth. "Nine percent. You win."


The line went dead without another word.



Horace tossed his phone aside, lips curling into a grin that held more amusement than anger.


A subordinate edged closer, cautious. "Boss, do you really plan to follow her orders?"


So the woman thought herself untouchable now daring to bark commands just because she had a little backing.


Arrogance came easy when she believed she held leverage.


Horace lifted a crystal glass, watching the scarlet wine spin in slow circles.


"Kill her?" He laughed, the sound low and chilling.A dangerous spark lit his gaze. "No. Eleanor isn't to die."



Alive, she was worth far more than any corpse.


He tipped the glass back, savoring the taste as his voice turned sharp with cruel intent. "Track her down.Deliver Miss Warren to me."



The subordinate gave a quick nod, already knowing better than to question. "Understood, boss."
###Chapter 197 Could You Come Pick Her Up
Eleanor had no clue danger was looming.


Her eyes were fixed on the suitcases scattered across the villa's living room, with confusion written all over her face.


Were those really her things from the apartment?


It looked like everything had been relocated.Had she just moved in without anyone telling her?


She stared in silence, her mind running circles before she finally turned toward the obvious culprit beside her. Her voice was calm, but suspicion colored every word. "Nolan, care to explain what this is supposed to mean?"



Nolan didn't even flinch. His expression stayed composed, and his voice was as even as ever."Lainey is being reckless these days. I don't feel comfortable leaving you to live by yourself."


Eleanor almost laughed to herself.


What a righteous excuse.


If he could only hide the unease flashing in his eyes,she might have almost bought his act.


Still, she couldn't deny the convenience of the situation.



Living here meant easier access to a driver,fewer hassles.



She straightened her expression and told him firmly,"I'll take the third floor for myself. No one's allowed up there without my permission. That includes you,Nolan."



Her privacy was non-negotiable. After all, some secrets couldn't risk being exposed.


That was the bottom line for her.


Nolan studied her for a moment, then simply nodded.
 
He knew when to stop pressing.If she were willing to stay, even under her rules, he would take it.


Once the servants had been instructed to sort everything, evening settled in.


Nolan slipped on his suit jacket, leaned in to kiss her,and said casually, "I've got a meeting at the office.It may run late, so don't wait up."



Eleanor blinked, momentarily thrown off. Why did his tone sound so much like a husband speaking to his wife after years of marriage?


The thought unsettled her, though she didn't let it show. She only gave a faint nod.


Once he left, the quiet pressed in until the maid, Lilah Guerrero, appeared with her usual gentle smile.


"Miss Warren, dinner is ready. Would you like to have it now?"


Eleanor was about to ask Lilah to call Fannie for dinner when her phone suddenly rang.


The number flashing on the screen was unfamiliar. She answered anyway and froze at the sound of Lillian's slurred, drunken voice. "Fraser, you bastard!How could you leave without saying goodbye? I've been looking everywhere for you."



Eleanor frowned. What on earth was going on with Lillian?



Before she could press for answers, another voice came through the line. This one was calm and polite,and clearly he was a bar staff member.


"Hello, do you know this lady personally? Our bar is closing, but she's still here and quite drunk. Could you come pick her up?"


Eleanor immediately straightened in her chair. "Send me the location. I'Il be there right away."


The moment she hung up, she turned to Lilah."Make sure Fannie eats dinner. I need to step out. Please ask the driver to bring the car around."Upstairs, she changed her clothes for something more comfortable,then headed straight out. Half an hour later, the car pulled up in front of a place called Nightfall.


The driver, noticing the dim lights and rowdy crowd outside, looked uneasy. "Miss Warren, should I accompany you inside?"


Eleanor shook her head firmly.


Lillian was drunk, and she was still a young woman.lf she had taken off her clothes or done something embarrassing in the booth, it would only mnake things worse with a man present.


"I'll be quick. Wait here." With that, Eleanor opened the door and strode toward the entrance.



Inside, the bartender immediately pointed her toward the back after she explained why she was there. She moved fast, weaving through the noisy crowd.


But just as she was nearing the private booths,the overhead lights went out with a loud buzz, plunging the bar into darkness.

 
Her heart skipped. A power outage? Of all times? She quickened her pace. Lillian hated the dark, and if she was drunk, she would be even more terrified.


Just as she was thinking about this, a sharp rush of air came from behind.


Her instincts screamed at her to dodge, but she was half a beat too slow.


Suddenly, a blunt force slammed hard into her shoulder.





Pain exploded, and her vision blacked out as she collapsed.





Her last thought was one of pure frustration. She hadn't even gotten the chance to show what she was capable of.
###Chapter 198 She's In Trouble





Even though Nolan had told Eleanor not to wait up,he ended up finishing his work faster than expected and returned to the villa.



But when he walked inside, she wasn't there.


The dinner table was still set. No one had touched the food.



Nolan loosened his tie, his movements slowing as a faint crease appeared between his brows.


Just then, Lilah appeared from the kitchen and greeted him respectfully. "Welcome home, Mr.Stewart."



"Where's Eleanor?" Nolan asked, dropping his tie on the sofa before taking his seat at the head of the table.



"She mentioned she was going to pick up Ms. Brooks and would be back later for dinner."



Lillian, of course.


Somehow, that girl always managed to wedge herself between him and Eleanor.



Maybe it was time her family found her a husband so she wouldn't be hanging around anymore.



He sat and waited, but the ticking clock only made his calm unravel.


Ten o'clock passed.



Then eleven.



The food on the table was stone cold by now.


The longer the silence stretched, the heavier the unease pressed against him.


He finally picked up his phone and dialed her, but all he got was a mechanical voice saying, "The number you have dialed is not available."



His jaw tightened as he tried again, only to hear the same response.



A chilling sense of dread gripped him.



At that moment, a servant's voice came from the doorway. "Mr. Stewart, Ms. Brooks has arrived."


Moments later, Lillian stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.


Her cheeks were flushed, and her words slurred."Eleanor, you traitor! Putting love before friendship!You said you'd pick me up! Where are you hiding?Come out!"



She paused mid-complaint and looked up, meeting Nolan's cold, sharp eyes.


The air went still.



One look from him sobered her up in an instant.


Then the very next moment, both of them asked at the same time, "Where is she?" "Where is she?"



Lillian froze, blinking as if her brain had short-circuited. A few seconds later, an icy chill started crawling through her chest. "Wait, what? Eleanor should've been here already. The bar called her with my phone,and she promised to get me. I even waited around until I was sober, but she never came."


Nolan's eyes turned sharply dangerous.


Lilah said Eleanor had gone out, but Lillian said she never saw her.


A sick certainty clenched in his gut. Something had happened to Eleanor.


He shot to his feet, the chair scraping harshly against the floor, and strode out.


The sudden intensity rolling off Nolan rattled Lillian.Without even thinking, she rushed after him. "Nolan,what's happening? Is Eleanor-"


Nolan yanked open the car door, phone already pressed to his ear as he dialed Erick.


"Call the authorities. Trace the Maybach Eleanor drove tonight. I want the last location in five minutes." His voice left no room for argument, and he ended the call without hesitation.


Lillian hurried to the car, gripping the doorframe."Did she vanish on the way? Or-"


"She's in trouble." His tone was calm, yet the certainty in it hit Lillian like a blow, leaving her shaken.


Before she could ask anything else, his phone buzzed again, and Erick's voice came through,urgent.


"Mr. Stewart, we traced the car. It was abandoned on a side street close to Nightfall and hasn't been touched since."



Nolan didn't waste a second. He slammed his foot on the gas, and the black Bentley shot forward into the dark.
###Chapter 199 Where's Nolan





Outside Nightfall, the place glowed unnaturally bright, though it should have long been closed.


The manager, flanked by a few security/ guards,was wiping sweat from his forehead. When the black Bentley tore up to the entrance, his jaw dropped as if a phantom had appeared.


The door swung open, and Nolan stepped out, every inch the picture of authority and menace.


Any attempt at a charming smile vanished instantly;the manager dropped into a deep bow, trying to make himself small. "Mr. Stewart, what brings you here in person? You could've just called... there's no need for-"



"Surveillance," Nolan interrupted sharply.


The single word froze the manager in place. He nodded so quickly it was almost desperate. "Yes,sir! Right this way to the control room!"


They hurried inside, moving swiftly through the bar.


In the control room, a technician fumbled nervously at the controls, and soon, footage appeared on the screens.



At 7:27 p.m., a black Maybach pulled up to the entrance.



Eleanor stepped out and walked alone toward the bar door.



She asked the bartender for directions, then made her way to a private room.



And then, nothing.


A low electrical hum crackled through the speakers,and every screen went pitch black.


Lillian's stomach dropped. "What the hell happened?"


The technician wiped his forehead, his voice trembling as he explained, "Around 7:30, the bar lost power completely. The main circuit tripped. It was an accident. Emergency crews were called immediately,but it took half an hour to get full power back. So,fromn 7:30 to 8:00, the cameras captured nothing."



Nolan's eyes burned into the blank screen, and the tension in the room sank to an almost suffocating level.



His fists clenched so tight that his knuckles went white. Damn, that was one hell of a setup.


A low, chilling laugh escaped him, sending a shiver through the room.


It was clear that someone had been targeting Eleanor all along, carefully setting this up.


All through the night, Nolan searched Elepdon relentlessly, leaving no place unchecked.


Yet Eleanor had disappeared completely, as if she had simply vanished into the air. There was no sign of her anywhere. Back at the Brooks family's villa, the tension was just as heavy. Erick stood in the middle of the living room,looking exhausted.


The news he delivered hit Lillian hard, even though she had just sobered up. It felt like the floor had vanished beneath her feet, and she wobbled,barely able to stay upright.


"I'm the one to blame," she murmured. "If I hadn't gotten drunk, if I hadn't asked her to come get me,none of this would have happened. If something happens to her... I'll never forgive myself."


Ryland had just come rushing in from the company.Seeing Lillian in such despair made his chest tighten.



Without hesitation, he moved forward and steadied her trembling body.


He wanted to say something to comfort her, bout words.failed him.



Instead, he turned to Erick and asked in a low voice,"Where's Nolan?" Erick's face darkened even further. "He... he is on his way to his grandfather's."


Ryland froze.


Nolan was visiting grandfather's place? Now? At a moment like this?


It didn't take him long to piece it together.


For Eleanor to vanish so completely while under Nolan's watch, leaving absolutely no trace, there was probably only one person in Elepdon who could pull that off-Norwood.



Damn it.



Nolan headed for his grandfather's place. This wasn't good.


Whether Norwood was involved or not, Nolan couldn't confront him directly.


Ryland let go of Lillian gently, grabbed his coat from the sofa, and bolted for the door.


"Keep an eye on her. I'll be back soon," he called to Erick without looking back.


Erick hesitated for a fraction of a second, his worry for Nolan clashing with his concern for Lillian. But seeing her so shattered, he nodded firmly. "I will."
###Chapter 200 Get Your People And Leave Now!
Norwood was comfortably seated in the Stewart family's residence's living room, chatting animatedly with Jeff.



Thanks to Lainey's nonstop scheming, the conversation had once again shifted to Nolan's marriage.


Jeff, driven by a fierce desire to secure the perfect match for his daughter, slid a multi-billion-dollar contract across the table for Norwood to see.



Norwood's face lit up. He even leaned forward to pour Jeff a cup of coffee himself. "If our families were united by marriage, it would be a legendary alliance," he said, beaming.


The contract meant the Stewarts could finally break into the Breoqua market. Not only would they cement their status as the richest family in the country, but they could also set their sights on becoming a global powerhouse.


And Lainey? Well, aside from her occasional arrogance and sharp edge, she was hardly a concern.


Once Nolan married her, and she would fit neatly into the plan.


Jeff, though trying to maintain composure, couldn't hide his pride.


He raised his cup and said with a sincere smile,"You're right, Mr. Stewart. She would be lucky to have your grandson as her husband."


As she heard that, Lainey pretended to be shy and lowered her eyes, though the smile spreading across her face betrayed her.


This was it. She was about to be Nolan's wife!


Eleanor, that annoying woman, was probably somewhere suffering right now. Suddenly, the front doors swung open, and Nolan stepped in, radiating a chilling intensity.


Lainey's heart skipped a beat. She quickly straightened, plastering on what she thought was her most charming smile.


"Nolan, you-" she started, but the words died in her throat.



A dozen bodyguards moved in perfect unison behind him, filling the living room and blocking all possible exits.



Lainey froze, her smile locked and lifeless.


Norwood slammed his coffee cup onto the table, the sound cutting through the tension like a whip.



"How dare you,Nolan!"


Jeff's face tightened with concern. "Nolan,what is al this?"



Nolan's eyes swept the room like ice, taking in Lainey, Jeff, and Norwood in a single glance. They were all conveniently together, sparing him the hassle of going to each one separately.



He pressed his lips together and subtly signaled the bodyguards, who immediately understood, and without a word, half of them fanned out to conduct a thorough search of the estate.



The entire place quickly turned into a coordinated operation, like a full-blown raid.



Norwood's finger shook as he jabbed toward Nolan.



Jeff wore a dark, grim expression, sensing the gravity of the situation.



Within minutes, the bodyguards came back and bowed to Nolan. "Mr. Stewart, we can't find Miss Warren," one reported.



Norwood finally realized what had happened.


The girl had vanished, and his own grandson was convinced he had taken her, storming in ready to exact revenge! The truth hit him like a hammer to the chest, stealing his breath.



"You bastard! Get your people and leave now!"Norwood barked.



But Nolan remained unmoved, his gaze sharp and unyielding. Instead of replying, he fired back,"Where is she?"



It wasn't a question but a command, loaded with authority and danger.


Norwood struggled to contain his anger.


Despite his disdain for Eleanor, considering her beneath the Stewart name, he would never stoop so low as to kidnap her.


Such an act would tarnish the family's honor, and that was something he could never allow.



When.he noticed that Norwood's face showed no trace of lies, Nolan's gaze shifted to Jeff.


The intensity in his eyes was enough to send a shiver  down Jeff's spine.


"My men are on their way to your residence," Nolan said calmly, as if he were discussing the weather."Let me make this clear. If this has anything to do with the Benton family-"


His voice dropped, and his eyes flashed toward Lainey, whose face had turned ghostly pale. "I will make sure you pay for it. Endlessly."


Lainey's blood ran cold.


She hadn't anticipated that Nolan would go to such extremes for Eleanor.


The deadly intent in his eyes was terrifyingly real.


He would not hesitate to act.


Seeing how scared his daughter appeared, Jeff was ready to explode with anger, but a strange worry about Eleanor's disappearance gnawed at him.


Just as the tension reached its peak, a panicked voice called out as someone hurried in. "Nolan! Take it easy!"
###Chapter 201 You Shouldn't Be Upset With Him
Ryland burst into the room, and the scene before him immediately sent a shiver down his spine.



He hurried over to Nolan, lowering his voice to a tense whisper.



"On my way here, Erick sent a message. A private jet left for Zerovia last night, and someone at the airport reported seeing a woman who looked exactly like Eleanor on board."



For the first time in a while, Nolan's icy intensity softened just slightly at the news.


His sharp eyes swept over the three people in the room, noting their mixed reactions. He turned to the bodyguards, his tone was sharp. "Nobody goes anywhere. Not a single person leaves without my say."



It was basically a house arrest with luxury.


Among those trapped inside were the former leader of the Stewart family and one of Breoqua's most influential elites.



The absurdity of it all wasn't lost on Ryland. He opened his mouth to protest, but Nolan had already pivoted and was storming toward the exit.


Ryland swallowed and fell in step behind him.


"To the airport. And broadcast this globally-anyone who locates Eleanor and keeps her safe gets a hundred million reward," Nolan instructed.



The bodyguards nodded and practically sprinted to carry out the orders.


Norwood stayed frozen, clutching his chest as if Nolan's very presence had knocked the wind out of him.



The butler's face went pale. He darted forwad to steady Norwood, barking at the other staff. "Hurry!Call the doctor now!"



Norwood sat back down, his eyes burning with disappointment.



What had he done to deserve this?



His once-proud grandson had confronted him over a woman of unknown background more than once.



It was outrageous!


And it was all his own fault. He shouldn't have handed too much power to Nolan just because of Colson's  incompetence,.


And now, with Nolan in command, the boy had the nerve to defy him.



He drew in a shaky breath and casta quick,apologetic glance at Jeff. "Sorry you had to witness this mess."


Jeff waved him off calmly. "Don't worry about it,Mr.Stewart. Right now, we need to focus on finding Eleanor."



Lainey, standing nearby, watched the scene unfold,her shock evident.



Nolan had treated him like that, yet Jeff stayed calm,almost unnervingly so.



Was he worried about that insufferable Eleanor?



The thought made a flicker of jealousy flare in Lainey's eyes, but she quickly straightened up and spoke in a composed, concerned tone. "I think everyone's overreacting a little. I heard Miss Warren has been seeing several men on the side, so maybe she ran off with one of them?"



Turning to Norwood, she added smoothly, "Norwood,Nolan's obsessed with her. That's why he's acting so rashly. You shouldn't be upset with him." Lainey's words were smooth, almost sweet, but they  were carefully calculated-throwing shade at Eleanor while giving Nolan an excuse for acting like a maniac.



Norwood's face relaxed as he listened, a hint of respect appearing in his eyes. He regarded Lainey with genuine approval.


The gossip about her was clearly baseless. Her grace,her calm confidence, and her eloquence all made her look leagues above that scheming Eleanor.



Jeff,however,barely registered Lainey's performance.His mind was on Hilda back at home.



Nolan had already deployed people to their home...was she alright?



With Norwood temporarily settled, the conversation shifted back to less volatile topics.



Lainey saw her opening and slipped away into a quiet corner.



She pulled out her phone, dialing fast, and whispered as soon as someone picked up. "How's it going? Has that... problem been taken care of yet?"



Horace's voice on the other end was slow and teasing,as if he had all the time in the world. "What's the hurry?When do I get my shares?"



Lainey's eyebrows shot up. That greedy moron! Despite her anger, she kept her cool. "You'll get everything promised as soon as it's handled."



Horace snorted skeptically. "I want half the shares now,or don't expect it to be done right."



Lainey's hands tightened around the phone. She could almost crush it in frustration, but she needed him for the moment.



Gritting her teeth, she replied, "Fine. Half now, but the shares aren't in my hands yet. I'lL give you $100 million as a deposit first."



Horace was silent for a moment before hanging up.



Lainey stared at her phone, annoyed to the max.



Damn it!



She hadn't even gotten the chance to check on Eleanor's status, and he hung up like it was nothing.



That bastard!



Still, she wasn't sweating it.


Horace was hooked now.



He wouldn't bail. He had no choice but to follow through.
###Chapter 202 I'll Give You The Good Life
Deep underground in Zerovia, hidden away from prying eyes, the Fist Guild's base throbbed with life.


Neon lights blinked in every shade imaginable, painting the walls in wild,shifting colors.



Music blasted so loud it rattled bones, while groups of hulking men crowded around tables, drinking and laughing. The whole place was chaos, but the kind that felt alive.



Horace's phone buzzed with a message.He checked it and saw the transfer of one hundred million from Lainey. Lounging with his drink, he casually tossed his phone onto a table already buried in bottles and cards.


One of his lackeys crept closer, grinning. "Boss,why bother keeping that chick alive? Let's just take her out and be done with it."



The words were barely out before Horace's hand cracked across his face. "Idiot. Didn't I tell you? That woman's worth her weight in gold."



Sure, Lainey was a snake and probably hiding more tricks up her sleeve than she let on, but she had  spoken one truth-Eleanor wasn't just some random girl. She was Nolan's woman, and that made her priceless.



With her,he could bleed Nolan dry. And if that wasn't enough, Eleanor was also the Benton family's true daughter.


If he played his cards right, exposing that secret to the Bentons could rake in a jackpot.



The lackey rubbed his stinging cheek and bowed his head,stammering apologies.


Horace waved him off, clearly bored. "Is she up yet?"


The man nodded quickly. "Yeah, boss. She came to her senses a while back. As soon as she woke, she knocked down several of our men without breaking a sweat. We only managed to restrain he after drugging her."



That caught Horace's attention. His lips curled into a sly grin. "A fighter, huh? Interesting."


Curiosity got the better of him, and he pushed himself up, making his way toward the room where Eleanor was locked.


 
Inside, Eleanor lifted her gaze, weak but sharp,her brows drawn tight. So this guy was Horace Boyd, the leader of the Fist Guild in Zerovia.



She had been right all along.


Lainey's dirty fingerprints were all over this.



As she studied Horace, he studied her right back.


The second his eyes landed on her, he froze.


Something about her face was familiar.


She reminded him of the woman who had beaten the hell out of him years ago before disappearing like smoke.



No. That was impossible. It couldn't be her.



Shaking off the thought, Horace narrowed his eyes and focused on the woman sitting before him.



Damn, she was stunning. Way easier on the eyes than that snake Lainey.



Everything about her carried that effortless poise women from her homeland were famous for.



The way she held herself, the curves she couldn't hide..it was no mystery why Nolan had guarded her like a priceless gem. Getting her here hadn't been easy; his men had to pull off some serious work to snatch her up without Nolan breathing down their necks.



The longer he stared, the more something twisted inside him. Desire mixed with greed. He crouched down so he was eye-level with her, his voice dripping with temptation. "Pretty girl, how about a deal? Stick with me, and I'll let you live. I'll give you the good life.Money,power,whatever you want."



Eleanor, on the other hand, was busy weighing her options. She had needles hidden on her, and for a second, the thought of taking Horace out flashed through her mind.


But logic kicked in quickly. What good would killing him do? The place was crawling with guards, and this was Zerovia, his domain.



Even if she got rid of him, she would never make it out alive.



Rescue might take forever, and thinking she could escape on her own was nothing but a fantasy.


The safest option was to play along, at least for now.



She exhaled slowly, forcing her tension into a smile that lit up her face. "Alright," she said sweetly. "But where I come from, we don't do things halfway. If we're going to be together, there has to be a proper ceremony. Everyone needs to know."



Horace's eyes lit up like a kid in a candy shop. He let out a booming laugh. "Ha! I've heard all about your country's obsession with rituals. Fine then, sweetheart.You'll have your ceremony."



The underling standing off to the side felt his stomach drop.



A ceremony? Making it public?



Did the boss lose his damn mind?



If his formidable wife ever got wind of this, he would be in for another storm.



Everyone knew Horace both feared and respected that woman, yet his lecherous ways never changed.



Still, none of them dared speak up.



They just hoped Horace's lust didn't drag the rest of them into hell with him.
###Chapter 203 You Should Start Preparing For The...
Horace didn't give a damn about anything else.



Pleasure came first.


He scooped Eleanor up effortlessly, carrying her straight to his private lounge.



Eleanor clenched her teeth, forcing herself to stay calm,all while subtly taking note of the room's layout and where people were positioned.



He laid her on the bed and leaned toward her eagerly.



Eleanor swallowed her disgust and instead let a teasing,seductive smile slip onto her face.



She lifted a finger, stopping him just short.



"Horace, don't be in such a hurry," she said,her tone playful yet pointed. "There's always a ceremony first,a symbol of commitment before taking things to the next level. Since I've chosen to be yours, it only makes sense that I expect a lifelong partnership."



She shot him a teasing look. "And... see me like this?Messy, dusty... doesn't this ruin the fun for you?" Horace froze for a moment, caught in her gaze, his desire spiking.



But the thought of a lifelong partnership had him grinning like a fool.


He quickly got up from the bed and pulled his clothes back on. "You're something else, always keeping me guessing."



As soon as he left, Eleanor's smile vanished.



She rolled off the bed and went straight to the window,but it was boarded tight from the outside. There was no way to open it.


She tried the door and tugged and twisted the handle,but it was locked too.



She had no choice but to pause and rethink her escape.



Her eyes wandered around the room until they landed on a wall full of photos, with women in revealing poses,dressed to seduce.



Horace's past flings, clearly.


She scanned each unfamiliar face until she stopped cold.



Among them was Lainey. One photo showed her cuddled up close to Horace,smiling like nothing was wrong.



But the next picture? It was pure nightmare material.



Lainey holding a machete, standing over a freshly severed head.



No wonder she had kept her history abroad so secret.



Bloodthirsty deeds like that explained everything.


But this wasn't the time to dwell on Lainey's past.


Right now, she had to focus on escaping.


Nolan was likely panicking by this point, searching frantically for her.



But hoping for distant help wouldn't save her in this moment.



She needed a plan, and fast.


If that so-called ceremony went ahead, the consequences would be catastrophic.



Suddenly, chaos erupted outside the room.



"Boss! Bad news! Bad news!"



"What is it?" someone shouted. "Your wife... something's wrong with her! She's seriously ill!"



Horace's roar followed immediately. "Get Dr. Watson here immediately! He's the best doctor in Zerovia! If anything happens to my wife, I'll make sure you pay!"







Eleanor arched an eyebrow.



Who would have thought that Horace, the lust-driven maniac, would care this much about his wife?



Perfect.



She finally got a chance to get out of this.



She knocked lightly on the door, catching the attention of the guards outside.


When they came closer, she whispered something to them.



Meanwhile, Horace stormed back to the villa, pacing like a caged tiger beside his wife, who was lying unconscious on the bed.



The doctor with him looked terrified. "Boss, I can't help her. The illness is too severe, and Dr. Watson is out of town. Mrs. Boyd... she might not survive," he stammered, sinking to his knees. "You should start reparing for the funeral."
###Chapter 204 You Had Me Terrified!
Horace's eyes were bloodshot, burning with fury as he grabbed the doctor by the collar, looking like he might crush him on the spot. "What did you just say?"


The doctor froze, words choking in his throat, every breath trembling. Fear had him paralyzed.



Horace's temper snapped further, and he kicked the nearby medical kit across the room with a deafening crash.



Then, pointing at the group of trembling lackeys at the door, he barked, "Go! Find a doctor! If my wife dies today, you'll all wish you hadn't been born!"


The men bolted, scrambling out in a panic, leaving the room heavy with Horace's ragged breathing and the sharp tension in his gaze as he stared at his wife on the bed.



He didn't love her, but he respected her.


Without her, he could never have climbed to the top of the Fist Guild.


The thought of handling it all alone now was  unbearable.



Just then, one of his men tentatively poked his head inside. After a shaky breath, he spoke. "Boss, the woman from your private lounge... she says she can save Mrs. Boyd."



Eleanor?



Horace froze.



Trust a fragile-looking girl with his wife's life?


It sounded absurd.



But as he watched his wife's breaths grow shallow,desperation won over disbelief. He gritted his teeth and growled, "Bring her in."



Whether it was a trick or not, he had no choice but to gamble on a miracle.



Within moments, Eleanor was ushered into the room.



She took one look at the dying woman and instantly understood-this was Horace's wife.



Horace's gaze didn't waver from Eleanor, filled not with desire but with raw,tense intensity."Can you really do it?" he demanded.



Eleanor said nothing and strode directly to the bedside.  She then raised her eyes to meet his, unwavering."Step aside," she said firmly. "If you're in the way, I can't do anything."



Horace froze for a second, then reluctantly stepped back,muttering under his breath but obeying.



Eleanor lifted three fingers and pressed them lightly on the woman's wrist. Her eyes closed as she focused,reading the pulse with practiced precision.


After a moment, she opened them again, her expression filled with cetainty. "She doesn't have an infectious disease. Her lungs have a blood clot blocking airflow, which is why she's struggling to breathe. The fever is just a complication from the lung issue."



Her eyes scanned the medical kit on the floor and landed on a sealed pack of needles.



She tore it open and grabbed one.



With quick, exact movements, she drove the needle into the woman's body.



Immediately, the unconscious woman on the bed twitched violently, and a mouthful of dark red blood spilled from her lips.


Horace's eyes flared with rage. "What did you do to her?" He yanked the dagger from his waist and lunged forward.



But everything froze the instant his wife's eyes opened.


"You reckless idiot, chasing after women again?" she chided, her voice weak but unmistakable.



Horace halted in shock, staring at his wife.


Though she was still fragile, her face showed signs of life returning, and tears welled in his eyes.


"You're awake, finally! I thought I'd lost you! You had me terrified!" he cried.



Eleanor blinked, utterly dumbfounded.



The ruthless Zerovian mob boss she had known, the man feared by everyone, was now reduced to a fumbling,tearful husband.


Even his men bowed their heads, not daring to make a sound.



Eleanor's mind raced. If this woman really held that kind of power over him, it would be easy to get out of there.
###Chapter 205 I'd Like To Go For A Walk
Darlene Boyd, Horace's wife, wasn't the type to be swayed by tears or drama.



Horace could cry all he wanted, but her sharp, no-nonsense gaze cut right through him. Finally, her eyes landed on Eleanor. "What's going on?"she demanded.



Horace's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.



What could he say? That Lainey had set this whole thing up? Darlene would skin him alive.



If he claimed he had been planning to keep Eleanor as a mistress, Darlene might just erase her on the spot.



Either way, the fallout would be brutal.



He had no good excuse.



Seeing him flounder, Eleanor smoothly stepped in."Mrs. Boyd, it's a pleasure to meet you," she said politely. "I'm a doctor. Horace asked me here to treat you."



Horace latched onto her words like a lifeline, nodding so fast that it looked ridiculous. "Yes, yes! Exactly!She's a doctor. I brought her here for you, my love.Are you feeling better? Any pain?"



Darlene shot him a cutting glance that shut him up instantly, then turned her attention back to Eleanor.After a long, weighing silence, she finally spoke."Thank you."



Even while she had been unconscious, she had known she was close to death.



This young woman, whoever she was, had saved her life.



And she was not the type to repay a debt with hostility.



Eleanor inclined her head slightly, keeping her tone calm and respectful. "I'm glad I could help. My name is Eleanor Warren. If you ever need me again,just say the word."



She said it with purpose. If Darlene remembered her name, Horace wouldn't dare pull anything reckless against her.



The way the two women were talking made Horace nervous. He quickly cut in, eager to separate them before more damage was done. "Baby, you've just woken up. You need to rest. Dr. Warren still has surgery to attend,so I'll see her out." Darlene, still feeling grateful, didn't argue.


Once Eleanor and Horace were outside,he finally stopped walking.


His whole demeanor had shifted. The hungry,lecherous gleam was gone,replaced with something closer to respect.



Looking at her seriously, he said, "From now on, I'll be counting on you to take care of my wife's health."



That was his way of extending an olive branch.



Eleanor raised an eyebrow at him, her lips curving faintly. "Fine," she replied. "But l've got one condition."



Horace thought she was about to make some outrageous request,but all she said was, "I'd like to go for a walk."



Being stuck inside left her no chance to learn anything or look for a way out.



Horace studied her carefully, his eyes dark with suspicion.



If he agreed, what if she bolted?


On the other hand, if he said no, she could easily complain to his wife and let slip a few ugly truths.Darlene finding out? That was a nightmare he couldn't  afford.



After a long pause, he gave in. "Fine. But you stay close, and I'm sending someone with you."



Eleanor didn't argue. She had gotten what she wanted.Without another word, she turned and strolled toward the courtyard.



Horace's eyes followed her, darker than before.


Just then, a lackey slipped out from the shadows and whispered, "Boss,shnould we still get rid of her?"



But before the man could even blink, Horace whirled around and sent him crashing to the ground with a brutal kick. "Scram!"



The grunt coughed, limping away, and Horace spat after him, seething.



That damned Lainey.



She was the one who had wanted Eleanor dead.What a short-sighted fool.


Didn't she see the value standing right in front of them?



Eleanor wasn't just any woman-her medical skills were a treasure.



With her on their side, the organization could grow  even stronger.



The more Horace thought about it, the more the idea consumed him. His lips curled into a grin.



"You there!" he barked after the lackey not far away.


The man hurried back at once, bowing eagerly. "Boss,what do you need?"



"Set everything up. I'm going to make her mine,"Horace declared, stroking his chin, with eyes full of greed. "But don't let my wife get wind of it before it's done."



The lackey's jaw dropped, but he quickly plastered on a smile and nodded. "I'm on it."



He took several steps but then stopped mid-step and turned back with a strange glint in his eyes. "Boss,when I saw the way she used those needles earlier,it reminded me of someone."



Horace narrowed his gaze."Who?"



The man swallowed hard before whispering,"The Soul Surgeon."



Even saying the name sent a chill down his spine."They say the Soul Surgeon's skills with needles are godlike and able to drag the dying back from death itself,Pure miracles." Horace's eyes flickered with excitement.



He had heard the rumors too, though only as whispers in the underworld.



If Eleanor really was that legendary figure..



If she could save the dying, then surely she could fix other problems too. Problems he didn't dare speak aloud. Maybe she could help him get the child he desperately wanted.



The greed in his chest swelled, and he crooked his finger for the underling to come closer.
###Chapter 206 She's The One | Came For
Horace was picturing himself having thechild when a private jet cut through the stormy skies and landed on Zerovia's runway.



The door swung open, and out stepped Nolan in a black trench coat, the kind of man whose presence could silence a crowd.



His sharp gaze swept across the wet, familiar land."Zerovia," he muttered under his breath.



This place wasn't foreign to him.



He didn't come here often, but he knew the lay of the land all too well.



A place full of coruption, backstabbing, and shadows.



And if the intel was right, only one organization here would dare touch his girl-the Fist Guild. They had been running wild in Zerovia for years, fattening themselves off the chaos.



Nolan's eyes darkened as he turned toward Erick, who was shielding him from the rain with an umbrella. His tone left no room for argument. "Get word to the right people. I expect full cooperation. If anyone dares get in the way, we will withdraw from Zerovia altogether."



That wasn't an empty threat. Zerovia had been through hell, political mess and economic collapse,and Stewart money was the only thing keeping parts of it afloat.



Nolan knew the weight he carried, and so did everyone else.



Without waiting for a response, he walked out of the airport in long, decisive strides, heading directly for the man in military uniform who stood waiting.



It was none other than Kaiden Alvarado, commander of Zerovia.



The soldiers behind him snapped into salutes the moment Nolan appeared.



"Mr. Stewart," Kaiden greeted him firmly before launching into his report. "As soon as I got word,1sent people into the Fist Guild. We've got men on the inside now. And according to inside intel, Horace is preparing to take in a mistress, someone with medical skills."



Nolan froze for half a second. Horace?



That lowlife dared to set his sights on Eleanor?



Unforgivable.



His jaw tightened, rage burning through his calm mask."She's the one I came for. Don't move until I say so Just make sure my message gets to her through the informants."



"Yes, sir!" Kaiden snapped a salute again.



Soon after, Nolan was being escorted through the streets in a convoy of military vehicles, all the way to the most exclusive hotel in the country.



The presidential suite was lavish, yet it felt hollow.



Nolan stood at the giant window, staring into the night rain.



His thoughts were all on Eleanor.



Was she safe? Was she hurt?



The thought of her enduring pain or humiliation clawed at his chest until he could barely breathe.



This was on him.



His negligence had led to her capture. All he could do now was pray she had the strength to hold on until he reached her.



Meanwhile,Eleanor found herself reluctantly working needles into Horace's body.


The irony wasn't lost on her. She never thought she would end up treating someone just to fix their bedroom problems.


If word ever got out, David would probably disown her.



Horace, however, was lying there as if he had struck gold,his face practically glowing.


"You're sure you can fix me?" he asked eagerly.



Eleanor curved her lips into something that resembled a smile, though it held no warmth. "Of course."



That single phrase was enough.



Horace's chest puffed with pride, his imagination racing ahead. A future where his wife could no longer mock him,where his so-called manhood was restored -he could almost taste the victory.



But before his fantasy could swell any further,his phone buzzed against the bedside table.


The caller ID lit up with a name that made his  expression sour instantly. Lainey.


He snapped up the phone, his joy evaporating,replaced by irritation. He waved at Eleanor like one would shoo away a servant. "Go. You can leave now."


Eleanor didn't need to be told twice.



She smoothly gathered her needles and headed out,but not before catching a glimpse of the screen.


It was Lainey calling.


Eleanor let out a quiet sneer.



Lainey calling at this hour most likely meant she wanted to confirm her death.



Oh, she would love to know how Horace explained this.



Watching those two snakes turn on each other promised to be entertaining.



With a faint smirk,Eleanor started exploring the place.



Her sense of direction was poor, and she couldn't afford to get lost in a critical moment.


But just as she rounded a corner, someone barreled straight into her.



Eleanor sighed. Did no one in this place know how to walk without colliding into others?



Steadying herself, she was about to move on when she felt something in her pocket.



She reached in and pulled out a crumpled note.



Could it be from an ally?



She quickly slipped into a restroom, shut the door,and unfolded it.



The note had only a few words, written with deep,bold strokes.



"Wait for me. Be careful."



Her breath caught. That handwriting... she would recognize it anywhere. Nolan's.



He was here. He had come for her.



A surge of relief spread through her chest, dissolving the weight that had been pressing against her ribcage since her capture.



Perfect.



With backup around, she could start planning her move. Lainey thought she had played a clever game,but now the tables were turning.



Eleanor intended to return the favor, and when she did,it would be a strike Lainey would never forget.
###Chapter 207 Show Me Proof
Once Eleanor set her mind to it, she wasted no time.She spotted a thug loitering in the hall, offered a casual smile, and asked to borrow his phone, saying she only wanted something to do out of boredom.



Since she was clearly someone Horace valued,the man hesitated but still handed it over.



Before passing it to her, though, he pulled out the SIM card like a paranoid old man. "Wi-Fi's on. You can use the apps and games," he muttered.


Eleanor didn't protest. She simply took the phone and walked away.


Later,when the coast was clear, she slipped back into the room Horace had once dragged her into.


Wasting no time, she snapped photos of everything related to Lainey and sent them to her own email.



After finishing, she returned to her quarters and tried to rest.



She was piecing together her next move when a soft knock interrupted her thoughts, and a few servants  stepped inside.



The first carried a folded set of elaborate ceremonial clothes, and the others trailed behind with trays of dinner fit for royalty.



"Ma'am," the one in front said nervously, "this ceremonial attire is prepared by Mr. Boyd for tomorrow's ceremony."


Eleanor's gaze drifted over the group until it landed on a man standing half-hidden at the back, almost blending with the shadows near the doorway.


Recognition clicked instantly. It was him, the one she had bumped into earlier in the corridor.



Sensing her attention, he looked up briefly.



Their eyes met for a second before he quickly lowered his head again.


Eleanor caught on right away.


She leaned back lazily in her chair, completely ignoring the fancy meal set in front of her.


"I don't eat this crap. I want traditional food from my country. Tell your chef to figure it out."



The lead servant stiffened. At this hour, where would they find someone who could cook foreign food?



But none of them dared to argue.


They had been warned beforehand that this young lady was precious to Horace, and even Darlene thought highly of her. Offending her would be as good as signing their own death warrants.


Helpless, the lead servant managed a polite smile."Of course, ma'am. We'll make the arrangements right away."



They bowed, gathered up the untouched food, and quickly left.


Eleanor waved off the rest of the attendants until only one man remained, the one standing by the door.She tilted her chin slightly toward him, her tone carrying an air of command.



"You! Yes, the one standing there doing nothing.Come here and massage my legs."


The man closed the door quietly and walked toward her with an easy, honest smile.



"Alright, I'll do it," he responded with a chuckle.



But as he approached, Eleanor's relaxed expression  hardened.



"Who are you really?" she asked sharply. "Show me proof."



The note had looked like Nolan's handwriting, but she couldn't rule out the possibility of a trap.



The man's smile disappeared. Silently, he reached inside his jacket, pulled out a small object, and placed it in her hand.



It was an emblem, its center carved with a single word -Stewart.



The crest of the Stewart family.



Eleanor's tension finally eased.



She had seen Nolan with one before and knew it was real.



After a moment, she returned it to him.


The man bowed his head respectfully. "Miss. Warren,you need not worry. I represent the Stewart Group here in Zerovia, and everyone knows me as McCollum.Mr. Stewart sent me to tell you that we'll take action during tomorrow night's ceremony. Be prepared."


Eleanor gave a slight nod. At that very moment, loud banging rattled the door,and a drunken man's voice slurred from outside,"Open up, little beauty. Let me keep you company tonight."
###Chapter 208 Ceremony, My Ass!
Eleanor and McCollum froze at the same time.



The voice outside the door was Horace's.



Without hesitation, McCollum pulled the dagger from his waist and positioned himself in front of Eleanor.



His eyes had that wild, fight-to-the-end spark.


But Eleanor caught his wrist before he could act."Don't even think about it. That'd be like running straight into a bonfire," she warned.


This was the Fist Guild's base. God only knew how many men were stationed outside. Charging out blindly meant certain death for both of them.



She scanned the room, quick but sharp, and her gaze landed on the wardrobe. "Hide in there. Now."



Sure, people had seen her ask McCollum to stick around, but if Horace found him in here alone with her,it would raise questions and mess up the whole plan.One slip, and their message would never get out.


McCollum's jaw was tight, every muscle screaming  resistance, but he knew she was right. "Watch yourself," he muttered before squeezing into the wardrobe.



Once he was out of sight, Eleanor straightened,smoothed her expression, and went to open the door like nothing was wrong.



The strong stench of alcohol hit her first. Horace was leaning against the frame, stinking of booze, his patience long gone.


The second he entered, his eyes darted around suspiciously. "Took you long enough. What were you doing,plotting your escape?"


Eleanor shot him an unimpressed look and moved aside. "If I wanted to escape, I wouldn't still be here.Use your head,"she retorted.


Horace grunted, not buying it but too drunk to think straight. His head was hazy, but his hunger wasn't.


Earlier,his wife had shoved him out when he had tried his luck, and his ego and appetite were still burning. So now,staring at Eleanor, he decided she would do.



She was going to be his woman anyway-why wait?


A crooked grin twisted his lips as he staggered closer."Sweetheart,how about we have some fun tonight?"he drawled. Hearing that, Eleanor immediately tried to steer him away. "Horace, the ceremony-"


"Ceremony, my ass!" he snapped, cutting her off.′′We don't give a damn about that nonsense!"



And then he lunged toward her, consumed by desire and stripped of reason.



The moment words became useless, Eleanor's whole aura shifted and her eyes went cold. ODut of nowhere,a silver needle glinted between her fingers, and just as he leaned in, she struck.



Horace's eyes went glassy. He crumpled like a puppet with its strings cut, not even managing a sound.



The wardrobe door creaked, and McCollum rushed out, tense as ever. "Miss Warren, are you hurt?"



"I'm fine," she said, adjusting her clothes, her voice slipping back into its usual coolness. "Now get out of here. Don't come near me unless it's absolutely necessary. It's too risky."



"Yes, ma'am," he replied, then vanished without another word.



Eleanor's gaze dropped to Horace sprawled out on the bed, unconscious. She frowned, thinking through her next step until something shiny caught her eye. A phone. It must have slipped from his pocket in the scuffle.



She picked it up.



The screen was still lit, and right there was a new message from Lainey.



Eleanor's lips curved slightly. Interesting.



If Darlene happened to see this, maybe Horace would finally have something else to worry about besides bothering her.
###Chapter 209 You're Still In Touch With That Woman
When Horace came to the next morning, his head throbbed mercilessly.


He dragged himself upright, pressing a hand to his aching forehead as he took in the disaster zone around him.



The place was wrecked-torn clothes scattered, a glass tipped over, and a plesant scent hung in the air.



His memories of last night were a blur,his mind fuzzy as he tried to recall the details. He rubbed his head,willing the fog to lift.



A slow grin spread across his face-he had finally had his way with Lainey.


Nolan's girl had caved to him at last.


The thought jolted him awake,making his hangover fade into the background.


Damn, not bad at all. He would call it a win.



But where was Eleanor? Horace glanced around the messy room, puzzled by her absence.



She must have headed off to check in on Darlene.



When he peered out the window, the sun was already high-it was nearly noon.



He smirked to himself. Clever woman, getting on Darlene's good side before he was even up.


In high spirits, Horace got to his feet, slipped on his shoes, and made his wway toward the door.


The moment he stepped out, he nearly collided with a stone-faced figure.


Stephanie stood waiting-his wife's most loyal attendant.


She offered a polite bow, her voice sharp and formal."Sir, Mrs. Boyd wvould like a word with you."


Horace nodded quickly, trying to hide his nerves. "Of course, of course, I'll go right now."


Stephanie led the way, her posture rigid and her expression unreadable. The silence on the walk left Horace with a pit growing in his stomach.


He had a bad feeling about this. His instincts were right. The second he stepped into Darlene's room, a glass flew at his head.



He dodged on instinct, legs nearly giving out beneath him.



Pulling himself together, he forced a shaky smile."Baby, what's got you so riled up?"



Inside,he was terrified.



This was no ordinary tantrum.


Darlene didn't bother with words. She fixed him wvith an icy glare, then tossed a phone his way.



Horace recognized it instantly-his own phone.


A chill crept through him as he stooped to pick it up,his gut twisting with dread.



The screen was still glowing, and at the top was a text message from last night.


It was from Lainey.



"Horace,did you take care of Eleanor?"



His blood ran cold.



Had he really left his phone with Darlene last night? Panic set in, his mind racing, sweat breaking out along his spine.



He scrambled for words, voice shaky. "Baby, wait,let me explain-this isn't what it looks like. There's nothing going on between me and her.I-"



Darlene interjected, her eyes icy and sharp, "You're still in touch with that woman? And now you're scheming to get rid of the one person who saved me?Are you really so eager for a death wish, Horace?"



Horace's words died in his throat. He dropped to his knees with a heavy thud, the sound ringing through the room. "Baby, please-I know l messed up! I swear,it was just business. That's all,I-"



But for once, he couldn't even spin a convincing lie.



Darlene didn't bother to reply. She exchanged a glance with Stephanie.


Stephanie nodded, walked to the wall, and returned holding a leather whip-her face utterly unreadable.


When Horace saw the gleaming whip in her hands,panic shot through him. "Baby! I'm begging you-please,not this time!"


But his pleas fell on deaf ears. The whip cut through the air, snapping down hard, and Horace's cries echoed through the house.


He didn't dare protest. All he could do was curl up and shield himself, sobbing and writhing on the floor.



From the shadows behind a pillar, Eleanor observed the spectacle, a sly smirk curving her lips.



Just as she expected.



A spitfire like Darlene would never tolerate any lingering attachment to Lainey.


This beating was only a taste of what was coming.



The real chaos was still ahead.
###Chapter 210 You Watch Your Back
After scanning McCollum's message, Nolan let out a low laugh.


Eleanor was the type to never accept being taken advantage of-not even for a moment.


She wasn't a pushover; she hunted in silence, waiting patiently for the perfect moment to strike.



That resilience of hers always left him satisfied.



Horace was brazen to think he could meddle with his girl and get away with it.


Kaiden,noticing Nolan slip his phone into his pocket,stepped forward with deference. "Mr. Stewart, all preparations are complete. Our team will attend the event posing as members of the Zerovia Chamber of Commerce.They'll be ready to act at your command."


A faint, chilling smile touched Nolan's lips, though his eyes stayed hard as steel. "I'll be there myself."


The news made Kaiden stiffen,sweat prickling his brow.


Nolan's safety was a matter of national concern. If anything ever happened to him, Zerovia's entire economy could spiral.



But arguing with him was out of the question.


All Kaiden could do was silently double and triple their security-determined that nothing, absolutely nothing would go wrong.



Nolan found himself genuinely intrigued by what was coming.



He couldn't help but picture Eleanor draped in the traditional ceremonial attire of this country-curious to see how she would look.



Elsewhere, Eleanor sat perfectly still, her body limp and compliant as the women around her fussed with pins and layers of fabric.



She gazed at her own reflection, her face a mask of resignation.


The woman staring back from the mirror looked almost unrecognizable-her skin thick with powder,garish streaks of blush smeared across her cheeks,eyelids painted in jarring colors as if shewere about to take the stage in some tragic farce.



The maids around her gasped and gushed, voices full of exaggerated praise. "Absolutely stunning!"


"She looks just like a goddess!"


Eleanor's lips twitched in a half-hearted attempt at a smile.



Dressed like this, she doubted even Myah would know who she was.



While she drifted in her thoughts, a familiar figure wove quietly through the crowd.



McCollum had arrived, slipping into the chaos as if he belonged there. He caught Eleanor's eye and gave her the briefest nod.



Everything was ready.



A subtle relief washed over Eleanor, her anxious heart growing just a little lighter.


The moment had arrived.



A pair of maids helped her stand and gently steered her toward the bustling front hall.


Her scarlet gown swept behind her, long and weighty,shimmering with gold thread and studded jewels-every inch radiating extravagant wealth.



As she neared McCollum, she slowed, speaking so  softly only he could hear, saying, "If anything goes wrong, find Horace's wife,Darlene."


For a heartbeat, McCollum's eyes grew sharper, then the mask returned. He dipped his head, his tone serious. "You watch your back."



Then,taking advantage of the commotion, McCollum pressed a small dagger into Eleanor's palm, his movement quick and unnoticed.


The icy blade sent a chill through her fingers,but she accepted it without hesitation. She might need it.


Inside the front hall, the festivities were already roaring.



The noise was deafening-voices, laughter, and clinking glasses shook the old beams overhead.



Men with flushed cheeks toasted Horace, hollering over the music.



"I bet that Stewart kid is about ready to explode by now!" one shouted, and the crowd roared its agreement.



"Exactly! Anyone who tries to go toe-to-toe with Horace ought to know he's playing with fire!"



The whole crowd erupted in laughter, sharing in Horace's moment of glory. Horace tipped back his glass, draining it in one long pull, a cocky grin plastered across his face.


He signaled to his right-hand man with a sweeping gesture. "Once this ceremony's done, send Mr.Stewart a lavish gift. He deserves to hear the good news firsthand."



This wasn't just a taunt anymore-it was a direct challenge,meant to sting.


Across the room, Kaiden sat stiffly at his table, casting a wary glance at the man beside him, sweat beading along his brow.


Nolan sat utterly still, tapping the table in a slow,steady rhythm-his face as unreadable as stone.



But Kaiden knew that the quieter Nolan seemed,the more dangerous things had become.



Horace had no idea what kind of storm he had just summoned.



Suddenly, someone's voice rose above the din, cutting through the laughter. "Here comes Miss Warren!"
###Chapter 211 Let's Go Home
Every head in the hall turned toward the entrance.


Eleanor walked in, a trail of maids at her side,moving slowly but steadily.



When she finally looked up, her gaze cut straight through the crowd like a blade and locked on a single figure.


Nolan sat there, cool and distant, his whole presence out of place with the noisy hall-crisp suit, sharper eyes,watching her like he saw right through her.



Eleanor's face heated instantly.



Damn it.



All those eyes on her made her feel like she had just walked into a circus, the main act with no way off stage.



She could already imagine Nolan's smug grin later,teasing her until she wanted to crawl under a table.


She lowered her lashes, her cheeks burning in a way she couldn't control. 
But Horace? He read it all wrong. To him, that blush wasn't embarrassment, but it was shyness.


His chest swelled with pride, and he grinned wide,throwing his arms out to his men. "Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves!"


The room erupted in cheers.



"Kiss her! Kiss her!"



"Come on,Horace, don't keep the girl waiting!"


Horace's smirk grew as he leaned in, his eyes roaming over Eleanor's face like she was already his.



But across the room, Nolan's expression snapped.


His jaw tightened, his eyes went black with fury, and the weight of his rage settled over the place like a storm about to break.



Without hesitation, he pulled a pistol from his waistband, and a gunshot ripped through the chaos.



At that very instant, Eleanor moved.



It was as if she had seen this moment coming.Her hand flashed, a dagger appearing, and she slashed down hard toward Horace's arm.



Horace wasn't some street fool. He had lived his life dodging blades and bullets.The instant he sensed the danger, he jerked his head aside just in time.


The bullet still scraped past him, tearing his ear and drawing a hot line of blood.


He dodged the bullet, barely. But Eleanor? He couldn't dodge her. In the same heartbeat, her dagger sliced across his arm with brutal force.



Horace staggered, holding his bleeding arm. He felt something hauntingly familiar about that attack... the speed, the force, and the way it was aimned.


Blood dripped between his fingers as he stared at her.


Those eyes, cold and unforgiving...


A memory he thought he had buried ripped its way back.



Years ago. That day... the woman who came out of nowhere and left him broken and humiliated.His eyes widened as recognition struck.



"It's her!" His voice cracked into a roar."Damn it,it's her! That cursed woman! Somebody get her! Take her down!"



But his command fell into silence. Around him, the hall was filled with drunken men slumped over the tables, snoring loud and heavy.His men weren't ignoring him; they were out cold,drugged by McCollum's spiked liquor.


Horace's gut sank. For the first time, he realized he was completely alone.



And then, Nolan stood up. He didn't rush. He walked forward,slow and deliberate.


With every step closer, Horace's heart plunged deeper into despair.


The suffocating weight pressed against his chest until he could hardly breathe.



It was over. He knew it.



Not only would he lose the woman, but his ownlife might very well be the price.


Panic shoved aside bravado. Without thinking twice,he spun on his heel and bolted for the back door.



Kaiden, sharp as ever, caught on immediately and motioned his men to give chase.



But Nolan stopped. His steps halted right in front of Eleanor.



In that moment, there was no one else in his world. Only her.



He pulled her into his arms, holding her as if he would never let go again.


"I'm sorry," he said, his voice thick with regret."It's my fault they even got the chance."


If he had crushed them earlier, she wouldn't have had to face this mess at all.



Eleanor's face softened as she nestled into his chest.His familiar scent washed over her, chasing away the tension that had been clawing at her nerves.



She smiled.



"What's meant to happen will happen sooner or later.Don't blame yourself," she whispered, giving his back a light pat. "Besides, look at me. I'm standing right here,perfectly fine."



Nolan cupped her hand, his eyes searching every inch of her as though to make absolutely sure. Only when he was certain she was safe did a small wave of relief pass through him.



His hand was cold as he held hers. "Let's go home."
###Chapter 212 The Entire Fist Guild Is Mine
Horace pressed a trembling hand to his bleeding arm,stumbling through the chaos toward the back door.


He had always prided himself on his wits, but tonight,he had been thoroughly bested-outsmarted by a woman when it mattered most.



He gritted his teeth, swearing to himself that if he made it out alive, he would make her pay for this humiliation.



His wound throbbed with fiery pain, and the blood loss sent dark spots dancing before his eyes.



Suddenly, a familiar silhouette materialized from the shadows near the corner.



It was McCollum.



A surge of relief washed over Horace-finally,someone who could help him.


McCollum had stayed out of the rowdy hall and was surely sober.


Desperation sharpening his voice, Horace called out,  "McCollum! Over here-help me out!"


He dangled a promise in the air. "Get me out of this,and I'll make you second-in-command of the Fist Guild!"



Even with his life hanging by a thread, Horace couldn't resist making promises he would never keep.



Despite knowing Eleanor belonged to Nolan, he had tried to take her for himself-either foolish or suicidal.



McCollum's face gave nothing away as he strode toward Horace, looking every bit the loyal rescuer.



But as Horace finally let out a shaky breath, a massive fist came out of nowhere, crashing into his jaw with bone-jarring force.



Horace didn't even manage a sound before his knees buckled and the world went dark.


A moment later, Kaiden appeared with a squad,entering from the hall.



He took in the scene at a glance-Horace sprawled motionless on the ground, McCollum looming nearby,cold and impassive.



Kaiden gave McCollum an approving nod.



"Get him out of here," Kaiden instructed. Two men stepped forward without hesitation, grabbing Horace and hauling him away like he was nothing more than a sack of rubbish.



When Horace finally came to, his head throbbed as if it had been split open, his jaw aching with every breath.



He quickly realized he was bound tight to a chair,ropes biting into his wrists. He was in his own bedroom -at least, it looked like it-but everything felt different now, wrong and unfamiliar.



Across the room, he recognized Darlene's silhouette.She was standing with her back to him, deep in conversation with Kaiden.



"Kaiden, from this moment on, the entire Fist Guild is mine," Darlene declared, her voice ringing with newfound authority.


Horace sat in stunned disbelief.



He had never imagined that his wife knew Kaiden personally.



Darlene continued,her words dripping with contempt,"As for Horace, I'll see to it that he stays in line from now on. You have my word. He won't be a problem again. And if you speak with Mr. Stewart, I'd appreciate you passing along our apologies for what happened with Miss Warren. The Fist Guild will answer to the  Stewart Group from this day forward."


Kaiden nodded, clearly pleased, and gave her shoulder an approving pat. "Darlene, you're far shrewder than Horace'll ever be. It's good to see you know where your loyalties belong."


Before stepping out, he cast a glance at Horace-nothing but disdain in his eyes. "Everything in Zerovia revolves around the Stewart family. We'd do well to remember who built this country's reputation."


With that, Kaiden exited, hands clasped behind his back, and shut the door with a quiet finality.


The silence in the room was suffocating.



Darlene finally turned, her eyes blazing with a cold,predatory light.


A cold sweat broke out across Horace's skin, dread creeping up his spine. He shuddered and dropped his gaze, voice quivering as he pleaded, "Baby, please,I messed up-I'm begging you, I'm so sorry."


Darlene's only answer was a sharp slap across his cheek.



She didn't spare him another glance. Instead, she waved to the loyal guards stationed just outside the door. "Take him away," she instructed coolly. "No one is to let Horace out-not for any reason, not even for a breath of fresh air-unless I say so."



"Understood, ma'am!"



Horace's former followers wasted no time. They closed in, seizing him without a hint of hesitation.


In that moment, the reality hit him like a hammer-his grand plans, his schemes, all of it was finished.


Everything he had built was lost in a heartbeat.



His mind reeled, drifting back to a warning Darlene had given him years ago.


She told him his downfall would come at the hands of a woman, but he laughed it off.


All those years, he had played around, convinced he was untouchable, always letting the women pay the price.


But this time, her prediction had come true.



Regret settled in his bones, heavy and suffocating.



But now,regret was useless. It was all over.
###Chapter 213 I'm Not Leaving You Alone Tonight	     
On the flight home,Eleanor slipped away to freshen up,eager to wash off the exhaustion from the trip.


She returned a few minutes later,settling comfortably into her seat before turning her attention to the man beside her. "So, how did things play out with the Fist Guild?" she asked, curiosity flickering in her gaze.



Nolan's eyes drifted open, and he gently enclosed her cool hand within the warmth of his own.



A touch of drowsiness lingered in his voice. "The Fist Guild carries great influence in Zerovia. If it were to fall apart, the gangs would splinter into factions,and the disorder that followed would stir up even greater trouble."



He continued, "The woman who runs the Fist Guild actually has her head on straight. She handed back all their ill-gotten gains, trying to make peace before things could turn ugly."


He paused, then pulled a file from his bag and handed it over. "We even ended up with a bonus out of all this." With a puzzled look, Eleanor opened the folder.


Inside, a bank statement showed a sea of transactions,but one transfer from the Benton Group jumped out: one hundred million, clear as day.


Eleanor's expression iced over.


She didn't need to ask. Lainey's fingerprints were all over this.



Embezzling funds on this scale was unbelievable.



Shutting the file with a quiet snap,Eleanor leveled her gaze at Nolan, a hint of a smirk curling her lips."Funny,you mention unexpected bonuses. I've got one of my own," she said, waving her phone. "I found a stash of photos from Lainey's wild days in Horace's lounge.Let's just say she won't want anyone seeing these."



The plane touched down at Elepdon Airport before sunrise.



No sooner had they stepped off the jet than someone rushed toward them.



Lillian threw her arms around Eleanor, clutching her tightly. "Eleanor! I thought I'd lost you for good," she cried, her voice thick with emotion.


Ryland dragged himself along at the rear, exhaustion  written all over his face and dark shadows under his eyes.



Nothing about the last few days had been easy.



With Nolan gone to Zerovia to rescue Eleanor, every responsibility for the Stewart Group had fallen on his shoulders.



Endless paperwork kept him busy from dawn to dusk,and to make matters worse, Besty kept storming the Stewart family's manor, demanding Eleanor's return and turning every day into a circus.


Ryland fixed Nolan with a look that mixed relief and exasperation. "You're finally/ back. I thought I'd never see the end of this mess."



As Ryland vented his frustration, Nolan's gaze moved to Lillian, who clung to Eleanor like she might never let go. His eyes narrowed ever so slightly.


Having just pulled Eleanor out of real danger,Nolan wasn't about to let anyone else keep her out of his reach.



He wasted no time. Reaching out, he disentangled Eleanor from Lillian's grasp and pulled her firmly into his own arms.



"Eleanor needs to rest. I'lI be taking her home now,"he said, tone brooking no argument and leaving no  room for protest.


Before leaving, Nolan tossed a folder straight at Ryland. "Take this to the Benton family's estate. Give it to Jeff."



Ryland accepted his fate with a heavy sense of inevitability.


With the document still in his hand, he watched the couple leave and felt a sinking certainty that his long days of exhaustion were far from ending.



He carried the name of the Brooks family, and he could not understand how Nolan could treat him as if he were of so little worth.



Lillian watched in confusion, still processing the abrupt handoff.



All she had wanted was to check on Eleanor. What did Nolan have against her?



Upon returning to the villa in Regal Heights, Nolan held his pillow and stubbornly trailed Eleanor all the way to the third floor.


He claimed he had missed her so much, the thought of being apart again left him uneasy.


A hint of annoyance flickered in Eleanor's eyes before her expression softened. "Alright, but I'm sleeping in  my own bed. The guest room's all yours."


Nolan wasn't having it. "If you're in the bed, I'm at least sleeping on your floor. I'm not leaving you alone tonight."


She glanced at the needles near her bedside and considered how much he had been through.Reluctantly, she gave in.


When night fell, Nolan went all out, pulling out every card he had, all the car keys, even offering up the deeds to his properties.


Spreading the documents across the bed, he gave her a hopeful, almost sheepish look. "Eleanor,everything I have is yours if you just let me sleep next to you tonight."



She didn't so much as flinch.



With one glance at his display, Eleanor slid under the covers and turned away. "Goodnight. I'm exhausted."


Seeing she wouldn't budge, Nolan took the hint.


He grabbed a blanket and settled down on the floor beside her bed.



There he was, a billionaire sprawled on the floor,sighing. Winning Eleanor's heart would never be simple, no matter how much he offered.
###Chapter 214 Is She Still Alive
 Nolan wasn't the only one struggling. Ryland also had his own mess to deal with.



After running himself ragged digging up information on Jeff, he finally tracked him down, only to learn that Jeff was currently at the Stewart family's estate.


Ryland rubbed his temples. Seriously? After being stuck there once already, Jeff still ended up back at that place?



Just picturing Norwood's looming presence was enough to make Ryland break out in a cold sweat.


The old man was intimidating as hell, and Ryland hated crossing paths with him. But Nolan had given him a job,and bailing wasn't an option.


So,swallowing his nerves, Ryland made his way to the Stewart family's residence.


The second he stepped inside, Norwood's voice hit him like a whip. "Well? Did you track down Eleanor? Is she still alive?"



Ever since Eleanor had shown up at Nolan's side,disaster had followed close behind. First,she stirred up trouble with those small families,and now there was a kidnapping scandal dragging the Stewart name down.



She was nothing but trouble.


Ryland could only force a stiff smile. "Mr. Stewart,she's alive."


The truth was, he felt trapped. On one side, Nolan was chasing love like it mattered more than loyalty. On the other, Norwood was rigid, sharp, and impossible to sway.


Norwood, clearly uninterested in hearing explanations,waved him away with an impatient flickof his hand."If that's what you came to say, then you can leave.I already know."


Ryland didn't argue. Instead, he passed a file to Jeff,who was sitting nearby. "Mr. Benton, Nolan asked me to give this to you. I think it has something to do with a cooperation matter, though I'mn not clear on the details."



With that, he bowed slightly and left.


Jeff, however, wasn't really paying attention to the papers. His mind was still replaying the news that Eleanor was alive and safe. He couldn't explain it, but knowing she was alive brought an odd sense of relief.


Once Ryland was gone, the living room went quiet.


Jeff glanced at the file in his hands, then at Norwood.Staying any longer suddenly felt awkward.


He stood up, giving Norwood a respectful nod. "Mr.Stewart, thank you for your hospitality. Lainey and I should get going."


Norwood's face remained unreadable as he gestured to the butler."See them out."



Jeff nodded once more and headed toward the entrance. He was about to go searching for Lainey in the garden when he spotted her already standing by the door.


Convenient. He raised a hand and called to her,"Lainey, let's get going."


Lainey had been zoning out, and it took her a beat to answer."Alright."



Her mind was spinning.



Eleanor was alive?



How the hell did that woman manage to crawl back from the fire? And what was in that file Ryland just dropped off?


Back at the Benton family's estate, she didn't rush upstairs. Instead, she stuck around, playing the part of the dutiful daughter, sitting with Jeff.


The closer she stayed to him, the faster she could get her hands on those shares. Then her perfect life would finally start.


While she was busy daydreaming, Jeff opened the file.


He lowered his gazeas he pulled out a stack of A4papers, along with several photographs.


The first thing that jumped out at him was the bold words-Lainey Gilbert,while studying in Zerovia,lived with the local mafia boss...



Jeff froze mid-breath, his chest tightening as he read on.



The photos were worse. There was Lainey,plastered in heavy makeup, cozying up to a tattooed man,laughing like they were lovers.



Another image showed her gambling recklessly at a casino. And then one where she held a knife, glaring fiercely beside what looked like a severed head.


The written report painted a nasty picture about how  she had been some mob boss's mistress and how she clashed with his legal wife and ended up beaten for it.


Then came the financial trail-a domestic account transferring a full hundred million to a foreign account under the name Horace Boyd.


Jeff's hands shook, and his thoughts scattered into silence.



Could his daughter actually have done something like that?
###Chapter 215 When Did You Sneak Into My Bed
Lainey had no clue what was really in that document or what Jeff was scheming.


She was about to ask about the shares when she glanced up and caught Jeff staring at her.


The warmth that usually softened his eyes was gone,replaced by a sharp, probing look.


Panic bubbled up.



What was going on?


Why was he staring at her like that?


Was the document about her?



Forcing her nerves into a polite mask, Lainey leaned in slightly,tilting her head with a soft, sweet smnile."Dad,when are we going to finalize the transfer for the shares? Didn't you say we'd handle it in a couple of days?"


Jeff's eyes flicked to the document one last time before snapping it shut. His mind was a storm.



The DNA test wouldn't lie.



Lainey was his daughter.



And he hadn't been there for her.



The mistakes, the neglect, all of it pressed on him.


He had failed to protect her, failed to guide her.



Despite those thoughts, he didn't act on impulse. He shoved the document into a nearby bag and shook his head at her request.



"No rush," he said firmly. "Let's wait until your brothers are back from Breoqua. We'll do the signing ceremony when the whole family is together."



Lainey's smile disappeared.


Wait,what?



Hadn't this been settled already?



Why drag it out?


The Benton boys' return...how would that help her?


Anger bubbled up inside her as her eyes fell on the document.Jeff's mood had clearly changed after he saw it.


What kind of nonsense had Ryland fed him?


Seeing her gaze,Jeff softened slightly, as if he could read her thoughts. "You're my daughter.Everything from your mom and me will eventually be yours. Be patient, okay? I have things to handle in the study now.Make sure you rest well."


And just like that, he got up, grabbed the document and disappeared into the study.



Lainey's eyes followed him, burning with anger.



No!


She had to get a look at that document.


Until then, she couldn't feel calm.



At the villa in Regal Heights, Eleanor woke to an odd,uncomfortable pressure against her back the next morning.


Something hard was pressing into her, and it immediately put her on edge.


Still groggy,she reached behind her to shift whatever it was, then froze.



Her fingers brushed against... something unexpected. Her eyes shot open.


Sleep evaporated in an instant.


What the hell was that?



Her heart started racing as she carefully felt again.


The texture, the thickness... it all clicked. Panic prickled up her spine.



She wanted to jump up, to put distance between herself and the source of the discomfort.



But before she could even twist, Nolan rolled over her,pinning her in place.



Eleanor's eyes went wide. "Nolan?"



His voice rumbled low, still lazy with the haze of morning, right in her ear. "You're awake. About that little move just now, were you trying to tempt me?Because if you were... well, I'm always ready."


Eleanor's face went red with a mix of shock, anger,and pure embarrassment.



She shoved against his chest with all her might. "Nolan!When did you sneak into my bed? Get off me!"
###Chapter 216 Why Don't We Get Engaged
Nolan offered no explanation. Instead, a rare seriousness took over his features.



He stared deeply at Eleanor, emotion swirling in his gaze. "Eleanor, let's skip all the detours. Why don't we get engaged?"


The words stunned her into silence.



Her thoughts scattered in every direction,struggling to catch up.



Engagement?


Where did that even come from?



He still owed her an explanation for everything. And what about his grandfather? Wouldn't hestand in their way?


"Do you really think your grandfather would ever go along with this?" she asked.


A quiet, almost daring laugh escaped Nolan. "I'm the one choosing a fiancée, not him. His opinion isn't part of my plan." Warmth bloomed in Eleanor's chest, leaving her breathless for a moment.



Years spent in the orphanage left her yearning for the kind of belonging most people took for granted, a place, a family, a sense of home.


Marrying into the Todd family was her way of repaying Sallie for her kindness, but deep down, she also longed for the comfort that came with being part of a family. In the end, though, that sense of belonging turned out to be nothing more than a lie.



Yet Nolan gave off a sense of safety that she had never known before in her life.



He was willing to take on anything for her sake, always keeping her close and guarding her with steady,unwavering care.



If Nolan was her answer, what reason did she have to hesitate?



She met his earnest eyes and, heart racing, whispered,"Yes.I want that."



A genuine smile broke across Nolan's face, the relief clear in his eyes.



He had been bracing for rejection, but now the fear faded away. Leaning in, he closed the distance between them,his lips almost brushing hers.


But before they could shae the moment...


A sharp knock echoed from the door.


Lilah's polite voice called from the hallway. "Mr.Stewart, your breakfast has been prepared and is waiting for you."



Eleanor's senses returned in a rush, and she scrambled to shove Nolan away, diving beneath the covers with her cheeks blazing.



Watching her curl up like a startled kitten, Nolan couldn't help but chuckle softly,finding her bashfulness unexpectedly endearing.


Later,the pair made their way downstairs, side by side,as if nothing had interrupted the morning.



Erick was already waiting for them at the dining table,his suit pressed and posture stiff.



Nolan took it upon himself to pull out Eleanor's chair,then claimed the seat right next to her.


Lifting his coffee cup, Nolan lounged back with an air of total calm.



Then, as if he were commenting on the weather, he  said, "Erick, go ahead and start planning the engagement."


Just as Erick was about to give his report, he froze the moment those words reached him.



Engagement?



Was that really what he heard?



Had Nolan somehow managed to win over Eleanor without anyone noticing?



And what about Norwood?



If he got even a hint of this, wouldn't he be furious enough to blow the whole place apart?



Nolan noticed Erick<'s hesitation and shot him a cool glance. "Is there a problem?"



Jolted out of his daze, Erick straightened up and stammered, "No problem at all, Mr. Stewart! I'll get on it right away!"


Without another word, Erick hurried out, the weight of the news propellinghim down the hall.


It didn't take long for word of Nolan and Eleanor's engagement to sweep through Elepdon like wildfire.


Naturally, the news found its way to Lainey. Lainey was seated at her dressing table, carefully choosing which pieces of jewelry to wear the following day, when the news finally reached her.


A bright, attention-grabbing headline flashed across her phone screen as the news alert came through.


Her triumphant expression vanished in an instant,disbelief spreading across her face.



Hadn't Norwood promised her?



He had insisted that she was destined to be Nolan's bride.



How could things have changed so quickly?



With anger rising, Lainey jumped to her feet and stormed out of the room, determined to confront Jeff and demand the truth.
###Chapter 217 Nolan Doesn't Love You
Jeff stood in the living room, phone pressed to his ear,lines of worry etched into his face.



The steward from the Stewart family's estate spoke with a nervous edge in his voice on the other end of the call. "Mr. Benton, I'm truly sorry. Mr. Stewart grew so agitated that he fainted, and he's not in any condition to answer the phone right now. Please accept my sincere apologies."


There was a heavy pause before Jeff finally replied,"Please see to it that his needs are taken care of.l actually called to talk about breaking off my daughter's engagement to Nolan."



After turning it over in his mind, Jeff realized that dragging things out would only make matters worse.He had rather end it cleanly.


The document he had reviewed had shaken him to the core.



If Norwood ever saw it, things would be worse. The fallout wouldn't stop with Lainey; it could tarnish the entire Benton family's name. Downstairs, Lainey had just reached the last step when she heard Jeff's words echo through the hall.


She froze, shock and anger flooding her features "Why are you ending the engagement?" she demanded.



Jeff set the phone down, sighing.


He started toward her, hand half-raised in comfort,before he stopped himself.


His tone was gentler than she expected, almost cold in its restraint. "Lainey, Nolan doesn't love you. If you forced this marriage, it wouldn't bring you any happiness."


But Lainey was having none of it.


Losing her composure for the first time in front of Jeff, she lashed out. "Who are you to decide what makes me happy? Didn't I tell you l care about him?I really do! If you won't fight for me, at least don't sabotage me behind my back."


Her voice cracked as she pushed on. "Now I get it.I know you've always looked down on me, just because I didn't grow up like everyone else, or because I'm not the perfect daughter you pictured. But what did I do wrong? You're the ones who lost me, not the other way around!" She had been on the verge of getting everything she wanted,and now Jeff was tearing it all apart.



He was such a disappointment.


Jeff listened to her outburst, sadness overtaking any frustration.


He knew the pain in her words wasn't all her fault. In the end, it was the family who had failed her.


Jeff let out a weary sigh, a heaviness settling over his words. "Lainey, none of what happened in Zerovia is on you. If anyone should be apologizing, it's us. I've made arrangements for us to go back to Breoqua.Once we're there, I promise to help you find someone who's your equal in every way, someone who truly deserves you."



He didn't wait for a response. Turning away, he headed upstairs, leaving Lainey standing in the echo of his words.


Stunned and motionless, she dug her fingernails into her palms.


Zerovia? Did Ryland's report expose what she had done there?



A tremor ran through her body as dread crept in. Just how much had they figured out?


That explained why Jeff had so suddenly backed out of transferring the shares.



No,she couldn't risk going to Breoqua.


If she set foot there, Fraser,who still carried a heavy grudge against her, would no doubt go out of his way to make things unbearable. He might even start running DNA tests behind her back every chance he got.


Panic clawed at her chest, but desperation sharpened her thoughts.


One ruthless idea took shape: if Jeff, Hilda,and Eleanor were all gone, she would be in line for the Benton inheritance.



That kind of fortune would force the Stewart family's hand; they would have to accept her, no matter what.



As for Fraser and his brothers, they were oceans away and no threat to her plan. Once she secured her title as Nolan's wife and locked down the shares, nothing could touch her, even if old scandals surfaced later.

 
Malice slowly overtook her fear, darkening her gaze with resolve. Upstairs, Hilda had just stepped out and caught sight of Lainey's twisted expression.


A cold shiver of unease crept over her. Whatever Lainey was plotting, she could feel the danger looming,but she had no idea what storm was about to break.

###Chapter 218 You Won't Marry Anyone But Her
At the Stewart Group's private hospital, Norwood lounged against a pile of pillows, savoring his coffee with a smug sense of accomplishment.



Muted voices in the hallway brought a rare smile to his lips. At last, he had managed to rattle that unyielding grandson of his.



Meanwhile,Nolan stood in the corridor, his glare sharp enough to cut glass. The butler blocked the door,shrinking under the pressure of his stormy mood.



Tension hung in the air like a thundercloud.



"Tell me the truth. How is he really doing?" Nolan pressed,his patience wearing thin.


The butler's face contorted in practiced grief. His voice wavered as he clung to his script. "Mr. Stewart,please don't be alarmed. The moment your grandfather heard about your engagement to Miss Warren, he fainted, collapsed from the shock. The doctor's not optimistic. He says it's... critical."


A muscle jumped in Nolan's jaw. "Move. I'm going in." 
Waffling for time, the butler stammered, searching for an excuse.


Erick stepped up, eyes steely, and all but yanked the butler aside.



Nolan wasted no time. He swept into the room and pushed open the door.


Inside, Norwood made a show of hastily shoving his coffee cup beneath the pillow and squeezing his eyes shut,feigning unconsciousness.


His movements were swift, but they still left behind signs that something had been done.


Nolan's eyes landed on the coffee-streaked sheets and the cup clumsily tucked beneath the pillow, as if someone had tried to hide it in a hurry.



Nolan took it all in, a sigh catching in his chest. He dropped into the chair at Norwood's bedside, choosing not to call out the theatrics.



"Grandpa,I've followed your lead for as long as I can remember. I know you're still angry about what happened with Dad, but blaming Eleanor for his choices isn't fair. I've made my decision about her,and I want your blessing, not your resentment."



Norwood's eyelids fluttered, then he opened his eyes,  sharp and lucid. "You won't marry anyone but her?"


Without the slightest hesitation, Nolan nodded,unwavering. "That's exactly what I'm saying."


A laugh broke from Norwood, bitter and brimming with anger. "Unbelievable! This is the legacy I've built?This is my successor?"


He sat upright, jabbing a trembling finger in Nolan's direction, his voice rising with each word. "If that's how it is, you'll sign over every share of Stewart GGroup you own. From this moment on, I have no grandson. Do what you want,marry who you please. You're nothing to me!"



The words stung, but Nolan kept his composure.


He stood, bowed deeply, and said with quiet resolve,"I'll have Erick handle the transfer today. As for you..."


He lifted his head, gaze steady and sincere. "You've been my family, and nothing can change that. No matter what you say, you'll always be my grandfather.Eleanor and I will visit you."


He turned and walked out, every step certain,without a backward glance.


Left behind, Norwood trembled with rage, chest rising and falling as anger overtook him. He snatched the pillow off the bed and flung it hard in the direction of the door.



The pillow struck the door with a dull thud before dropping to the floor, lifeless and still.


The butler slipped quietly into the room, careful not to provoke Norwood's simmering anger. "Mr. Stewart,your grandson-"



Norwood's voice cracked like a whip. "Defiant.Completely defiant!"



His lips quivered, his rage barely held in check.


He had never imagined Nolan pushing back so relentlessly, never once wavering in his decision.


Closing his eyes, Norwood took a slow breath,fighting to regain his composure. When he looked up again,his eyes were icy and calculatng. "Find Wray. Bring him here,now."



The butler felt a chill run down his spine and hurried to obey. "At once, sir."



Meanwhile, Nolan made his way out of the hospital,heading straight for the waiting Bentley parked at the curb.



Erick climbed behind the wheel, stealing a look in the  mirror at his boss, who looked calm and unreadable.



"Just got word, Mr. Stewart. your grandfather's sending for Wray," Erick reported quietly.



Everyone in the family knew Wray had always eyed Nolan's position from the shadows. All he needed was a chance.



With Norwood's latest move, his intentions couldn't be clearer.



Nolan's face betrayed nothing. He barely glanced up.


He had seen this coming long ago and was ready for whatever Norwood tried next.


No matter what, he wouldn't let anyone, not even his grandfather, come between him and Eleanor.



"Tell Ryland to keep an eye on things. For now,your only priority is getting the engagement plans in order.And keep this from Eleanor. She doesn't need the extra worry."



Erick nodded, understanding every unspoken order."Consider it done."
###Chapter 219 Consider This My Peace Offering
At the villa in Regal Heights, Eleanor was sitting on the soft wool carpet, carefully selecting her engagement dress.



She had initially wanted to design it herself, but Nolan had put his foot down, insisting she leave it to the designer he had paid so she wouldn't wear herself out.


Her eyes lingered on a mermaid-style gown dotted with tiny diamonds.


Elegant,understated, exactly her taste.


She nodded in satisfaction.



She was about to try it on when Lillian burst in like a whirlwind, dressed in a fiery red outfit.



She tossed her limited-edition handbag onto the sofa and marched straight toward Eleanor, hands planted firmly on her hips, glaring.


"Eleanor!" she barked.



"An engagement this big, and you didn't even bother to clue me in! If my brother hadn't spilled the beans, I  would still be in the dark."



Eleanor couldn't help but laugh at her friend's dramatic entrance.



She stood, strolled over to the bar, and poured a cup of coffee, offering it to Lillian with a small smile."My bad. I planned to tell everyone once things were settled," she said, handing over the cup. "Consider this my peace offering."


Lillian huffed but accepted the coffee,taking a long sip.




However, midway through, her eyes lit up with realization.



"Oh, and Nolan, he's something elsel The perfect future husband! He literally gave up the entire Stewart Group for you. Can you believe that?"


Eleanor tightened her grip on the cup, her brow furrowing slightly. "Wait, what do you mean? He gave up the company?"


Lillian's jaw practically dropped. "You don't know?Seriously! Nolan didn't tell you?"


She leaned forward and began recounting the hospital showdown between Nolan and Norwood.



How Norwood had faked a faint, only for Nolan  to see  through it, and then how Norwood had tried to force Nolan to give up Eleanor in exchange for the Stewart Group's shares.



"You wouldn't believe it! Erick said Nolan didn't even hesitate before choosing you over the Stewart Group.Norwood was so angry he almost fainted for real.Right after, he sent the butler to bring Wray.You know him, right? The one who's always scheming to take Nolan's spot. Looks like Norwood's planning to change who inherits everything!"



Eleanor listened quietly, feeling a tight ache in her chest.



It was a mix of bitterness and a little sweetness.



She hadn't expected Nolan to go so far for her.


He always protected her from life's storms, quietly,without ever asking for recognition or letting her know the full extent of his efforts.



Just then, Lillian's phone vibrated.



She glanced down, and saw it was a message from Rylan.


It read, "Don't spill anything to Eleanor. Nolan said so."


Lillian froze, realizing she had just given Eleanor the full play-by-play. In vivid detail. She then looked up at Eleanor and forced out a nervous laugh. "Uh, Eleanor, I just remembered I haven't fed my cat yet. I should get going. Let's catch up another time!"


And with that, she snatched her handbag and bolted,like the devil himself was after her.



Eleanor blinked, shaking her head as she watched Lillian disappear.



She didn't even bother thinking too much about it.The hospital drama replayed in her mind anyway.


Slowly, she walked over to the picture window and gazed at the night sky.



Her chest felt warm, and a soft smile appeared on her lips.



Noticing the late hour on the clock,she looked over at Lilah, who was busy in the kitchen getting dinner ready. "Lilah, you've done enough today. Go on and take the evening off."



Lilah paused, frowning. "But dinner's not ready yet,ma'am."



Eleanor chuckled softly. "No worries. I got this tonight."


Lilah's eyes widened in surprise. In all her years working here, she had never seen Eleanor step foot in the kitchen.


"Alright, madam. Be careful and call me if you need anything," she said, bowing slightly before leaving.
###Chapter 220 | Must Be The Luckiest Man Alive
As soon as Nolan stepped through the door, an unfamiliar scent drifted in from the kitchen.



This wasn't the usual aroma from Lilah's carefully prepared meals.



Slipping into his slippers, he made his way toward the dining room, curiosity piqued.


There,he found Eleanor, who was wearing an apron,was setting down the final dish with practiced care.


A smile crept across Nolan's lips. He hadn't expected this,a home-cooked dinner from her.



Moving quietly, he came up behind her, slipping his arms around her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder.



"I must be the luckiest man alive," he murmured, voice soft and sincere.



She stiffened, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes.


Gently pushing his arms away, Eleanor turned to face him, her expression unreadable. "Let's eat before it  gets cold."


The meal unfolded in a heavy silence.



Nolan ate heartily, savoring every bite, but Eleanor only picked at her food,her mind clearly elsewhere.


A jumble of memories tugged at her, everything Nolan had done for her, every sacrifice, every gesture.



Gratitude and something deeper warred inside her,but a shadow of discomfort lingered.


Still, an unfamiliar and creeping sense of unease lingered just beneath the surface, impossible to shake off.



She refused to live as someone who needed shielding.She had both the strength and the right to stand by his side, ready to whatever life threw their way,side by side.



All at once, she set down her fork.



Nolan paused,halfway to reaching for another helping,and glanced up.



"Tell me about the shares, Nolan." Her gaze locked on his,steady and clear.

 
For a moment, he was taken aback. 
He set his utensils down with measured calm, his face giving nothing away. But in his eyes, a flash of understanding stirred.


So,Lillian,always too quick to talk, had let the truth slip out.



Without a word, Nolan rose and walked around the table,pulling her gently into his arms.


Nolan drew her close, his tone light as if they were chatting about dinner plans instead of life-altering decisions.



"Grandpa's been feeling nostalgic for the office,so he's decided to step back in. Honestly, it might work out for the best. I'll have more time for us," he replied,brushing off the seriousness with an easy smile.


Eleanor only watched him, her gaze calm and unwavering, not buying the casual act for a second.


That unwavering look made Nolan falter, his smile slipping away.


He always struggled when she was like this, so composed, so clear-eyed, always seeing straight through him.



He lowered his gaze, lashes throwing shadows across his cheek, his voice suddenly vulnerable "You know, I handed over the reins at Stewart Group.Don't tell me you're going to abandon me now."


A laugh escaped Eleanor despite herself, though she rolled her eyes at his dramatics. "Cut it out."



Nolan caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her fingers,his earlier playfulness replaced with genuine warmth.


His eyes met hers, earnest and sure.



"Everything's under control. Grandpa's just sulking.Once we're engaged,he'll come around. I promise."


Eleanor swatted his arm, half in jest. "Something this big, and you didn't think to fill me in? Wle're supposed to be in this together. Next time, tell me first. I want to be the one you lean on."



A rush of affection swept through Nolan, leaving him oddly breathless.



He wrapped her up in a steady embrace and nodded,voice low and sure. "You have my word."
###Chapter 221 Eleanor Is Getting Engaged


Hilda lit up as soon as she heard Eleanor was getting engaged.

On the morning of the engagement party, she was already awake before the sun had a chance to rise.

She floated from one room to the next, straightening her gown, then hurrying to check the gift she had wrapped herself.

Jeff watched her move about, a soft smile playing at his lips.

His eyes landed on a small velvet box sitting open on the table, revealing a diamond bracelet.

It was an heirloom, something that had been part of the Wagner family for as long as anyone could remember.

Hilda's mother had once handed one to each of her daughters, many years ago.

Jeff recalled how much Hilda treasured hers. Most days, she kept it tucked away, only bringing it out for the rarest occasions.

He walked over and slipped an arm around her shoulders. "Sweetheart, even if Eleanor's your brother's daughter, isn't this a little over the top?"

Hilda snapped the box shut and shot him a look. "Over the top? You think this is too much? Eleanor is getting engaged, Jeff. If anything, I'm worried it's not enough! Today is about her, so please, let's not say anything to dampen the day."

If she could, Hilda would have given Eleanor the world.

Jeff just grinned and squeezed her shoulder, deciding it was best not to argue with her.

If it brought her happiness, that was all that mattered.

Lainey had left early that morning, which turned out to be a blessing. If she had witnessed this moment, she probably would have read too much into it.

Hilda decided it was time to get ready and headed upstairs to change.

Downstairs, the front door swung open to reveal a man in a crisp black suit. He stood with a stiff posture, his face unfamiliar-Hilda figured he must bethe new driver.

"Mr.and Mrs. Benton, the car is waiting out front," the man said with respect.

Jeff was lost in his thoughts and didn't bother looking back. "Alright," he replied without much interest.

A sudden, sharp pain pierced his skull, making everything spin.

There was no chance to cry out. His body simply slumped to the floor.

Just before everything faded away, Jeff caught a glimpse of the driver's face twisted in a chilling grin.

Hilda descended the stairs, feeling refreshed in her dress and practically bouncing with energy. "Baby, I'm all set. We should leave now if we want to get there on time," she called out, her voice brimming with anticipation.

She was halfway through the living room when her eyes landed on Jeff, sprawled across the carpet,completely still. A stranger stood a few steps away, watching her.

Fear surged through her, and she bolted for the staircase.

She did not get far.

The stranger sprang forward,yanked her back by the hair, and smashed her head against the wall.

Fiery pain exploded in her skull as blood streamed down the side of her face.

Dizziness swept over her, making everything tilt and blur.

Without a hint of emotion, the man let go, and Hilda crumpled to the floor.

He calmly fished a small bottle from his pocket and drenched the lavish rug and sofa with liquid.

A sharp reek of gasoline quickly filled the air. He flicked open a lighter, tossing it onto the soaked floor without hesitation.

Fire tore through the room, swallowing every piece of furniture in its path.

With a calm that bordered on chilling, the man pulled out his phone and dialed. "It's done, Lainey. There's nothing left to worry about."

The chaos faded from Hilda's view as the world slipped further from her grasp.

Heat pressed in from all sides, and through the flickering blaze, she caught a glimpse of the bracelet glinting at the edge of the rug.

It was supposed to be Eleanor's-something passed down from her own mother, a thread of memory tying their family together. Losing it now was unthinkable.

With every ounce of strength left in her body, Hilda dragged herself across the burning floor, reaching for the bracelet inch by agonizing inch.

Her fingers finally brushed against the metal. She gripped it fiercely, holding it to her chest to shield it from the flames.

Smoke thickened around her as the fire raged, swallowing everything in its path.

Jeff still lay motionless nearby, offering no sign of waking.

A crushing hopelessness settled over her heart.

There were so many things left unsaid to Eleanor.

She had never truly told her how much she cared. She had never even heard Eleanor call her"Mom."

Dying here couldn't be the end-she refused to let it be.

Trembling, Hilda searched her pocket for her phone.

Her trembling hands stained the phone's screen with blood, bu she still managed to tap out the number she could never forget-Eleanor's. The ringing stopped, and the call went through.

Eleanor's voice drifted faintly from the speaker, but before Hilda could respond, exhaustion pulled her under completely.


The phone tumbled from her hand, clattering to the floor as shadows closed in and swallowed her whole.
###Chapter 222 Don't You Think That's Sad, Eleanor


Backstage at the Regal Hotel, Eleanor was putting the finishing touches on her look.

The makeup team had just packed up and left, leaving her alone in the airy, quiet room.

Right then, her phone buzzed with a call from Hilda.

Expecting a routine call, maybe some last-minute instructions, she answered with a polite smile.

"Hello?" she said, but no one answered.

There was silence, except for a faint, unsettling sizzling, like something was burning.

Eleanor's smile vanished, and an uneasy tension gripped her chest."Mrs. Benton? Are you okay?" she asked.

The sizzling didn't stop. If anything, it seemed to get louder.

Panic-stricken, she stood up and began pacing, trying to calm herself.

What was happening?

"Mrs. Benton! Can you hear me?" she shouted.

Wasting no time, she grabbed her phone, tugged at the hem of her gown, and rushed to the door.

As she swung it open, she bumped into a soft figure.

Lainey, dressed in a bubblegum-pink gown, stepped back a few paces, but her composure didn't waver.

She fixed her hair and planted herself squarely in Eleanor's path.

"Eleanor, where do you think you're going? The engagement party's about to starrt she'said.

Eleanor didn't have a second to waste on pleasantries. She tried to push past her, but Lainey didn't move.

Slowly,her voice softened, yet a sharp edge remained.

"Someone is truly pathetic. On what should be the happiest day of her lives, she ends up grieving. Don't you think that's sad,Eleanor?"

Eleanor froze for barely a heartbeat, then spun around, her eyes cold and furious.

She didn't say a word and slapped Lainey hard, knocking her to the floor as her cheek puffed up and reddened instantly.

Before Lainey could even think, Eleanor crouched beside her and gripped her neck tightly.

"What the hell have you done?" Eleanor growled through clenched teeth. "What did you mean by that?"

Lainey struggled for air, her face bright red, but her lips curled intoa cruel smile.

She thrived on pushing Eleanor's buttons.

"What do I mean?" she sneered. "Do you really not understand? I had someone swap our DNA samples, and Hilda, that careful old woman, and Jeff, that fool, actually believed it! They actually believed I was their real daughter! And now, all of this... it's their own doing. Their mistake. Their blind trust. And if you hurry over to their home now, you might just catch a final glimpse of them. Tick-tock, my dear."

Every word hit Eleanor like a punch to the chest.

Panic bubbled up as Hilda's kind, loving face flashed in her mind.

Could it really be true? Were the Bentons truly her real parents?

Her hands and feet went icy, and her eyes reddened without her realizing it.

Fixing Lainey with a sharp gaze, Eleanor hissed, "If anything happens to them, you'll regret it."

Then, without another word, she let go and bolted.

Lainey stayed sprawled on the floor, but that twisted smirk never left her face. Perfect timing. Eleanor was running straight into her trap.

She rubbed her sore neck and grinned wickedly.

Luckily, before Horace was dealt with, he had stationed some men in the countryside who would follow orders for money.

She hadn't even expected Nolan to be this relentless about marrying Eleanor, and she certainly didn't think Norwood would dare set Wray's appointment as general manager today. Yet the engagement was still going on as planned.

It was maddening and exhilarating.

Lainey's grin widened,

Nolan would be hers, and anyone in her way, Eleanor, the Bentons, well, they could all burn.
###Chapter 223 We're Going To The Bentons'


The banquet hall was alive with chatter and the shimmer of evening gowns, the scent of perfume thick in the air.

Music floated over the crowd, and everyone seemed to be holding their breath, waiting for the main event.

But Nolan didn't notice any of it. He stood at the edge of the stage, frowning, scanning the room with a growing unease. Eleanor was nowhere to be seen.

Lillian, tasked with.greeting guests, hurried over. "Nolan, where's Eleanor? Shouldn't she be here by now?"

He shook his head and pulled-out his phone, dialing Eleanor's number again.

The same unreachable tone rang out.

Something was off.

Since Eleanor had agreed to this engagement, she wouldn't just disappear.

His heart started to pound.

Without a second thought, Nolan rushed toward her dressing room, Lillian close behind.

But when they arrived, the room was empty.

Eleanor was gone.

Panic tightened Nolan's chest. He barked an order tothe hotel manager who had trailed them, "Check all the surveillance cameras. Now!"

Just then, Erick appeared,pale and tense.

"Boss, there's trouble at the Benton estate," he whispered."It's on fire, and the flames are spreading fast.Also, the investigation into Miss Warren's connection to the Bentons is complete."
He swallowed hard before adding, "She is their daughter."

Nolan froze.

The villa was burning, and Eleanor, their daughter...she had to be there.

She was in danger!

His mind snapped into focus.

At that moment, the staff who had been looking for Eleanor came back, out of breath. "Mr. Stewart, we checked the footage. Miss Warren left through the back door about thirty minutes ago. She seemed to be heading straight for the Benton estate."

That was all Nolan needed to hear. He didn't hesitate.

A cold, determined edge settled over him as he strode toward the exit. "Get the car ready. We're going to the Bentons'," he barked.

"I'm coming with you!" Lillian exclaimed, trying to follow, but Nolan's gaze pinned her in place.

"Stay here and manage the guests."

Frustration flared across her face, but she knew the responsibility rested on her, so she reluctantly nodded.

Hidden in the corridor's shadows, Lainey watched everything with a cruel smile spreading across her face.

By the time they get there, there would be no one left to save.

Meanwhile, as Nolan's sleek Bentley raced down the road, Eleanor had just gotten out of the taxi.

Ahead of her, flames shot high into the sky.

The villa looked like a massive bonfire, and the air was heavy with the sharp sting of smoke.

She tried to run toward it, but security had already set up a long barricade. "You can't go in there! It's too dangerous!" one of them shouted. Eleanor ignored him and held onto the ripped hem of her dress, determined to get inside.

"Calm down! Wait for the firefighters!" the man pleaded, stepping in her way.

Calm down?

Her parents were trapped inside.How could she wait calmly?

She hadn't even gotten to call them Mom and Dad yet.

There was no time to think. With a fierce glare, she shoved past the guards and charged straight into the flames.

Smoke wrapped around her instantly, burning her lungs and skin.

She coughed, tears running down her face but she didn't stop! Nothing was going to hold her back.
###Chapter 224 | Have To Go In!


Nothing else mattered as Eleanor's gaze swept frantically across the burning hallway.

Flames clawed their way up the once-elegant wallpaper, while sparks rained down from the teetering chandelier overhead.

In the smoky haze, she finally caught sight of two figures huddled by the toppled sofa-Hilda and Jeff.

Panic squeezed her chest, but she pushed forward without thinking.

Relief flooded her when she saw their chests rise and fall-they were still alive, only overwhelmed by the thick, choking smoke.

There was no time to rest. She glanced desperately at the main doors, but they were sealed off by a pile of beams and a wall of fire.

Her mind raced for ariother way out, and then she spotted the back door. The flames had not reached it yet,and hope sparked in her heart.

Acting on instinct, Eleanor crouched down and hooked her arms under both Hilda and Jeff, fighting to lift them.

Their combined weight nearly brought her to her knees, but she refused to let go.

Step by step, teeth gritted, she inched forward, carefully weaving around the flames licking at her shoes.

A burnt beam smashed to the floor right behind her, showering sparks everywhere.

For a second, Eleanor realized just howN close she had come to disaster.

Her pulse hammered in her chest, fear threatening to take over, but she forced herself to keep moving.

Every wall around her shuddered as the whole house groaned, splintering wood echoing through the smoke.

Adrenaline took over and Eleanor pushed herself to go faster. Just as she made for the back exit, three shadowy figures appeared, blocking the doorway.

Men in dark suits stood shoulder to shoulder, faces blank, offering no way past.

...

Out on the street, a sleek black Bentley waited just beyond the police barricade.

Nolan threw the door open and sprinted toward the chaos.

Flames devoured the villa in front of him, turning his face pale with shock.

A massive explosion thundered through the night.

The house caved in with a terrible roar, and for an instant, it felt like the entire world held its breath.

Nolan froze in place, every muscle tensed as dread overtook his features.

He shouted her name, voice cracking with panic. "Eleanor!"

Without hesitation, he tried to bolt toward the burning house.

Erick and the nearby security guards caught up just in time to stop him, grabbing his arms and pulling him back.

"Boss, you can't go in there-it's too dangerous!" Erick said.

"A lady just ran inside and hasn't come back out. You can't throw your life away!" one guard pleaded, trying to reason with him.

Wild desperation took over as Nolan's eyes reddened and he screamed at the top of his lungs,"Open the way! I have to go in! Please!"

Knowing Eleanor was trapped inside made the'panic nearly unbearable.

She must be scared out of her mind, all alone in that burning house.

His thrashing grew so violent that the guards nearly lost their grip, barely managing to restrain him as he fought with everything he had. Erick's eyes glistened with tears as he watched his boss unravel. Knowing he had no other choice, he gritted his teeth and knocked Nolan out. "Forgive me, sir. This is for your own good."

Just then, a fleet of sleek Maybachs rolled up to the edge of the police blockade.

Doors swung open and Norwood stepped out, flanked by a group of attendants.

Norwood's eyes immediately landed on an unconscious Nolan. A hint of relief crossed Norwood's face at the sight of Nolan unscathed.

That relief faded fast as he took in the Benton estate, now nothing but flames and ashes. For a brief moment, his eyes narrowed-if Nolan had made it inside, he might never have come back out.

Norwood's tone left no room for argument as he addressed the butler. "Take him home.Now."

"Right away, sir!"
###Chapter 225 Watch Lainey's Every Step


Nolan jolted awake from a terrifying nightmare.

In his dream, Eleanor had been trapped in a wall of flames.

"Eleanor!" he yelled, springing upright on the massive bed.

Erick and Norwood were right there at his side.

The room felt heavy, like grief itself was pressing down on him. It was almost suffocating.

Nolan grabbed Erick's arm, his voice shaking. "Where is Eleanor? Did anyone get her out? Tell me, where is she?"

He kicked the covers aside and scrambled out of bed barefoot, not caring about anything else.

Norwood watched him with a complicated look. After a long sigh, he finally said, "She's gone. The fire...after it was put out, the police found three bodies in the wreckage."

He glanced at Erick. "Show him."

Erick hesitated but finally picked up the tablet and handed it to Nolan. His fingers trembled as he did.

The glow of the screen lit up Nolan's pale, anxious face.

The headline read, "Breaking News-Fire at the Benton family villa. Jeff and Hilda Benton were confirmed dead. Will reveals younger daughter Lainey inherits most of the estate. Three bodies recovered, another presumed to be Enigma,Fans gather at the scene to pay respects."

Dead...everyone? Eleanor was... gone?

Nolan stumbled back, his mind refusing to accept it. "No, this isn't real. Eleanor... she can't be dead!"

Norwood sighed again, unable to watch Nolan fall apart. "This has been confirmned by the police. What do you have to say now?" Nolan's lips trembled as he looked at Erick for some kind of reassurance.

Erick swallowed hard. "Boss, I checked the surveillance. Miss Warren did go inside. We're just waiting on DNA results..."

Before he could say more, Nolan collapsed back onto the bed,completely drained.

He stayed there for what felt like forever.

Then, suddenly, he snatched the tablet and hurled it to the floor. "No. She's smart. She can't just be gone!Find her, now! And track down Lainey. I want answers!"

"Stop!" Norwood barked, slamming his cane on the floor.

Lainey was the heiress of the Benton family now. Any reckless move would trigger a scandal, especially with her parents just passing away.

Yet seeing Nolan so pale and frantic, Norwood softened slightly. "The police will get to the bottom of this,whether it was some tragic mistake or someone's dirty work. Either way, Eleanor's gone. That means your engagement with her'ends here. In three days, I'll send someone to propose to Lainey."

He threw Erick a sharp glare. "Watch him. If he dares to make a move without my say-so, consider yourself unemployed."

Without another word, he walked off, the door shutting hard behind him.

For a long moment, silence hung thick. Erick glanced at Nolan, unsure of what to say. Finally, he muttered,"Boss, I'm sorry for your loss."

Nolan lifted his head slowly, eyes burning with stubborn rage.

Loss?

What a joke.

If Eleanor was really gone, what reason did he have to keep breathing?

Nolan moved like a ghost, not eating, not drinking, lost in a haze of despair. Then, his phone buzzed, and a short message lit up the screen. "I'm alive. Just hurt, nothing serious. Since Lainey tried to kill me, why don't we flip her little game against her?"

Eleanor. It was her. Of course. With her aboilities, death could never claim her so easily.

Relief crashed over him, and laughter burst out of him, raw and broken, until tears blurred his eyes.

Erick's scalp prickled.

From where he stood, it looked like Nolan had finally lost it.

Eleanor was dead, and his boss had gone mad.

Then Nolan's cold voice cut through the room. "Erick, watch Lainey's every step. Also spread the word that I'm devastated... that I can't accept reality, and I'm drowning in despair."

How had Eleanor even found out about the fire at the Benton family's villa? And why would she throw herself into the flames without a second thought?

There could only be one answer-Lainey. She must have told Eleanor everything, using the truth about her bloodline to push her over the edge.

What a twisted little setup.

Erick had no clue what had brought Nolan back to his senses so suddenly, but he didn't dare question it. He only straightened up and replied quickly, "Got it, boss."
###Chapter 226 Can You Give Us A Reason


Lainey wasted no time after her performance at the Benton family's villa, eager to face the cameras and seize the moment.

The press conference hall buzzed with anticipation. Reporters and photographers packed the space, every lens trained on the woman standing beneath the bright lights. She wore a simple black dress, her sorrow painted for everyone to see.

"I appreciate everyone's concern. I promise to stay strong and carry out my parents' wishes by leading the Benton Group with integrity," Lainey remarked with red-rimmed eyes, her tone quivering for effect. "I will also be donating a portion of my inheritance to charity, in hopes of honoring my parents and bringing them peace."

Flashes went off as the reporters murmured in approval. Here was the heiress of the Benton family, carrying her loss with poise and still thinking of the greater good.

A few even whispered about her compassion and social responsibility.

But Lainey wasn't finished.

The room erupted as Lainey shifted gears and delivered her next statement.

With a slow, dramatic bow, she met the cameras head-on, her wide-eyed innocence almost too perfect. "I need everyone here to keep an eye on the investigation. Why was Miss Eleanor Warren there that day? And is it possible her actions are connected to my parents' deaths?"

She paused for a trembling breath, then continued, voice cracking, "Out of respect for those we've lost, I truly don't want to throw accusations around. All I'm asking is for the Enigma Group and the police to explain what happened and help my family find some closure."

Whispers and flashes filled the air, the accusation barely disguised.

Lillian's patience snapped. Shoving her way through the sea of reporters, she stormed the stage, fire blazing in her eyes.

"You're unbelievable, Lainey! How dare you twist things like this? If Eleanor really started the fire,why would she risk everything to run back in?" Lillian retorted, voice ringing with outrage. "You're turning the tables,blaming the innocent! Everyone's about to see what you're really like, and I won't let you fool them any longer!"

Lillian's fury only seemed to amuse Lainey, who stood her ground, a flicker of satisfaction breaking through her tearful expression.

Secretly, she relished the outburst. The louder Lillian grew, the easier it was to paint herself as the wounded party.

She let her shoulders shake and took a faltering step backward, eyes wide with feigned terror as tears streaked down her cheeks.

"Ms. Brooks; I understand your loyalty to Eleanor," Lainey said, voice trembling for effect. "But please, put yourself in my shoes. I just lost my parents, and all I want is the truth. If Eleanor was truly innocent, then why was she at the scene that night? Can you give us a reason?"

The question landed like a stone, leaving Lillian speechless.

Her mouth opened, but nothing came out.

The question echoed in Lillian's mind too-why had Eleanor shown up at the Benton family's villa in the first place?

She found herself at a loss, uncertainty swirling in her mind.

She couldn't deny it-if Eleanor had stayed away, she might still be alive.

Every camera in the room focused directly on Lillian, turning her confusion into tomorrow's headlines.

Reporter after reporter murmured, their hushed voices filling the air with suspicion and doubt.

"Isn't the Brooks girl acting way out of line right now?" "Seriously. Lainey just lost both her parents, and here comes Lillian making things even harder. There's not a shred of compassion in her."

"Lillian thinks her family's money gives her a free pass to treat people however she likes."

Lillian heard every word, her hands trembling and her cheeks burning with fury.

A firm grip suddenly caught her arm.

Ryland appeared beside her, face set in a grim frown as he pulled his sister away from the crowd. "That's enough,Lillian."

At this point, the entire room sympathized with Lainey, casting her in the role of the helpless victim.

Any more drama would only give Lainey more support, and Ryland knew it.

Lillian wanted to argue, her lips parted for a retort, but the warning in her brother's eyes made her bite her tongue.

Letting out a shaky breath, Ryland finally turned to Lainey, forcing a polite apology."Miss Gilbert, please accept my apologies. My sister can be hotheaded. I hope you'll forgive her behavior."

Lainey had no plans to let the matter drop.

She delicately dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, shooting Lillian a look laced with disdain."Mr.Brooks, you might want to teach your sister how to behave. It's hard to see any grace or class in such unruly conduct, especially from someone raised in a family like yours."

Every worddripped with sarcasm, her smile never reaching her eyes.

"You!" Lillian's anger threatened to boil over all ovêr again.

Ryland stepped in swiftly, forcing a strained smile as he seized her by the arm and steered her out of the spotlight.

###Chapter 227 What Do We Do Now


Lainey stood by, her gaze hard and victorious as she watched the Brooks siblings disappear dejectedly.

Almost all of Jeff's personal fortune, and his wife's now belonged to her.

Plans for her engagement to Nolan were already in motion, thanks to Norwood's efforts. Their engagement party was only days away.

Every goal she had set her sights on was finally within reach.

Once she married into the Stewart family, she would make the Brooks family pay.

A soft vibration interrupted her thoughts. Her phone flashed with a message.

"Darleen Faulkner is awake."

Lainey nearly lost her.composure.

Darleen? Wasn't that girl supposed to be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life? How could she suddenly come back from the brink?

This was a problem, a serious one. Jaw tight, Lainey clenched her fists, steeling herself.

She would have to take care of Darleen before secrets started to slip out.

Some truths needed to stay buried.

A few strategic tears later, Lainey wrapped up the press conference and strode straight to her waiting car.

"Hospital. Now," she ordered.

"Right away, Miss Gilbert."

Meanwhile, Lillian sat quietly in the Maybach, her anger simmering. Watching Lainey bask in her victory,Lillian struggled to hold back tears. With Eleanor out of the picture, Lainey basked in the glow of her victory.

Lillian was weighed down by the thought that she wasn't even capable of standing up for her best friend and fighting for justice.

Ryland fired up the engine, glancing at his sister in the rearview mirror. "Don't lose hope just yet. We'll go to the Stewarts' first and see what Nolan intends to do."

Nolan had vanished into his room after yesterday's chaos, refusing food, water, or company.

That wasn't like him. It felt like the story wasn't over yet.

He hadn't shown any reaction to the press conference that day, and that was highly out of character for him.

A chance for things to take a different turn might still be waiting ahead.

By the time the siblings reached the Stewart family's residence, they discovered Nolan seated alone in the room, his expression drenched in quiet despair.

He was draped in a stark white outfit, the air of authority that usually surrounded him nowhere to be found.

A wave of sorrow washed over Lillian, so she tugged gently on Ryland's sleeve, urging him to speak for both of them.

She didn't trust her own voice, not when tears threatened to spill at any moment.

Ryland drew in a steadying breath and addressed Nolan, his words quiet but clear. "Nolan, Lainey's taken over the Benton family.Everyone can see her ambitions are out of control. What do we do now?"

For a moment, Nolan said nothing.

His eyes opened slowly, dark and unreadable, as if nothing could touch him.

"Two days from now, there's going to be a funeral for the Bentons. We will send someone to settle the engagement date. Lainey's about to become the official heiress," Nolan responded, voice devoid of warmth.

Shock and outrage crashed through Lillian. She broke away from Ryland and rushed toward Nolan, her voice shaking with pain. "Nolan, how can you be so cold? It's barely been a day since Eleanor's gone! Are you really going to marry the woman who destroyed her?"

Ryland jumped forward to pull his sister back, worry etched on his face.

Something about this didn't add up.

He knew Nolan. If Eleanor had truly died, Nolan would have torn the city apart by now.

There was no way he would just agree to get engaged to Lainey without a fight.

It was too strange.

Unless...

Unless Eleanor was still alive.

Maybe everything Nolan was doing was an elaborate act to soothe Lainey into a false sense of victory.

Maybe he wanted her so convinced of her own success that she wouldn't see her downfall coming until it was too late.

The more Ryland considered it, the more convinced he became that the truth was close at hand.

With fresh resolve, he took Lillian by the arm, guiding her out before she could cause any more of a scene."Nolan,I understand now."

Lillian stumbled behind her brother, bewildered. "What do you get? Ryland, what do you mean? Please, just tell me!"

Their voices faded as they disappeared down the hall.

Left alone in the room, Nolan closed his eyes once more and whispered under his breath, "Eleanor,I promise, I'Il make sure Lainey pays for everything she's done."
###Chapter 228 Did You Kill Them


At a hospital, Darleen was a mess of nerves.

She clutched at the nurse's white coat like her life depended on it. "Please, call Eleanor for me! Or Nolan...anyone! I'll repay you, I swear!"

She had to get the truth out before it was too late.

Lainey was a monster. She had swapped the DNA samples, stolen Eleanor's identity, and was after the Benton family's legacy. Her ruined state was all her doing.

The nurse flinched at Darleen's wild grip, her wrist turning red.

This woman had just woken up from a coma. Maybe she wasn't in her right mind?

"Calm down," the nurse murmured, trying to pry herself free. "I'll get the doctor, just wait..."

The door swung open, and before she couId even register who had walked in, two men in black suits grabbed her and shoved her aside.

The door slammed shut behind them with a heavy thud.

Lainey walked up to Darleen, twirling her freshly painted nails like she had all the time in the world.

The moment Darleen saw her face, her heart nearly stopped. Her pupils shrank, and her body trembled violently.

It was Lainey.

This devil had come back to finish her off.

Lainey smirked at the pale, weak woman on the bed.

"Well, well. Who would've guessed you had such a stubborn will to live? Even after rotting away like a vegetable, you still managed to crawl back." Darleen's hands shook as she fumbled for the glass of water on the bedside table.

She raised it with all the courage she could muster. "Stay back!" Her voice cracked.

Lainey actually laughed. To her, this little show of resistance was pathetic.

She didn't even bother with her usual sweet act anymore-the malice in her eyes was raw and bare.

"You know what?" Lainey's voice had that cruel sing-song edge, like she was about to share a juicy secret.
"Eleanor's dead. Burned to ashes in the Benton villa. And the Bentons? They're finished too."

Darleen's thoughts froze, her head ringing as if struck, the words refusing to make sense.

Eleanor...dead?

No. No,that wasn't possible.

She stared at Lainey in horror, her shock pushing aside even her fear. "Was it you? Didyou kill them?"

Lainey let out a laugh, merciless and cruel, the kind that could cut through skin.

Confidence radiated off her, and why wouldn't it?

Soon she would be Nolan's wife, holding power over both the Benton and the Stewart families.

With that kind of future waiting for her, what risk was there in taunting a dying woman?

"So what if it was me?" She sneered. "There's nothing left that can pin it on me anyway. And you know the best part?"

She leaned down, enjoying the fear in Darleen's eyes before twisting the knife further with her words."You won't be around much longer to tell anyone. Soon, you'll be gone too."

Her mocking smile fell away, replaced by a chilling coldness.

Slowly,she slipped a dagger from her handbag, its blade catching the dim light with a cruel gleam. Step by step, she closed in.

Darleen's breath hitched, her body trembling as she tried to shrink back. "NNo...stay away!" But she had only just woken from months of stillness. Her body was weak, fragile, and useless against the storm standing before her.

Lainey didn't hesitate.

She lunged and drove the dagger deep into Darleen's stomach.

A wet,sickening sound filled the room as blood burst out.

Darleen cried out, the glass slipping from her hand and shattering against the floor.

But Lainey wasn't finished. Her fury boiled over, and she stabbed again and again.

If this woman hadn't existed, none of her plans would have gone wrong. Her rage fueled her arm as she stabbed without restraint, convinced Darleen deserved every ounce of pain.

Panting, she grabbed a fistful of Darleen's hair, yanking her head back, and dragged the blade across her pale face.

One cut, then another, until the features were gone, replaced by a mask of blood.

Finally, she stepped back, with a sick grin stretching her lips. Victory had never tasted sweeter.
###Chapter 229 Norwood Wants To See You


The nurse, her mouth clamped shut by a bodyguard's hand, was so terrified her body gave out completely,and she even wet her pants.

What had she just seen? Lainey, covered in blood, murdering someone right in front of her!

Lainey finally turned, as though only now realizing the nurse's presence.

Her face was streaked with Darleen's blood, her lips curled into a twisted grin that made her look less like a woman and more like something dragged straight out of hell.

The nurse shook violently, tears and mucus streaking her face. Her muffled sobs broke free in desperate gasps as soon as the guard loosened his hold. "Please... don't kill me. I, I won't tell anyone... please."

Lainey cocked her head, feigning innocence as she smiled sweetly."Oh,, I don't mind letting you live. But you'll have to do a little something for me."

Half an hour later, the nurse's trembling hands clutched a clipboard as she handed over the forged medical file.

Her voice cracked as she spoke.

"It's... it's done. Just like you said, it claims Miss Faulkner regained consciousness unstable... and... and that she killed herself."

Lainey skimmed the page, a satisfied smirk tugging at her lips.

She dropped the bood-soaked dagger on the floor, then calmly wiped her hands clean with a wet tissue.

With a small signal to one of her bodyguards, she turned on her heel and walked out as if she had just left a fashion show instead of a slaughterhouse.

The bodyguard caught her meaning instantly. The moment the door shut behind Lainey, he drew a knife and, without hesitation, slit the nurse's throat.

Then he wiped the blade and followed after her.

However, neither of them noticed that, hidden behind the curtains, a man had been filming the entire scene on a cellphone.

Once the coast was clear, the man slipped into the room in a hurry.

What greeted him was a nightmare. Darleen and the nurse sprawled on the floor, both lying in their own blood,already long gone.

He quickly pulled out his phone and made the call.

"Erick, it's confirmed. Lainey killed Darleen and a nurse. I've got the whole thing on video."

Within seconds, the report traveled through Erick to Nolan.

Hearing it, Nolan slowly raised his eyes, a chilling smile tugging at his lips. Lainey's game was almost over.

Right then, footsteps echoed from outside the room.

Wray walked in, his eyes dark with resentment, though he forced himself to keep a respectfultone."Nolan,Norwood wants to see you."

Inside,his chest burned with bitterness. If Eleanor hadn't suddenly died, if Norwood hadn't decided to hand Nolan another chance, the general manager's seat at Stewart Group would have been his.

That power, that title...it had been within his grasp, only to be stolen away. How could he not resent Nolan for it?

Nolan slowly stood up, dusting off his clothes like they had collected dirt. His calm eyes gave nothing away as he prepared to leave.

Then Wray stepped right into his path. A smug smirk curled his lips, convinced he had the upper hand."Don't think you're untouchable. Eleanor's gone, and you've already let Norwood down. He'll never really trust you again." Nolan paused,still as composed as ever.

Beside him, Erick wiped at the sweat gathering at his brow. Wray had no idea he was poking a lion with a stick.

Nolan didn't even bother looking at Wray.

His voice was light and dismissive, yet it cut deep. "Because Grandpa tossed you a few crumbs of favor,you think you're important?"

And with that, he brushed past without another glance.

Wray's face burned red with rage.

How dared a man who had already fallen out of favor act so high and mighty?

One day, when power was in his hands, he would crush Nolan completely.

In the grand hall, Norwood sat upright in his chair, his expression dark and severe.

When Nolan entered, Norwood raised his eyes and motioned for him to sit.

"The Bentons' funeral is the day after tomorrow," Norwood said."As for your marriage with Lainey, if you don't wish to attend, then-"

Nolan cut in smoothly, "I'll be there."

Norwood's hand halted midair, the coffee cup trembling slightly before he set it down.

His eyes fixed on Nolan as he tried to read him.

What was this about?

Only a few days ago, Nolan had looked like he would throw his life away for Eleanor. And now, this sudden shift inattitude?

Still, if he was willing to go through with it, then it was good news.

After all, a marriage with the Bentons would only strengthen their position. Still, if he was willing to go through with it, then it was good news.

After all, a marriage with the Bentons would only strengthen their position.

Norwood allowed himself a small breath of relief, assuming Nolan had finally seen reason.
###Chapter 230 Give Nolan The Engagement Ring


The Bentons' funeral was held at the most famous church in the city.

The guests in attendance were all from powerful families, every face set in solemn respect.

To those who didn't know, it could have been mistaken for a state funeral.

In the crowd of mourners draped in black, Lainey was impossible to miss. She wore an elegant black designer gown, with sparkling jewelry on her neck and wrists.

Her makeup was flawless, not a trace of grief on her face. Instead, her expression carried a quiet smugness,as though the day belonged to her.

And in a way, it did. Jeff and his wife's assets had fallen neatly into her hands. She had been waiting for this moment, and now it was finally hers.

Her silent gloating was interrupted when someone exclaimed, "The Stewvart family has arrived."

Her smug smile vanished in an instant.

She hurried forward, her tone soft, almost timid, as she greeted the man at the lead."Norwood."

Then her eyes shifted, locking onto the figure just behind him. "Nolan."

Norwood took in her timid, lonely appearance and couldn't help but feel a wave of sympathy for her.

He reached out, gently patting her hand. "You've been through a great deal, my dear. These days must have been hard."

Lainey offered a few weak nods, murmuring her thanks, but her attention had already slipped past him. Erick held a small box.

Her heart gave a leap. Was it a ring box?

The thought alone sent a thrill through her, her pulse quickening with greed. Around them, guests whispered among themselves, their voices a low hum.
"Lainey's fortune is unbelievable. Losing her parents and now set to marry into the Stewarts."
"Right? She'll be the president of the Benton Group and Nolan's wife. What more could anyone ask for?""Some people are just born lucky."
The jealous stares from the crowd fed Lainey's ego, making her feel untouchable.
This was it-her moment of victory. She had finally beaten them all, even Eleanor, who was no longer around to compete with her.
Norwood cleared his throat, and the murmurs around the hall died instantly.
He hadn't just come to mourn. He was here to seal the alliance before the public eye. "Give Nolan the engagement ring."
Erick approached Nolan, presenting the ring box with both hands.
Lainey's pulse raced as her eyes fell on the box.
Once she accepted Nolan's proposal of marriage, she would be his fiancée.
Lainey tilted her head shyly, sneaking a glance at Nolan, waiting for him to accept the ring.
But Nolan didn't move.
His fingers tapped lightly on the edge of the box, his face giving away nothing.
Norwood's brows knit together. Could his grandson be hesitating now, at such a crucial moment?
Lainey's chest tightened. A ripple of unease.spread through her, smothering the joy she had worn just moments ago.
Why wasn't he taking it?
Was he having second thoughts? The silence thickened until Nolan suddenly let out a low chuckle. The sound was soft, almost playful,but his smile didn't reach his eyes.

"Before we move forward," he said, his gaze locking onto Lainey's anxious face, "there's somethingl′dlike to give you. Consider it a 'gift!."

A gift?

Lainey blinked in surprise before the meaning sank in.

Of course, an engagement gift. He must be planning to present her with something special,in front of everyone.

Maybe a piece of priceless jewelry, or a share transfer.

Her worries melted away, replaced by a flush of excitement. Whatever it was, it would only add to her glory.
###Chapter 231 I'll End You Right Here!


Nolan didn't spare Lainey another look.

Instead, he gave Erick a faint nod, who immediately caught the signal and lifted the small remote in his hand and pressed it.

With a faint whir, a white screen unrolled at the front- of the hall, and the projector blinked to life. Soon enough, a video appeared, clear for everyone to see.

It showed a hospital room, where Lainey was holding a woman by the hair and slashing her face again and again with a dagger.

Her crazed grin and twisted expression made her look nothing like the refined socialite everyone thought she was.

Watching the scene, gasps exploded through the mourners.

"Is that Lainey?"

"Did she actually kill someone?"

Lainey's eyes locked on the screen, her blood running cold.

No,this couldn't be real.

Where did this come from?

Who fiImed it?

Her mind screamed denial, but her lips faltered before she shrieked, "No! No, this is fake! It's a setup!Someone used Al to create this!"

Before the murmurs could settle, another voice boomed across the hall.

"And what about the fire in my house?" Everyone froze.

The voice belonged to Jeff. The man who was supposed to be dead walked through the doors, calm and commanding.

As the guests instinctively stepped back, a path opened wide.

And down that path came not just Jeff, but Hilda... alive, radiant despite everything. And behind them was Eleanor.

The three of them, alive and breathing, walked straight into the hall.

The room exploded with disbelief. How? The fire had consumed everything. How could they have possibly survived?

Lainey's head spun, and her mouth worked faster than her brain. Before she could stop herself,she blurted,"Dad... Mom...you're supposed to be dead!"

The words dropped like a bomb in the hall.

Her face drained instantly when she realized what had just slipped out.

Scrambling to cover her tracks, she shot a finger at Eleanor and shrieked like a madwoman, "This is all your doing!"

Then, as if to erase her blunder, she stumbled forward and clutched Jeff's hand with a pitiful expression."Dad,thank heavens you're alright."

But Jeff recoiled instantly and yanked his hand away as if her touch burned. The look he shot her was pure disgust. "You really wanted me and Hilda gone, didn't you? So you could snatch everything we worked for!"

"Dad, what? No,what are you even saying?" Lainey stuttered, trying to keep her composure.

Jeff gave a cruel laugh, his voice cold and sharp. "Lainey Gilbert, your acting's gone on long enough. It's pathetic."	=

Right then, Hilda, her eyes blazing with anger, came forward. She pulled out a stack of papers from her bag and flung them at Lainey. They smacked her square in the face.

"DNA results," Hilda spat. "They prove you're not our daughter. Eleanor is. Always was."

Her chest heaved as she glared at Lainey. "And I heard you on the phone with the bastard who set our house on fire."

Eleanor moved up beside her, her tone cutting and cold. "Horace from the Fist Guild already spilled it all. He admitted you paid him to mess with the DNA reports. Lainey, you've run out of excuses. Everything's out in the open now."

The hall broke out in shocked whispers.

"She's been lying this,whole time?"

"She didn't just pretend to bé Jeff's daughter, she actually tried to burn them alive. What kind of monster does that?"

"Exactly. If Jeff and his wife had really died, Lainey would've gained everything. The way she plotted it all out is terrifying."

"And that video earlier... she killed someone! She's insane!"

Lainey's ears buzzed as the room closed in around her.

Her carefully built life, being Nolan's wife, inheriting the Bentons' wealth, being envied by everyone-it was all slipping through her fingers.

And in her mind, one name burned brighter than anything else. Eleanor.

That bitch had ruined everything.

In that moment, her grip on reality snapped.

Her eyes went bloodshot, her face contorted with madness. She let out a wild, piercing scream and charged straight at Eleanor with a knife.

"If I can't have it, neither can you! Eleanor, I'll end you right here!" Eleanor's gaze hardened.

She braced herself, ready to move, but before she could react, a figure darted in front of her, shielding her completely.

It was Hilda.

Eleanor froze, horror ripping through her chest. Her cry tore out, raw and desperate."No!"
###Chapter 232 We Made It Out Alive, Didn't We


Nolan swung his long leg with precision, kicking Lainey squarely in the stomach

She went flying,crashing hard into a nearby table.

The guests gasped, stepping back in shock at the sudden violence.

Eleanor was quick to move, supporting Hilda as she checked her over. "Are you okay?" she asked.

Jeff moved forward as well, his eyes scanning both women with concern. Any slip could be disastrous.

Just then, from outside the church, the wail of approaching police sirens cut through the tense silence.

Lainey stiffened.

No. She couldn't be caught, not now. If she ended up in police custody, everything she had schemed for would collapse.

Driven by sheer survival instinct, she struggled to her feet, ignoring the pain, and bolted toward a chosen escape route.

Erick's gaze went icy. With a sharp gesture to the bodyguards behind him, he commanded, "Get her!"

Instantly, several figures lunged forward, pursuing her through the hall and out into the streets.

Meanwhile,Eleanor lifted her head, scanning the crowd. And then her eyes locked with a pair of unreadable,familiar ones.

Time seemed to pause.

Nolan stepped forward, and in front of everyone, he pulled Eleanor into a tight embrace.

The grip was strong enough to make her slightly uncomfortable, but she understood that he was terrified of losing her again. As she noticed his tremor, Eleanor's lips curved into a soft smile. She patted his back gently. "Calm down.I'm fine,see?"
Slowly, he released her, his eyes tracing her face inch by inch before finally settling on her bandaged arm.
His relief vanished instantly, replaced by sharp concern. "Doctor! Where's the doctor?" he demanded.
Still holding her carefully by the waist, he guided her toward the nearby bench, his movements protective,as though any misstep could spell disaster.
Eleanor sighed and didn't fight as Nolan led her away.
Hilda's eyes followed her daughter nervously.
She felt like if she looked away for even a second, her long-lost daughter might disappear again.
Norwood, leaning on his cane, walked slowly forward.
A lifetime of experience hadn't prepared him for moments like this. Today, for the first time, he found himself played by a young woman like Lainey.
He glanced at Jeff with a soft expression. "Jeff, I'm glad you and your wife are safe."
Jeff nodded slightly, keeping his calm, professional demeanor.
"Thank you, Norwood. Things are hectic here. I'Il have someone escort you to rest. I'll visit properly another day."
Norwood nodded slightly, realizing this was the Benton family's problem and not his place to stay. He quietly followed the servants away.
Soon after, Nolan's private doctor arrived and began inspecting Eleanor's arm wound.
Nolan stayed close, his presence commanding, eyes locked on her scorched skin.
When the doctor finally set down his tweezers, he spoke with reassurance. "Mr. Stewart, it's nothing serious. Just a surface burn, the area is small, and it hasn't reached the deeper tissues. With proper care and keeping it clean and dry, it will heal quickly without leaving scars." Nolan finally allowed himself to relax a fraction, though seeing the redness and swelling still made his chest tighten.

This was on him.

He should have protected her better.

Eleanor noticed the tension in his face and found it somewhat amusing. "Really, after what we went through,a little burn is nothing. We made it out alive, didn't we?"

She remembered the fire, the terror, and the near-death experience.

Being safe and alive now felt like a miracle, and that was all that mattered to her.
###Chapter 233 | Will Make Things Right


Nolan's eyes darkened as he sat beside Eleanor.

He stared straight into her eyes.

"What really happened?" he asked, his voice rough. "And what about those remains they found in the fire?"

Eleanor lowered her gaze and told him everything clearly.

"Lainey tricked me. She called me, saying my parents were trapped in the house. When I got there, thefire was already raging. I found my parents and was about to get them out when three men appeared.Lainey must have sent them. I managed to stop them and got them out through the back before the house collapsed. Then we made it back to my apartment."

Nolan's eyes narrowed as he understood immediately.

The remains at the fire weren't the Bentons and Lainey-they were the three men Lainey sent.

She hadn't just tried to burn Jeff and Hilda alive. She wanted to kill Eleanor too. Ruthless. Heartless.

A dangerous intensity flared in Nolan's eyes.

He wouldn't let Lainey get away with this.

Eleanor felt the vengeance radiating off him.

She gently pressed her forehead to his, and spoke softly. "I hate her too, but you don't need to deal with her personally. Even if she left no trace in the Benton family's estate, the hospital incident, killing those two people, can't be ignored. She'll face justice this time."

She paused and added softly, "It's not worth dirtying your hands for her."

Nolan felt his anger ease a little.

He kissed the corner of her mouth and murmured, "Alright." Their quiet moment was broken by Hilda's footsteps.

They pulled back and sat properly.

After a few more knocks, Hilda rushed over, panic all over her face."Eleanor!"

Hilda hurried to her, holding her hands and looking her over from head to toe."Are you okay? Did Lainey hurt you? Are you dizzy or in pain anywhere?"

Jeff came right behind Hilda, looking conflicted.

He knew this mess was his fault. He hadn't recognized his own daughter, and allowed Lainey to manipulate everything.

The weight of guilt pressed down on him.

He had even caused Eleanor pain because of Lainey's schemes.

Eleanor was so overwhelmed she couldn't find the words.

She tried to pull her hand back instinctively, but Hilda's grip tightened.

"I'm fine, Mrs. Benton," Eleanor replied quietly, her tone distant, almost detached.

Hilda froze, worry fading slowly as she looked at Eleanor.

Then her lips trembled. "Sweetie, you won't even call me Mom?"

It hurt Hilda to hear it.

She and Jeff had failed Eleanor for so many years, leaving her alone to struggle and suffer.

So asking her to forgive and accept them immediately was too much.

Tears streamed down Hilda's face as guilt and sorrow took over.

Jeff moved closer, hands shaking as he steadied Hilda, who wobbled under the weight of her emotions.

Eleanor didn't even acknowledge Hilda,let alone him. His voice shook as he spoke, "Eleanor, I was the one who failed you. I trusted Lainey and caused you so much pain. You have every right not to accept us."

He looked into her clear eyes, and his heart ached with regret. "I promise, I will make things right. I've even arranged for an official statement to be released, telling everyone that you're our real daughter."
###Chapter 234 Am | Heartless


Eleanor stayed quiet, her chest tight with feelings she couldn't quite put into words.

Family. Parents. Those wwere the things she had dreamed of for so many lonely nights, the things she had wished for more than anything else.

And now, with the truth finally laid out in front of her. A connection that should have been hers twenty years ago, she felt... nothing. Not joy, not relief. Just a strange numbness, like watching life happen from the outside.

She couldn't shake the memory of Jeff doting on Lainey and taking her side even when she made mistakes

The way he had loved Lainey used to make Eleanor ache with envy.

But it wasn't real love; it was favoritism disguised as affection. It ignored reality, blurred the lines, and excused behavior that shouldn't have been excused.	。

After a long pause, Eleanor finally lifted her eyes.

"Mr. Benton," she said softly, but there was a firmness that couldn't be ignored. "I'm not coming back to your family. I can't respect the way you favor certain children. If reconnecting means turning a blind eye to what's right, I won't take part. And as for who I am... please, don't tell anyone."

She bowed to Jeff and his wife, deliberately and with finality.

When she stood up, she didn't look their way again and walked straight out of the church.

Nolan, without a second thought,followed her.

Jeff and Hilda didn't deserve respect not until Eleanor could forgive them. If it weren't for them,she wouldn't have been through all this.

The church was heavy with silence. Hilda's sobs stopped, leaving her staring blankly at the door, drained to the bone.

Jeff remained frozen, unable to move.

Eleanor's words hit him like a series of crushing blows.

She was right.

That was exactly how he had treated Lainey.

He thought he was making up to her, but in truth, he had sided with a villain and pushed his own daughter away.

If they forced Eleanor to accept them now, it wouldn't be love. It would just be another demand,proving her point and further ruining their bond.

He and Hilda exchanged a look, seeing the sorrow mirrored in each other's eyes.

A distance had grown between them and Eleanor.

They were filled with regret, strong regret, but it was too late.

From that moment on, all they could do was give everything, hoping she might one day turn back and notice them.

At the church entrance, Eleanor paused as if hearing his footsteps.

Her figure, framed in light, seemed smaller than before, lonely in a way that made the air around her feel still. "You knew they were my real parents?" she asked.

Nolan's gaze dropped, and he stepped closer. He didn't try to hide it and replied honestly, "I found out the day of our engagementparty."

Eleanor stayed there, silent.

After a moment, she turned just a little, glancing at the man beside her, confusion flickering in her eyes.

"Am I heartless?" she asked softly. After all, Jeff and Hilda were her biological parents, the ones she had waited for over twenty years.

And yet, she couldn't bring herself to accept them.

The way they spoiled Lainey, their blind favoritism, made her feel like she couldn't face them.

This long-overdue family bond... she simply couldn't embrace it yet.

Nolan's chest tightened at the sight of her struggle.

This stubborn girl always blamed herself.

Did she ever stop to consider the pain others had caused her?

He lifted his hand and softly touched her face, his fingers grazing her soft skin. "Eleanor, you've always been the best."

She had been lost in her own thoughts when his words came out of nowhere, leaving her momentarily speechless.

She felt like laughing at the absurdity of it all.

Pushing his hand away, she was ready to walk away, but Nolan didn't let her go. He wrapped his arms around her from behind, his chin resting lightly on her shoulder.

His hug was warm and filled with a quiet reassurance. "Don't worry," he murmured. "You'll always have me."

Slowly, the tension in her body eased.

She wasn't alone anymore.

Not really.

She had Nolan.

And whether she accepted the Bentons or not, she wasn't facing life by herself.

Just then, hurried footsteps broke through the moment. Erick came rushing from the corner, with papers in hand. He froze when he saw the two of them locked in an embrace at the entrance.

His heart sank.

Had he come at the worst possible moment?

Would Nolan throw him out in anger?

Ah,he wished he could disappear on the spot.

Standing there awkwardly, neither able to step forward nor retreat, he finally cleared his throat.

"Boss, Lainey's been caught. She's just been handed over to the police."

Eleanor's cheeks turned bright red as she quickly pulled herself out of Nolan's arms.

The warmth of the moment broke, Nolan's face turning cold as his eyes cut sharply toward Erick.

That look alone made Erick shiver.

"I see." Nolan's voice carried a chilling edge. "Hire the top lawyers. Lainey must answer for what she's done,and make sure the punishment is death."

"I'm on it, sir!" Erick practically salivated at the relief of being spared.

Clutching the documents, he hurried off in a rush, as though escaping from disaster itself.
###Chapter 235 This Isn't Fair At All!


A burst of engine noise announced their arrival as Eleanor and Nolan pulled up at the villa in Regal Heights only for a striking purple convertible to zip in and park right in front of them.

Lillian barely waited for the car to stop before flinging open the door and dashing out.

She had rushed over the second she heard the whole story, dragging Ryland along with her.

When she spotted Eleanor, bright-eyed and very much alive, Lillian's emotions got the better of her. Without a word, she wrapped her arms tightly around her friend.

"Eleanor! Do you know how worried you made me?" Lillian exclaimned, her voice trembling.

A gentle warmth spread through Eleanor as she hugged Lillian back. Softly, she reassured her, "I'm really okay."

From a short distance away, Nolan watched the reunion, his expression tightening.

He waited quietly for a moment before reaching out, almost protectively, to draw Eleanor away from Lillian's grasp.

Still caught up in the moment, Lillian was unaware of the way Nolan glared at her.

She drew in a steady breath before turning to Eleanor, her expression burning with resentment. "Lainey's completely out of control. It's a good thing she's finally been dealt with, or who knows what else she might've done to you?"

Mid-sentence, something suddenly clicked in Lillian's mind. Her eyes widened in disbelief. "But I had no idea you were actuallythe Benton family's daughter!"

Ryland looked equally shocked, unable to hide his surprise.

As she heard the Benton family name, Eleanor's mood shifted ever so slightly. That was all it took for Nolan's patience to wear thin; memories Eleanor would rather forget were surfacing,and he wasted no time in steeringthe Brooks siblings away.

"If there's nothing more you need to say, I think it's time for you both to head home," Nolan said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Not waiting for a response, he slipped an arm around Eleanor's waist and led her toward the front door.

Just before they went inside, Nolan shot Ryland a meaningful look, silently urging him to get Lillian moving.

Ryland caught on right away and rushed to stop his sister from saying anything more. "We shouldn't stick around.Give them a little space; they deserve it. You can always drop by and see Eleanor another time,"he said.

Lillian slammed her foot against the ground, her voice rising with frustration. "Eleanor's my best friend! Are you saying I need to set an appointment just to see her? That's absurd! I've known her way before he ever came along. This isn't fair at all!"

Ryland took Lillian's hand, offering a deal she couldn't ignore. "If you don't leave with me right now,you'll lose your allowance next month. But if you come home with me, I'll tack on an extra million."

And surely, money could never convince Lillian to leave her friend behind.

Yet, when she saw Ryland's determined expression, she finally gave in and slid into the car with a reluctant sigh.

The moment the Brooks siblings drove off, Nolan felt certain no one else would interrupt his time alone with Eleanor.

But just as he leaned in to kiss her, Eleanor's phone blared, cutting through the quiet.

Betsy's name flashed across the screen.

Eleanor hit the answer button, and immediately, Besty's enthusiastic voice exploded through the phone,barely audible over the background commotion.

"Eleanor! I can't tell you how relieved I am that you're safe!" Besty exclaimed, nearly shouting. Besty's nerves had been completely frayed with worry.

Learning Eleanor's survival washed all that worry away.

Hardly stopping to catch her breath, Besty rushed into her next report. "The second word got out that you're alive, our stores started selling out nonstop. Some products are already gone from the shelves! Could you come over and help us handle the restocking and arrange the new arrivals?"

Eleanor paused for a beat, unsure what to say.

Almost instinctively, she glanced over at Nolan.

His expression could only be described as wounded, like a loyal dog watching its owner walk out the door.

But after weighing it over, Eleanor decided to say yes. "Alright, I'lI come by soon," she replied.

Once the call ended, she couldn't resist shooting Nolan a look.

Did he honeśtly need to behave as if she were disappearing for good? She was just leaving for a short while.

Nolan looked on the verge of losing his composure.

He silently vowed not to forget the name Besty anytime soon.

Even though he hated the idea, he went to grab the car keys without protest.
###Chapter 236 I Didn't Kill Anyone!


With fervent backing from supporters, Enigma's sales skyrocketed by ten percent, immediately claiming the title of the season's most coveted brand.

By the day of Lainey's public trial, half a month afterwards, the chatter around the case had not dimmed.

A sharp rap from the judge's gavel signaled the official commencement of proceedings.

The bailiff guided Lainey to the defendant's bench with firm hands.

She was clad in a standard prison uniform, her hair hanging dull and yellow, her face exhausted and hollow-her former radiant beauty completely vanished.

When she lifted her eyes, Eleanor and Nolan appeared in the gallery, their expressions detached. Jeff and his wife sat nearby, anger etched across their features.

Hatred blazed in Lainéy's gaze.

Everything pointed to Eleanor!

Without Eleanor's interference, she would have married Nolan and inherited the Benton fortune by now.

Eleanor had destroyed her entire future.

Rage consumed Lainey, leaving her trembling and unrestrained. "Eleanor! You wretch! You'll pay for this!"she shrieked.

Two bailiffs gripped her firmly; otherwise, she might have lunged forward.

"Quiet!" The judge slammed his gavel forcefully, his tone sharp and commanding.

Nolan's lawyer rose, presenting a hefty bundle of documents to the bench.

"Your Honor, my client accuses Lainey Gilbert of financial corruption, orchestrating Darleen's murder, and falsifying DNA paternity results. The proof is undeniable. We respectfully request the court's judgment." The judge skimmed the papers briefly before addressing the defendant. "Miss Gilbert, the plaintiff has submitted accusations.How do you plead?"

Lainey seemed disconnected, lost within her own chaotic thoughts.

Avoiding accountability, she launched into a frantic monologue. "I didn't do anything! I didn't kill anyone!That hateful Darleen! She envied me constantly, blackmailing me after my return to the Benton family. She even hired people to torment me! I had no choice but to end her! I'm the real victim!"

She continued, "The DNA test? The Benton family ran it themnselves and accepted the outcome. How does that implicate me?"

Her words tumbled out wildly, each sentence a desperate attempt to frame herself as innocent.

Hearing her frantic claims, the plaintiff lawyer calmly repositioned his gold-rimmed spectacles and gestured for his assistant to display a video before the court.

It showed the unedited sequence of Lainey mercilessly killing Darleen in the hospital room.

Her face twisted with fury, the repeated stabs leaving horrifying marks, each movement brutal and deliberate.

What depth of hatred could push someone to mutilate a woman repeatedly, even after death?

A nurse, entirely innocent, also suffered under her violent grip.

The audience gasped audibly at the gruesome footage.

The plaintiff lawyer's voice cut sharply through the courtroom. "Miss Gilbert, do you still claim to be the victim?"

He paused, then commanded, "Bring in the witness."

A bailiff soon escorted a trembling man forward.

Fear drained his knees, leaving him shaking uncontrollably like a leaf caught in the wind.

At the sight of Lainey, he collapsed entirely, voice quivering as he confessed. "I plead guilty! | admit everything I did! Lainey Gilbert ordered it! She forced me to murder that nurse! She orchestrated everything -it isn't my responsibility!"

Panic overtook Lainey.

This man had worked under Horace previously, tasked with doing her dirty work for her.

How had authorities discovered his involvement as wvell?

She was doomed.
###Chapter 237 I Haunt You Eternaly!


Lainey rotuggd to surrender.

She thrashed violently, shiriekirig und Her volce brdks with hysterfa.

"No!I didny do tt!" she shouted. "Thls ts a lle! You'ro setting me e양!"

Her gaze locked onto the kneeling man, 'blazing with desperate intenslty.

"Who put you up to this?" she stopped fust short of narning Eleanor aloud.

"Quiet!" The judge, growing intolerant of further disruptions, struck the gavel and flxed Lainey with a stern stare. "The evidence cannot be disputed. What more remains to debate? If you continue to accuse others without proof, defamation oharges will follow!°

He declared a ten-minute break, allowing the panel to deliberate before rendering the verdict.

At thls, Lainey's energy drained completely, and she collapsed into the defendant's chair,paralyzed by fear.

Before the trial began, the Gilbort family's lawyer had repeatedly urged her to deflect responsibility,insisting she claim coercion had forcod her hand.

That way, she might endure prison but still preserve her life.

She did not want to die; she genuinely feared death.

From the spectator seats, voices rose in sharp condemnation.

"Who would've imagined? She seems harmless but hides a cruel heart."

"Exactly.She nearly destroyed Enigma. Serves her perfectly!"

"Justice will triumph!"

Desperation clawed at Lainey as she scanned the room, clinging to the tiniest spark of hope. Her eyes fell on Jeff, seated prominently in the front row.

A flicker of relief lit her expression. She stared pleadingly, silently begging for aid.

He had once cherished her, treating her like a daughter.

Now, his gaze returned nothing but revulsion.

If not for this malicious woman, he wouldn't have confused her for his real child, losing precious time with the daughter he truly loved.

Because of Lainey, Eleanor still refused to call him Dad.

He longed to strip Lainey of everything, caring nothing for her survival.

When she saw Jeff remain unmoved, Lainey's last fragile hope disintegrated.

Rage engulfed her, and all pent-up resentment erupted violently.

"You stubborn, foolish man!" she screamed toward him. "Everything is your fault! Had you not taken me in,would I suffer like this now? Every one of you deserves death! I'll haunt you eternally!"

Eleanor's lips curved faintly, a cold smile forming in response to the frenzy.

She tilted her head slightly and spoke, voice smooth yet chilling. "You misunderstand: Considering the atrocities you've committed, haunting us might not even be possible."

The ten-minute break ended abruptly.

The judge returned, and the courtroom rose, weighted with solemn tension.

Lainey trembled uncontrollably.

The judge lifted the verdict, preparing to announce it, when an unassuming man in the crowd, hat pulled low, spoke. "Your Honor, I believe Lainey Gilbert is not a citizen of this nation."

Nolan's gaze tightened with intensity, and the judge's words froze midair.

This fact had been overlooked entirely. The judge scanned the files quickly, his expression shifting with each page.

Documents confirmed that after studying abroad, Lainey had obtained Zerovia citizenship.

According to Daulcan law, foreigners could not receive the death penalty unless involved in extreme offenses, like drug trafficking.

Lainey, who had been shaking with dread, suddenly erupted into manic laughter.

She wasn't finished.

She leveled a defiant stare at Eleanor and Nolan.

Despite their wishes, she had survived this battle.

Nolan and Eleanor held their silence, eyes tracing the voice's source, but the man had vanished completely.

Following an urgent consultation with the Zerovia embassy, the court adhered to international extradition and trial agréements.

Lainey was convicted on multiple counts but sentenced to life imprisonment instead of execution.

The courtroom erupted in disbelief. Anger and outrage filled the gallery as voices clamored in protest.
###Chapter 238 Long Time No See, My Dear Brother


Eleanor could hardly believe it.

Lainey had slipped through the noose. With Zerovia citizenship as her shield, she had managed one last cunning escape.

Eleanor's eyes followed as court officers dragged Lainey away. She was still screaming, refusing to accept prison. Eleanor's face remained calm; she was untouched by the scene.

Execution would have been quick, almost merciful.

But a life behind iron bars was a slower torment. Each passing day would strip Lainey of hope, until despair consumed her completely.

In truth, that fate might be far crueler than death.

Eleanor turned away and walked toward the courthouse doors. Beside her stood the renowned lawyer.She gave him a polite nod."Thank you for your effort."

The man pushed his gold-rimmed glasses higher, his tone respectful."You're welcome. I only followed Mr.Stewart's instructions."

He bowed his head slightly. "I still have other matters to handle, so I'll take my leave."

With that, he blended into the crowd, vanishing with his briefcase in hand.

Eleanor lingered, scanning the faces around her. She searched instinctively for Nolan.

He had disappeared the moment the trial ended.

She had no idea where he had gone.

As her thoughts wandered, a soft voice called to her, "Eleanor."

She turned and met Hilda's gentle eyes, brimming with motherly affection. Jeff stood nearby, his gaze complicated-part guilt, part worry, and a faint hope for forgiveness.

Hilda stepped closer, reaching for Eleanor's hand. "Why don't you come home for dinner tonight? I'll make everything myself.I already bought the ingredients for your favorite dishes."

Her tone carried a trace of caution.

Eleanor glanced at the hand extended toward her. Almost without thinking, she stepped back, avoiding the touch.

The movement was slight, yet it struck Hilda and Jeff like a knife to the heart.

To Eleanor, their sudden warmth only stirred unease.

She had long grown used to solitude, to carrying her burdens alone.

Careful kindness now felt heavy, almost foreign.

Lowering her gaze, she hid her emotions. "Thank you, Mrs. Benton. That's thoughtful. But I already have plans to eat with Lillian tonight, so I won't trouble you."

Her voice was steady, giving nothing away.

With that, she turned and walked out of the courthouse.

Hilda's hand lingered in the air, her eyes misting.

Jeff rushed to steady her, his chest tightening as he watched Eleanor's figure retreat.

They had wounded her too deeply. Over two decades of absence couldn't be erased in a single night. They had pushed her away themselves, and now reaching for her again was anything but simple.

Outside the courthouse, the cold wind cleared Eleanor's restless thoughts.

On the stone steps, she pulled out her phone, ready to call Nolan.

Her finger hovered over the familiar number-then froze.

Not far ahead, by the marble pillars, stood two men. One was tall, composed, carrying the quiet authority she knew so well-Nolan.

The other wore a black baseball cap, brim low to hide his face.

He leaned slightly forward, his posture edged with provocation, as if taunting Nolan.

Eleanor started to move toward them.

Just then, the man in the cap gave a low laugh.

Lifting his head, he revealed sharp brows and a smug smile. His eyes locked on Eleanor before sliding back to Nolan. "Long time no see, my dear brother."

The voice was the same one that had exposed Lainey's nationality in court.

Eleanor's eyes narrowed.

Nolan only had one brother.

So the man was Colson's illegitimate son-Brodie Stewart.
###Chapter 239 Does Grandpa Know You Returned


Eleanor remained silent, choosing to observe from a quiet corner.

Nolan caught sight of her, gave a faint nod, then returned his focus to the figure standing across from him,the half-brother he hadn't seen in years.

The last memory Nolan had of Brodie stretched back to-their shared childhood.

Colson had arrived at the Stewart family's residence with his mistress and Brodie, barely six months younger than Nolan. Norwood had immediately expelled them, declaring they would never set foot in the country again.

Seventeen years had passed since that fateful day.

And here Bródie was, standing in front of him.

Nolan had never truly clashed with Brodie personally, yet simply glimpsing the child of his father's mistress was enough to darken his mood entirely.

Eyes narrowing, Nolan fixed Brodie with a sharp, icy stare. "Does Grandpa know you returned?"

Brodie tilted his head and feigned innocence, shrugging lightly. "I've heard Grandpa's health isn't strong. As his grandson, isn't visiting expected? Don't you think it's cruel to phrase it like that?"

While talking, his gaze deliberately flicked toward Eleanor, standing just a few steps away, and he exhaled deeply."Ah, I understand. Your devotion belongs entirely to Miss Warren now, leaving neither Grandpa nor me any thought."

Her name reached Eleanor's ears, breaking her quietude.

She advanced gracefully, ignoring Brodie entirely. Without hesitation, she moved to Nolan's side and took his hand.,"Baby, it−1Szgetting late. We should head home."

When his eyes met hers, the tension in Nolan's jaw eased immediately. He inclined his head, letting Eleanor guide him toward the Bentley parked curbside.

The door clicked shut, and the black Bentley vanished swiftly around the corner.

Brodie stayed rooted, a faintly cryptic smile curving his lips.

Eleanor,was it?

Fascinating.

His attention shifted across the courtroom, where Kurt and Jonny, accompanied by others, hurried along with court officers toward a private visitation corridor.

If memory served,Jonny had once been Eleanor's husband.

The woman Nolan now protected so fiercely had been married to someone else before.

No wonder Norwood's temper flared constantly at the mere thought of their relationship.

As for Lainey, she possessed undeniable strength; wielded correctly, she could become a razor-sharp instrument in his plans, making her eventual rescue worthwhile.

But that matter could wait.

Brodie adjusted the brim of his baseball cap, concealing the scheming calculations in his eyes.

Determination hardened his expression-this time, he would reclaim everything rightfully his.

Inside the visitation room, only Kurt had arrived; Jonny had yet to enter.

Kurt's palms were clammy, and he could not remain seated, his nerves raw.

Despite the pain Lainey had caused recently, she remained his daughter, cherished for every moment of her life. The weight of her life sentence pressed heavily against his heart.

Lauryn, his wife, had fainted at the news andremained hospitalized.

Chaos had taken over completely. As these thoughts ran through him, the massive iron door swung open. Lainey entered, escorted by two female officers, her distress evident.

Kurt's chest tightened painfully.

He hurried to the visitation window, his voice trembling with urgency. "Lainey, sweetie! Don't worry, Dad's here.Dad's right here!"
###Chapter 240 You'll Drown In Torment!


Lainey's stare finally locked onto Kurt.

Her once-lifeless eyes ignited with fury the moment she realized who stood before her.

She leapt from her seat, stormed toward the thick glass barrier, and snatched the receiver.

"You incompetent fool! What kind of worthless lawyer did you send? Didn't you swear everything would work out? This was deliberate! You intended to make me suffer! Kurt, it's entirely your fault!"

Every shred of warmth inside Kurt's chest froze instantly.

Shock rendered him immobile, as if witnessing the little girl he had cherished for decades transform before his very eyes.

Was this truly the sweet, charming Lainey he had known?

Or had this ferocity always existed, hidden beneath her innocence, unseen until now?

His silence only convinced Lainey she had struck a nerve, fueling her rage further. "It's al because of you! lf you hadn't insisted on clinging to Denny so stubbornly, how could I have ended up trapped like this? I'm doomed to decay here forever! Every single day of my life!"

Her screams tore through the room, tears and mucus streaking her face in chaotic abandon. "I'd be better dead! I despise you! I despise you! Why couldn't you just die!"

Kurt's lips quivered, yet not a word emerged.

The daughter he had nurtured, spoiled, and loved above all else for more than twenty years now wished him gone?

A bone-deep chill spread fromn his feet to his heart.

She accused him. Had she truly believed he chose to abandon her? The child he had raised had left him for another family,and nobody could fathom the pain that caused him.

Even aware she belonged to the Benton family, he had swallowed his anguish to support her, providing funds generously so she could live comfortably.

And she? Every visit was met with cold rejection.

He remained ignorant of her past deeds overseas and her actions within the Benton household.

And now, she blamed him entirely.

Kurt's heart hardened, solid and unyielding.

All traces of paternal devotion vanished completely.

He cast one final, lingering glance toward her before pivoting and striding away.

Lainey's screams halted, replaced by frantic pleading."Dad, don't go! Please don't leave me. If you walk away, what will become of me?"

Only his firm back answered, unyielding.

Another voice, however, emerged from the doorway.

"Tsk, my dear ex-wife, how did you manage a life sentence?"

It was Jonny.

He approached the visiting window, his glare sharp. He grabbed the receiver and hissed through clenched teeth, "You made me lose Eleanor, and this is exactly what you deserve."

Lainey's anger flared like wildfire.

How dared a bankrupt loser, incapable of rescuing his own empire, lecture her?
-
Spitting toward him, her eyes blazed with disdain."Do you forget how you grovelled like a pitifui dog,begging me for cash? And now you dare lecture me?" Recounting past humiliations drove Jonny into a furious frenzy.

He had been humiliated by a fraud.

Shame clawed at him relentlessly.

The receiver trembled in his grip, as if he could crush her through it.

"You wretch! You'll pay for this! But it won't matter. Prison will consume you for the rest of your days! And I will ensure no peace reaches you inside those walls. You'll drown in torment!"

With a violent slam, he ended the call and stormed off.

Lainey erupted into madness.

She hurled herself against the glass, pounding, screaming relentlessly. "Jonny! Jonny! Return immediately!|swear, if I perish, I will haunt you endlessly and make every moment a nightmare! Jonny! Come back!"

She screaméd until visiting hours ended, but silence remained the only reply.



###Chapter 241 I've Already Arranged Someone To...
Inside the vehicle, silence pressed in.


Erick kept his hands steady on the wheel, glancing at Nolan's quiet figure through the mirror above.


Through the passing years, Nolan never once spoke of Colson, yet Erick recognized that name as the deepest scar lodged inside Nolan's chest.


Brodie's presence alone was like steel driven into that scar, an unyielding reminder of memories Nolan wished buried.



With Brodie suddenly back in the country, Erick sensed danger looming close.


He hesitated briefly, then broke the silence, saying,"Boss, I've already arranged someone to shadow Brodie."


Nolan gave a faint "Hmm," then added calmly,"Be sure Grandpa doesn't hear about this."


Grandpa had grown old, and after recent ordeals, his health carried too much fragility. Learning this truth would only weigh heavily upon him. Beside Nolan, Eleanor felt the coolness of his palm and instinctively clasped it tighter, her gaze colored with unease.



He caught that flicker of worry, and the chill he carried dissolved.Leaning playfully near her ear, he asked,"Eleanor, what did you just call me?"



For a heartbeat, she froze, remembering calling him "baby".



Heat rushed to her face, and she pushedhim lightly,muttering, "Sit straight."



Refusing to yield, Nolan teased further. "Say it again.Only once more,hmm?"



As the car eased to a halt before the villa in Regal Heights, Eleanor spotted her chance and swiftly pushed the door open, fleeing without a backward glance.



Amused, Nolan let out a soft laugh and chased after her.



At the entrance, their playful tussle ended with Eleanor's surrender.



Nolan lowered his chin onto her head, brushing her hair gently, voice dropping tenderly. "Eleanor, the last engagement banquet wasn't completed. Let's hold  another-this time flawless, no interruptions."



His heart longed to give her a celebration both grand and whole.



In his arms, Eleanor blinked, startled by the sudden proposal.



Yet beneath the surprise, warmth quietly rose within.



She gave a small nod,whispering,"Okay."



This time Nolan's plans for the engagement eclipsed anything before.



Fireworks and drones rehearsed in dazzling scale,unmatched in splendor.



Beyond that, he proclaimed across the city that every congratulation for their union carried the chance to win part of a hundred-million-dollar prize.



Excitement swept through the streets, while envy spread-everyone knew Nolan, once the city's most sought-after bachelor, now belonged fully to Enigma.



On the couch, Lillian bounced restlessly with her phone clutched in her hand.



"Ahhh! Eleanor! Look! The entire city is reposting your engagement notice with Nolan!"She shoved the glowing screen before Eleanor,showing the dramatic announcement Nolan had broadcast. "Congratulations on the engagement-get your chance to win a share of a hundred-million-dollar prize."



The bold headline flashed loudly and was impossible to ignore.



Overcome by extravagance and sweetness, Lillian declared, "I swear, Nolan is the most thoughtful man alive! Such a huge moment-we must celebrate properly!"



Watching her friend's endless excitement, Eleanor exhaled helplessly.



Lavish gestures stirred little inside her; if Nolan was the one beside her, that alone was enough.



But she also knew Nolan wished to make amends by giving her a flawless engagement party. It carried the depth of his true intent.



Without pausing, Lillian pulled Eleanor upright from the cushions.



"Come on! I know somewhere amazing! There's an event at the racetrack today-we'll go together. Think of it as a farewell tosinglehood!" Though Eleanor feared driving, Lillian's bubbling enthusiasm swept her along, leaving no chance to refuse.
###Chapter 242 Could We Speak Privately  
The racetrack thundered with the deafening roar of engines.


Lillian slipped into her sleek racing suit, excitement coursing through every fiber of her being.


Settling into the driver's seat, she flashed Eleanor in the passenger seat a confident smile. "Eleanor,hold on tight!"



Their car rocketed forward in a heartbeat.



Lillian's driving had always been impressive, and with Eleanor's steady guidance through the curve data,they moved as one perfectly synchronized unit.


Within moments, Lillian executed a flawless drift and blazed across the finish line first.



Wild cheers exploded around them.



Triumphantly, Lillian pulled off her helmet.


A man in a garish floral shirt sauntered over, whistling casually while his eyes locked onto Eleanor with obvious interest. Casually leaning against their car door, he attempted what he clearly thought was a suave hair flip. "Hey there,gorgeous.How about letting me take you for a real ride and show you what true excitement feels like?"



Lillian instantly stepped in front of Eleanor,chin raised in fierce defiance. "Not a chance. Get lost."



Having a woman dismiss him so bluntly clearly bruised his ego more than expected.



His gaze swept over Lillian wwith open disdain before returning to Eleanor. "Your friend's way too aggressive.That's not attractive at all. Become my woman, and I promise you'll live like a queen."



Lillian burst out laughing.



Who did this arrogant fool think he was, trying to steal Nolan's girlfriend?



Crossing her arms, she spoke with icy calm. "Do you have any idea whose girl she is?"


The man shrugged dismissively. "Don't care whose girl she is. Winner takes all around here. Those are the rules we live by."


Lillian's laugh turned cold and mocking as she slowly dropped a single name. "He is Nolan Stewart. Think he needs to follow your precious rules?" Every trace of color drained from the man's face.



Nolan Stewart?



The man who had turned the entire city upside down,throwing around a hundred million just to see one woman smile?



Everyone knew Nolan's reputation for being ruthlessly unpredictable, and the woman he loved was completely/off-limits.



Nobody in this city could afford to cross him.


The man's face was drained of color, and he finally managed a smile. "Oh wow, would you look at that.Just remembered I left the stove on at home. Really gotta run!"



He bolted like his life depended on it, practically tripping over himself to escape.



Eleanor watched his panicked retreat,caught between laughter and disbelief.



Lillian sauntered over and looped her arm through Eleanor's with a satisfied grin. "Pretty smooth,right?Guys like that only understand one language, so you've got to hit them fast and hard!"



They chatted and laughed together. Just as they prepared to leave, a familiar figure suddenly emerged in their line of sight.



Jonny stood there before them.



His suit was wrinkled beyond repair, hairsticking up at odd angles, and dark shadows ringed his eyes.


All traces of his once-confident swagger had completely vanished.



Slowly, he approached and stopped several meters away,his voice rough and strained. "Eleanor. Could we speak privately?"



Lillian snorted with disgust. "What, the woman you love is rotting in jail, so now you come crawling back to Eleanor? Get lost!"



Eleanor shook her head gently at Lillian, and turned to face Jonny. "Alright."


Eleanor walked a few steps away from Lillian. Jonny followed, carefully keeping his distance out of respect.



His gaze found hers, eyes swimming with tangled emotions. Regret, anguish, and a desperate plea he didn't even realize he was making.



"|am sorry." Finally,those three words escaped his lips.



"Now I know everything about Lainey. I've come to realize what a complete fool l've been, blind to everything that mattered, and I... I lost you."


Once he started, the words seemed to pour out easier."I believed you loved me so deeply that you'd do anything for me. I convinced myself my family's success came from my own brilliance. I thought my leg healing was some kind of miracle... Turns out it was all because of you. Eleanor, I was wrong.Horribly,unforgivably wrong."



Each word seemed to physically pain him as he spoke.



Everything he had once felt proud of, every bit of contempt he had harbored, now turned into knives cutting him from the inside.


Eleanor stood perfectly still, listening with a blank expression.



Her willingness to hear him out stemmed purely from respect forSallie.



Perhaps her patience might help Jonny find some peace, give him the strength to rebuild himself and become the support Sallie would need in her golden years. At least then this conversation wouldn't be completely pointless. When silence finally fell, Eleanor spoke with complete emotional detachment. "Have you finished? If so, I'll be going now."



Jonny could only stare at her retreating figure for what felt like an eternity
###Chapter 243 | Will Never Approve Of This Marriage
Word of Nolan's lavish engagement preparations spread quickly, soon reaching the Stewart family's estate.



When the butler reported the news, Norwood nearly exploded on the spot. His face flushed red, and his chest heaved as though he might lose his breath entirely.



Watching him like that, Wray immediately stepped forward."Norwood,please, don't work yourself up. It's not worth risking your health. I'm sure Nolan isn't thinking clearly right now. Once he cools down, he'll come to his senses."



Norwood slammed his palm against the armrest with a loud crack. His whole body shook with fury. "Not thinking clearly? That boy is under the spell of that scheming woman!" he bellowed.



The heir he had molded with his own hands,his carefully chosen successor, was pushing against him again and again, all for the sake of a divorced woman.How could he remain calm?



He turned,snarling at the butler, "Go! Drag Nolan back  here at once!"



The butler froze, clearly conflicted. After a hesitant bow, he said softly, "Sir, Mr. and Mrs. Benton are waiting outside."



The Benton couple?



Norwood's anger hit a sudden pause, like a flame doused with water. His expression remained dark, but he held himself back.



Their sudden visit could only mean one thing-it had to be about theengagement.



After a moment's silence, he finally muttered in a deep tone, "Let them in."



When Jeff and Hilda walked into the living room, the atmosphere felt heavy.



Norwood sat straight, his face stormy and unwelcoming. Beside him, Wray appeared composed and obedient.



Jeff and Hilda looked at each other, already knowing what they had to do.



They had finally met their long-lost daughter, and since she truly liked Nolan, they couldn't let her suffer


Whether Norwood liked it or not, they had to  intervene for her sake.



Breaking the silence, Jeff put on a polite smile."Norwood, forgive us for showing up unannounced.Since Eleanor and Nolan are about to be engaged, we felt it was only right, as her parents, to come and pay you a visit."


His tone was warm and respectful, carrying a quiet authority of its own. "The marriage between our families had some issues before, but luckily things are settled now. We know we owe Eleanor a great deal.To make it up to her and show our blessings, we've decided to double the value of the wedding gifts we first planned."



Saying this, he pulled out an embossed gift list from his briefcase and passed it over.


The butler accepted it with care and quickly presented it to Norwood.



Norwood took the long list without even bothering to open it.



It was clear the Bentons valued Eleanor dearly, as the lavish gifts were proof enough.


But to him, it made no difference.


In his eyes, Eleanor brought nothing but disgrace. Nolan's involvement with a divorced woman had already dragged the Stewart family into ridicule.



And now, on top of that disgrace, he wanted to throw a grand engagement party, as if parading their shame for the world to see.



He would never allow his grandson to be dragged down by such a woman.


With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the thick gift list onto the polished coffee table as though it were nothing more than scrap paper.


"The matter from before was nothing but a misunderstanding," he said coolly. "Our families never agreed to any engagement. As for Nolan-"


His words cut off with a sharp snort. "He's young and reckless. I will never approve of this marriage."


Jeff's polite smile faltered. His brows knitted together,but for Eleanor's sake, he forced down the frustration rising inside him.



He opened his mouth to respond, but Norwood had already lifted a hand, signaling he had heard enough."I'm tired. I'll rest now."



He then signaled the butler, "Show our guests out." At that, Hilda's stomach sank. Her fingers instinctively curled around her husband's sleeve,as though clinging for reassurance.



Jeff gave her hand a gentle pat, his eyes steady as he looked at the old man sitting stubbornly.



But in the end,he didn't argue. He just shared a quiet Look with HHilda before leading her out.



Once outside, they got into the car.



The ride was weighed down with silence until Hilda finally couldn't take it anymore. With worry all over her face, she turned to her husband. "Baby, what are we supposed to do now?"



Jeff gently took her hand and said softly, "Don't worry.Nolan's a man who stands by the people he loves.He'll stand by Eleanor."


To him, Norwood's harsh refusal wasn't entirely bad.



"If, in a few days, he still refuses to budge, we'll take them both back to Breoqua. There, at least,they'll have us and our family to support them. With us around, no one will dare make them suffer."



His words were reassuring, yet a knot of unease still lingered in Hilda's heart. She knew her daughter better than anyone.


Eleanor's roots, her love, her dreams, everything was here.



Asking her to leave would be like asking her to tear her heart in two.



For the moment, though, there didn't seem to be any other way.
###Chapter 244 Please Don't Get So Worked Up
Once Jeff and Hilda had left, Norwood remained in his seat,still simmering with anger.


Wray lingered quietly nearby, keeping his gaze lowered, though a faint, satisfied smile tugged at his lips.



Learning that Eleanor was the long-lost daughter of the Bentons had at first unsettled him. He had worried Norwood might give his blessing to the marriage simply out of respect for the Benton family.



That would have meant Nolan inheriting the Benton family's powerful support,leaving him with little hope of rising within the Stewart Group.


Yet, to his surprise, events had unfolded in his favor.


The more Nolan treasured Eleanor, the more Norwood's resentment seemed to grow.



Fortune was finally tipping in his direction.


At that moment, a servant who had been sent to the villa in Regal Heights hurried in, looking thoroughly distressed. Norwood was already in a foul mood, his anger only intensifying at the sight of the anxious servant.



He snapped, "Where is Nolan? What did he tell you?"



The servant trembled under Norwood's glare, bowing so deeply he barely dared to breathe. "He...he said   "



"Out with it! What's his excuse?" He barked.



"He said he's personally preparing the engagement venue and hasn't got time to return right now."



As soon as those words were spoken, a heavy,uncomfortable silence settled over the living room.



Norwood's anger hit its breaking point as his entire body shook and his face turned crimson with fury."Well, my grandson never fails to surprise me!" he spat out.



Norwood slammed his fist against the armrest, his chest rising and falling as he struggled to catch his breath.



The highly respected head of the Stewart Group lowered himself to the level of a servant, all for a woman who had already been divorced! Was this really the grandson he had invested so much  hope and effort in raising?


Sensing the perfect moment, Wray quickly moved closer,his voice soothing as he fanned Norwood's frustration. "Norwood, please don't get so worked up.Nolan is being reckless. After everything you've done for him, this is how he repays you, with carelessness and thoughtlessness."



He paused, watching for any sign of approval in Norwood's face, then pressed on to push his advantage. "Forgive me for speaking plainly, but if you let Nolan go through with this marriage, who knows? He might abandon this family altogether. He mighteven live with the Benton family after getting married."



"He wouldn't dare!" Norwood erupted, though even as he shouted, the warning had clearly rattled him.



He simply could not tolerate the idea!


Never would he allow the heir to embarrass this family like that!



There was no way he would stand by and let such a humiliation take place.



Turning sharply to the butler, Norwood issued a stern order. "Go now! Tell that ungrateful boy that he's no longer  the head of the Stewart Group! Then inform Human Resources, effective immediately, Wray is to assume the CEO position and hold absolute authority over company affairs!"



Wray's eyes lit up with barely contained thrill.



He could hardly believe how quickly fortune had turned in his favor.



Wray quickly masked his delight, putting on an air of humility and concern. "Norwood, are you sure about this? I don't know if I'm truly worthy of such a big responsibility. Still, if you're placing your faith in me,l promise I'll give it my all and never let you down."


Norwood ignored him entirely, his gaze still clouded by fury.



He needed to teach that disobedient grandson a lesson he would never forget.



And on top of that, he had to find Nolan a proper match as soon as possible, putting an end to all this nonsense.



He suddenly remembered how, just a few days earlier,a friend from the White family had mentioned over coffee that their granddaughter had recently returned from overseas and was the right age for marriage.



While the White family only ranked fourth among the  city's elite families, the girl's maternal grandfather held sway in high government circles.



Uniting the Stewart family with the White family would strengthen their position enormously.



Besides, a young woman brought up in such a prestigious family might be just the person to bring Nolan back under control.



Completely unaware of Norwood's scheme, Wray basked in the thrill of the authority he was about to claim.



He swore he would never give Nolan another chance to stand in his way!



The only blemish on Wray's rise was that he wasn't a direct descendant of Norwood.



Even as CEO, the inheritance rights would never be his by birth.



But he was patient, and once Nolan was finished, it was only a matter of time before the entire Stewart empire became his for the taking
###Chapter 245 What Are You Implying
The second Wray got out of the house, he noticed the butler engaged in a tense confrontation with someone.


Hector Perez, long a loyal adviser to Norwood, rarely allowed anyone to provoke him into open conflict.


Intrigued, Wray crouched behind a fountain, listening closely.



A young man whose features seemed vaguely familiar pleaded earnestly, "I heard Grandpa is unwell, so l brought some premium health supplements from abroad to visit him. Please, let me in. I promise to leave immediately after seeing him."



Hector's lined face remained unreadable, showing no hint of concession. "Mr. Stewart, have you forgotten what your grandfather insisted seventeen years ago?Leave at once. Regarding those supplements, this country already has more than enough."



Brodie's hand froze midair, clutching the box, his face alternating between pale and flushed.


As a descendant of the Stewart family, he was denied entry by a mere butler. 
Humiliation flooded his chest.



He vowed silently that once he controlled the family and claimed its leadership, Hector would no longer hold his post.



Oblivious to Brodie's thoughts, Hector gave a slight bow and gestured for him to depart.



With no alternatives, Brodie followed toward the gates.





As Hector turned, he caught sight of Wray nearby.



He offered Wray a strained smile. "Congratulations,Mr. Stewart, on securing the CEO position at the Stewart Group."



Brodie narrowed his eyes,resentment simmering.



How could such a distant relative assume the CEO position?



Norwood had clearly lost his senses.



Still, an opportunity glimmered.


If he could not approach Norwood or enter the company directly, perhaps he could utilize Wray.



Acknowledging Hector, Wray kept his gaze fixed on Brodie. It did not take long to identify Brodie as Colson's illegitimate son.



The enemy of Nolan's enemy could become an ally,and Wray considered the possibility of collaboration



Hector remained unaware that a single glance had already begun syncing their intentions.


Hector guided Brodie out, ensuring he entered his own car before departing for the company to follow Norwood's orders.



Yet inside the car, Brodie did not drive away.



Instead,he lowered the window as Wray stepped out from the estate gates.



"Wray, how does it feel to take orders from others?"Brodie taunted.



Now wielding authority, Wray refused to yield. A sardonic smile curved his lips. "No matter how unpleasant, I'm far ahead of some people. Who exactly was turned away at the gates?"



Brodie chuckled rather than fuming, climbed out of the car, and reached forward with his hand. "I understand you've been named CEO of the Stewart Group.Congratulations. But do those senior fools at the company actually respect you?" Wray's face shifted slightly as he shook Brodie's hand perfunctorily. "What are you implying?"



Brodie withdrew his hand, leaning casually against the car, cigarette dangling loosely. "You know perfectly well. I hold the inheritance rights; you control the real power. Let's join forces and take over the entire Stewart Group."



Wray paused, considering the proposal.



Brodie's words had struck deep.



He needed someone with legal inheritance to secure his position.



Yet everyone knew Norwood despised Brodie, the illegitimate child.



If Norwood discovered any alliance,his authority could vanish instantly.


Still, with Nolan in mind, he was unwilling to let this chance escape.



He realized Norwood continued to care for Nolan.



That suggested that, someday, on a whim, the CEO role could return to Nolan.



Rather than entrusting his destiny to others, he decided to claim it himself. Keeping that in mind, Wray lifted his gaze and offered his hand toward Brodie.



Once their hands met, silence fell between them;their intentions were clear, requiring no words to explain.
###Chapter 246 Are You All Right
When Eleanor left Lillian behind and returned to Regal Heights, darkness had already settled over the estate.



At the villa's entrance, a familiar silhouette emerged from the shadows.



It was Hector.



He seemed hurried.



Eleanor froze in place.



Why was he here?



She moved quickly to intercept him, her eyes locked on the container. "Hector, what's happening?"


Noticing Eleanor, Hector inclined his head politely."Good evening, Miss Warren."



He exhaled and began recounting the events candidly.



"I'm here to pass a message to Nolan. Starting tomorrow, Wray will step into the CEO role."



Eleanor's gaze darkened as she absorbed the news. Nolan ended up losing everything because of her.


Although she bore no blame, her presence had inadvertently strained his grandfather and his bond.


Hector studied her quietly. After a brief pause,he added, "Miss Warren, if possible, please speak with Nolan. His grandfather holds enormous expectations for him and truly cares. He shouldn't-"


He stopped momentarily and sighed wearily. "Forget it. Old people rarely comprehend youthful matters.Still, I hope you won't resent Mr. Stewart. His actions stem solely from deep affection for his grandson."



With that,he departed.


Eleanor lingered in silence for a moment,then stepped into the villa.



The living room welcomed her with the faint scent of cooked food drifting from the kitchen.


Curiosity piqued, she approached cautiously, her steps quiet.



Inside, the man destined to dominate Elepdon's corporate world now wore an incongruous apron,absorbed in preparing a meal.



The domestic sight made her pause, catching her  breath.



She stayed unobtrusive, leaning against the doorway as she observed him.



Eventually, Nolan turned, meeting her gaze. "Baby,you're back. Wash your hands; dinner's ready."


A soft "hmm" escaped her lips, her thoughts swirling with mixed emotions.



Nolan Stewart, a titan in business circles, was personally cooking.



And this came right after losing his authority.



Was his calm genuine, or merely a mask?


Eleanor paused for a moment, then asked, "Are you all right?"


Carrying a dish to the dining room, Nolan returned to face her.



His gaze held steady, eyes glowing with the familiar warmth she remembered. "I'm fine, as you can see.Wash your hands and taste my cooking."


He sidestepped the subject effortlessly, ignoring the recent dismissal.


Eleanor studied him silently, choosing not to probe  further.



Suddenly,the phone Nolan had left on the counter lit up.



Instinctively, Eleanor glanced at it.



A message from Erick appeared.



"Boss, we've contacted people in Zerovia, and the company's operations are fully arranged."


Everything remained under Nolan's control.


Eleanor felt a small relief, casually looking away as if she hadn't noticed.



"Alright, I'll be right there," she said with a gentle smile, then moved to wash her hands.


During dinner, Eleanor's thoughts remained tangled with concerns about the Stewart Group.



Wray,the incompetent fool,posed no real threat.



But Nolan confronted a furious Norwood.



One error could have irreversible consequences.



As her mind wandered, a warm hand rested over hers.



Looking up, she met Nolan's deep, steady eyes. 
"I'm fine. Besides, letting Grandpa release his frustration helps. We don't want him getting worked up and ending up in a hospital," he said.


His composed assurance finally eased her tension.


"Alright,if you need assistance, I'll help however I can,"she responded.


Her own empire, though smaller than the Stewart Group,was still substantial enough to provide support.


Nolan laughed softly, patting her head affectionately."Fine,my girl is the best."



Eleanor frowned slightly, a mix of amusement and exasperation.


What was that?



Was he handling her like a child?



Clearly, she shouldn't have felt sorry for him-her sympathy only encouraged him to playfully exaggerate.
###Chapter 247 | Regret Not Finding You Sooner
Eleanor emerged from the bathroom with freshly washed hair,droplets still clinging to the damp strands.


Suddenly, her phone screen illuminated with an incoming message.


The text came from Fannie, reading, "Tomorrow is Nolan's birthday!"



Eleanor froze mid-motion while toweling her hair.


Nolan's birthday? She had had absolutely no idea.


Her pulse quickened, stirred by an unexpected flutter of emotion.



Eleanor rapidly typed her response, "Really? Why hasn't he ever mentioned it?"



Fannie's reply appeared almost immediately,accompanied by a cheerful emoji. "You know Nolan -he's impossibly reserved and distant! He never acknowledges his birthday. What if we planned something special to surprise him?"


Considering the day's earlier events, Eleanor readily  agreed, responding, "Sure."



The two continued exchanging messages at lightning speed,solidifying their arrangements within minutes



The following morning in the dining room, Eleanor finished her final spoonful of oatmeal and placed her utensils aside.



Casting a glance at the man dining with refined precision across from her,she mentioned casually, "I'm heading to Hope House today. Fannie and I arranged to volunteer together."



With that, she rose swiftly and departed.



Nolan's grip on his silverware tightened imperceptibly.



Today marked his birthday, and he had quietly hoped she might spend the entire day by his side.



Despite his disappointment, he chose not to interfere,understanding her unwavering dedication to her charitable commitments.



As evening shadows lengthened, Eleanor remained absent.



Nolan's brow furrowed as he prepared to call her,when Fannie's urgent call interrupted first.


"Nolan! Something awful has happened! Eleanor  collapsed!" Fannie's voice carried pure panic.



At those words, Nolan's world went completely silent,as though time itself had frozen and ice had replaced the blood in his veins.



Without even properly checking the address Fannie transmitted, he seized his car keys and bolted from the house.



What normally required thirty minutes of driving was accomplished in ten.



At the Lumina Hotel, Nolan located the room number Fannie had provided. The door stood slightly open,revealing only impenetrable darkness beyond.



He rushed forward, pushing the door wide.


At that precise moment, gentle light bloomned within the shadows, accompanied by a clear, melodic voice singing, "Happy birthday to you..."


Eleanor and Fannie emerged from the darkness,bearing a cake adorned with flickering candles.



Then, the room's lights blazed to life suddenly,revealing colorful balloons and flowing ribbons decorating every corner, transforming the space into something wonderfully festive and inviting.



Nolan's frayed nerves finally began to settle as he  absorbed the scene surrounding him.


The crushing wave of terror dissolved into gentle warmth spreading through his entire body.


Eleanor set the cake carefully on the coffee table and offered him a mischievous wink. "Happy birthday. Let me grab some plates so we can enjoy this together."


With that, she disappeared toward the storage area.


Nolan's attention shifted to Fannie.



Fannie's heart lurched at the expression he directed her way.



On no!


She recognized that particular look far too well.


Nolan appeared poised to return her favor with a swift dismissal!



Erick, who had arrived moments earlier,immediately understood the dynamics at play.



He stepped forward smoothly, offering Fannie a courteous smile as he suggested, "Miss Stewart,the evening grows late.Would you allow me to escort you home?"



Before she could voice any objections, he efficiently  guided the protesting and resistant Fannie toward the door.



Eleanor returned carrying a box of cake plates, only to discover Nolan standing alone in the room.


"Where did Fannie go?" she asked with obvious confusion.


Nolan had already moved closer to Eleanor, smoothly accepting the plates from her grasp.


"She mentioned feeling sleepy, so l arranged for Erick to see her home safely," he explained.


Eleanor's puzzlement deepened. "Sleepy? The sun hasn't even set yet."


Nolan captured her hand, guiding her toward the waiting cake while his voice dropped to intimate,gentle tones. "Don't worry about her. Let's focus on the candles."


Though still perplexed, Eleanor chose not to pursue the matter further, assuming Fannie had departed due to some unexpected obligation.


Nolan clasped her hand firmly, closing his eyes beneath the gentle candlelight, and whispered a heartfelt wish-that every year, every day ahead,she would remain beside him always. Eleanor studied his profile, made tender by the flickering glow, and quietly ventured, "Our relationship doesn't appear to have others' approval. Do you ever have second thoughts?"



This question had been weighing on her mind for days.


Nolan's eyes opened, his gaze penetrating and steady as it found hers. "I do regret it."


Eleanor felt her heart sink slightly at his admission.


Yet in the next breath, Nolan continued with earnest deliberation, "I regret not finding you sooner."


Eleanor felt completely breathless, delicious warmth blooming in the deepest corners of her heart.


Rising onto her toes, she pressed a tender kiss to his lips.


Nolan's eyes grew darker as he closed them,responding to her kiss with fervent passion.


Was Eleanor finally embracing him without reservation?


Recognizing this shift, Nolan slowly intensified their connection.



They parted only when breathing became necessary.


Foreheads touching, they shared the same air between Findi...them.



Beyond the windows, sunset painted the sky in molten gold, merging flawlessly with the evening clouds.


They remained wrapped in each other's arms, silently watching the sun disappear beneath the horizon amid the twilight's embrace, for what felt like an eternity.
###Chapter 248 Can We Share A Room Tonight
After Nolan and Eleanor finished the cake, night had completely fallen.


As they walked through the hotel lobby,they suddenly ran into Wray.


He stepped out of the elevator with a crowd around him,brimming with confidence.



With his new position in hand, he was eager to host banquets and win over hearts.


The moment he spotted Nolan, his steps faltered.



A senior executive, eager to curry favor, rushed to speak. "Mr. Stewart, you're so ambitious and full of promise. Under your leadership, the Stewart Group will surely reach new heights! Not like someone here,who's so blinded by a woman that he's lost all reason!"


As he spoke, he shot Nolan a mocking glance.


Others quickly chimed in,echoing his words, "Exactly!"


Wray basked in the praise, his smile wide and smug.

Nolan, however, acted as if he heard nothing. He kept walking without sparing a glance.


Taking this as a sign of weakness, the executive grew bolder.



"You mustn't follow Nolan's example-falling for a divorced woman! He's nearly dragged the Stewart Group into disgrace!" His voice rang loud in the lobby.



Eleanor's face darkened at the mention.


At that, Nolan finally stopped. He turned his head slowly, his cold eyes fixing on the man. His voice was flat and sharp. "Is that so?"



Just three words, yet they struck like a bucket ofice water.



The executive froze, his smugness vanishing. The air itself seemed to grow heavy, and no one dared to breathe.



Lately, Nolan's gentle side with Eleanor had made them forget who he truly was-the man who had once seized control of the Stewart Group with an iron hand.That ruthless edge had never lefthim. The executive's legs buckled. His lipstrembled,but no sound came out. Wray cursed him silently. What a fool!


Forcing a smile, Wray quickly stepped in. "Nolan,don't mind their nonsense. You just focus on Eleanor.The company's in good hands with me. No need to worry."



But Nolan and Eleanor brushed past him without a word.



Wray's smile stiffened.



Damn them.



Once he and Brodie took full control, he would grind Nolan beneath his heel.



Eleanor and Nolan, unfazed, returned to the villa in Regal Heights.


Nolan looked at her, his Adam's apple shifting.


After a pause, he spoke softly, almost hesitant."Eleanor, can we share a roomn tonight?"



Afraid she would refuse, he quickly added, "I swear, I won't do anything."



Eleanor was slipping off her coat when his cautious gaze met hers. Her heart softened.



Yet she couldn't bend her principles. "No," she replied firmly.


The light in Nolan's eyes dimmed at once.


Seeing his disappointment, Eleanor felt a pang of sympathy.


After a moment, she offered a small concession. "But you can move into the room next to mine."



To Nolan,even that was a blessing.


He immediately turned to go upstairs and pack.


Finally,he could move closer to her.


But just then, Fannie popped out from behind the sofa,with a pitiful look at Eleanor.


"Eleanor! Nolan bullied me! We prepared a surprise for him, and as soon as it ended, he had Erick drag me away! I worked the whole day and didn't even get a bite of cake!" she cried, full of accusation.


Eleanor's face twisted with exasperation.


She turned toward Nolan, who had just reached the stairs. He hadn't taken a single step up.


"You should stay in your original room," she said coldly.  Nolan froze.



He clenched his teeth, his glare cutting straight at Fannie-the culprit.



But Fannie only stuck her tongue out playfully,unfazed by his murderous stare.



Nolan's hopes of moving closer to Eleanor were dashed, his frustration plain to see.



Yet he could neither scold his sister nor the woman he loved.



In the end,he called Erick, dragging him out of sleep,and rattled off a string of work instructions.



Still half-dreaming,Erick grew even more confused as he listened.



What kind of boss handed out tasks in the middle of the night?



He felt utterly wronged.
###Chapter 249 We Can't Let This Pass!
The incident at the Lumina Hotel lobby was caught on someone's phone and quickly posted online.


By the next day, a new trending topic exploded.


"Shocking! Former Stewart Group CEO Confronts Current CEO Over a Divorced Woman!"



The bold headline drew countless eyes.



The video spread like wildfire, and the comments section turned into chaos.



"That executive's mouth is filthy! What age are we in,still throwing around such insults?"


"Wray is no better. His man mocked his family's bride -to-be, and he stood there grinning-shows his character."



"Say what you want, but Nolan standing up for his girl was actually quite cool."



While the Internet buzzed, Eleanor and Nolan paid it no mind.  Hilda,however, was furious.



Jeff had just returned from trimming the garden when he noticed her dark expression.



His heart tightened. He dropped his tools at once and hurried over.


"What's wrong, baby? Are you feeling unwell?" he asked with concern.



Without speaking, Hilda shoved a tablet into his hands.


When Jeff watched the video, his face turned just as grim.



Hilda's eyes were red with anger, her chest heaving."How could they talk about Eleanor like that? We can't let this pass!"



Jeff wrapped her in his arms, patting her back gently.His voice was low and steady. "Don't worry. I'll take care of it."



He could hardly believe Wray had the audacity to bully Eleanor-and he swore Wray would pay the price.


Nolan's downfall could be brushed off as family strife within the Stewarts.



For Wray to publicly humiliate Eleanor? Unforgivable. This was more than an insult to Nolan-it was a slap to the Benton family's name.


And Jeff would never sit idle.


After soothing Hilda, he went straight to his study and dialed Denny.


"Reach out quietly to our business associates in Breoqua. From today on, cut ties with the new Stewart Group CEO, Wray. Anyone siding with him will be treated as an enemy of the Benton family."


Jeff paused momentarily before continuing, "And spread the word-the Benton family recognizes only Nolan as the head of the Stewart Group."


The next morning, Wray arrived at the company, still riding high on dreams of power. But the same executive who had flattered him in the hotel lobby came rushing in, pale and frantic.


"Mr. Stewart, we have a problem!" he stammered.


Wray, savoring his own triumph, frowned at the interruption. "Why the panic? Have some composure."


The man was nearly in tears. "Several top firms in Breoqua-led by the Benton Group-just emailed to terminate all contracts! They also announced they'll only work with Nolan! And...And-" His voice shook as he added, "'Inside the company, the entire executive office has gone on strike!"


Wray's smugness vanished in an instant.


This had to be Nolan stirring trouble with the Benton family's help.


That damned Nolan!



Did he really think these dirty tricks could bring him down?



Impossible!



How could a fallen heir like Nolan cause him any real harm?



Steeling himself, Wray snapped, "What are you crying about? Get Marketing and HR on this! Replace anyone on strike-talent is everywhere if you have the money.Let's see what tricks Nolan can still play!"


With a frown, he went on, "As for those Breoqua companies, if they insist on canceling, tell them to pay every cent of their penalty into my account!"



Was that a solution?



The executive didn't dare argue, though he silently disapproved, and went off to carry out the order. The thing was, Nolan had no idea any of this was happening-until Erick brought the news the next morning.



Tapping his fingers lightly on the desk,Nolan chuckled."Well, this is interesting. I wonder how Wray is handling it."


Erick hesitated before asking, "Mr. Stewart, do you think this was Mr. Benton's doing?"


Nolan leaned back in his chair,thoughtful.



After a moment, he gave a small nod.



Who else but Jeff could wield such influence?



It was the clearest, most forceful way to stand up for Eleanor-and a warning to the entire business wvorld.No one, under any circumstance, was allowed to bully a Benton.
###Chapter 250 Don't Feel Burdened
Eleanor had seen the news as well.


She stared at the phone screen as it dimmed,her mind lost in a haze, her feelings tangled and restless.


When Nolan came downstairs, he found her sitting in that daze.


He walked over, slipped his arms around her from behind,and rested his chin on her shoulder. His lips brushed close to her ear as he whispered softly, "If it feels hard to accept, then thank them face-to-face.Hmm?"



His voice carried a gentle, coaxing warmth.


Nolan knew her too well. Eleanor longed for family more than she dared to admit.



Now that her family was right before her, she simply didn't know how to reach out.


His warm breath brushed her ear, making her shiver.


She shifted slightly, then turned to face him and gave a small nod. When Jeff and Hilda received the invitation,joy nearly lifted them off their feet.



Hilda tried on more than ten outfits in her walk-in closet,none feeling good enough.


Jeff busied himself, wanting to bring every valuable painting from home,trying to win Eleanor over.


Hilda finally stopped him with a laugh.



The meeting was set at Verdant Crest.



When Jeff and Hilda arrived, nerves buzzing,they found Eleanor sitting alone by the window,her figure bathed in quiet solitude.


Hilda's chest tightened. She rushed forward, clutching Eleanor's hand as her voice trembled. "Sweetie,how have you been?"


Eleanor, a little uneasy, gently pulled her hand back.With a polite smile, she replied, "I'm fine. Thank you for your concern. I invited you today mainly to thank you for standing up for me against Wray."


Hilda felt wounded by the gesture, but she didn't hold it against Eleanor. She knew they owed her.


Sensing Eleanor's distance, she dared not show too much affection. She feared her love would only weigh heavier on Eleanor.


At that moment, Jeff stepped in, pulling Hilda closer.With a cheerful smile, he said, "This is nothing. Don't feel burdened."


Eleanor didn't know what to say, the Bentons wwere afraid of being too eager. As a result, silence lingered until the meal ended, leaving the air awkward and heavy.


Eleanor stood politely, said her goodbye, and turned to leave the restaurant.


Hilda watched her walk away, tears spilling at last.


Jeff wrapped his arms around her, wordlessly comforting her.


They knew they had once hurt Eleanor deeply.Healing her heart would take time.







After leaving the restaurant, Eleanor didn't head straight for Regal Heights. She asked the driver to take her to the Hope House instead.


Only there could her restless heart find a sliver of peace. Myah was handing out snacks to the children when she saw Eleanor. She waved her over. "Come,sit."


Eleanor walked up and took the basket from her hands.



The children quickly gathered around, calling her name sweetly.


When they ran off to play in the courtyard, Myah led Eleanor to a bench. Her voice was soft. "Got something on your mind?"



Eleanor didn't answer. She only rested her head on Myah's shoulder.



After a long silence, she fnally whispered, "Myah,when children here were found by their parents,how did they feel?"



Myah's wrinkled hand stroked her back gently.


She didn't press, but instead spoke slowly. "Some cried and rushed into their parents' arms, as if all the waiting had been for that one moment. Some were bitter, certain their parents had abandoned them, and refused to forgive. Others felt lost, unsure of how to face the sudden return of family."



She paused, her voice warm and steady. "Family ties are never simple. There's no fixed answer. Their  stories belong to them. Yours belongs to you.Only your heart can tell you the way."


With that, Myah stood and quietly left her to her thoughts.



Eleanor sat alone on the bench for a while.



The evening breeze brushed past as the sky slowly deepened into night.


It wasn't until Nolan called that she rose and returned to Regal Heights.


That night, Eleanor couldn't find sleep.
###Chapter 251 You Can Fix This

Jeff's earlier strike had successfully kept Wray subdued for several days.


Yet, through Wray's unpredictable maneuvers, the Stewart Group managed to regain stability.


Inside the president's office, he lounged in a wide leather chair, one leg folded over the other, smugly humming a clumsy tune.



So, the Benton family wasn't as intimidating as people claimed.



He had overestimated Jeff.



While savoring his apparent victory, a sudden knock came at the office door.



The executive known for constant flattery burst in,nearly tripping over his shoes.


"Mr. Stewart, we got a problem. All our business associates in Zerovia abruptly canceled every partnership with us! Worse still, a shipment already dispatched there has been seized at Customs by the military!" the executive said breathlessly. Wray's smug grin vanished immediately.



The military?



How had soldiers become involved in this?


He sprang to his feet, seized the executive's collar,and barked, "Repeat that!"


Terrified by Wray's violent temper, the executive stammered through the details once more.


He finished with, "The military insists the cargo hides contraband, so it must remain under indefinite inspection."



At those words, Wray's strength deserted him.


His grip fell away, and he collapsed heavily into the chair.



Everything was collapsing.



Such staggering losses could never escape the board's notice.



This smelled of Nolan's schemes.



But how could Nolan command Zerovia's military so easily?

 
When businessmen collided with the military, it felt like fighting pistols against knives.


Frozen in place, unable to act, he saw Brodie stroll inside with effortless compoosure.



Brodie's eyes settled on Wray's ashen face, a sly smile tugging at his lips.


"Looks like trouble found you?" Brodie's tone carried no doubt.



Wray snapped irritably. "If you came only to mock me,then leave."



Brodie chuckled, waving the executive away.


Moments later, the office held only the two of them.


Pulling out a chair opposite Wray, Brodie calmly poured himself a cup of coffee. "I happen to hold some sway in Zerovia too," he said lightly.


Wray's eyes brightened. "You can fix this?"


After sipping leisurely, Brodie answered, "I can. But-"


Grinding his teeth, Wray demanded, "What do you want?"



Setting down his cup, Brodie casually brushed back his hair."The CFO's position."


That demand made Wray's brows crease. The Chief Financial Officer seat carried immense weight.


A single mistake from the Chief Financial Officer could spark a devastating financial collapse.


If failure struck, neither Norwood nor the board would ever forgive him.


Still, faced with Zerovia's disaster, Wray wavered.


Without a solution, he would lose his current job and even get kicked out of the company.


Watching his uncertainty, Brodie pressed harder. "You honestly think you can survive without me? You've seen Nolan's power today. He could bring you down effortlessly. Joining forces with me is your only escape."



Wray knew those words held truth.


He couldn't allow Nolan to triumph!


Never again would he live beneath another's control.


If the Chief Financial Officer seat belonged to someone loyal to him and Brodie, draining money from the Stewart Group would be far simpler.



Together they could outmaneuver Nolan, even Norwood. Then the entire empire would fall into their hands.


Resolved,Wray declared, "Deal!"


Brodie's grin widened.


He rose, extended his hand, and said, "Here's to our first successful partnership."


Wray clasped it firmly. "Looking forward to it."


Without delay, Wray launched his counteroffensive with Brodie beside him.


At the Regal Heights villa, inside the study, Erick delivered his report. "Mr. Stewart, Wray installed a new CFO, one of Brodie's allies. Also, Brodie pulled strings in Zerovia, and Customs already released the shipment."



Nolan tapped slender fingers against the desk.


Every piece fell exactly where he had planned.


That fool Wray lacked the composure to endure pressure.


Nolan felt pleased, convinced it was wiser to draw out hidden vermin in one sweep rather than hunt them individually.


His lips lifted faintly, though his gaze held not a trace of warmth.



He said, "Leave them alone. It's time we advance to the next stage."



A shiver ran through Erick. He bowed quickly."Understood."
###Chapter 252 You Will Be Nolan's Wife
Nolan and Wray were caught in a bitter rivalry.



Meanwhile, Norwood, with Hector at his side, went to meet Kieran White and his granddaughter.



The moment Norwood arrived, Kieran greeted him with a warm smile. "Norwood, at last! My coffee's almost cold."



Norwood smiled, shaking his hand. "Got held up on the way, old friend. I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long."



The two elderly men exchanged a few warm words before they took their seats.



Norwood's eyes soon landed on Trudy White, seated gracefully beside her grandfather.


With delicate features and a calm, refined air, Trudy radiated poise.



To Norwood, she was far above Eleanor-who, in his eyes, was only a pretty face.


If Nolan married Trudy, Norwood believed he would  finally settle down.


With that thought, he offered her a warm smile."Trudy,you grow more graceful with each passing day."



Trudy lowered her gaze shyly, a soft smile playing on her lips. "You flatter me, Mr. Stewart."


Her modesty pleased Norwood even more.



Turning back to Kieran, he spoke directly. "I've come today on behalf of my unruly grandson, Nolan, to formally propose to your granddaughter, Trudy."



Both sides already knew the purpose of this meeting.Now the words were spoken aloud.



Trudy,who had long harbored feelings for Nolan,blushed at the proposal.


Kieran,too,was pleased.



The White family did not hold as much sway in business as the Stewarts.



An alliance through marriage would bring great advantage.


Still, he pretended to hesitate. "Norwood, I've heard Nolan is fond of someone. Is that true?"



Norwood gave a dismissive snort, his tone firm."That  woman is of no consequence. As heir to the Stewart family, Nolan doesn't get to decide his own marriage."


That was all Kieran needed to hear.



He set down his coffee cup with a smile. "Since you put it that way, I have no reason to refuse. For Trudy,marrying into your family is an honor."


At that, Norwood signaled Hector.



Hector immediately pulled out a neatly prepared engagement agreement from his briefcase and placed it on the table with care.



Norwood's expression softened into satisfaction.



"Here is the agreement. Please review it. If there are no issues, we'll consider the matter settled today.Next week is the Stewart Group's centennial celebration.I will announce their engagement before all our guests then."



Kieran read the document carefully several times. At last,satisfied,he nodded in approval.


With the formalities complete, Norwood-whose health was not the strongest-took his leave.



Once the room was left to just grandfather and granddaughter, Trudy's shyness slipped away. She tugged gently at Kieran's sleeve. "Grandpa,shouldn't we ask for Nolan's opinion first? He's so attached to Eleanor Warren... Will he accept this?"



Kieran's response mirrored Norwood's exactly. "Men often keep casual women by their side, but they never matter. You will be Nolan's wife. As long as you hold your rightful place, the rest are nothing but distractions-easily removed."


When she heard her grandfather's words, Trudy's worries eased.



Grandpa was right.


She had both the time and the means to make Nolan hers-completely, in body and in heart.
###Chapter 253 Will You Marry Me
Nolan had no idea that Norwood was already plotting out his marriage like it was some cold business arrangement.


Right now, he was in his study, lounging back with a flashy little romance guidebook in his hands, staring at the pages as if they held the secrets of the universe.


When Erick walked in carrying a stack of documents,he nearly doubted his own eyes.


He could hardly believe that his sharp, no-nonsense boss was actually reading a book like that.


He had to clear his throat to cover the laugh that was threatening to escape. "Mr. Stewart, is there anything | can do for you?"



Nolan didn't even bother to look up. "What could a single guy like you possibly know about this?"


The jab hit Erick right in the pride.



He stood there, silently licking his wounds, when he suddenly heard Nolan mutter under his breath, "How do I make the proposal stand out?"
Erick blinked, then pushed aside his bruised ego and started thinking seriously. "Well, Mr. Stewart, what matters most to Ms. Warren?"



The answer that almost slipped out of Nolan's mouth was "me." But he bit it back.



Instead, he said, "The Hope House."



Erick's eyes lit up as an idea struck him. "Then why not propose there? Let the children join in. It would be meaningful, and she'd never forget it."


Nolan's entire expression shifted. Energy sparked in his eyes.


The book was tossed onto the table in an instant, and he was already grabbing his car keys, striding toward the door with purpose.



Just before leaving, he paused, turned back,and clapped Erick on the shoulder. "This month, your salary's doubled."


Erick was stunned, then practically glowed with excitement. It felt like he had been struck by fortune itself.



Over the next few days, Nolan's schedule changed.He was in and out constantly, leaving early and coming home late. Eleanor didn't think twice about it.


In her mind, Nolan was probably just caught up in another round of heated clashes with Wray. Being busy was nothing new for him.


That afternoon, she had just finished sketching out a new design when her phone buzzed.



It was Myah calling.


"Eleanor, the orphanage just got a huge donation of supplies from a charity. Can you come help me sort and count everything?" Myah said.


"Of course. I'll head over right now," Eleanor answered without hesitation.


After ending the call, she picked up her bag and rushed out.


Soon,she arrived at Hope House and pushed open the rusty iron gates.



Just as she stepped inside, soft rose petals began to fall from above.



Before Eleanor could process it, a little girl ran up to her, holding a single red rose in her tiny hand. She beamed as she held it out. "Eleanor, this is for you."


Eleanor accepted the flower, still in a daze. 
Then another child appeared. Then another.One after the other, they came running to her, each handing her a rose with the brightest smile.


Her arms were slowly filled with roses, and her eyes began to sting.



She was starting to understand.



When the last child had skipped off, leaving her clutching a bouquet of roses, she saw Nolan standing at the far end of the path lined with petals.


Dressed in a perfectly fitted black suit, he was holding a diamond ring that sparkled brilliantly under the sunlight. His steps were solemn as he walked straight toward her.



Finally, he stopped, lowered himself onto one knee,and looked up at her.


For once, the unshakable Nolan seemed nervous.


"Eleanor," he began, his voice gentle but tinged with emotion, "I love you. Will you marry me?"


Before she could even respond, Eleanor caught sight of movement in the distance.



Several familiar faces peeked out from behind a nearby tree-Hilda and Jeff, along with Lillian, Fannie,  Ryland,and Myah.


Everyone important to her was there, quietly witnessing the moment.



Her heart clenched.


She hadn't expected Nolan to be this thoughtful, to bring all the people she cared about together.


Even if she wasn't ready to face Hilda and Jeff yet, a part of her still wanted her parents to be present on such an important day.


Her tears spilled over as she nodded. "Yes, I will."


Joy lit up Nolan's eyes as he slid the ring onto her finger with practiced care.


Then he got up, swept her up into his arms,and carried her forward, the sound of laughter and cheers ringing out behind them.


Back at the villa in Regal Heights, their steps turned into whispers against the floor as Nolan laid Eleanor gently onto the bed.


Their lips found each other, breaths mingling.


The air grew heavy, almost electric, as if the world around them had disappeared. And just when the moment was about to tip over the edge,Nolan suddenly stopped.



He pressed his forehead to hers, his voice coming out low and husky. "Not yet. Let's save that for our wedding night."


Eleanor's chest heaved as she tried to calm her racing heart. Their passion subsided slowly, replaced by a quieter,deeper warmth.


Nolan pressed a gentle kiss on Eleanor's forehead as he murmured, "The Stewart Group is holding its hundredth anniversary next week. Will you come with me?"


Her foggy thoughts cleared slightly at his words. She blinked, hesitant. "Do you really think your grandfather will accept me?"


A faint laugh slipped from Nolan's lips. His thumb traced the outline of her mouth. "You don't have to win him over. The only one you need to satisfy is me."


At his words, Eleanor rolled her eyes, though her lips curved despite herself. Somehow he always twisted the conversation to suit his own desires.
###Chapter 254 What's Norwood's Game
Hector sent a text message to Nolan the day after.His grandfather had asked him to bring Eleanor to the Stewart Group's centennial celebration.



Nolan couldn't help but feel unsettled by Norwood's sudden change of attitude. He couldn't understand the reason behind it, but it made him wary.



On the day of the banquet, as Nolan and Eleanor entered the grand hall, a cheerful voice yelled, "Nolan!Eleanor!"



Fannie, her hands lifting her dress, quickly ran over to greet them.



She was overjoyed-at last, her grandfather seemed to welcome Eleanor into the family.


She linked arms with Eleanor affectionately."Oh my goodness! You look gorgeous, Eleanor!"



Eleanor returned the smile, her eyes resting briefly on Fannie's face.



Fannie looked healthier than before; with more care,she might recover fully. "You also look amazing!" Eleanor responded.


Fannie's delight grew at the compliment. She shook Eleanor's arm playfully, acting a little spoiled. "I'm feeling a lot better now. The Stewart estate is too boring for my liking! I don't want to stay anymore. Can I live with you? Don't worry, I won't disturb your private time!"



Nolan's face darkened when he heard that.



First it was Lillian, then Betsy, and now even his own sister wanted Eleanor's attention.



This was intolerable.



He cleared his throat and asked, "How did you do in your recent exams?"



Fannie froze, stomped her foot, and turned to Eleanor for help. "Eleanor, do you see how annoying he is?!"



Not far away, Wray watched with a glass of champagne in hand. His expression grew stormy.



Shit!



He was now the head of the Stewart Group, yet when he tried speaking to Fannie earlier, she barely looked his way. But with Nolan and Eleanor, she was full of  joy.



Nolan was her brother, so closeness was natural.



But why Eleanor? Why did an outsider win her favor?


"Sometimes you need to swallow


small setbacks for bigger gains." A calm voice rang out.



Taken aback, Wray turned sharply. "Brodie? What are you doing here?"



Brodie tilted his glass and let out a cold laugh. "I'm still a Stewart. Do you think I'd miss an event like this?"


Wray had no reply.



Lowering his voice,he muttered while glancing toward Nolan,Fannie and Eleanor, "What's Norwood's game?


He's despised Eleanor from the start. Why bring her in now?"



Had Norwood really changed his mind to support Nolan?



While Brodie was absorbed in thought, the hall's lights dimmed.



A single spotlight fell upon the stage. The emcee gave a brief welcome and then said,"Please join me in welcoming Mr. Norwood Stewart to the stage."



Norwood stepped forward with vigor, greeted by a wave of applause.



But to everyone's astonishment, he wasn't alone. A young woman in a flowing white gown stood at his side,her makeup flawless, her bearing graceful.


It was none other than Trudy.



Taking the microphone from the emcee's grasp,Norwood swept his eyes across the hall, the weight of authority in his gaze.



After a brief opening, his voice hardened.


"Tonight, at the Stewart Group's centennial celebration,I have joyous news."



Drawing Trudy beside him, he declared, "This is Miss Trudy White. I have chosen her to be Nolan's fiancée.And let me remind certain people-know your place.Our family will never take in a divorced woman."



His words fell like a hammer. The hall erupted in murmurs of shock.
###Chapter 255 Both Our Families Are Left Disgraced
Wray's smug smile froze mid-face, stiffening until it looked almost painful.


The White family...fourth in Elepdon?



Sure, everyone knew the Whites ranked fourth among the city's wealthiest, but that wasn't the real problem.



The real problem was Trudy's mother hailing from the Perry family. It was a powerhouse in Elepdon's political circle, the kind of influence money alone couldn't buy.


If Nolan actually married a White, he might as well pack his bags. There would be no place for him in the Stewart Group.


The thought made Wray's chest burn with fury. His hand clenched so tightly around the champagne glass that it nearly shattered.


This! This was even worse than Norwood agreeingto let Nolan marry Eleanor.


And in that moment, it hit him that expecting Norwood to completely cut Nolan off, after grooming  him for years as heir, had always been nothing more than a fantasy.



Meanwhile,the supposed target of Norwood's scheme,Eleanor,let out a short, cold laugh.


So that was what this was all about.



She had been wondering why she had been invited to the event tonight. Now it made sense that this was nothing but a setup to embarrass her.


Nolan tightened his grip on Eleanor's hand.



With every eye in the room on them, he guided her toward the stage. His steps were solid, and his presence carried an aura that pressed down on everyone.



Fixing his gaze firmly on Norwood, Nolan declared, "I don't agree. In this life, the only woman I'll marry is Eleanor."



His voice was absolute, leaving no doubt about his resolve.



Without offering another glance at those on stage,Nolan turned away,pulling Eleanor along with him.


His actions were sharp and final, making it clear that there was no space for argument. 
"Nolan!" Fannie's voice called after them.



She glanced back at Norwood's thunderous face and the strange woman still standing on stage, then stomped her foot in anger before hurrying after her brother and Eleanor.



The grand hall sank into stunned silence.



Guests exchanged wide-eyed looks, whispers spreadinglike wildfire.



They couldn't stop talking about the depth of Nolan's devotion to Eleanor, about his audacity to defy Norwood in front of everyone, even after he got kicked out of the Stewart Group.


And yet, Trudy, left standing at the center of it all,didn't so much as flinch.



She had expected this reaction.



To her, what mattered wasn't the rejection tonight but the title she believed would eventually be hers-Nolan's legal wife. That was the victory she clung to.



Norwood,however,was far from composed.



His whole frame shook with rage, his finger jabbing in the direction Nolan had stormed off. "How dare he!"His voice cracked under the strain. A divorced woman over Trudy? The thought alone made his blood boil.



Then, in a rush of fury, his vision blurred.



The next second, his body stiffened, and he collapsed backward like a felled tree.



"Grandpa!"



"Norwood!"



"Quick,get a doctor!"


The room erupted into chaos, shouts and panic crashing together in a wave of disorder.


Later, in the quiet of the lounge, after receiving some care, Norwood slowly opened his eyes.


Trudy quickly moved closer.


"Norwood, are you okay?" She held his hand gently and said, "Maybe Nolan was just caught off guard and couldn't take it in right away. Please don't be upset with him."



Nolan was hers. She couldn't risk Norwood's anger pushing him further away.



The old man studied her gentle face and her reassuring tone, and his shoulders eased.
With effort,he raised his shaky hand and patted hers."My dear,you've been through so much."


Before themoment could soften further, a voice cut through the air from the doorway.


"Well, Ms. White, I must say, you're incredibly forgiving. After what Nolan pulled tonight, both our families are left disgraced."


Brodie was propped casually against the doorway,arms folded across his chest, a sly grin resting on his face.
###Chapter 256 | Told You To Leave!
Norwood's expression turned thunderous instantly.



Though Hector had already informed him of Brodie's return, he never anticipated such brazen audacity in appearing before him today.



Seizing the glass beside him, he hurled it at Brodie with violent force. "Who gave you permission to return to this country? Get back to Zerovia immediately!"



Brodie sidestepped with casual ease, the glass exploding against the wall in a shower of fragments.



He grinned, spreading his hands in mock innocence."Grandpa, I'm simplyworried about your wellbeing.Dad learned you've been unwell,so he dispatched me to check on your condition. His concern for you runs deep."



Concern for him?



More likely hoping for his swift demise!



This realization prompted Norwood to gesture furiously toward the exit, his voice quaking with rage. "I told you to leave! I acknowledge no such son, nor do I recognize a grandsonlike you! Get out!"


Rather than departing, Brode strolled directly inside and settled onto the sofa, crossing his legs with deliberate insolence.



He clicked his tongue disapprovingly and continued,"Come on, Grandpa. Dad and I have consistently maintained exemplary behavior. How precisely have we offended you? It's Nolan's conduct today that warrants exile abroad."



Norwood felt his fury reaching a breaking point.



He couldn't fathom how Brodie,nothing more than an illegitimate offspring,possessed the audacity to tell him what to do.



Regardless of his reckless tendencies, Nolan remained the heir he had personally cultivated, the legitimate heir of Stewart Group. Nolan was way out of this bastard son's league.


Refusing to waste additional words, Norwood commanded coldly toward the entrance, "Throw him out!"



Immediately following his declaration, two security personnel entered,seizing Brodie from both sides and hauling him toward the exit. Brodie had intended merely to create disturbance and harbored no plans for extended presence.


Though privately fuming, he offered no resistance.



Almost the moment Brodie was forcibly ejected,Hector rushed inside.



He approached Norwood swiftly, lowering his head in respectful submission. "Mr. Stewart, Mr. and Mrs.Benton have arrived."



Before Norwood could process this information, Jeff and Hilda burst through the entrance, their faces etched with obvious distress.



Eleanor had finally found happiness. How could they permit anyone to destroy it? Not even Norwood possessed that authority!



Norwood anticipated their purpose but spoke first with a frigid smile. "Jeff, I'm delighted you found your daughter,though you should consider teaching her appropriate conduct and decorum."



Was he suggesting their daughter was shameless,desperately clinging to Nolan?



Yet Nolan had been the one to propose first!



Hilda's chest heaved with righteous indignation as she  prepared to respond.


Jeff restrained her gently, patting her hand in a calming gesture that urged patience.



He then fixed Norwood with an unwavering stare that contained no trace of submissive respect, only the frank assessment of an equal.



His declaration rang with absolute conviction, "My daughter requires no criticism from outsiders. Should your family reject this union, that's perfectly acceptable. I've already allocated sixty percent of Benton Group's shares plus our complete international operations as her wedding gifts. The world contains countless worthy men. We have no need for Nolan!"



Following this pronouncement,Jeff refused Norwood even a parting glance, turning to depart with Hilda at his side.



His visit hadn't been intended for reconciliation,but rather to establish unequivocally that Eleanor commanded too much respect to endure humiliation.He wanted Norwood to understand that Eleanor remained the treasured center of their universe.



Following the Bentons' departure, stunned silence filled the lounge.


 
Throughout Breoqua, Benton Group commanded  commercial influence rivaling that of Stewart Group itself.



Presenting sixty percent of company shares plus the entire international division as wedding gifts essentially meant Jeff and Hilda were transferring control of the entire Benton empire to Eleanor.


Norwood's face grew ashen with fury.



Partially due to Jeff's public humiliation before so many witnesses.


Additionally, the prospect of forfeiting such enormous financial gain proved absolutely intolerable.


Trudy's expression appeared even more thunderous,her concealed hand slowly forming a tight fist.


She had assumed Eleanor possessed minimal status,suitable only as a hidden mistress kept in the shadows.



Never had she anticipated Jeff and Hilda placing such extraordinary value on Eleanor.



She recognized the necessity for a completely revised approach.



Regardless of obstacles, she remained absolutely determined to become Nolan's wife.
###Chapter 257I'll Be Occupied For Some Time
Once they left the banquet hall, Nolan brought Eleanor directly back to the villa in Regal Heights.



On the sofa, Eleanor reclined comfortably,tilting her face toward the man beside her as he poured water into a glass.



Playfulness danced in her gaze when she said,"Honestly, I think Ms. White suits you well. Why not consider her?"



Nolan's hand stilled, and he set the glass carefully on the coffee table in front of her.



Then he leaned forward, bracing both palms against the sofa's backrest, enclosing her within his arms.



"I don't care how perfect she seems. The only wife I've ever chosen is you, Eleanor," Nolan responded.



Although he knew her words were teasing, the seriousness in his eyes never wavered.



She had a way of provoking him even in moments like this. With so many burdens weighing him down, she still found amusement in jesting.


And still, he loved her endlessly.



Nolan's embrace tightened as he pulled Eleanor close,resting his chin lightly upon her head. "I'll handle everything,"he promised.



The tenderness in his voice stirred her, and she pressed her cheek into his warm chest, whispering her soft reply.



She had always trusted him unconditionally.



Just then, faint commotion sounded beyond the villa,mixed with hurried voices.



Arms spread wide, Fannie blocked Jeff and Hilda, her expression full of urgency. "Mr. and Mrs. Benton,please hear me! What happened today was solely my grandfather's doing-it has nothing to do with my brother!"



Jeff ignored her plea, his sharp eyes scanning inside."Where's Eleanor?"



Exchanging a glance, Nolan and Eleanor rose together and stepped out.


At the sight of Nolan, Fannie flicked her gaze toward  him,urging silently for help in easing the Bentons 'anger.



Hilda rushed forward,clutching Eleanor's hand, tears brimming instantly. "Eleanor, you must have been upset. Please, come home with me."


The warmth of a mother's touch carried undeniable comfort.



Eleanor felt Hilda's genuine concern, her own heart softening, her voice turning gentler. "I truly appreciate your kindness, but this path is my decision."



She slipped her hand free and headed back inside,going up the stairs.



Unable to face such overwhelming affection, she chose instead to retreat.


As she watched Eleanor's figure disappear, Hilda's disappointment showed clearly.


Nolan stepped closer to Jeff, his tone steady. "I apologize for everything that happened today. I'll resolve the matter properly, and Eleanor won't bear any unfair treatment."



Jeff's features remained severe, his piercing gaze locked on the young man before him.


"Nolan," he said, "I don't care how tangled your family  affairs are. If Eleanor ever suffers harm or injustice, I will never let you go unpunished."



From the study upstairs, Eleanor stood at the window,watching as Jeff and Hilda departed, her emotions in turmoil.



Though she deliberately turned away from that sudden surge of parental love, their sincerity still touched her deeply.



As she wrestled with these thoughts, Nolan's firm footsteps drew near behind her.



She quickly smoothed her expression, meeting him with calm composure. "Enigma Group is releasing new projects this quarter, and I'm organizing a charity gala.I'll be occupied for some time. During this period,I'll stay at Podium Apartments and won't return here."



Nolan crossed the room and wrapped an arm around her shoulders.



He understood she was giving him space to handle the troubles with Norwood and the White family.


"Alright." Lowering his head, he pressed a kiss onto her forehead. "I'll assign Erick to serve as your driver."



Eleanor accepted without resistance, nodding softly.
###Chapter 258 I Won't Marry You

The next morning, as thefirst light spread across the sky,Eleanor quietly packed a small suitcase and left the villa.



Nolan stood there, watching her car fade into the mist until it vanished from sight. Only then did he turn around and head for the Stewart family's estate.



Inside the dining room, Norwood and Trudy were sharing breakfast. Their conversation flowed easily,almost like a picture of a warm family morning.


However, that warm scene lasted only until Nolan stepped into the doorway.



The moment he appeared, the laughter died, replaced by an awkward silence.



Norwood slowly raised his eyes to meet Nolan's. A bitter chuckle slipped out as he tapped his spoon against the plate, the sharp sound breaking the silence.



"Well, what a rare sight. Did you come just to check whether I'm still alive?" he said with open sarcasm.



Trudy immediately set down her fork and knife,  interjected in a gentle tone. "Norwood, don't say that.Nolan cares about you, I'm sure of it. Otherwise,why would he come back so early this morning?"



Norwood only snorted in response. He knew his grandson far too well to believe such words.


Nolan never showed up without a reason.



Norwood rose with a stern expression, striking his cane hard against the floor. "You, come with me to the study!" he commanded.



Without another word, he turned and headed upstairs.


Nolan didn't move right away.


Instead,he crossed the room to where Trudy sat, his eyes steady on her. "Miss White, let me be clear-l won't marry you. If your family is forcing you into this,I can help arrange another marriage for you, one even better than tying yourself to OUR family."


Trudy hadn't expected him to be so direct. His words cut straight through her, leaving a sting in her chest.


She had cared for him since they were children,always dreaming of being his wife, and she had chosen this path willingly.


Pushing down the ache in her heart, she lowered her voice, speaking softly. "Nolan, I know your feelings aren't with me right now, and that your heart belongs to Miss Warren."



She looked up and locked eyes with him. "But that doesn't matter. I want to marry you anyway, to stand by your side as your wife. I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes, until you're willing to look my way again."



She lowered herself completely, but Nolan's face didn't shift in the slightest.


Since she had already decided to wait, he saw no reason to waste more words.



Without hesitation, he turned and strode upstairs.



In the study, Norwood was standing by the window,looking stern.



When he finally turned, his eyes burned with restrained fury. "Kneel!" he barked.


Nolan dropped down without a second thought, but his back stayed stiff, his spine straight as a rod.


Norwood grew even angrier at his grandson's unbending stance.



His voice thundered through the room. "Look at what you've become! Have you completely lost your senses? Trudy is an excellent girl, yet you ignore her  for Eleanor, a divorced woman! If you're so attached to Eleanor, then keep her out of sight,away from this family. Did you not hear what Trudy said? She's cool with it. But when it comes to your wife, the one who stands at your side, it must be Trudy!"


Norwood's tone left no room for doubt. There was simply no way he would allow Nolan to throw away the Stewart family's golden alliance with the Whites and the powerful Perry family just for one woman.



Nolan, however, was unmoved. His eyes held that same stubborn fire. "Grandpa, if the White family alliance means that much,then let Wray marry her.He fits your plan well enough."


The room fell silent in an instant.



Norwood looked at Nolan in shock, then lifted his cane and brought it down hard across Nolan's back."How dare you!" he roared.



To him, the idea of letting Wray, a distant relative,marry Trudy and gain access to the Perry family's influence was unthinkable.



That kind of move would shake the very foundation of the Stewart family's power.



Norwood looked at the grandson he had placed all his hopes on, and his heart sank under the weight of disappointment. After a long pause, his voice came again, this time hoarse with fatigue. "I'll ask you one last time. Will you marry Trudy or not?"



Nolan lowered his head and said nothing. His silence spoke louder than words.


When Norwood saw the unyielding look in Nolan's eyes,anger surged so strongly that he felt lightheaded.


He stumbled back and had to brace himself against the desk to keep from falling.



"You just refuse to listen, don't you?" he said coldly."Fine. Go to the basement, receive the punishment,and kneel there until I say otherwise!"


Nolan didn't argue. Without a word, he rose to his feet and walked out of the study.



The moment he left, Norwood's temper exploded. He swept everything off the desk in a fit of rage.



Had Nolan lost his mind? Whose blood did he carry to be this defiant?



His stubbornness was enough to drive himmad.
###Chapter 259 Perhaps You Speak Too Soon
When darkness settled, light rain began falling, and the air grew colder.


Trudy lingered in the corridor, quietly watching the man confined in the basement.


Nolan had remained on his knees there for ten long hours.


His suit clung to his back, soaked in blood, forming a ghastly picture beneath the faint glow. After enduring fifty lashes, he never let out a single cry.



This man proved even more unyielding than she had believed.



His indomitable pride and raw endurance awakened a sharper craving inside her-possessiveness burning hotter.



The harder he was to break, the sweeter the triumph of mastering him.


Hector arrived from behind. "Ms. White," he said. "Mr.Stewart wishes Nolan to be entrusted to you." Trudy inclined her head slightly. "I understand. Thank you for helping, Hector."



With that, she lifted her skirt and moved elegantly into the basement.



"Nolan,why subject yourself to this?"she asked softly."I already pleaded with Norwood, and his anger subsided. Allow me to bring you back for rest."



Trudy extended her hand toward Nolan.



The instant her fingers touched his skin, the burning heat shocked her, and she jerked back in alarm.



Was he feverish?



Yes,illness rendered any man weakest. This offered the perfect chance for closeness to blossom.



Clenching her teeth, Trudy guided Nolan's arm over her shoulder and summoned all her strength to raise him."Come with me."



Eleanor, at that moment, had come back to Podium Apartments.



Lilah helped remove her coat, speaking anxiously "Erick mentioned that Mr. Stewart visited his grandfather early this morning and still hasn't returned." Eleanor knitted her brow, reaching for her phone,  when the sound of the electronic lock clicked at the door.



A moment later, the apartment door flew open



Trudy stumbled inside, supporting Nolan's weight



His tall frame sagged against her, his face ashen, his eyes shut-he had collapsed entirely.



Eleanor's pupils shrank as she rushed forward to take him from Trudy.



His body radiated frightening heat.



She pressed her palm to his forehead, frowning deeply.



Why had his fever risen so suddenly?


And those bloodied bandages across his back... what exactly had happened?


Trudy stood aside, smoothing her loosened hair before speaking with a courteous smile. "Miss Warren,there's no need to worry. Nolan's condition isn't grave.Before bringing him here, I had someone bind his wounds and give him medicine for the fever."



Eleanor said nothing, guiding Nolan steadily toward the room. Trudy, unfazed by the cold shoulder, allowed her voice to trail pleasantly after her. "Miss Warren, I appreciate you caring for Nolan tonight. Once he and I marry, I'll certainly repay such kindness."



Assumingthe stance of Nolan's bride-to-be, she declared imperiously. "But Regal Heights belongs only to each Stewart head and their partner.Please make sure you don't leave anything there; otherwise tongues may wag."



Eleanor halted briefly, tilting her head so her frosty gaze met Trudy's face. "Ms. White,perhaps you speak too soon."



She turned back, her tone utterly flat. "Lilah, escort our guest outside."



Lilah, long irritated by Trudy, she replied instantly,"Yes, ma'am."



With a stern look, she motioned for Trudy to leave."Please,Ms.White."



Though irritation surged within her, Trudy's expression stayed composed as she exited gracefully.



At first, she intended for Nolan to remain at the Stewart family's estate, sharing quarters to seal their bond. However, Nolan insisted on returning to Podium Apartments,refusing any other option.



She had no alternative but to escort him here.



Still, it hardly mattered; plenty of time lay ahead.



Once she officially became Nolan's wife, countless means existed to handle unwelcome rivals.



Stepping outside, Trudy glanced toward the corner where a planted reporter waited and offered a subtle nod.



The reporter instantly caught on and gave a confirming nod in return.
###Chapter 260 A Kiss Would Heal Everything
Meanwhile, in the master bedroom, Eleanor summoned every ounce of her strength to maneuver Nolan onto the bed.



His substantial weight nearly overwhelmed her petite frame.



Just as she prepared to straighten up, a burning hand seized her wrist with surprising force



The world tilted suddenly around her.


Nolan dragged her down onto the mattress, trapping her beneath his fevered body.



Eleanor found herself completely immobilized, while the jealousy that had been brewing over Trudy began rising to the surface.



"What exactly are you doing? How did it feel receiving such devoted care from the lovely Ms. White?" she asked with bitter sarcasm.



Nolan lay with his eyes sealed shut,brow creased in obvious pain, his complexion flushed with unhealthy heat. He appeared to register her voice and mumbled incoherently, "Eleanor... My Eleanor is the most beautiful woman alive. Don't worry yourself. Grandpa may be furious, but I promise everything will work out perfectly."



His breath scorched against her neck as his voice carried a plaintive note. "But Eleanor, the pain is unbearable. A kiss would heal everything."



Eleanor pushed his head away with visible irritation."No way."



Yet suddenly, Nolan's body went completely slack.



Eleanor felt alarm spike through her as she quickly pressed her palm to his forehead. The temperature had climbed even higher than before.



Unable to waste another moment, she immediately retrieved her needles.



Following a comprehensive treatment session, Nolan's fever finally broke.



Completely drained, Eleanor could barely maintain consciousness as she collapsed beside the bed,slipping into restless slumber.



The following morning, Eleanor jolted awake to Erick's frantic voice. "Mr. Stewart! We have got a big  problem!"



Eleanor glanced at Nolan, who remained unconscious on the bed, before leaving the master bedroom."What's the situation?" she inquired.



Erick delivered his urgent report. "Last night, when Lilah escorted Ms. White from the apartment building,photographers captured everything. The images are spreading across the Internet rapidly! Countless online users are claiming, claiming that you-"



Following a brief hesitation, Erick struggled to continue, "They're suggesting that you, as the mistress, have stolen her rightful position."



Recalling Trudy's behavior as though she had already become Nolan's legitimate wife, Eleanor couldn't suppress a sound of annoyance.



She had to acknowledge the strategy's cleverness, far more sophisticated than Lainey's previous attempts.



However, she considered this entirely irrelevant to her circumstances, since Nolan's complications remained his responsibility to address.



Today marked Enigma's flagship store launch in Elepdon, featuring new collections alongside a charitable initiative, keeping Eleanor extraordinarily occupied. She cast a glance toward the bedroom before striding purposefully headed down the stairs.



Simultaneously, she instructed Erick, "Let Nolan handle the situation. Ready the car and escort me to the store."



Beyond Enigma's flagship location in Elepdon, crowds gathered in dense clusters.



Numerous fashion influencers and journalists had completely blocked the entrance.



Inside, Besty maintained composed supervision over the staff's final arrangements.



Eleanor,wearing an impeccably cut white suit,stepped elegantly onto the stage's center.


Her announcement rang clearly. "We appreciate everyone's unwavering support of Enigma Group. As our expression of gratitude, today's entire new collection will be offered at twenty percent below regular pricing."



At this declaration, the audience exploded into deafening applause.


This was Enigma, after all. Her creations typically remained beyond most people's reach, yet now they could not only purchase them, but at reduced prices?What a stroke of luck! Eleanor lifted her hand, gently gesturing for quiet,before sharing additional news. "Additionally, today's complete proceeds will be contributed to the Elepdon Welfare Center in honor of each purchaser."



This announcement sent the crowd into renewed frenzy.



Not only could they acquire Enigma's usually unattainable designs at discounted rates, but they could do so while supporting charitable causes?Where else could such a perfect opportunity exist?



Therefore,the moment Eleanor declared the opening,masses surged through the entrance.



The generous retail space quickly filled to capacity,bodies pressed together throughout.
###Chapter 261 You're The Intruder Here





The crowd had already drifted inside the boutique,leaving the entrance quiet.



Eleanor stepped down from the stage, ready to follow them in, when a familiar presence stopped her.



It was Trudy.



Dressed in a pale pink Atelier Veyron suit, she approached with her usual calm grace.



"Congratulations on your opening, Eleanor," she said with a warm smile.



Her eyes swept over the boutique's glittering display of gowns before she added, "The timing is perfect,actually. I'll be attending some important events with Nolan in the next few days, and I'll need a few formal gowns. Your designs are one of a kind, so l was hoping you could give me some recommendations." Betsy stood off to the side, her face tightening.


Trudy wasn't here to shop-she was here to stir trouble.



She moved to step forward and guide her out politely, but a clear, teasing voice interrupted from behind. "Well, we can't have Enigma wasting her time on something so trivial, can we?"


Lillian appeared, striding forward in a striking red dress paired with sky-high heels, exuding self-assurance with every step.


Her gaze flicked over Trudy, and she allowed herself a small,disdainful smile.


Lillian had just returned from Breoqua, already seething after hearing rumors about Fraser being set up on a blind date.



Not finding him there had left her on edge, and now seeing Eleanor cornered by Trudy only added fuel to her temper.

 
Who did this woman think she was, putting on air in front of Eleanor?


Determined to shut her down, Lillian stepped between the two women and introduced herself."Ms.White, I'm Lillian Brooks, shareholder of Enigma Group. Dresses are my specialty, so if you need help,I'll be glad to assist you."


Trudy didn't flinch. Her smile remained as polished as ever. "Ah; Ms. Brooks. I've heard quite a bit about you. In that case, I'd be grateful for your advice."


Eleanor observed Lillian's eager approach with a flicker of concern.



Trudy had been calculating, while Lillian tended to act with fiery impulsiveness, traits that didn't blend well.



Turning slightly, Eleanor leaned toward Betsy and murmured, "Keep an eye on them. Make sure Lillian doesn't get outmaneuvered."


"Understood, boss," Betsy said with a firm nod.


But trouble wasn't far off. In her usual blunt fashion, Lillian steered the conversation toward Trudy and Nolan's arranged marriage, pointedly warning her not to meddle where she didn't belong.


Trudy, however, wasn't about to back down. She raised her voice, clear enough for anyone nearby to hear. "Ms. Brooks, I'm just here to shop, nothing more. No need to treat me likean enemy. Besides,I've already promised Nolan that after we marry, I'll make sure Eleanor is treated kindly."


The unspoken message was clear that she was the "rightful" partner, magnanimnous and above petty jealousy, leaving Eleanor, the supposed mistress,untouched.



People around them exchanged uneasy glances.Wait, was Enigma, the celebrated designer, suddenly Nolan's mistress?



They had just witnessed Eleanor and Nolan openly showing their affection not long ago, and now here came Trudy, claiming to be the legitimate fiancée. The timing felt almost comically cruel, like fate was having a laugh at everyone's expense.



Lillian's anger flared at Trudy's words.


Eleanor and Nolan had history; they were the original pair. And Trudy, an intruder, had the audacity to act so generous?



She was about to snap, but Eleanor gently tugged at her to hold back.



Stepping in front of Lillian, Eleanor faced Trudy calmly. "Ms. White, I don't know why you agreed to marry Nolan, but the fact is, Nolan and I announced our engagement before you. Lillian isn't wrong. By every measure, you're the intruder here. Just because you have Norwood in your corner doesn't mean you can distort the facts."



Eleanor rarely went into such detail, but today was different. She had to call out Trudy's hypocrisy, and quickly, before Lillian got caught in the crossfire.


After all, Lillian was standing up for her, and she fail her friend.
###Chapter 262 Why Would You Upset Her
Trudy never imagined Eleanor would voice such words in front of everyone, and her face soured instantly.


Still, recalling the backing she enjoyed from both her and Nolan's grandfathers, she steadied herself in an instant.


She adjusted her crumpled gown, recovered her refined bearing, and retorted in a calm, measured voice, "Eleanor, you misrepresent everything.Whatever ties you share wth Nolan amount only to a fleeting affair unworthy of serious acknowledgment."


With a sudden shift in tone, she carried on, "Yet I remain generous. As long as Nolan feels content,I have no complaints. I promised Norwood a chess match, so I must excuse myself. I shall not intrude further." After saying this, Trudy pivoted gracefully and exited.


Lillian stood stunned beyond words, breath caught in her throat. "Eleanor! How can she display such brazen audacity?"


Eleanor, however, stayed composed, resting her palm lightly on Lillian's hand as a quiet reassurance.


Lillian, nevertheless, refused to move past it. Why should Eleanor bear the stigma of being a mnistress?


Around them, reporters and fans surged forward,unleashing a storm of questions.


"Ms. Brooks, how do you answer the rumors flooding the Internet?"



"Didn't Enigma and Nolan have an engagement? Why is she being branded as another woman?"


"Is Enigma truly despised by the Stewart family?"


Hearing the uproar, Lillian's fury deepened.


Even so, she recognized Trudy's remarkable skill at distorting reality. As her eyes swept the flashing cameras, inspiration struck suddenly.



If Trudy chose to engage in the battle of public opinion, Lillian resolved to join the game and let her suffer the consequences of her own schemes.



She would never allow anyone to trample Eleanor.







After leaving the store, Trudy slid into the Maybach idling nearby.


She sank into the leather seat, uunfastened her earrings, and tossed them into the armrest box.


Next, she drew out her phone, scrolling through the online chatter with amusement.



Her lips curved with satisfaction as she discovered the earlier drama had already climbed to the top of trending searches.



Very soon, the world would accept that she was destined to become Nolan's wife, while Eleanor was reduced to a mere mistress.


Relishing the thought, Trudy started the engine,riding high on triumph.



Yet her elation quickly dissolved.


Barely two junctions later, her phone rang shrilly.


Answering, she heard her father, Miguel White,raging. "Did you step foot in Enigma's shop today?"


Trudy, unconcerned, answered lightly, "Yes. Eleanor marked an important day, so I went to offer congratulations."



Miguel exploded. "Congratulations? Do you grasp that White Group's stock is collapsing? Enigma's fans are boycotting our products everywhere! Why would you upset her?"



What?



Trudy's head spun, blank and ringing.



Stock collapsing? How was that even possible? Without a moment to process, she slammed the phone down, pulled over to the curb, and shaking,tapped open her social media app.



The trending list had shifted, overtaken by tags like #Enigma'sFansAgainstSlander,#TrudyThelntruder,#TrudyApologizeToEleanor,	and #BoycottingWhiteGroup.


How could everything unravel so fast?


Rattled and panicked, she clicked the hottest post,a long piece written by one of Enigma's prominent fans.



The headline struck like a blow. It read, "Exposing Trudy's Hypocrisy."


The article displayed a detailed chronological chart,documenting every milestone of Eleanor and Nolan's romance, each backed by media coverage or event photos.



Trudy's name appeared only six months after Eleanor and Nolan had declared their relationship publicly. After that came viral snapshots portraying the so-called "mistress flaunting happiness while the real partner wept."


Each image was dissected meticulously, frame by frame.



The piece ended with surveillance video from Enigma's boutique, capturing Trudy declaring herself Nolan's fiancée.



The comment thread seethed with outrage.



"Unbelievable! What a twist-Trudy White is vile."


"With that performance, she should join the theater."



"My heart goes out to Lillian, insulted so viciously by such deceit."



"And Eleanor-how unjust, being with Nolan from the start yet branded an intruder."


"White Group? Say no more. I'm done buying from them!"



Trudy's vision blurred as she scrolled. She never dreamed Eleanor's supporters wielded such force.



Defeat stared her in the face.



Yet none of it mattered.



Online uproar was meaningless.


If she had a secure marriage with Nolan, she remained victorious.



That thought dulled her fury slightly.


Yet, watching the online insults pile up alongside White Group's tumbling stock prices, she couldn't quell her resentment.


She vowed not to forgive, and resolved to make Eleanor and Lillian suffer greatly for today's disgrace.
###Chapter 263 We Could Make A Strong Alliance
Trudy parked outside the Stewart family's estate and quickly fixed her makeup before stepping out of the car.



At times like this, staying calm and collected was more important than anything else.



She carried a chessboard she had carefully picked out for Norwood and walked toward the gates with a smooth, confident step, but Hector stopped her before she could get any closer.


"Ms. White," Hector said, standing in her way, "this isn't a good time. Mr. Stewart is taking a nap right now."



Trudy's smile faltered for a moment.


 
A nap? It was already two in the afternoon, and Norwood was rarely still at this hour.


She knew immediately that this was just an excuse.


It was clear he was upset about the White Group's stock dropping so fast, and on top of that, she had been criticized all over the Internet.


Suppressing her irritation, Trudy gave Hector a polite smile and turned back toward her car.


From a distance, inside a sleek black Maybach,Wray watched the scene and clicked his tongue softly. "I didn't realize Eleanor had this much influence. Even Trudy can't compete with her," he muttered.


Still, that presented an opportunity for him.


He had just left the Stewart family's estate himself.


Norwood had been so angry over the White Group's stock tanking that he smashed a costly vase.


In business, profit always came first, and alliances came right after. Once the White family lost their value, Norwood could drop them at any time.


And Wray saw his opening.


Brodie, leaning lazily in the car, noted the ambition in Wray's eyes. "The White Group's stock has hit rock bottom, but the Perry family still counts for something. Consider this an early congrats, Wray.You might just win Trudy's heart."


Wray smoothed his suit and hair, brushed off imaginary dust, and stepped out of the car, standing directly in front of Trudy as she moved to get inside.


He greeted her with a polite smile. "Ms. White, hi.I'm Wray Stewart."


Trudy gave him a brief glance, taking in the man who had replaced Nolan as the head of the Stewart Group.


She kept her composure, giving a polite nod as she tried to pass him.


But Wray wasn't finished. His voice had an edge to it  as he spoke again. "I just visited Norwood.He was furious after seeing the news about the White Group's stock crash. And it seems even you were held at the door. Perhaps he's reconsidering the alliance between our families."



When she heard that, Trudy's stepscame to an abrupt stop.


She looked up at Wray in disbelief. "What do you mean?"



Norwood wanted to call off the engagement?


That couldn't be happening.



She couldn't risk being rejected like this.


She and her family would end up being a joke in town.



Wray noticed the flash of disbelief in her eyes and knew he had already scored half the battle.


He took a step closer, adopting a calm, polished smile, trying to appear the perfect gentleman. "I'm  just offering a friendly suggestion," he said smoothly."l've recently stepped in as CEO of the Stewart Group. Perhaps it's time to consider another partner.Together, we could make a strong alliance, and surely-"



But before he could finish, Trudy's sharp intuition kicked in. Her expression turned icy, and she cut him off with a sneer.


"Excuse me?" she snapped. "Who do you think you are? A distant relative trying to compare yourself to Nolan? If you so much as step out of line, I'll mnake sure my grandfather handles it."


Wray's eyes narrowed as he watched her car pull away.


Damn it!



That woman!


And the comparison to Nolan... it burned him more than anything.


Why did Nolan have everything handed to him,while  he had to fight tooth and nail for even a little recognition?


Clenching his jaw, Wray walked back to his car, his face as cold as ice.


Brodie, noticing the frustration written all over him,let out a mocking whistle. "Looks like she's not an easy one to impress."


That only fueled Wray's anger more.


Always Nolan.



Always the perfect one.


One day, he would even the score.


And as for Trudy, who did she think she was? As CEO of the Stewart Group, he could have any woman he wanted.
###Chapter 264 You're The Only Onel Care About
Wray was fuming with anger, and Trudy wasn't in a much better mood herself.


She felt tense and uneasy.


Norwood's stance wasn't as steady as it had been before. He could pull the plug on the engagement at any moment.


She couldn't just sit there and wait for it to happen.


She had to prove herself-not just to the Stewart family, but to everyone watching. She needed to show that her worth went far beyond the White Group. Marrying her would be the smartest move the Stewarts could make.


Biting her lip in thought, she stared ahead for a moment before her expression hardened. Finally, she gave the driver a sharp order. "Turn the car around.  Head to my grandparents'."



Meanwhile,Eleanor had no idea any of this was happening.



The Enigma store's grand opening stretched late into the evening.



By the time the day ended, sales had astonishingly surpassed ten million.



Every penny would soon be donated to Elepdon Welfare Center under the names of the customers,promising a brighter future for countless children.



Plans were already taking shape to establish multiple orphanages, reaching even more homeless kids.


Lillian's eyes sparkled with excitement. She grabbed Eleanor's hand and practically pulled her along."Eleanor, come on! We have to celebrate. I know the perfect spot. The Crown Club has tons of good-looking guys lately. Trust me, it'll be amazing!"


Eleanor couldn't help smiling at Lillian's excitement.  Just as she was about to respond, a familiar figure caught her attention.



Nolan had arrived.


He was leaning casually against a black Bentley, his tailored suit emphasizing his tall, commanding presence.



The streetlight cast a long shadow behind him,and he watched her silently, like a loyal companion patiently waiting.



Lillian followed Eleanor's eyes and saw him, and her smile immediately faded.


Had he heard everything she just said?



Panic overtook her. She quickly raised a hand to her forehead,faking dizziness. "Eleanor, I feel a little faint all of a sudden. Maybe I overdid it today. I should head home.Have fun,okay?"


Before she could answer, Lillian bolted.



Eleanor chuckled softly, shaking her head. Typical  Lillian.



By the way, wasn't Erick supposed to pick herup?


Apparently, Nolan had taken his place.


He walked over smoothly, opened the car door for her with quiet courtesy, and Eleanor leaned in gracefully to get inside.


The car was calm, the only sound their soft breaths.



Eleanor was about to start talking about the day's amazing opening when Nolan suddenly leaned close,capturing her in a firm, possessive kiss.


Their lips met, and the small space around them seemed to hum with heat.


By the time Nolan finally pulled away, Eleanor was nearly breathless. He lingered, reluctant to let go, his fingertips brushing her swollen, red lips.His gaze burned into hers. "Eleanor, where did Lillian say she wanted to take you?"


Jealousy radiated from him in every word. Eleanor couldn't help but laugh inwardly but kept her expression sweet and innocent. "Oh, we didn't go anywhere. You're the only one I care about. I like you the most. Let's go back to my apartment. I'm starving."


She reached out and gently ruffled his hair,a tender gesture that calmed him instantly.


Nolan's lips curved into a satisfied smile. He settled back into his seat and started the car.



At a red light, he pulled out his phone and sent a quick message to Ryland.



"Keep an eye on your sister. Don't let her lead Eleanor astray."


Far away, Ryland stared at the message, utterly confused.



What had Lillian done this time to earn Nolan's wrath?



He looked up at the sky and let out a long,resigned sigh. Ever since Nolan and Eleanor had gotten together,life for him and his sister had been anything but easy.


Why had they done to deserve this?
###Chapter 265 What Delightful Timing!





Over the following days, Eleanor bounced between the Hope House and Podium Apartments like a restless spirit.


Since they weren't living together, Nolan felt utterly abandoned.



Without her constant presence, Nolan felt like a forgotten relic gathering dust. That day, he missed Eleanor so much that he headed for her apartment early i the morning.



Cradling his coffee cup, he savored each sip with deliberate slowness.When Eleanor emerged ready to leave, he sprang to his feet like a coiled spring."Eleanor, venturing out somewhere? How about I chauffeur you around?"


As luck would have it, Eleanor genuinely needed transportation. Myah's frantic call had just come through about a forgotten notebook lurking at the Hope House's abandoned site, and she desperately needed Eleanor's assistance in hunting it down.



Eleanor tilted her chin upward, masking her thoughts behind a theatrical pause. "Where did Erick go?" she probed.


Nolan's lie rolled off his tongue like silk. "Shipped him off on urgent business to the neighboring city.He's trapped there for the next few days."


The universe had other plans. Footsteps echoed from the entrance at that precise moment.



Erick materialized in the doorway, briefcase clutched in his grip, having absorbed every word that had just spilled from Nolan's mouth.



Time seemed to freeze around him.



Was he showing up at the wrong time?


When exactly had Nolan sent him to the neighboring city? Why was he completely in the dark about this?


Despite his bewilderment, Erick grasped the situation perfectly. Nolan was desperate for private moments with Eleanor, and retreating gracefully was his only option.


Eleanor crossed her arms with amusement, watching in the unfolding scene.


Embarrassment flashed across Nolan's features before vanishing behind his carefully constructed mask.



He coughed deliberately and launched daggers at Erick with his gaze. "Why you here? Weren't you supposed to be on a business trip in the neighboring city?"


Erick's entire frame quaked as enlightenment struck,and he bowed his head in swift surrender. "I... I just rushed back to check for any additional orders."


Nolan's hand cut through the air dismissively."Nothing else required." Relief flooded through Erick as he bolted from the scene likea man escaping wildfire.


Nolan's attention swiveled back to Eleanor, hope blazing in his expression.



Eleanor shook her head with resigned amusement before striding toward the exit without ceremony.



Nolan trailed after her like a devoted shadow.



The sleek black Bentley soon glided away from the apartment building.



Time had not been kind to the Hope House's original location. Crimson brick walls now wore thick coats of emerald moss like forgotten armor.



Together, they forced open the protesting iron gates and ventured into the abandoned grounds.



Drawing on muscle memory, Eleanor navigated straight to Myah's old office and located the hefty notebook buried beneath layers of neglect.


She brushed away the accumulated dust and caught Nolan's eye, signaling their mission complete.


But fate had other plans. As they pivoted toward the exit,they collided with an unexpected gathering.


At the front stood Wray, absent from their lives for countless days.


A garishly dressed woman clung to his arm while Wray's chin tilted with arrogant satisfaction. "Baby,I'll demolish this place and erect a magnificent villa in your honor," he said.


The woman pressed herself closer, her voice dripping artificial sweetness. "Thank you, Mr.Stewart. That's so kind of you."


Wray basked in her theatrical worship, then his gaze landed on Nolan and Eleanor standing nearby, along with the weathered notebook clutched in Eleanor's grip.


Victory melted from his features, replaced by cruel amusement. Nolan?
What business did he have skulking around this forgotten wasteland?


And why was Eleanor clutching such worthless refuse?



What a golden opportunity to humiliate him!


Malice sparked in Wray's eyes as he projected his voice with theatrical flair. "Well, well! Nolan! W/hat delightful timing! Has fortune abandoned you so completely that you've resorted to scavenging through ruins for scraps? If money troubles are plaguing you, a simple conversation would have sufficed. Despite my modest means, I'd gladly spare some charity for a distant relative!"


Nolan and Eleanor treated him like empty air,continuing their exit.


Unfortunately, Wray's entourage formed a human barricade across their escape route.


"Trying to leave?" Wray's smile turned predatory,"Certainly, but first surrender that stolen stuff." His contemptuous stare fixed on the logbook in Eleanor's possession. "This property belongs to Stewart Group, after all. Should inventory go missing,explaining such losses to my superiors would prove...challenging."


The woman draped across Wray's arm released a tinkling laugh, each note poisoned with mockery. "Oh my, look what the cat dragged in. If it isn't the illustrious Nolan himself. Who could have predicted you'd escort this lovely lady on a common burglary expedition?"
###Chapter 266 Try To Understand Them,Eleanor
Eleanor's eyes sharpened instantly, a frosty edge cutting through the tension.


Clutching the notebook against her chest, she stepped forward, positioning herself in front of Nolan. Her gaze pierced the heavily made-up woman standing arrogantly before them.


"Mind your words," Eleanor said icily. "This used to be an orphanage. We're simply retrieving what belongs here."



Nolan's face mirrored Eleanor's frost; his stare hardened like frozen steel.


How could Wray,barely a distant relative of his, dare to sully Eleanor's reputation?


He was practically inviting disaster.



 A shiver ran down Wray's spine under Nolan's relentless glare, yet he forced calm over his features.


Norwood's backing had fortified his position, while Nolan had lost everything.Why tremble before him?


Moreover, with a beautiful companion around, he couldn't let Nolan have the upper hand.


Steeling himself, Wray lifted his chin and projected confidence, though it rang hollow. "This site is now part of Stewart Group's major Usepsall development.Forget that tattered notebook; you won't touch a single page!"


He motioned to the bodyguards behind him,signaling an escalation. "Grab the notebook from them!"



Tension crackled immediately across the room.


Suddenly, a piercing ringtone shattered the standoff.


Irritated, Wray yanked out his phone and answered without glancing at the caller ID. "Who is this? Don't you know I'm busy?" The voice on the line stopped him cold. Arrogance drained from his features, replaced by stark shock.


Beads of chilly sweat formed on his forehead, his skin grew ghostly pale, and his voice quivered with panic. "What? This can't be... Fine, fine, I'm on my way!"


Shaking violently, Wray ended the call. When he turned toward Nolan, the prior smugness had vanished entirely, leaving sheer terror in its place.


Even panicked, he tried to assert dominance,blurting out a threat to mask his fear. "I'll let this slide now!Next time, I'll settle scores with you!"


He bolted, abandoning the stunning woman entirely.


"Move! Let's go!" he shouted as he urged his men forward.



The group scattered chaotically, leaving the glamorous woman frozen, dumbfounded by their abrupt departure.


Eleanor observed the spectacle, eyebrows drawn in  confusion.



What could have frightened an arrogant Wray so completely?


Nolan's brow furrowed. He was equally perplexed.


Could the company be facing trouble?


For the moment, those worries took a back seat.


Ensuring Eleanor completed her task mattered more than speculative concerns.


Gently brushing dust from her shoulder, he murmured, "Ignore him. Let's get this to Myah first."


They had only just arrived at the Hope House when Nolan got a call from Erick.


Eleanor wasn't able to catch the details, yet she noticed Nolan's face grow darker with concern.


Once he ended the call, Eleanor pressed, "What happened?"


His lips pressed into a tight line, voice low and  steady. "The Perry family has intervened."



Trudy's grandfather wielded immense influence,capable of covertly undermining the Stewart Group.


This time, they had seized an entire quarter of overseas shipments, citing customs irregularities,striking at Stewart Group's financial lifeline.


No wonder Wray had been terrified earlier.


Although he no longer led the Stewart Group,standing idle was impossible. The empire represented his grandfather's lifetime of toil and the family's enduring foundation.


Still, Eleanor didn't need the full story; he couldn't bear to burden her with fear.


Meeting her gaze with regret, he said, "I'm sorry,Eleanor, I can't accompany you inside. A driver will pick you up afterward."


Eleanor sensed the weight of the crisis in his tense demeanor.  He offered no details, so she didn't push any further.


Eleanor nodded softly. "Understood. You handle your matters first."



Then she opened the car door and stepped out.


Nolan watched until she entered the Hope House,then drove away silently.


Eleanor carried the heavy notebook into the courtyard.





Myah sat on a small stool, glasses perched on her nose,darning a child's worn clothing.


Spotting Eleanor, she set aside her tools, her expression brightening. "Eleanor, you're here."


Eleanor nodded, extending the notebook.


"| found it, Myah. Here."


Myah's hands remained folded; instead, her gaze softened.



"Open it. See for yourself."  Curious, Eleanor obeyed, opening the fragile notebook carefully.


The pages were yellowed and delicate, each carrying decades of memories.


She turned slowly, scanning the names, admission dates, and brief notes for every child.



Her fingers froze on one entry.


Right there, written in bold letters, stood her name-Eleanor Warren.


A small, faded photo was attached.


The infant in the photograph lay swaddled in a soft blanket, appearing only a few months old. Her face was angelic, and her large, round eyes glimmered.


Intricate clothing hinted she had not come from ordinary circumstances.


Beside her rested a finely carved wooden rabbit.

 
The photograph radiated love, care, and protection.  Eleanor's heart pounded as unfamiliar emotions swelled inside her.


Myah, standing beside her, spoke gently, a faint sigh accompanying her words. "When parents lose a child, the suffering is theirs alone. The child grows up and moves forward, but parents endure the torment continuously."


Her hand rested lightly on Eleanor's shoulder.


"Try to understand them, Eleanor. These years have weighed on them too."


With that, Myah stepped away, leaving Eleanor in quiet reflection.



Eleanor lingered over the photograph, lost in thought, emotions swirling silently.
###Chapter 267 You're My Pride, Nolan





At the same moment, Nolan steered toward the Stewart family's estate.


The Perry family's abrupt interference had triggered chaos that Grandpa had unwittingly unleashed.


If Grandpa became aware of his oversight, remorse would overwhelm him completely.


His health was fragile already, and he might crumble under the burden.



Unfortunately, Nolan's fears were confirmed.


Passing through the house's massive oak doors,Nolan froze at the sight of physicians and nurses hustling across the living room, their expressions shadowed with concern.



Was Grandpa in trouble?


A shiver of dread raced through Nolan, his chest constricting with each cautious step.


Hector, the loyal family butler, hurried toward him,relief etched across his features. "Mr. Stewart,you've finally returned. The Perry family has acted against the Stewart Group. When your grandfather learned the news, he collapsed immediately."


Anxiety laced his voice as he continued, "What should we do? The delivery deadline is tomorrow,and missing it would trigger tenfold penalties. I fear this might destabilize everything the Stewarts have built over a century."


Nolan tightened his fists, determination blazing in his eyes.


What audacity from the Perry family.


What a shrewd maneuver by Trudy.


Tyler Perry had crossed into forbidden territory.Was he truly willing to challenge our family's authority?


The boundary separating politics from business had always been untouchable. If Tyler defied those limits, he would respond without mercy.


With that resolve, he retrieved his phone and typed a message to an associate in Zerovia.


"Alert your boss. Prepare a plan. Identify the ideal moment to bring Tyler Perry down."


No sooner had he slipped the device into his pocket than a doctor emerged hastily. "Your grandfather is awake,though still weak. You should enter now."


Nolan stepped forward.


In only a few days, Norwood appeared a decade older, his face pale as he leaned against the headboard. Sighting Nolan, he forced a faint,weary smile. "Never anticipated this... I spent decades striving, believing the Perry family's influence would elevate us. Instead, they outwitted me, and I've jeopardized half our empire."


Nolan advanced slightly, his voice firm yet soothing.
"Grandpa, I'm here. I will ensure the company Norwood examined him long and silently before exhaling a burdened sigh.


He had always been cunning, rarely faltering,except in his dealings with Trudy and the Perry family.


Blind ambition and hunger for power had led him astray.


He had almost destroyed the Stewarts, and now, his only hope depended on the grandson he had nurtured. "You're my pride, Nolan. I trust you completely."


He glanced at Hector, standing quietly nearby, and issued a solemn command. "Contact the board immediately. Remove Wray from the presidency and restore Nolan as leader. Also, transfer fifty percent of my shares to Nolan."


Hector's eyebrows lifted slightly.


That quantity of stock granted total authority to Nolan. Yet he nodded without hesitation. "Understood, sir."Once Hector departed, silence reclaimed the room.

Norwood's weary eyes found Nolan's. "This is all |can offer now. I'm relying on you to protect our legacy."
Nolan gripped his grandfather's hand firmly,unwavering. "Grandpa, don't fear. I will manage everything."
By the time Nolan exited the estate, the afternoon sun illuminated the grounds.
Instead of driving to the office, he called Lilah. "Stay with Eleanor without pause."
With the Perry family striking, Nolan couldn't allow Eleanor to remain alone in her apartment.
Lilah sensed the seriousness instantly. "Yes, sir. I won't leave her side."
###Chapter 268 The Stewart Group Will Collapse
The next morning, Eleanor learned about the turmoil surrounding the Stewart Group from the news.


Her phone screen dimmed gradually, and her fingers tightened with sudden tension.


The Perry family, holding certain sway in political circles, would never act without concrete proof.


Nolan must be grappling with a difficult situation.


Without thinking, she decided to text Nolan.


Her fingertips hovered briefly, typed a few words,then erased them with frustration.



She wanted to know how he was holding up and offer support if he needed it.


Yet she knew such questions might only burden him  further.


A man as proud as Nolan would never reveal weakness to outsiders, much less to her.


What he required now was not idle concern but unwavering faith.


Any intrusion from her would merely distract him.



She had to place her trust entirely in him.



With that realization, Eleanor set her phone aside,swallowing the rush of emotion.


Still, a peculiar restlessness lingered in her chest.


Nolan must be swamped, and he was probably skipping meals again.


After a brief pause, she called the driver. "Prepare the car. I need to run to the nearby supermarket."


The driver responded promptly, his tone respectful,"Understood."


 
Two hours passed, and Eleanor emerged carrying  two heavy grocery bags.


As she headed toward the car parked along the curb,two familiar figures caught her eye under a sunshade nearby.


It was Wray and Trudy.


Thoughts of the Stewart Group's crisis made her pause instinctively, then she moved closer.


Just then, Wray's exasperated voice rang out."Trudy! What exactly are you up to? You've nearly destroyed me! I've lost my CEO position and now face legal trouble. I'm warning you, tell your family to back off. Otherwise, everyone will know you're responsible!"


Trudy stirred her coffee lazily, her composure completely unshaken. "Instead of threats,you should convince Nolan to honor the marriage agreement.Otherwise, the Stewart Group will collapse."


Her confidence soared, bolstered by Tyler's support.


She no longer just wanted to be Nolan's lawful wife;  she wanted him kneeling, begging for her favor.


Wray seethed at her audacity, yet found no words to respond.


He understood that even exposing the truth would accomplish nothing against Trudy.


After all, the former chief financial officer appointed by Brodie was corrupt, and the current tax problem was entirely his responsibility.


The Perry family was merely exploiting the situation to exert pressure.


Seeing Wray silent, Trudy sneered, her gaze full of disdain.



She straightened her dress, rose elegantly, and walked away.


With her back turned, Eleanor remained unnoticed.


Wray,however, noticed immediately.


He stormed toward her, voice sharp with accusation.

"You troublemaker! This is your fault! Had you not  provoked Trudy, the Stewart Group wouldn't be in this chaos, and I'd still be the thriving interim CEO!"


Eleanor had no desire to argue with a man like Wray.


She ignored him completely and slid into her car.


Her eyes followed Trudy's departing figure, a frown forming.


Eleanor hadn't anticipated that the Perrys were merely pressuring Nolan to force concessions, and that Trudy would go so far to make Nolan marry her.


Clearly, Nolan faced immense challenges this time.


Yet she believed he could endure and prevail.


Just as she reached home and prepared to start cooking, her phone rang. It was Hilda.


"Eleanor, I heard about the Stewart Group," Hilda said cautiously.


Her grip on the phone tightened, memories of yesterday's photo flashing in her mind. Hadn't Hilda endured so many hardships over the years?


While she lingered in thought, Hilda's anxious voice came again. "Eleanor, don't worry. Your father and I will definitely support them."


Eleanor snapped back to reality, intending to decline,yet somehow replied, "Thank you."


Her voice sounded awkward, leaving Hilda utterly stunned.



Even after hanging up, Hilda remained frozen in disbelief.


Jeff, standing beside her, caught her reaction and quickly asked, "Honey, what's wrong?"


Hilda turned toward him, her expression brightening with joy. "Jeff, Eleanor just accepted our help and thanked me."



Could this mean she was beginning to forgive them?


Jeff understood immediately, and elation washed  over him. "That's wonderful, truly wonderful."


They embraced, tears streaming as relief and happiness overwhelmed them.
###Chapter 269 Things Are Starting To Improve
Eleanor assembled a meal, carefully placing it inside an insulated lunchbox, before picking up the phone to call Erick.


"I prepared some food. Could you deliver it to Nolan?" she asked. "His stomach is delicate, and he mustn't go hungry while working."


Silence stretched across the line, leaving Eleanor uneasy and tense.


After wvhat felt like an eternity, Erick's tensed voice finally came through. "Miss Warren, I'm afraid Mr.Stewart isn't seeing anyone at the moment, including me."



Even Erick, who had spent the most time by Nolan's side, was now kept distant.


A heavy wave of concern weighed on Eleanor. She  pictured Nolan buried in stress, carrying a burden far greater than most could imagine.


Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles paled.


"Alright. I understand." Eleanor ended the call,her brows drawn tight.


No, she couldn't allow matters to continue this way.


Determined, she resolved to return to the villa in Regal Heights, knowing he would eventually come back for clothes and vital documents.


With resolve firm, Eleanor turned to Lilah. "Lilah,pack our bags. We're leaving for Regal Heights."


Lilah hesitated briefly, then nodded with understanding, replying politely, "Yes, ma'am."


Eleanor had made the right choice.


By the next morning, Nolan had returned.


Fatigue clung to him, his appearance exhausted and drained. Eleanor nearly leapt from the sofa,rushing to his side. "You're finally home," she said, her voice threaded with concern.


Nolan lifted a hand, brushing her cheek with gentle care. "Yes, I'm back," he murmured, his voice hoarse and eyes bloodshot.


For days, Nolan had buried himself in endless work,using every task as a shield against his thoughts.


Yet during the quiet hours of the night, only her face haunted his mind.



He refused to worry Eleanor and feared that revealing the Stewart Group's dire crisis would shatter her peace.


So he shut himself off, avoiding everyone,determined to fix everything swiftly and appear before her unharmed.



He hadn't anticipated Eleanor waiting for him at the villa.



Nolan pulled her close, resting his chin lightly on her shoulder. "Don't worry. Things are starting to improve."


Noticing his hesitation to explain, Eleanor stayed silent, refraining from asking for more.


Eleanor nodded and leaned into his embrace silently.


Just as they parted, Erick rushed in, his expression shadowed with urgency.


"Mr. Stewart, bad news. Our team discovered the company's tax situation is indeed troubling."


Eleanor's stomach sank.


Companies could survive occasional setbacks, but a tax investigation by authorities was devastating.


Once the accusation became official, any future government contracts would vanish for the Stewart Group.


The family's century-long reputation risked ruin.


Nolan's face remained composed, though his eyes sharpened to ice. "Continue," he instructed. Erick said quickly, "After Wray assumed control, the newly appointed CFO, Sheppard, exploited his position to fabricate accounts and siphon off significant tax funds. The Internal Revenue Service has collected evidence and is preparing charges."


Wray's carelessness had invited disaster.


Nolan's stare hardened as he issued precise orders."Immediately secure all surveillance and digital records from Sheppard's office. Have the legal team work overnight to compile proof that his actions were personal, not company-related. Also, calculate the tax shortfall and settle it at once."


Erick, who had been tense moments ago, found direction in Nolan's clarity. "Understood, Mr.Stewart."



He departed swiftly,moving without hesitation.
###Chapter 270 Your Grandpa Is Gravely
As the tension coiled within Nolan began to unwind,his phone pierced the calm with Hector's urgent call.


"Mr.Stewart! Your grandpa is gravely ill!" Hector's voice trembled with panic.


Nolan felt a chill course through him, his voice quivering as he pressed. "What has happened?"



Sobs choked Hector's words on the other end. "It's Brodie. He returned briefly, shared a few heated words with your grandfather in the study, and moments after he left, your grandfather fainted!"


Nolan's eyes blazed with fury and fear as he ended the call. Without a moment's hesitation, he bolted for the door, his heart pounding with dread.


Losing his grandfather was unthinkable. Eleanor, witnessing his frantic departure, felt her chest tighten. Instinctively, she snatched a coat from the sofa and raced after him. "I'm coming with you,"she called out.



They arrived at the Stewart family's estate in a whirlwind, Nolan charging into the main bedroom with desperate urgency.


He seized the arm of Norwood's doctor, his voice sharp."How is he?"



The doctor turned, his face etched with solemnity and shook his head. "Mr. Stewart, I'm afraid you must brace for the worst. His age and frail health make this shock too great to bear."



Nolan's sturdy frame swayed, nearly crumpling under the weight of the words.


Eleanor steadied him, her gaze shifting to the frail figure on the bed.


Norwood's time was slipping away.



Though Eleanor's medical prowess was renowned she harbored doubts about saving him.



Yet she couldn't stand idly by, not when Nolan faced such a devastating loss.


With unwavering determination, Eleanor opened her acupuncture kit and approached the bedside.



Her hands danced with precision, placing needles until Norwood's form resembled a pincushion.


The doctor gaped, astonishment widening his eyes."Miss Warren, what are you doing?"


To his disbelief, Norwood's pallor began to warm, a soft flush returning to his cheeks.



How was that even possible?



Wasn't this the kind of miracle only the Soul Surgeon could perform?



Wait,was Eleanor the Soul Surgeon?



Upon realizing this, the doctor stood in stunned disbelief. No longer concealing her skill,Eleanor removed the needles and began another round of meticulous acupuncture.


Moments later, Norwood coughed violently, his eyelids fluttering open.


He was awake.


Against all odds, he had pulled through.


The doctor stood in awe, his admiration for Eleanor boundless.


Nolan, overcome with relief, clasped Norwood's hand tightly. "Grandpa, how are you feeling?"


As their heartfelt exchange unfolded, Eleanor quietly gathered her kit and slipped away.


She sensed that, apart from Trudy, she was likely the last person Norwood wished to see.


Thus,she was loath to provoke him further.


As she approached the front door, a sardonic voice sliced through the stillness. "Miss Warren, your performance was nothing short of spectacular."



Brodie had appeared unnoticed, lounging against the wall with a derisive smirk playing on his lips. "But what does it avail you to save him? In his eyes, you'll forever be the unwelcome shadow. As long as he lingers, you and Nolan can never get married.Doesn't that chafe?"



He drew nearer, bending to whisper in her ear,his tone thick with cajolery. "Moreover, Nolan's on the brink of ruin. Why tether yourself to a sinking ship?Why not jump to a steadier deck?"



At his words, Eleanor's lips curved into a smile,though her eyesglinted with frost, her voice sharp with mockery."Are you so certain of that?"


Brodie straightened, flicking his hair from his brow with a return to his habitual nonchalance. "The tax scandal is ironclad. Nolan's trapped, and even if he wriggles free, the Stewart Group is a wounded giant,destined never to reclaim its former splendor!" Eleanor found his cocksure attitude almost comical."lf the Stewart dynasty crumbles, do you truly believe you, an illegitimate child, and your spineless father will emerge unscathed?"


She paused, her stare turning glacial. "And what makes you think Nolan stands alone in this fight?"



Brodie's brow furrowed in confusion. "What are you implying?"


Eleanor's smile was enigmatic as she replied, "All in good time,you'll see."


Without another glance his way, she slipped into the waiting car.



Brodie's taunts were nothing but the bluster of a feckless fool.



She dismissed them without a second thought.



Her true concern lay with the formidable Perry family,particularly the influential Tyler, Trudy's grandfather.


With resolve, Eleanor directed the driver in a calm,


clear voice, "To the Elepdon Sanatorium."


"Very well," the driver replied with a nod, setting the car in motion.
###Chapter 271 We'll Help You Find Someone Worthy
About thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop at the gates of Elepdon Sanatorium.



The courtyard hadn't changed; it still carried that quiet charm Eleanor knew so well. But the peace was instantly broken by the sound of bickering. On the patio, Dyer and David were hunched over a chessboard, locked in one of their endless battles.



"You can't just take your move back! That's blatant cheating!" Dyer snapped, stabbing a finger at the board.



David's face reddened. "Cheating? You're blind, old man. Maybe if you cleaned your glasses once in a while,you'd see the board properly!"


 
Eleanor couldn't help but smile helplessly at the sight. Between the two of them, they were close to two hundred years old, yet they bickered with the energy of squabbling schoolboys.


She cleared her throat softly as she walked over.


At once, both men stopped mid-argument and looked her way.


When they recognized her, their stern expressions melted into delight.


"Well, look who it is!" Dyer laughed, rising to his feet and ushering her toward a chair. "What wind blew you here today?"


"You should've told us in advance," David added,puffing up his cheeks. "We could've prepared something special for you."


Eleanor wasted no time. "I actually came because need your advice and your help."


She explained the current trouble looming over the Stewart Group and how the Perry family was pressing down hard.  The chessboard was forgotten the moment she finished.


Dyer's brows knitted together, and he let out a disapproving huff. "So Nolan can't even hold his own ground? He needs you to carry the burden for him?That boy isn't fit for you."


David's palm came down hard on the table. "Exactly!That boy is nothing but a disappointment. You deserve better. We'll help you find someone worthy."


Their words left Eleanor torn between feeling touched and exasperated.


She knew their anger was only born of concern for her, yet she couldn't let them misjudge Nolan so easily.


"Don't tease me like that," she said softly but firmly."He's not weak, and he isn't careless. He simply doesn't want me to bear the brunt of this fight."


The seriousness in her tone silenced them.

 
The two old men exchanged a glance, their playful  banter fading into thoughtful quiet.



After a long pause, Dyer finally muttered, "Tyler's grown far too bold these last few years. Sitting so high above everyone else has only made him reckless."



David leaned back in his chair, his voice steady."Politcs and business were never meant to mix.That's the golden rule."



Turning to Eleanor, he continued, "Now telI us, what exactly do you want us to do?"



Eleanor had already guessed they wouldn't turn her away.



A faint smile tugged at her lips. "The Stewart Group's so-called tax scandal started with the CFO's personal dealings. If no one had stirred things up, it never would've turned into this storm. What I need is for you to remind Tyler that Elepdon isn't his family's playground, and he doesn't get to throw his weight around here." Not wanting their frustration with Nolan to deepen,she sweetened her request with a little bait. "David,your paper on nerve repair is still missing crucial clinical data, isn't it? And Dyer, that royal-era bronze vase you've been chasing, the one that slipped away at the last auction. I may know where it ended up."


That got them. Their eyes lit with interest at once.



David was ever the medical fanatic, while Dyer was the collector who lived for rare antiques.


Eleanor had played straight into their passions.


David coughed into his fist, pretending to hesitate."Since you've put it that way, we'll see what we can do."



Dyer didn't waste words. He pulled out his phone and made a quick call. His tone was calm but left no room for argument. "It's me. Make sure the Stewart Group's matter is handled properly. No outside interference.Do it now."



He ended the call with a decisive snap of his fingers  across the screen.


Eleanor could finally breathe easier. The Perry family's attempt to twist the tax issue to their advantage was already dead in the water.


She stood up and gave them both a deep bow."Thank you, Dyer. Thank you, David."


Dyer waved her gratitude aside with mock irritation."Enough of that. We don't need thanks. Just remember, if Nolan ever treats you unfairly,we'll set him straight for you."


Eleanor smiled and nodded. "I'll keep  that in mind."
###Chapter 272 Go Find Someone Like That For Yourself
After leaving the Elepdon Sanatorium, Eleanor made her way back to the villa in Regal Heights.


She stayed up deep into the night, hoping Nolan would come through the door, but he never did.


It was morning then that finally brought Nolan home.


He didn't bother with greetings; he simply closed the gap between them and wrapped Eleanor tightly in his arms.


Resting his face against her neck, Nolan breathed in her gentle, familiar scent, finally feeling the knot in his chest begin to ease.


"Grandpa's safe now. I owe you, Eleanor. Thank you so much"



Eleanor lifted a hand and gently smoothed the tension from his brow. "There's no need to thank me.Not when it's us."



Their quiet moment was suddenly interrupted by Lillian's enthusiastic voice ringing out in the hallway.


"Eleanor! Let us in! Ryland and I came to visit!"



With a dramatic flourish, Lillian burst through the door and engulfed Eleanor in an enthusiastic hug.


Ryland trailed behind her, arms full of grocery bags,and a wave of relief crossed his face the moment he saw Nolan.



"The shipment made it to the buyer overseas."Ryland set the groceries down and continued, "It took some effort, but the deal's finished. The client signed, and we have the Benton family to thank for smoothing things over. If not, we would've been hit with a massive penalty. As for Zerovia-"


Before he could finish, Nolan stepped in and stopped him.


"We'll handle this in the study," Nolan said quietly. He didn't want Eleanor tangled up in these troubles any longer.



She had already given more than enough for him and for the entire Stewart family.



Now, it was his responsibility to see things through.


With a soft click, the study door shut, blocking out the rest of the world.



Nolan turned to Ryland, his gaze sharp and unyielding. "What's going on in Zerovia?"



Ryland's expression shifted, the gravity of the situation written all over his face. "Nolan, your father's already on to you. He's been using the Stewart Group's name behind the scenes to stir up trouble."



A cold, relentless anger radiated from Nolan.


To Nolan, Colson was just a relative by blood, nothing more than a biological connection.



Colson had never acted like a true parent, and now he was willing to sabotage both the family and the country for his own interests.
It was unforgivable.
"Spread the word," Nolan instructed, his tone cold and unyielding like steel. "From now on, Colson and Brodie are completely severed from the Stewart family. They have no right to speak or act for the Stewart Group."
With that, Ryland gave a firm nod. "Understood. I'll make sure everyone gets the message."
With the business handled, Ryland's shoulders finally loosened, and he nudged Nolan playfully. "Seriously,man, you really lucked out with Eleanor. She's sharp,strong, and she'd fight the world if it meant having your back."
Nolan shot him a sideways look, the hint of a smile playing at his lips. "Sounds like you're envious. Go find someone like that for yourself."
Ryland laughed but quickly pivoted back to more serious matters. "Alright, jokes aside, have you made any progress on that tax problem?"


Nolan's expression darkened.


"We pinned everything on the CFO. The evidence is airtight, so we can charge him with fraud and get him locked up.However-"


He hesitated, voice dropping lower. "If the Perry family keeps pushing the issue, we're still at risk."


Ryland understood immediately.


Compared to this, the shipment problem was nothing.



If the authorities slapped Stewart Group with a tax evasion charge, it would spell disaster for everyone involved.



Ryland's face grew grim. "Zerovia's a tough nut to crack, and Tyler Perry isn't going down easily.Have you thought about reaching out to Trudy?"


Nolan's answer was immediate. "I'm not meeting  her." There was no way he would agree to meet with a woman he despised, especially not if it meant making Eleanor unhappy.
Ryland let out a low laugh and shook his head."Man,you really are loyal down to your bones,Nolan."
Nolan just grinned and gave him a light punch on the arm.
Meanwhile, in the living room, Lillian clung to Eleanor's hand, letting her frustration pour out."Trudy's unbelievable! She couldn't win Nolan over,so now she's going after the Stewart Group with all these dirty tactics. It's disgusting!"
How could anyone stoop that low?
Lillian used to think Trudy was just a pampered rich girl, but now she realized just how spiteful and toxic she could be.
Eleanor gently squeezed Lillian's hand to calm her."Don't let her get to you. She's running out of  options."


Lillian's eyes gleamed with curiosity. "What did you do?"


Eleanor offered a sly, knowing smile. "You'll see soon enough. For now, let's keep it between us."


Lillian put on an exaggerated pout. "What, I'm not in the loop anymore?"


With a bit of gentle persuasion, Eleanor finally succeeded in lifting her spirits.
###Chapter 273 Are You Really That Confident
Ryland and Lillian didn't linger; they departed quickly.


Eleanor planned to climb to the third floor for rest. As she lifted her foot onto the first step, firm arms slid around her waist from behind.



Nearby servants averted their gaze immediately and hurried away.



Nolan rested his cheek against her shoulder. His words hinted at desire, yet his tone carried fatigue."Eleanor, I want to share a room with you tonight," he murmured.



Eleanor felt sympathy for him and nodded.


Receiving her consent, Nolan lifted her effortlessly carrying her from the first floor straight to the third.


Exhaustion soon claimed Eleanor, and she drifted off to sleep in his arms.


He pressed a soft kiss to her forehead.


"Sleep well, Eleanor," he whispered, wrapping her completely in his embrace and closing his eyes,finding calm.



When morning arrived, light spilling through the windows, they woke again.


Nolan's phone rang incessantly, and surprise struck them when Trudy's name appeared.



She had prepared to meet them.



By the time they reached the café, Trudy was already seated.



She stirred her coffee with deliberate elegance,ignoring them until they were settled.


Finally, she met Nolan's gaze and laid down her conditions bluntly. "If you beg and consent to marry me obediently, I can have my grandfather intervene.Otherwise, the Stewart Group will collapse for  certain."


Finishing,she shifted her sharp gaze to Eleanor,eyes glinting with disdain. "You, however, have two options. Leave Elepdon immediately and vanish from Nolan's life forever, or kneel and plead. I may allow you to remain his secret mistress. Oh, and post on Twitter admitting publicly that you're a shameless mistress."



Her plan was clear: humiliate Eleanor in front of her followers.



Nolan ignored Trudy entirely, leaving his refusal unspoken but unmistakable.


Eleanor, in contrast, smiled faintly, lifting the glass of lemonade before her and swirling it gently.


They had come curious about Trudy's schemes, yet this immediate attack had surprised them both.


"Are you really that confident?" Eleanor asked, lips curling with half-amusement.


Trudy leaned back effortlessly, nodding. "Yes, completely. As long as my grandfather stands firm,the IRS will spare nothing from the Stewart Group."


A skeptical eyebrow rose. Eleanor's tone dripped with irony."Oh,really? He may hold influence here,but what if the higher authorities intervene?"



Trudy's reply was sharp, almost defensive."Impossible! People that high up aren't reachable by you or the Stewart family!"


Before she could elaborate, Tyler's call cut through."Sweetheart, I can't handle this. Someone went over my head straight to the higher-ups. It wasn't urgent before, but now they've spoken, demanding impartial resolution..."



The rest of his words were lost to Trudy's ears.



Hands shaking, she clutched the phone, staring at Eleanor in disbelief. "How... how did you manage that?"



Eleanor set the lemonade down and rose, looking down at her. "You don't need to know. Just remember: no one can control every outcome from behind the scenes. Not even your grandfather."


Without waiting for a response, she left, Nolan walking quietly beside her.


In the car, Nolan said nothing.


Sensing his thoughts, Eleanor reached out and rested her hand on his. "Don't overthink it. You would find a way even without my intervention. I just wanted to do this for you."


Turning his head, Nolan met her clear gaze. The shadows in his heart lifted, replaced by warmth.


How could Eleanor be so perfect? She shone in a way he wanted to protect, hiding her from the eyes of anyone who might desire her.
###Chapter 274 You've Dragged Our Family Into Ruin!
The storm that had besieged the Stewart Group finally dissipated, leaving the once-glorious White and the Perry families teetering on the edge of ruin.



In Zerovia, the wheels of justice turned swiftly. Within mere days, Tyler was whisked away by authorities,his fate sealed as they probed his misdeeds.


Soon after, a thunderous proclamation echoed through Elepdon; Tyler had been stripped of his power, cast out for twisting his authority to stifle fair competition.


The news sent shockwaves rippling across the city igniting whispers and gasps in every corner.


The Perry family's collapse spread like wildfire, their empire crumbling under the weight of disgrace.


As the Perry family's closest ally, the White family found themselves stripped of their strongest pillar.Their once-dominant market share became a tantalizing prize, ripe for the taking by ravenous competitors.


Miguel, desperate to salvage his family's legacy,dashed between Elepdon's towering enterprises, his pride swallowed as he begged for aid.


But his pleas fell on deaf ears, met only with icy rejections.


"Mr. White, kindly see yourself out."


"Our small company can offer no assistance."


"You've crossed the Stewart, the Brooks, and the Benton families... we dare not tangle with such titans."



Shunned like a pariah, Miguel stood alone amidst the city's bustling streets, a broken man in a sea of indifference.


How had it come to this?  How had the tides turned so drastically?


Miguel's mind reeled, as he grappled with the enigma of Nolan's influence and the mystery of Eleanor's true power.



Regret surged through him like a bitter tide,threatening to drown his spirit.


He staggered home, only to be greeted not by the familiar embrace of his estate but by a stark white seal plastered across the gates.


An enforcement vehicle loomed ominously before him, and stern-faced officials approached, thrusting a document into his trembling hands.


"Mr. White," one officer began, voice devoid of warmth, "by court order, all assets of the White Group, including your properties and vehicles, are hereby frozen and under investigation."


The world seemed to crumble beneath Miguel's feet,his vision blurring as he swayed, on the brink of collapse.  Not far away, Trudy stood frozen, her gaze fixed blankly on the seal.


Her once radiant face now held only bewilderment.


Her mind refused to accept it.


How could this be?



Wasn't her grandfather the unchallenged titan of Elepdon?



Who would dare challenge them?


This had to be a nightmare.


If she hadn't targeted Eleanor, if she hadn't chased Nolan's affection with such fervor, if she hadn't spurred Tyler to crush the Stewart Group,would their world still be intact?


The White family's glory would remain untarnished-and she would still live as the pampered girl.


But regrets were futile now.


Miguel's bloodshot gaze locked onto Trudy, fury blazing within him.


It was her fault!



All of it!


He lunged forward, his hand slicing through the air,delivering a stinging slap.


"You reckless fool!" he roared. "All for a man, you've dragged our family into ruin! A century of legacy,shattered-because of you!"


The flicker of remorse in Trudy's heart twisted into venomous hatred.



Why should she bear the blame?


The true culprit was Eleanor, the architect of their downfall.


She would not let this go.


She vowed to remember this debt, determined that one day Eleanor would repay it a thousandfold.
###Chapter 275 She Turned Everything Around
The downfall of the Perry and the White families hit Brodie like a bolt out of the blue.



Stunned, he tried to process the news.



How on earth had Nolan pulled it off?



The Perry family was a giant in Elepdon, nearly untouchable. How could they crumble in just one night?



For the longest time, he assumed Nolan owed everything to Norwood's favoritism, thinking he could outmaneuver him with a few clever tricks and take over Stewart Group.



However, reality finally set in, and he couldn't even lay a finger on Nolan, while Nolan had the power to destroy him without breaking a sweat. Worse yet, the chief financial officer who took the fall had been his inside man, and most of the stolen money was sitting in his own accounts.


A wave of panic crashed over Brodie, and he rushed to book a flight to Zerovia, desperate to get out before it was too late.







Nolan paid no attention to Brodie's frantic escape.


He had weeded out the corrupt staff, put out the fires, and steered the company safely through the turmoil.


Knowing Norwood's health was steadily improving gave Nolan a quiet sense of relief.


Later that afternoon, Nolan drove up to the Stewart family's residence.


At the entrance, Hector greeted him with a genuine smile. "Welcome home, sir. Your grandfather's waiting for you in the study." Nolan stepped into the study, where he found Norwood seated by the windowin a deep leather chair,looking much better.


When Norwood glanced up and saw him, an unusual gentleness flickered in his weary eyes.


"Please, sit down," Norwood said quietly.


Nolan then took a seat across from him.


Gone was the usual tension between them. Now,there was only a rare and welcome calm.


They sat in silence for a moment until Norwood finally broke it, his words deliberate. "I've heard everything that happened. Eleanor really came through for you, didn't she?"


Nolan just nodded, careful not to exaggerate her role. "She turned everything around. If it weren't for her, Tyler Perry wouldn't have been brought down so soon."


Norwood fell silent again, a troubled look shadowing his features. Every misstep with Trudy and Wray could be traced
back to his own mistakes. He had left the door wide open for disaster.
Through it all, Nolan and Eleanor had kept steady,proving they could handle whatever came their way.
This was on him. His disappointment in Colson had clouded his trust in Nolan, and his bias against Eleanor had twisted his judgment.
One careless decision had nearly cost the Stewart family everything.
Right then, Norwood looked as if the years had finally caught up with him, his tired eyes fixed on Nolan."I'm finished interfering in your affairs."
Nolan froze mid-reach for his coffee, aflash of surprise flickering across his features.11SO1you're saying you actually approve of Eleanor and me?"
Norwood didn't answer him directly. Instead, he turned his attention to Hector, who was standing nearby. "Spread the word. Effective immediately,
Promote your business none of the extended family, Wray included, is allowed in Elepdon unless I say so. They're to stay out of company business."


With those words, Norwood slowly pushed himself to his feet, shoulders bent with exhaustion, and shuffled out of the study, his silhouette weighed down by loneliness.


Nolan's hopeful expression faded instantly.


A wave of worry then took its place.


Grandpa looked frail now, exhausted by the mistakes of his past, burdened by regret.
###Chapter 276 Your Parents Are Waiting
Nolan drifted through a haze of thoughts before steering toward Regal Heights.


Exiting the car, he spotted Hilda lingering by the gate,hesitant.


Her hands gripped a thermal container, pacing with nervous energy, fingers brushing the doorbell before recoiling,her face a map of uncertainty.


Nolan took measured steps toward her. "Mrs.Benton."


Her fingers clutched tighter, voice catching before she said, "I heard the Stewart Group is safe. ls Eleanor coping all right?"


She and Jeff had taken the liberty of intervening to help the Stewart Group without announcing themselves, and she now fretted Eleanor might see it as an intrusion.


She wanted to spare her daughter from worry.


Seeing the anxiety in her eyes, Nolan stepped aside,clearing the doorway."Come in."


Hilda shook her head sharply, startled. "No, no."


She thrust the container into Nolan's hands. "I prepared this myself. You and Eleanor enjoy it. I won't overstep."


With those words, she moved on swiftly.


A few steps away, she looked back, eyes glimmering with tearful tears.



Nolan, container in hand, remained silent.


He entered the living room where Eleanor lounged on the couch,absorbed in her book.


His footsteps drew her attention, and her gaze fell on the container, pausing.


It wasn't takeout. This came from the Bentons. Nolan spread the dishes on the dining table."Eleanor, dinner's ready," he called.


She set her book aside, moving slowly.


Why hadn't Hilda come inside?


Was it hesitation, or fear of seeing her?


Eleanor stopped at the table, hands frozen above the cutlery. "Where's Mrs. Benton?"


Nolan placed the last dish down and hesitated briefly. "She didn't want to bother you and left," he replied.


A heavy weight pressed on Eleanor's chest, and her eyes fell.


Nolan stepped closer, covering her cold hand with warmth.



He sensed the tension inside her-the tug between longing and fear.


For over twenty years, Eleanor had walked alone. Looking into her eyes, Nolan said softly, "Eleanor,whatever path you choose, I'm here."


She stayed silent, lifting her fork to taste the food.


Could this really be her mother's cooking?



She had never eaten it before, yet it carried a sense of familiarity, like a memory she had always carried.


She bit slowly, her thoughts wandering.


After the meal, Nolan tidied the table while Eleanor stepped outside for a walk.


Lost in thought, she wandered until the orphanage gate appeared.



Myah stood in the courtyard, enjoying the evening breeze.Spotting Eleanor, she waved warmly.


Eleanor stepped inside, drew a stool close, and lay her head on Myah's lap.



She didn't know what to do.


She truly didn't. Her mind replayed Myah's words.


Losing a child weighed hardest on parents.


She remembered the Bentons' kindness vividly.


Eleanor knew they had quietly acted to save the Stewart Group. She hadn't spoken it, yet gratitude ran deep.


Still, accepting it felt impossible.


Two decades of absence didn't vanish in a night.


The word"parents" feIt heavy, strange.


Their sudden return left Eleanor unbalanced, caught between fear and confusion.



Feeling Eleanor's light shiver, Myah touched her back tenderly."My dear, you already know what you want,don't you?"


Eleanor froze for a moment.



Myah's smile softened.


"You keep returning here, looking through that notebook, not to prove they abandoned you, right?You're really looking for proof they cared, that letting you go was never meant to happen. Perhaps things were misunderstood in the beginning. But deep down, their love reached you."


Eleanor lowered her gaze slowly.



Yes.



She had returned repeatedly, seeking roots, needing reassurance that she wasn't forsaken.


That faded photograph, delicate outfit, wooden rabbit...


All whispered of a love once present.


She hadn't dared confront it until now.


After a pause, Eleanor lifted her eyes, misty yet determined. "I get it now, Myah," she said.


Myah saw the clarity in her expression and smiled with relief.



Eleanor had finally conquered her fears and stepped  forward.


"Go home, my dear. Your parents are waiting."


Rising, Eleanor bowed deeply to the woman who had nurtured her.


Then she walked out, passing through the gate.


As she approached the gate, she caught sight of the familiar figure.


Under the streetlight, Nolan lingered, the soft radiance crowning him in a faint halo.



He said nothing, made no move to hurry her-simply watched.



Their eyes locked.


Nolan stepped closer, warm fingers enclosing her cold hand. "Eleanor, where are we headed?"


Her final trace of doubt melted as she met his gaze."To the Bentons'."



A faint smile curved Nolan's lips as he tightened his grip. "Let's go."
###Chapter 277 This Is Your Home





Hilda returned from Regal Heights and threw herself into the warmth of her kitchen, a cherished cookbook spread wide before her like an open invitation.


For over twenty years, she had missed the chance to know Eleanor's favorite meals, each missed moment a quiet ache in her heart.



Now, she poured her love into learning new recipes,dreaming of the day she could hand-deliver a dish to her daughter.


Even if Eleanor held her at arm's length, the thought of her tasting her cooking was a soothing balm.



As she jotted notes in the cookbook's margins, Hilda called out with a playful spark, "Love, come tackle this fish with me!"



Jeff, sporting his cartoon apron similar to Hilda's,sauntered in with a vibrant tray of freshly sliced fruit. "Your sous-chef, reporting for duty," he teased,setting the tray down and wielding a knife with finesse to prep the fish.


Whether or not Eleanor chose to accept them,they still carried a profound sense of indebtedness to her.


They had made peace with the circumstances,resolved to embrace whatever path Eleanor chose.Her happiness was all that mattered to them.


Abruptly, the doorbell chimed through the villa,accompanied by the butler's exuberant announcement. "Mr. and Mrs. Benton, Miss Warren is here!"



Hilda's spatula slipped from her grasp, clattering to the floor.



She and Jeff shared a glance brimming with delight,hastening outside, their aprons still tied about them.


At the villa's gates, Eleanor stood beside Nolan.


Nolan carried an array of elegantly wrapped gift boxes,his demeanor warm and composed. Hilda's eyes were riveted on Eleanor.


She was truly here, returning to them at last.


Caught in a surge of emotion, Hilda instinctively wiped her hands on her apron before stepping forward, yearning to clasp Eleanor's hand yet pausing,uncertain.


"Eleanor, you... you've come home," she murmured,her voice quivering, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Why didn't you let us know? I would have prepared all your favorite dishes."


Eleanor met Hilda's gaze, a whirlwind of excitement,slight apprehension, and overwhelming joy at their reunion shimmering in her mother's eyes.


She glanced at Nolan, standing steadfastly by her side.



He offered a reassuring nod.


With a throat tight with emotion, Eleanor softly uttered the words she had longed to say. "Dad Mom." Their stunned expressions prompted Eleanor to lower her eyes, her voice gentle as she continued,"Nolan and I would love to join you for dinner tonight.Would that be all right?"


At those words, Jeff and Hilda were swept away by a tide of elation.



Had they heard correctly?


Their daughter was acknowledging them, calling them Dad and Mom!



"Of course! Without question!" Hilda's tears of joy broke free as she enveloped Eleanor in a fervent embrace, her cheeks wet with emotion.



"My dear, what are you saying? This is your home-come back whenever your heart desires!" Jeff's voice trembled with feeling. This titan of industry,usually so commanding, now stood with eyes reddened by emotion, his words thick with unshed tears.



He nodded enthusiastically and turned to the butler with spirited instructions. "Quickly, prepare Eleanor's room with the finest linens!"


Then, he turned back to Eleanor, his tone softening."Eleanor, you and Nolan must stay the night. Don't even think of leaving!"


He murmured to himself, as if struck by a sudden thought. "Oh, and one more thing!"


He addressed the butler. "Arrange a grand feast! Let the world know my daughter has returned!"


The butler, his face alight with shared joy, eagerly agreed and turned to carry out the orders.


"Wait," Eleanor interjected softly, halting him with a gentle smile.


Amid the bewildered glances exchanged around her,Eleanor spoke with quiet conviction. "Dad, I don't want a grand banquet. A simple family dinner together is all I need."


Jeff felt a pang of disappointment ripple through him. He yearned to proclaim Eleanor's return to the world,to right the wrongs of the past two decades, and shower her with the love she deserved.



Yet, catching the faint shadow of reserve in her eyes,he softened, nodding with understanding. "Very well my dear. We'll do exactly as you wish."


Nolan, standing quietly to the side, observed the tender scene, his eyes reflecting a thoughtful depth.


Eleanor's heart still held a fragile barrier, not yet fully lowered. But that was alright-time was their gentle ally.
###Chapter 278 Finding You Was Worth Everything
That night, the Benton family's estate glowed wvith cheerful lights and welcoming warmth.


In the kitchen, energy and laughter filled the air.


Hilda and Jeff, both dressed in aprons, moved around each other with practiced ease.


She took charge at the stove, while he expertly managed all the prep work.


Soon, the dining table overflowed with colorful,tempting dishes, a feast fit to make up for all those years apart in a single night.


A gentle, almost magical coziness settled over the gathering.


Hilda kept sneaking more food onto Eleanor's plate,her every glance filled with motherly affection. Jeff might have been quieter, but the caring look he gave Eleanor said more than words ever could.



When dinner ended, Hilda and Jeff firmly insisted that Eleanor and Nolan should stay for the night.


After a bit of gentle protest, Eleanor and Nolan finally agreed.



Nolan got comfortable in the guest room, while Hilda softly clasped Eleanor's hand and guided her up the stairs.



She pushed open the door to a bedroom that made Eleanor stop in her tracks.



It looked like something out of a fairy tale.



The walls glowed a gentle pink, a plush carpet cushioned every step, and a glass case displayed a collection of stuffed animals and dolls that seemed lovingly preserved through the years.



Hilda watched Eleanor's reaction, her own eyes brimming with unshed tears. She picked up a Barbie dressed in shimmering clothes, her voice rich with nostalgia. "You were absolutely crazy about these dolls when you were little,Eleanor."


Hilda added, "I wasn't sure what you'd enjoy after all this time, but I thought every child loves these, so I just kept adding new ones."


She carefully set the doll in Eleanor's hands, her eyes flickering with a blend of hope and unease. "This will always be your home, sweetheart. You're welcome here anytime."


Eleanor stared at the doll, overwhelmed by a rush of emotion.



She took a step closer and wrapped Hilda in a gentle hug,the kind of embrace reserved for someone who had waited a lifetime.



Resting her head on Hilda's shoulder, Eleanor spoke in a whisper. "You must have been so tired, searching for me all those years." For a moment, Hilda stiffened, then clung tightly to Eleanor, softly patting her back. "Not tired at all.Finding you was worth everything."


Hilda wiped at her tears as she stepped away. "It's late, darling. Get some rest. I should call your three brothers; they'll be thrilled to hear about this."


Hilda paused at the doorway, giving one last loving look before quietly closing the door behind her.


Eleanor sank onto the plush bed, her heart full.


The bed was wrapped in the gentle scent of freshly laundered sheets and a lingering trace of her mother's love.


That night, she drifted into the deepest, most restful sleep she had had in years.


Eleanor ended up staying with the Benton family for several days.


Even though Nolan's schedule was packed, he made time to drop by each day, secretly happy to watch Eleanor reconnect with her parents. Still, he sometimes felt like an outsider, longing for the cozy little world that belonged to just him and Eleanor.


One evening, Nolan unfolded a sleek travel brochure."There's a brand-new coastal resort, gorgeous views, hot springs, just absolutely stunning," he said,pitching his idea to Eleanor and her parents with practiced charm. "I'd really like to take Eleanor for a relaxing getaway. We'll be back in two days."


It was the perfect excuse, impossible to refuse.



Hilda and Jeff exchanged a look, instantly understanding the couple needed time alone.



They didn't want their daughter to feel rushed or pressured.



"Go on, enjoy yourselves," Hilda said, flashing Eleanor a playful grin. "You both deserve a break together."



As Eleanor and Nolan's car rolled down the drive and out onto the road, neither of them noticed the black  sedan that quietly slipped into traffic behind them,keeping a careful distance.
###Chapter 279 I've Missed You





The luxury resort stood in a perfect spot, framed by rugged mountains on one side and endless ocean on the other, its scenery truly mesmerizing.


Every villa boasted a secluded outdoor bath, letting guests unwind in total privacy.


Once they had settled in and left their bags behind,Eleanor and Nolan didn't waste any time as they quickly changed into their swimsuits and made their way out to the steaming bath in their private courtyard.



Eleanor dipped her hand into the water to check if the temperature was just right, let out a satisfied sigh, and was the first to slide in.


As the soothing warmth surrounded her, the stress and fatigue she had carried for days seemed to dissolve completely. Nolan soon joined her, stretching his long legs into the pool and settling down beside her.


He leaned back against the edge, steam curling around him while a few damp strands of hair clung to his forehead, giving him a relaxed, almost inviting look.



A playful spark flashed in Eleanor's eyes as she glanced over at Nolan, struck by a sudden urge to cause trouble.



Without warning, she scooped up some water and sent a splash right at Nolan's face.



The unexpected attack left Nolan momentarily confused, his eyes wide. But the moment he spotted the victorious grin on Eleanor's face, that confusion faded,replaced by a look of fond amusement.


Rather than scolding her, Nolan simply grinned and sent a wave of water right back, using his strong hands to make sure she got drenched.



Eleanor let out a surprised giggle and quickly tried to dodge out of the way.
Their laughter and splashes echoed around the small
pool, making them feel like carefree kids again as they lost themselves in a spontaneous water fight.
Caught up in the fun, Eleanor stepped backward onto the smooth pebbles. In her excitement, she lost her footing.
A startled yelp escaped her lips as she slipped, her body tipping backward out of control.
But the painful fall she had braced for never arrived.
An instant later, a firm hand caught her waist and pulled her safely back, steadying her in a protective hold.
Nolan kept her close, his arms secure as he spoke,his tone edged with gentle warning. "Be careful."
Eleanor could feel his chest pressed warmly against her back.
With only the thin fabric separating them, she became acutely aware of the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, each pulse syncing with her own in a way that left her flustered.


His familiar, invigorating scent filled the air, and color rushed to her cheeks, leaving them bright red.


Dusk slowly crept in, and the last traces of daylight faded from the sky.


A crisp mountain breeze drifted in, swirling the pool's steam and making the air feel noticeably cooler.


A slight tremor ran through Eleanor as the chill set in.


Sensing her discomfort, Nolan quickly let go and touched her forehead before checking his own for a fever.



Once he was sure she was alright, Nolan breathed out in relief and said, "The temperature's dropped.Wait here. I'll grab our clothes from inside. After we change, I'll bring you out for dinner."


Eleanor responded with an easy nod. "Alright." Still worried, Nolan repeated his instructions before stepping out of the bath.


Eleanor watched him stride away, a towel draped around his shoulders, and found herself unexpectedly uneasy as she looked at his retreating figure.



Why did that odd feeling linger inside her?


A crease formed on her brow as she slipped deeper beneath the soothing water.


Meanwhile, Nolan made his way down the hall and stopped at the bedroom door.


The door hung open just a crack, probably left that way by housekeeping after their evening rounds.


Without giving it a second thought, he nudged the door and walked in.



Right away, a cloying, unfamiliar fragrance overwhelmed him.



Something was wrong. A jolt of instinctive alarm shot through him.


Suddenly, dizziness crashed over him, and he staggered, fighting to stay on his feet. A fierce,burning heat started low in hisabdomen and spread quickly, making it almost impossible to think straight.


Just as his vision began to blur, a pair of delicate arms slipped around his neck from behind, holding him tight.



The warmth of a woman pressed firmly against his back. "Nolan, I've missed you," she whispered softly.


Nolan tried to break free, but his strength seemed to drain away in an instant.


The heavy scent lingered, clouding his senses and wearing down his resistance.



Disoriented, Nolan slowly turned to face the woman behind him. His gaze blurred and shifted, but as her features sharpened, all he could see was Eleanor's face.



His throat bobbed as he struggled for breath, and before he could stop himself, he whispered the only name that mattered to him. "Eleanor."
The playful smirk vanished from Trudy's lips in an instant.
Her eyes blazed with outrage.
Once again,it was Eleanor!
Even when Nolan was drugged out of his senses, the only person he ever thought about was that bitch!
How was it fair?
Why did Eleanor always end up on top, while she herself was left to scrape by in the shadows?
Since the White family had lost everything, Trudy had been stuck living with her parents in a shabby,run-down rental.
Miguel, who once treated her like a princess, now took out every frustration on her, whether through harsh words or heavy hands.
Her days were filled with misery, and she was completely worn down by it.


But Trudy refused to let her life stay that way, and swore she would claw her way back into the world of the wealthy and powerful.


In her mind, the key was simple: as long as she became Nolan's woman, nothing would be out of reach again.


Pushing her bitterness aside, she leaned into Nolan's faint whisper and replied in a gentle tone, "Yes?"


She had spent weeks carefully orchestrating this night, slipping the staff a bribe and waiting patiently for her chance in Nolan's bedroom.


At last, everything had fallen into place. That tonight,her plan would finally succeed, and Eleanor would finally learn what it felt like to lose everything.
###Chapter 280 Let Me In!





Trudy crept in, and traced Nolan's sculpted abs.


The touch snapped Nolan back to reality.


Everything around him sharpened in an instant.


The woman in front of him was Trudy-her face caked with makeup, eyes thick with artificial seduction.



He had mistaken her for Eleanor due to the effects of the drug.


Disgust rolled through him. Nolan pushed her away,hard."Get out.Now."


Trudy tumbled to the floor, shock etched across her face.



She gaped at him, stunned by the fury blazing in his eyes-an intensity she had never seen from him before. How was this happening?


That drug was supposed to take him down, no matter what.



Why was he still in control?


Her heart pounded in her chest, but she stepped in closer, her voice barely more than a whisper. "Nolan,you're suffering. That stuff is brutal. Let me help, or you'll never make it through the night."


Let her help?


Not a chance.



Nolan's eyes darted to the fruit knife glinting on the coffee table.



He didn't hesitate-snatching the blade and dragging it across his own arm.



Hot blood spilled down his skin, the pain instantly cutting through the drug's haze.


Trudy could only stare, voice trembling. "Have you lost your mind?" Nolan would rather hurt himself than even touch her.Why?
What could possibly make Eleanor worth that kind of pain?
A fresh wave of humiliation stung Trudy, and she lunged for him again, hands clawing desperately at his towel.
"Nolan, stop fighting me. Let me take care of you,"she pleaded, her voice breaking.
Rage finally snapped loose inside lethal, his anger barely contained.	him. His glare was

Left in the hallway, Trudy shook with a mix of fear and disbelief.


She scrambled up, pounding on the door. "Nolan!Let me in! You'll hurt yourself if you stay alone! Please-open up!"


Only silence greeted her.


Inside, Nolan swiped the overpowering scented candle from the table, smashing it to the floor and grinding it out beneath his heel.


He staggered to the bathroom and twisted the shower knob as far cold as it would go.


Cold water poured over him, barely making a dent in the fire crawling under his skin.



Pressing his back to the freezing tile, he slid down,shoulders shaking.



Cold water mixed with blood as it ran down his wounded arm, swirling red at the drain. He squeezed his eyes shut, jaw clenched, every muscle fighting the urge that threatened to take over.


In the chaos of his mind, only one truth remained.


No matter what happened, he would never betray Eleanor.


Not now. Not ever.
###Chapter 281 Nolan, It's Me!
Eleanor lingered in the warm embrace of the hot spring,her anticipation for Nolan's return growing with each passing minute.



A brisk mountain breeze swept through, its chill biting at her skin.


She shivered, caught in the night's icy grip.



Why was Nolan delayed for so long?


A creeping unease stirred within her, swelling with every moment.


No,she couldn't wait any longer. She had to find him.



Rising from the steaming waters, Eleanor wrapped herself in a plush towel and hastened toward their room.



As she neared the door, she froze at the sight of Trudy,disheveled and frantic, pounding desperately on the wood.



What was Trudy doing here? A jolt of dread surged through Eleanor, a sinking feeling that something terrible had befallen Nolan. Trudy's eyes locked onto Eleanor's, and she lunged forward like a woman possessed.



"Eleanor, you've ruined everything!" she shrieked,her voice raw with venom. "If it weren't for you, I would have had my way by now!"



Trudy's words painted a grim picture, and Eleanor's gaze hardened, her heart icing over with resolve.



Ignoring Trudy's tirade, she strode to the door and hammered on it with urgency. "Nolan, it's me!" she called, her voice steady but pleading. "Eleanor! Nolan,please,open the door!"



Yet, only an oppressive silence answered her.



Then, a cloying, seductive scent drifted from beneath the door, curling into the air.


Eleanor's senses sharpened as she recognized the dangerous scent.


This was an aphrodisiac, potent and intoxicating,capable of dire consequences if not countered swiftly.


Without hesitation, Eleanor dialed the hotel reception,her voice sharp with urgency.



The hotel manager, upon learning the situation,seized the master key and hurried toward the room, panic quickening his steps.


The moment the door swung open, Eleanor darted inside, slamming it shut and locking it from the inside before the manager or Trudy could follow.



Outside,the manager stood perplexed in the corridor.



What on earth was happening?


Should he stick around... or just get the hell out of there?



He glanced at Trudy, now slumped on the floor,hurling curses with the ferocity of a cornered animal.


It was clear she wasn't a registered guest.



This was trouble.



With a furrowed brow, he summoned security guards."Remove this disruptor," he ordered firmly.



Inside, the room was thick with the sickly-sweet scent,so overpowering it turned Eleanor's stomach.



Her eyes fell on a shattered scented candle, dried bloodstains on the carpet.



Was Nolan injured?



Her heart constricted with fear. The sound of rushing water drew her to the bathroom.



Without a moment's pause, Eleanor rushed inside.



There, Nolan sat slumped against the cold tiled wall,the shower's icy cascade drenching him.



His skin bore an unnatural flush, veins pulsing at his temples, muscles taut with the effort of resisting the drug's grip.



Most arresting of all was the ghastly gash on Nolan's arm, a deep wound exposing bone beneath torn flesh.



Blood swirled with the water, a relentless crimson stream spiraling down the drain.



Just as before, he had chosen to wound himself rather than betray her with another.



Eleanor's eyes brimmed with tears, her vision blurring.



She rushed to his side and knelt beside him, her heart pounding.



"Nolan, are you all right?" Her voice quivered as she reached out, her fingers trembling as they assessed his state.



Nolan, eyes clenched shut in a battle for control,stirred at the sound of her voice. His lids fluttered open, revealing irises ablaze with a feverish, chaotic hunger.



It was her.



It was Eleanor.



In that fleeting moment, Nolan's restraint shattered With a desperate surge, he drew Eleanor into his arms,his lips, searing with unspoken longing, capturing hers in a fierce, consuming kiss.
###Chapter 282 Help Me



The kiss came crashing down on Eleanor-fierce,burning,impossible to ignore.



A shudder rippled through her as Nolan's feverish heat seared her, forcing her to push against his chest ever so slightly.



"Nolan, you-" she began, ready to point out the fever blazing through him.



But her voice faltered when his broken, hoarse whisper slipped through clenched teeth. "Eleanor...help me... I'm in torment."



Eleanor's gaze locked onto Nolan, his eyes bloodshot with a fire barely contained. Then she noticed the gash on his arm-the wound he had carved into himself for her sake. Her last line of resistance crumbled like sand in the tide.



All reason abandoned her.



She gave up fighting, tilted her head back, and-clumsy but desperate-returned his kiss.



That night, heat and desire burned like wildfire,wrapping the room in heady passion. By dawn, Eleanor stirred awake to a trail of feather-light kisses.



Her body felt drained, every bone aching with exhaustion, and without thinking, she curled closer to the warmth holding her.



"Mm... stop it," she mumbled drowsily, her voice heavy with the sweetness of half-sleep. "Let me sleep a little longer."



It had been her first time-and Nolan had pushed her limits until the small hours-so she was utterly spent.


Nolan gazed down at the woman in his arms, soft and languid like a lazy kitten. His eyes shone with raw affection and an unmistakable pride.



She was his now. Entirely, irrevocably his.



The thought made him bend to kiss Eleanor's forehead with reverence, his voice gentle. "Alright."



He eased himself out of bed, careful not to wake her,tucked the blanket securely around her, then slipped on a robe and left the room.



But the instant the door clicked shut behind him,all warmth drained from his face.



Now it was time to deal with Trudy. His expression hardened to steel as he strode into the living room, where Erick stood waiting stiffly like a soldier before his commander.



Erick had gotten a panicked call from the hotel manager last night. Alarmed, he had hurried over at dawn,fearing the worst.



The moment Nolan appeared, Erick lowered his head respectfully.


Nolan sank onto the sofa, legs crossed, his gaze glacial.



"Where is Trudy?" he asked, voice razor-sharp.



Erick's pulse skipped, but he answered quickly,"Locked in the room next door, sir. She has been crying and demanding to see you all night."


Nolan's lips curled into a cold, derisive smile. See him?She wasn't worthy.



"Send her back to the Whites'," he ordered flatly."And find out where she got that drug. Someone supplied her, and I want an explanation."


That sort of drug was tightly guarded, forbidden.



For Trudy to get her hands on it meant she hadn't acted alone.And Nolan had every intention of smoking out the culprit and making them pay dearly.



Erick bowed low. "Understood."



He slipped out at once, too wise to linger a heartbeat longer.
###Chapter 283 Who Gave This To You
Trudy found herself back in the cramped, rundown apartment.



Inside, Miguel and his wife, Glenda White, sat at the table,staring anxiously at nothing but two plates of pasta.



The day had ended with yet another disappointment.



Miguel had spent hours reaching out to everyone he once considered a friend, only to face cold shoulders and ridicule at every turn.



A handful of old contacts had grudgingly offered him a little cash, tossing it over as though he were some beggar on the street.



To make matters even more humiliating, one acquaintance went so far as to hint that Miguel should let Trudy spend a few nights at his place.



He remembered before the White and the Perry families fell apart, those same people wouuld trip over themselves to curry favor with him.



He couldn't understand how he had been so blind to  their true nature all this time.



The realization left Miguel feeling utterly defeated.


Meanwhile, Glenda barely touched her food, her expression mirroring his hopelessness.


Trudy had left early yesterday and hadn't returned,not even a phone call to ease their worries.


Her daughter's beauty had always set her apart. But what if something terrible had happened while she was gone?



Glenda's thoughts raced, her heart gripped by anxiety and fear.



Suddenly, the front door swung open and someone tossed a figure into the apartment with no more care than tossing out the trash.



Both Miguel and Glenda jumped in shock, dropping their forks in fright.


It only took a moment to recognize the disheveled,bound-up figure as Trudy.



Her hair was tangled, makeup streaked, and a look of stubborn defiance flashed across her bruised face.



"Let me go right now! You'll regret treating me like this! I'm the White family's daughter and Nolan's  future fiancée! How dare you? I swear you'll pay for this!" Trudy shouted, her words coming out in a furious rush.



Each syllable rang out, wild and desperate, teetering on the edge of hysteria.


In the doorway, a tall figure stood motionless,shrouded in cold light.



Erick stepped inside,his face unreadable,bringing with him an icy tension that seemed to shrink the small apartment even more.



Miguel immediately recognized him; this was Nolan's right-hand man, the last person they wanted as an enemy.



A wave of fear swept through Miguel at once.



He scrambled to his feet, barely sparing Trudy a glance as he put on his most patronizing smile. "Mr.Wright, what a surprise! Is something wrong? Did Trudy offend you or Mr. Stewart in some way?"



Erick's frigid stare flicked from Trudy, still raging on the floor, to Miguel's anxious face.



In a calm, almost chilling voice, he announced, "Your daughter was apprehended while trying to harm Mr.Stewart. Tell me, Mr. White, how do you propose we handle this?" A numbness spread through Miguel's mind,leaving him reeling in disbelief.



She had actually tried to harm Nolan?



How could she be so reckless?



Terror gripped him so tightly it felt like his blood had turned to ice.



There was no coming back from this.



No one understood Nolan's ruthlessness better than him, and with that realization, he knew the White family had reached the end of the line.


In a fit of rage, Miguel spun toward Trudy and struck her with a brutal kick.


"You worthless girl! I should beat you half to death!You've destroyed everything for this family!" Miguel yelled,hitting her again and again.



Glenda watched from the side. Tears streamed down her face, but she was too terified to intervene.



Trudy curled into herself on the floor, choking back cries of pain, her gaze still blazing with defiance.


Drained and desperate, Miguel turned back to Erick.He collapsed to his knees, tears running down his cheeks. "Please, Mr. Wright, have mercy! She's my  only child, and I failed her as a father. Punish me instead, I beg you! Just ask Mr. Stewart to let her go.We'll do anything you want!"



But Erick only regarded Miguel with cold indifference,his gaze as unyielding as midwinter frost.


Every desperate word Miguel wanted to say died in his throat.



One glance told him that Nolan demanded an explanation, and nothing less would suffice.


Completely defeated, Miguel crumpled to the floor,his strength utterly spent.



"Do whatever you have to," Miguel muttered,managing a weak,hollow smile.



Without a word, Erick gestured for the men behind him to begin their search. "Go ahead."


The two bodyguards moved in at once, methodically rifling through the cramped space of the apartment.



Miguel stared blankly, unable to comprehend what they could possibly be looking for.


A few moments later, one of the guards uncovered a finely crafted wooden box stuffed in Trudy's abandoned bag in the corner. He handed it over to Erick without hesitation.



As Erick cracked the lid, a rich, sweet aroma immediately filled the room, unmistakable and exotic.


Flat on the floor, Trudy caught sight of the box, her eyes narrowing in terror as all color vanished from her cheeks.



A wave of sheer panic swept over her.



Meanwhile, Erick lifted the box, turning it over for a careful inspection.



At the very bottom, a small tag printed in a foreign script caught his eye-it read "Zerovia."



A faint crease formed on his brow; he understood that this was no ordinary item.



His attention shifted back to Miguel as he spoke. "Mr.Stewart says that if Ms. White is willing to disclose the source of this box, there may still be hope for the White family."



Hearing those words was like being thrown a rope while drowning; a spark of hope returned to Miguel's desperate gaze. He shot to his feet, rage twisting his features as he glared at Trudy.


 
"Tell them!" Miguel shouted, storming over and pulling  Trudy up by the hair, smashing her head against the floor. "Who gave this to you? Are you trying to destroy us all?"


Trudy's painful scream echoed through the apartment,her scalp burning from the force of his grip.


"Dad, please! I'll talk, just stop!" Trudy pleaded, her voice shaking with fear as she pleaded for mercy.


Miguel then let go,his eyes still burning with fury as he stared her down.



Shaking uncontrollably, Trudy darted a nervous glance at Erick's stony face before forcing herself to speak."Brodie Stewart gave it to me. Before he ran away,he slipped this to me in secret. He told me... he warned that Nolan would destroy my family, and this was my only shot at getting back on top."



Refusing to be dragged down with everyone else,she had accepted the offer without hesitation.



She had truly believed it was her golden ticket, never realizing it would be the very thing that ruined her.
###Chapter 284 What's Got You So Worried
After returning to the coastal resort, Erick gave Nolan a thorough report of everything he had uncovered.



Nolan narrowed his eyes, fingers drumming an even beat on the sofa's armrest.



He realized he had nearly let Brodie slip from his memory, a snake who had always slithered in the shadows.



It hadn't been long ago that someone tipped him off about Brodie's under-the-table dealings with Wray.



Back then, he hadn't gotten the chance to deal with this troublesome pest.


But now, with old and fresh grudges piling up,he knew it was finally time to settle things once and for all.


With that decision,Nolan spoke to Erick in a voice as cold as steel. "Freeze all of Colson's assets. And let our contacts in Zerovia know Brodie's time there is up,get him deported."



Erick instantly recognized that Nolan meant to strip Brodie of every resource, leaving him with nothing Without hesitation, Erick gave a respectful nod and hurried away, not risking another moment in the room.



At that moment, the bedroom door opened quietly with a soft click.



Eleanor stepped out, bare feet padding across the floor, draped in an oversized men's shirt and looking adorably drowsy.



She blinked sleep from her eyes, hair charmingly rumpled.



Catching sight of her from the corner of his eye, Erick nearly jumped in surprise.


He bowed his head quickly and made his exit, pulling the door shut behind him.



The noise drew Nolan's attention, and he turned to see what was happening.


The instant Eleanor appeared, Nolan's frosty demeanor faded, replaced by a gentle warmth.


He rose to his feet and drew her near, still heavy with sleep,into his arms.



Lowering his head, Nolan let her stand right on top of his feet, his hands slipping around her waist to keep her close. 
"Did you finally wake up?" he asked, his tone softer than usual.


Eleanor nodded, eyes half-closed, and burrowed against his chest,searching for a cozy spot to rest.



Her arms circled his neck, and in a voice rough from sleep, she mumbled, "I'm starving. Can we eat?"


A soft chuckle escaped Nolan, his gaze brimming with tenderness.



He easily swept her off her feet and carried her straight to the dining table.



There,an elegant lunch awaited them, already set out by the hotel staff.



As they settled in to eat, Eleanor's phone buzzed with a notification.



She pickedit up and found a new message from Lillian.


On the screen, it read, "You won't believe this! Trudy was married off last night! To Oliver Wilson. He has eight ex-wives, and he's old enough to be her dad!Serves her right!"



Eleanor glanced at the message, barely surprised.



She looked over at NVolan,who was peeling shrimp for her with calm precision. There was no doubt in her mind that this kind of swift,ruthless solution could only have been Nolan's handiwork.



In her mind, Eleanor couldn't help but think Trudy had brought this fate upon herself.


At that moment, Nolan's phone buzzed with a new message.



He glanced at it without much concern and saw a text from Norwood.



Eleanor leaned in, eyes scanning the screen. "Have Eleanor come over for dinner this weekend."



She hesitated, her thoughts swirling.



Visiting Norwood made her nervous.



What if his health took a turn for the worse because of her?



Noticing her sudden unease, Nolan set his phone aside and gently pinched her cheek. "What's got you so worried? The last time I was there, Grandpa made it clear he wouldn't meddle in our relationship anymore.That means he's accepted you."



He lowered his voice, his lips brushing her ear as he teased, "And don't forget, you're the famous Soul  Surgeon. Grandpa won't end up in the hospital,even with us around."



Eleanor blinked, caught off guard by his playful words,then broke into laughter.



In the end, she nodded her agreement to go
###Chapter 285 | Want You To Have This
After enjoying several more days at the seaside retreat, Eleanor and Nolan eventually made their wNay back to Elepdon.



Word somehow traveled fast, as Hilda and Jeff had already caught wind of their return and were waiting eagerly at the arrivals gate.



A sleek, understated Rolls-Royce was parked in the most prominent spot, drawing subtle attention.



As soon as the doors swung open, Hilda and Jeff hurried over, faces alight with excitement.



With their warm welcome impossible to resist,Eleanor ended up being swept away and taken straight back to the Benton family's villa.



Nolan could do nothing but watch as her parents whisked her away, never giving him the chance to ask if he could come along.



Before long, the Benton family's car vanished down the road.



Left alone in his own car, Nolan couldn't ignore the creeping sense of emptiness that settled over him.


He was truly glad for Eleanor.


These were, after all, the parents she had dreamed of finding, a family she had always wanted.


Still, a sharp stab of jealousy caught him off guard.



Lillian,her ever-present best friend, always seemed to come first in Eleanor's world.



And now, with her parents finally back in her life, they clung to her as though they never wanted to let her out of their sight again.



Winning her hand felt like an endless uphill climb.


That thought left Nolan letting out a heavy, resigned sigh.



Over at the Benton family's villa, a joyous atmosphere filled the air.


Following Hilda's instructions, the chef had outdone herself, dish after dish gracing the table, each one tailored to the local favorites.


Hilda could hardly tear her gaze away from Eleanor,holding her hand tightly and taking in every detail as if trying to make up for lost time. Nolan had initially promised Eleanor a brief getaway that was meant to last just two days.



That brief escape had stretched into nearly a week.


Whenever they called to check in, their only excuse was that they were having too much fun to come back.



At one point, Hilda nearly marched straight to the resort herself to bring Eleanor home.



Every moment with her daughter felt precious, and Hilda longed to make up for the decades they had spent apart.



During dinner,Hilda piled food onto Eleanor's plate at every opportunity.


"Sweetheart, try some of this. The shrimp came in fresh this morning. And have some of the soup, too.I asked the chef to simmer it all afternoon. It's good for you," she said,her voice full of motherly concern.


Jeff mostly stayed quiet, but his gentle smile and affectionate eyes said more than words ever could.



As the meal went on, Hilda suddenly remembered something important. With a sly, knowing smile, she slipped a hand into her pocket and pulled out a velvet box. She flipped it open, revealing a diamond bracelet.



This was the same bracelet she had clung to during that terrible fire years ago.



"Eleanor, I want you to have this," Hilda said as she slid the box across the table towards Eleanor. "My mother gave it to me, and now it's yours."



Eleanor gazed at the diamond bracelet, instinctively wanting to decline, as it felt far too valuable to accept.



Having only recently rejoined the Benton family, she felt she hadn't earned the right to accept something so precious. The thought of taking such a meaningful gift made her uneasy.



Sensing her reluctance,Hilda squeezed Eleanor's hand,her own eyes brimming with emotion. "Oh,sweetheart, you don't have to be so formal. I'm your mother. This has always belonged to you. I was just holding onto it until you came back."



Jeff gave an encouraging nod. "Go on, Eleanor.Take it. It's your mother's way of showing you how much she cares."



With both her parents looking at her so expectantly,Eleanor found she couldn't say no. In a gentle voice, she whispered, "Alright."



Hilda's whole face brightened, her joy unmistakable.With utmost care, she fastened the bracelet around Eleanor's wrist herself.



The bracelet was fitting as though it had been made just for her.



Hilda's eyes lingered on her daughter's wrist, glistening with happy tears.


At last, a deep and genuine happiness filled her heart now that her daughter was finally back where she belonged.
###Chapter 286 Your Son Has Returned!
By the evening of the following day, Nolan's sleek car glided to a stop precisely on time outside the Benton family's stately villa.



Eleanor had just slipped into fresh attire and descended the grand staircase when she glimpsed her mother, Hilda, clinging to Nolan's arm.



Her face was filled with maternal concern.



After all, Norwood was known for his stern demeanor and traditional ways.



He lived and breathed rules, clinging to status as though it were his lifeblood.



Though Nolan had assured her that Norwood no longer disapproved of their union, Hilda's unease lingered like a shadow.



"Nolan, Eleanor has always been her own woman,speaking her heart freely. If her words ruffle your grandfather's feathers, please stand by her. Let any grievances fall on you, not her."


Nolan's gaze met Hilda's anxious eyes with unwavering  resolve. "Mrs. Benton, you have my solemn promise.No harm will come to Eleanor under my care."



His steady words carried a quiet strength, soothing Hilda's frayed nerves.



Hilda observed that beneath Nolan's composed exterior lay a man of steadfast dependability.



With a tender pat on Eleanor's hand, she reluctantly released her daughter.



As the car pulled away from the villa, Eleanor caught a fleeting glimpse of Hilda in the rearview mirror,standing rooted to the spot.



A wave of warmth flooded Eleanor's heart, the unspoken bond of family tying her to home.



The car soon arrived at the Stewart family's resident.



Inside, Nolan and Eleanor stepped into the elegantly arranged living room, where Norwood sat regally in a high-backed chair, savoring a cup of coffee.


When Norwood's eyes fell on Eleanor, the usual austerity in his demeanor softened, replaced by a gentle, welcoming glow. "Eleanor, it's a pleasure to see you. Please, make yourself at home," he said,gesturing with a gracious wave.



The long dining table was adorned with an array of  dishes, each one carefully chosen to suit Eleanor's tastes.



This didn't just happen by coincidence.



Norwood had,with evident care, acquainted himself with her every preference.



Breaking the comfortable silence, Norwood deftly placed a piece of sweet and sour spare rib on Eleanor's plate. "Tell me, have you two settled on a date for the engagement?" he inquired, his tone warm with curiosity.



A faint, knowing smile curved Nolan's lips. "Not yet,Grandpa. But when we do, Eleanor and I would be deeply honored if you would officiate the occasion."



Norwood's face lit up with a broad, heartfelt smile, his eyes crinkling with joy.



"Splendid! Truly splendid!" he declared, the word "splendid" escaping his lips twice, as though savoring its sound. The lines etched around his eyes seemed to soften with his delight.



"Eat heartily, everyone," he urged, his voice unusually tender as he turned to Eleanor. "Come by whenever you can,Eleanor. Your presence would brighten this old house."



Eleanor responded with a soft hum, her last traces of  wariness melting away like morning mist under the warmth of Norwood's kindness.



As Norwood gazed at the well-matched pair, a quiet reflection stirred within him.



He had been wrong before.



The Stewart family didn't need a polished but shallow figure to stand beside Nolan.



They needed Eleanor-capable, astute, and fiercely devoted, a woman who could weather any storm by his side.



Nolan needed her.



Now, with the wisdom of age, Norwood realized that many things lay beyond his control.



Instead of fretting over family quarrels, it was wiser to let the younger generation carve their own path.



What he wanted most was to bask in the uncomplicated joy of being with family.



The dinner unfolded in a symphony of warmth and laughter, the air alive with shared stories and clinking glasses



But just as the evening reached its crescendo, Hector,the butler, burst into the room, his face ashen with urgency.′′Sir, your son has returned!"
###Chapter 287 This Is The Woman You've Fallen For
The moment Hector's words left his mouth,Norwood's pleasant smile vanished completely.



The warmth in his features drained away,replaced by a fierce, thunderous glare.



Gripping his cane so tightly that the veins on his hand stood out, he snapped, "Who allowed Colson back here? Throw him out this instant! I don't have a son like that!"



It was unfathomable to Norwood that Colson would dare to show up again.



At those words, Eleanor's fork paused in midair.



She couldn't help but glance over at Nolan to see his reaction.



As expected, Nolan's face had gone completely cold,his aura sharp and forbidding.



Before anyone could react,a lazy voice drifted in from the entryway. "Dad, I'm home. Have you missed me?"



Just then, a man strolled casually into the room. He wore a striking designer suit, his hair dyed a vivid shade of gold, and a bold, mischievous grin played on his lips.



There was no mistaking the man; it was Colson himself.


Clinging tightly to his arm stood a woman draped in sparkling jewels, clearly eager to show off her affection.



This was Ady, the very woman Colson had chosen over his lawful wife and child, openly defying Norwood's authority.



"Leave!" The moment Norwood spotted Ady, his temper flared. He shot to his feet and swung his cane toward Coson. "Don't you dare call me Dad! I have no son as shameful as you! And you dare parade that woman here? Get out of my sight! You're not welcome to this family. Go!"


Colson moved quickly, catching the cane mid-swing with practiced ease.


A smile lingered on his lips. He was untouched by Norwood's outrage.



With unsettling calm, he replied, "Dad,all these years have passed, and you're still holding a grudge?Brodie's been back recently, hasn't he? You saw him,  right? I've spent years guiding that boy. He's always saying he wants to come home and take care of you."



Just hearing Brodie's name sent Norwood's temper flaring higher. "Take care of me?" he thought bitterly."That boy's done nothing but push me closer to my own grave."



Nolan rose to his feet, his expression glacial, eyes glinting with a chill that swept straight through Colson.



Without taking his gaze off Colson, he gave a curt command to the nearest servant. "See them out."



Colson's features hardened as he finally locked eyes with Nolan,resentment simmering beneath his surface.



In his mind, Nolan was the reason he had been denied his rightful place as head of the Stewart Group, and why Brodie had been cut off from his future.



Now, not only had Nolan claimed everything for himself, but he had also gone after Brodie, freezing all his assets.



He had even forced them out of Zerovia,leaving them with nowhere else to turn.



With their backs against the wall, Colson decided there was nothing left to lose. He had to come back and fight for what was his. Steeling himself, Colson put on a fatherly front."Nolan, it's been a long time. How have you been?"



His attention shifted to Eleanor, a flicker of interest in his gaze. "So, this is the woman you've fallen for?"



Nolan's response was cold and unyielding, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Don't even try to claim any connection to us.Leave,now!"



Colson's confident grin finally broke, and he jabbed a finger at Nolan, shouting furiously, "You ungrateful brat! How dare you speak to your father that way!"



He barely got the words out before a squad of bodyguards in black stormed in, swiftly encircling him and Ady.



When he saw the show of force, Colson's bravado faded. He plastered on a forced grin, his tone suddenly meek. "Hey, now, I was just messing around.I know l've made mistakes over the years. I'll do better, I promise. Ady and I will try to make amends from now on."



Turning his attention to Norwood, he added, "Dad,you and Nolan should get some rest. We won't trouble you anymore tonight.We'll come visit another time."



Without waiting for a reply, Colson grabbed the shaken Ady and ushered her out of the room. The moment the door closed behind them, Norwood's rigid posture collapsed; he looked as though every ounce of strength had left his body, sinking back into the chair.



"Mr.Stewart!" Hector rushed over to steady him



Norwood slumped against the armrest, his breath ragged and uneven.



He closed his eyes, waved Hector away weakly, and let out a weary sigh. "What have I done to deserve such a son?"
###Chapter 288 | Won't Let You Or Brodie Suffer
Nolan shot Hector a meaningful glance.



Catching on immediately, Hector gently helped Norwood to his room to rest.


A moment later, several bodyguards dressed in black strode in.



"Mr.Stewart, they've gone," one of them said, bowing his head.



Nolan gave a curt nod, his tone cool and clipped."Double the security around the estate. From this moment on, Colson is not to set foot anywhere near it."



"Understood." The guards accepted the command without question and slipped away as silently as they would arrived.



Nolan then pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Erick.



"Find out which hotel Colson is holed up in. Deliver a warning-he has got three days to clear out of Elepdon, or he'll learn the hard way what  consequences look like."



With that business settled, Nolan finally turned to Eleanor. She stood beside him, her face taut with worry."Baby, really-I'm fine. Don't trouble yourself.It's late. Let me take you home."



Something in his steady voice reassured Eleanor, and the tension in her shoulders eased. "Alright," she agreed softly.



Meanwhile,Colson and Ady had just returned to their suite at the Lumina Hotel.


Brodie,who had been pacing in the living room,rushed over the instant they walked in.



"Dad,how did it go wvith Grandpa?"



Colson ripped off his jacket and tossed it carelessly onto the couch, his face dark with irritation. "Don't even get me started," he barked.



The meeting had gone worse than he ever imagined.After all these years, Nolan of all people called the shots in the Stewart family.



He had not only thrown him out in front of Norwood but issued orders as if the family crown already sat on his head.



Since when did Nolan hold all the reins? Ady was just as furious; she turned her fire squarely on Colson.



"Because of Nolan, Brodie got sent packing from Zerovia, your assets are frozen solid, and now we're barred from our own home! If you don't come up with a plan soon, the three of us will be tossed out of Elepdon with nothing but the clothes on our backs!"


Seeing her wrath boil over, Colson scrambled to soothe her. "Baby, don't work yourself up. I promise -I won't let you or Brodie suffer."



But no sooner had the words left his mouth than a soft knock sounded at the door.



Brodie, being closest, went to open it.


On the threshold stood Erick, sharp in a tailored black suit, his face carved in stone.


His icy gaze slid past Brodie and locked on Colson lounging in the living room. "My boss's orders are simple," he said flatly. "You have three days to leave Elepdon. Fail to comply, and we'll personally see you escorted out."



Before Colson could open his mouth, Brodie shot forward, bristling with indignation. "And who the hell do you think you are, barging in here and threatening us like that?" Erick's eyes never wavered-cold, steady, not even the flicker of a brow. "I'm simply carrying out orders."


With a faint, almost dismissive nod, he turned on his heel and walked out.


The door clicked shut, and a heavy silence settled over the suite like a suffocating fog.


Ady's composure shattered. She crumpled into Colson's arms, striking his chest with trembling fists."Did you hear him, Colson? Three days! He means to corner us!"



Colson's face darkened. With a snarl, he slammed his fist against the coffee table, the sound reverberating through the room. His jaw clenched tight, teeth grinding. "I'm his father! I refuse to be driven out like some beggar. Let's see just how far he dares push me!"


The three of them convinced themselves that Nolan was bluffing.



And so, they resolved to remain at the Lumina Hotel,daring Nolan to make good on his threat.
 ###Chapter 289 You're Not Alone
Back at the Benton family's villa, Eleanor found herself unable to settle down, her thoughts constantly drifting to Nolan.



Unable to shake her worry, she made her way to the villa in Regal Heights early the next morning.



The moment she arrived, Lilah nearly ran to her,relief written all over her face. "Miss Warren, I'm so relieved you're here. Mr. Stewart came home before sunrise and locked himself in his third-floor room. He hasn't spoken or eaten a bite since."



Lilah's words sent a fresh wave of concern through Eleanor.



Before Eleanor could respond, Lilah continued in a low voice, "Today marks the anniversary of his mother's death. He's probably grieving for her."



Eleanor had heard bits and pieces about Reyna's story,but much of it was still a mystery to her.



Curious and wanting to help, she gently asked Lilah to share what really happened. Lilah hesitated, but after a moment, then slowly started explaining everything in full detail. "Years ago,Mr. Stewart's parents truly loved each other. But eventually, his father became involved with Ady. Ady was the daughter of a servant in the Freeman family and had grown up alongside his mother. Despite their different standings, the two had been as close as sisters."



With a sigh, she went on, "When his mother, already expecting Miss Stewart, found out about the affair,she was devastated. Even when his father insisted on a divorce, she refused. So, he moved out with Ady.Heartbroken, his mother gave birth to Miss Stewart,but her health declined rapidly. Not long after, in the depths of her despair, she took her own life by walking into the sea."



Tears welled up in Lilah's eyes as she continued,"Right after his mother's funeral, his father married that woman, Ady. After that, well, you know how everything turned out."



Eleanor listened in silence, her own eyes brimming with sympathy and heartache.


She finally understood that Nolan hadn't just been cast aside by his father, Colson; he had also carried the unbearable weight of Reyna's tragic end, and betrayal burned deep into his soul. The thought of how lost and powerless he must have felt back then made her chest ache.



Lilah dabbed at her tears, her voice pleading softly."Miss Warren, Mr. Stewart is holding on to so much pain. We all wish we could help, but none of us knows how.Please, could you go to him? Maybe you'll be able to comfort him."



It was clear Lilah's care for Nolan ran deep. He stood above everyone else, yet seemed forever isolated,unreachable by most.



Glancing up the staircase, Eleanor gave a determined nod.



She found Nolan sitting on the floor in her room,clutching a photograph in his hands.


The woman in the picture had kind eyes and an air of gentle grace. It was Reyna.



Without a word,Eleanor crossed the room and quietly settled down beside him.



She didn't try to fill the silence, choosing instead to simply be there for him.



Lilah's story kept replaying in her mind, over and over.



Now it made sense that Nolan wasn't truly cold; he  had just buried all his softness and kindness along with his mother's memory.


After a long, heavy silence, Nolan at last took action.


He turned to face her, voice rough and strained. "So,you've learned the whole story?"


Eleanor swallowed hard, struggling to keep her emotions in check.



In a gentle whisper, she promised, "From now on,you're not alone. Your mother would want you to find happiness again."


Nolan met her steady, understanding gaze, his stormy expression slowly softening.


For a while, he didn't speak, and then, in a low voice,said,"I need some time by myself."



Eleanor gave his hand a comforting pat and rose to her feet."I'll make us some lunch. Come down when you're ready."



At that,Eleanor slipped out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.


Once outside,she leaned against the wall,letting out a long, shaky breath.



She couldn't help noticing how alike they were. Both  had survived harsh childhoods, and both understood what it meant to feel completely alone.



Yet somehow, she had found her family at last,while he still remained caught in a cage of resentment.


After collecting herself, Eleanor made her way downstairs, intending to pick up some groceries from the nearby market.



As she stepped onto the first floor, she bumped into Fannie, who had just returned from a tutoring session.



Spotting Eleanor, Fannie broke into a bright smile and immediately looped her arm through Eleanor's. "Are you going out,Eleanor?"



The genuine affection in Fannie's eyes made Eleanor's heart warm.



"I am. I was just about to get some groceries," she replied with a nod.



Fannie's eyes sparkled, hope and excitement mingling in her expression. "Could I tag along? It's been ages since I went to the supermarket with anyone."



Eleanor couldn't resist her enthusiasm, giving Fannie's nose a gentle, playful tap."Of course you can. Let's go together."
###Chapter 290 You Are Not My Mother
The supermarket hummed with life, its bright lights making every aisle feel warm and welcoming



Fannie pushed the cart beside Eleanor, her hands tightening and loosening on the handle as if debating with herself. At last, she leaned closer and whispered,"Eleanor...I heard my dad and that woman are back in town."



Eleanor's hand froze midway to the vegetable bin.Slowly, she turned, her eyes meeting the nervous flicker in Fannie's gaze.



She sighed inwardly.



A child her age ought to be carefree, chasing after dreams instead of being dragged down by family shadows.



Both she and Nolan had tried their best to shield Fannie from all that ugliness.



"Fannie,just keep your mind on your studies," Eleanor said gently. "The rest isn't yours to carry."


Fannie dropped her gaze, her lashes fanning shadows  across her cheeks.



Deep down, she knew Eleanor and Nolan were only protecting her.



She hadn't been born when everything fell apart, with no memories to hold on to. But years of whispers from the household staff and gossip drifting in from outside had etched the truth into her heart.



She felt no true bond with the man who called himself her father, nor with the mother she had never had the chance to know.



One had never given her love, and the other was lost to her before she could even remember a face.



And yet... somehow, Fannie could still sense the sorrow her mother must have drowned in. That grief,though distant, felt like a thread tying their hearts together.



Seeing Fannie's spirits sink, Eleanor reached out and gently mussed her hair, her voice tender.



"Wherever your mother is, I'm sure she would want only one thing-for you to live happily. Leave the rest to us adults,hmm?"



Fannie nodded, her eyes shining with unspilled tears.



Just then, a sharp, saccharine voice sliced through the  Not M...hum of the store.



"Well, if it isn't Miss Warren! What a coincidence running into you here!"



Eleanor turned her head and spotted Ady striding toward them, heels clicking like tiny hammers, her smile painted on with insincerity.



With only the faintest glance and a cool little hum,Eleanor steered Fannie to keep moving.


But Ady-still smarting from her run-in with Nolan last night-wasn't about to let them slip through her fingers.


She stepped squarely in their way, lips curling into a mock-sweet grin as her eyes swept over Fannie.



"My, my. Is this what the Bentons call manners? No hello for your fiancee's family? And this must be Fannie, right? Such a pretty little thing. Here-since it's our very first meeting, how about I give you a gift?"


Ady slipped her manicured hand into her designer bag and drew out a sleek black credit card, holding it toward Fannie with mock generosity. "Here.Go on-spend it however you like. Don't be shy with me...after all, I'm your mother."


Fannie's stomach twisted at the words. She stared at the card as if it were poison, then slapped it to the floor with a sharp crack. "You're not my mother!"



Eleanor immediately stepped in front of Fannie,shielding the girl with a protective arm. Her gaze turned to ice as it locked on Ady. "Let's go. Don't waste your breath on her."



"Stop right there!" Ady's face flushed crimson, her composure unraveling under the sting of public humiliation.



How dared these two insolent women treat her with such contempt?



Her voice rose as she addressed Eleanor. "Iam Colson's lawful wife! Once you marry Nolan, I'll be your mother-in-law."



Frowning, she continued, "And you, Fannie! I'm your father's wife, which makes me your mother. What?Don't you even know the basics of respect?"



She sneered."Perhaps it's time I had a little word with the Benton family about whether this engagement is still suitable!"



The word "mother-in-law" struck Eleanor like a shard of glass, stirring memories of Reyna, a gentle woman driven past her limits by betrayal.



Eleanor stopped mid-step. Slowly, she turned back,her eyes burning with contempt. "My future mother-in -law has long passed away. As for you, you're nothing but a homewrecker. Don't delude yourself, Fannie will never call you 'Mom.'"

###Chapter 291 Why Don't We Choose Someone Better
Shoppers in the supermarket began to slow down,whispering and pointing at the commotion.



Ady hated nothing more than being called a mistress or a homewrecker.



Her temper flared as she raised her hand to strike Eleanor. "Say that again,you cunt?"


But Eleanor was faster. She caught Ady's wrist and shoved her hard.



Ady tumbled straight to the floor.



Colson,just done at the counter, rushed over to help her up.



Ady seized the chance, bursting into dramatic sobs."Colson, I can't bear this anymore! Your future daughter-in-law called me a homewrecker.You know I'm not like that. I only love you too much."


Colson,softened by her tears, tried to soothe her.



Once she calmed, he turned a cold gaze on Eleanor."Apologize!" Eleanor rolled her eyes without hesitation.



That only fueled Colson's rage. He snapped, "So you refuse, huh? Fine! Let's see how you marry Nolan without my approval!"



Eleanor let out a mocking laugh. "And you really believe Nolan would listen to you?"



Fannie stepped in, her voice sharp. "Exactly. Nolan stopped seeing you as a father long ago. Who do you think you are?"



Fannie rarely spoke like this, but today her anger spilled over.



Colson's glare shifted instantly to her."I'm your father!Watch your tongue!"



Ady pretended to play peacemaker. "Colson, let it go.Fannie's young and don't know better. I even gave her a card earlier, and she refused. She's still immature.Why take offense?"



Her words sounded gentle, but they were laced with thorns.



As expected, Colson flared up. He stepped forward and grabbed Fannie. "Apologize to your mother!"



Fannie's eyes burned with defiance."Why should Colson's playful arrogance vanished. His tone turned dark. "Because I'm your father!"



To him, Reyna's children were nothing but trouble.



Fannie and Nolan were always against Ady-and against him.



Only Brodie was loyal.



Eleanor had seen shameless men before, but Colson was in a league of his own.



She yanked Fannie back, shielding her.



Her eyes mocked him as she said, "Father? You drove your wife to her death for a mistress and abanddoned your children.What kind of father does that make you?"



Colson's face tightened, her words cutting deep.



And though it angered him, he knew she was right.



Still, in his heart, he felt no guilt. His love for Ady was all that mattered.



He opened his mouth to argue, but Eleanor had already led Fannie away.



Enraged,Colson kicked the wall. "I won't let a woman like her into our family!" Ady,however,had her own thoughts.



She had looked into Eleanor and knew the woman was capable.



If Eleanor became Nolan's wife, it would be more difficult for them to bringing him down.



Clutching his sleeve, Ady put on the mask of a gentle wife. "Colson, Eleanor isn't worthy of Nolan. Why don't we choose someone better? You're his father -you still hold that power. Norwood's hard to influence, but if Nolan's wife were someone we could control-"



She let her words trail off.



But Colson understood.



Even if Nolan didn't see him as a father, he still had the the right to interfere.



If they replaced Eleanor with a girl of their choosing,the Stewart Group would slip right back into their hands.



His eyes gleamed as he turned to Ady. "You're brilliant.Handle it. Destroy Eleanor's chances and find the right woman."



Ady leaned closer and whispered a name. Colson's eyes lit up, and a smug smile tugged at his lips.



"Perfect. You take charge, Ady. Just tell me when to step in."
###Chapter 292 You Hardly Ever Have Time For Me！
Eleanor had no idea what was brewing behind the scenes.



When she and Fannie got back to the villa in Regal Heights, she found Nolan already downstairs,sitting quietly on the sofa.



With a quick gesture, Eleanor signaled to Fannie and made her way into the kitchen.



Whatever Fannie had whispered to Nolan must have worked,because by the time Eleanor reappeared,his mood had noticeably improved.



In no time, six dishes were arranged on the table.



The three of them gathered around, laughter and warmth filling the room as they enjoyed their meal together.


Once they had finished eating, Fannie, ever the spark of the group,suggested,"Nolan,Eleanor,tomorrow's the weekend. Let's go camping! My friends say the countryside is gorgeous this time of year, and there are fireflies at night!" She had picked up on Nolan's earlier sadness and wanted to cheer him up.


Eleanor and Nolan exchanged uncertain glances.



Not one to give up, Fannie clung to Eleanor's arm and pleaded, "Please? You hardly ever have time for me!All my friends have been there, but I haven't gotten to go yet."



Unable to say no to Fannie's earnest request,Eleanor gave in and agreed.



With Eleanor on board, Nolan saw no reason to object.



Just as their camping plans were settled, Hilda's call came through. "Eleanor, where are you? I made you a nourishing soup. Hurry home or it'll get cold!"


Since the phone was on speaker, Nolan could hear Hilda's familiar, caring voice loud and clear.



It was clear Hilda was anxious for Eleanor to come home.



Letting out a quiet sigh, Nolan rose to his feet. "I'll drive you back."



Soon enough, the car pulled up outside the Benton family's villa.



Eleanor released her seatbelt, but didn't step out of the car.



She shifted her gaze toward the man sitting next to her.



Pale streetlight spilled through the window, outlining his sharply defined features in a gentle wash of shadow.



Nolan met her gaze, his eyes warm and steady. "I'll be here at nine tomorrow morning to pick you up."


"Okay," Eleanor replied, finally unbuckling her seatbelt before leaning over to wrap him in a gentle embrace.



She didn't say a word, but Nolan understood the comfort behind her touch.



He held her close, letting his chin rest lightly atop her head. "Try to get some sleep," he murmured.



The following morning, Nolan and Fannie were packed up and ready to go.


As they headed toward the door, a taxi pulled up,blocking their path.



The taxi door swung open, and a young woman in a white dress stepped out, suitcase in tow.


Her small face looked drained of color, her eyes puffy  and rimnmed with red; she had clearly been crying, and the sadness on her face made her look especially fragile.


The moment her eyes landed on Nolan, Elora Tyree froze,her gaze flooding with tears. "Nolan, I've missed you so much."


Nolan looked at her for a moment, his expression unreadable.



Recognition flickered in his eyes and, almost unconsciously,his features softened. "Elora? When did you get back?"


Elora was practically his family, a maid's daughter,raised by Reyna after her own mother died giving birth.



With only a two-year age gap between them, Elora and Nolan had grown up side by side.


Later,when Reyna was expecting Fannie, the maid's widower returned and brought Elora overseas.


From that day forward, she and Nolan had gone their separate ways.


Yet, despite the years, a piece of Nolan's heart had always remained with her. To him, she was like a little sister.


Curiosity lighting up her face, Fannie studied the newcomer.



She remembered Lilah mentioning Nolan's childhood friend.



With a cheerful smile, she stepped forward."You must be Elora, I've heard so much about you."



Elora looked pleasantly startled by Fannie's warm greeting. "And you're Fannie, aren't you?"
###Chapter 293 Nolan Won't Let Anything Happen To Y...
With a bright smile, Fannie hooked her armn through Elora's.



"That's right, Elora, it's me, Fannie. We're about to go camping with Nolan's fiancée. Want to come along?"



The mention of Nolan's fiancée sent a fleeting shadow of jealousy across Elora's eyes, but it disappeared so quickly that neither Fannie nor Nolan caught it.


She gave a soft sigh, her tone carrying a hint of sadness. "You all go ahead. I... I'm not feeling well today."



As she spoke, she subtly drew her hand behind her back, almost as if she didn't want anyone to see.


Nolan's attention sharpened at her pallor, a frown creasing his brow. He gently reached for her hand,and when he saw it, his face darkened with concern."Who did this to you?"



Elora's hand was mottled with bruises, some fresh and others already fading, the sight startling.



In a rush, she yanked her hand away and shook her  head. "It's nothing, really. I just took a bad fall. Aren't you about to head out? Don't let me hold you up. I only stopped by to say hello before checking into the hotel."



Nolan didn't buy her excuse for a second. His expression stern, he ushered her inside and settled her onto the sofa.



"Lilah, get my doctor here right away," Nolan instructed firmly.


Elora's hands flew up in protest, panic in her voice."No, Nolan, it's really not necessary. I'm fine."


But Nolan refused to budge, standing silently by until the doctor arrived.



After a careful examination, the doctor's expression turned grim. The verdict was clear: Elora had been enduring physical abuse for months.


Fannie clapped a hand to her mouth, horrified. "That's horrible.Who could do something like this?"



Nolan's jaw tightened as he demanded answers. "Elora,are you still going to hide who did this to you?"



Acting as if she were cornered, Elora spoke.



"Three years ago,I got a boyfriend. He was kind to me at first, but after my father died, and I had no one left  he changed. Whenever he got upset, he'd take it out on me."



Her voice quivered as she continued, "Recently, I tried to break it off for good. But he started stalking me,threatening me, hurting me whenever he could.couldn't take it anymore, so I ran... I had nowhere else to go but here."



As Elora confessed, tears spilled down her cheeks, and she began to sob, her shoulders shaking with every breath.



Fannie squeezed Elora's hand tightly, reassuring her,"Don't be scared. He can't hurt you here. You're safe.Nolan won't let anything happen to you."



Elora's tear-filled eyes flickered to Nolan, worry etched on her face, as if she were afraid to burden him.



She quickly tried to reassure him, "Nolan, I never wanted to cause any trouble. I just wanted to see you If it's too much, I can always stay at a hotel."



Nolan thought it over for a moment before giving a firm nod. "For now, you can stay here."



He had always thought of Elora like a sister. There was no way he could leave her to fend for herself.Making room for one more at home was the least he could do.



Fannie let out a visible sigh of relief, happy with his  choice.



Elora's eyes filled with gratitude, and she thanked them over and over, tugging at Fannie's heartstrings.


With arrangements in place, Nolan turned to Fannie."Stay here with Elora for a bit, Fannie. I'm going to find Eleanor."


Fannie had hoped to spend time with Eleanor herself,but thinking of all Elora had endured, she agreed without complaint.


By ten o'clock, Nolan slipped out of the house.


He had barely made it to the intersection when Fannie's urgent call came through.


"Nolan,Elora passed out!"



Nolan hesitated only a moment before pulling out his phone to text Eleanor.


"Something came up. We'll have to postpone our camping trip."



With the message sent, he turned the car around and headed straight back to the villa.



For his mother's sake, he was determined to make sure Elora had everything she needed.
###Chapter 294 I've Been Dumped!
When Nolan stepped into the villa, he found his personal doctor already waiting.


This visit, the physician carried an array of medical equipment.


After performing a detailed examination on Elora, the man hesitated, his solemn face betraying the weight of his findings.



Fannie's voice trembled with worry as she asked,"Please, just tell us! What's happening to Elora?"


The doctor clenched his jaw and replied, "She's been neglecting proper meals for too long, leaving her physically frail. On top of that, prolonged mistreatment has taken a toll on her mind. She requires balanced nutrition and emotional care.Otherwise-"



His unfinished words hung in the air, but both Nolan and Fannie instantly grasped the meaning.



In plain truth, Elora was struggling with depression brought on by her abusive ex. If nothing changed, she might share Reyna's tragic fate of ending her own life.



Nolan, shaken by the thought, slammed his hand against the wall, anger burning inside him. "Damn it!"



At that moment, Elora opened her eyes



Her gaze flickered with confusion. "Nolan, didn't you go? You should leave. Don't keep your fiancée waiting I'll manage."


Remembering the physician's warning, Nolan softened his voice. "Elora, I'm fine. I'll stay here with you today."



He couldn't endure the thought of losing another person close to him to depression.



Fannie quickly added in a soothing tone, "Elora, relax.Eleanor is a kind person. You'll understand once you meet her. Just stay here peacefully and stop worrying."



Although she seemed uncertain, Elora eventually nodded.



She exhaled gently with resignation. "Alright, I'll do as you say."



Meanwhile,Eleanor knew nothing of this. After she read Nolan's message, the brief spark of joy in her heart dimmed. Still,she chose to understand.


Nolan managed the Stewart Group, a massive corporation, so constant busyness was inevitable.


Yet disappointment continued gnawing inside her.



Descending the staircase,Hilda noticed Eleanor hadn't gone out and frowned in surprise. "Sweetie, weren't you planning some fun? Why are you still here?"


Eleanor forced a casual smile. "Nolan had an urgent matter, so our outing's off."


She truly didn't take it to heart.



But in the following days, Nolan's actions turned strange.



It felt like he had vanished completely from her world.



Other than brief morning and night texts, he sent nothing-no extra greetings, not even one call.


The distance between them felt as though they had become strangers again.



Eleanor wasn't prone to suspicion, yet unease coiled tighter in her chest eachday.



What occupied him so much? Should she go to Regal Heights?


Before she could act, her phone buzzed with Lillian's call.


"Eleanor! I've been dumped!" Lillian cried.


The shrill wailing was so intense that Eleanor pulled the phone away from her ear.


She hadn't even heard of Lillian dating anyone.



Was it yet another fleeting crush on some guy younger than her?


Pondering that, she asked, "Lillian, who exactly dumped you?"



Through sobs, Lillian barely managed to breathe."Fraser's going on a blind date! How could he do this?"


Eleanor rubbed her aching temples, realizing once again how oddly Lillian's mind worked.



A one-sided obsession with no actual progress had somehow turned into heartbreak.



While Eleanor reflected, an unfamiliar male voice entered the call politely. "Hello, are you her friend?She's drunk. Could you come take her home?"



Eleanor let out a sigh. She couldn't possibly leave her closest friend stranded in the street.


After receiving the location, she hailed a cab and set out.


Inside the restaurant, Lillian was sprawled across the table, empty bottles scattered around, mumbling curses at Fraser.


Eleanor paid the bill, then struggled to lift her drunken friend toward the door.



As they reached the entrance, two figures appeared before them.



The tall man standing there was Nolan, the very person she had waited for days.


At his side, a woman in a white dress clung tightly to his arm, leaning against him with a sweet smile as she whispered.
###Chapter 295 Are You Upset
Eleanor froze the moment she saw the scene before her.



Her eyes locked on that familiar face, and for a moment,her mind went blank.



Nolan had told her he was busy with something urgent.Was this what he had meant?



She didn't want to question his loyalty, yet her fingers tightened around Lillian's hand, as if clinging to it could steady her heart.



Nolan met her gaze without flinching. His voice was calm, not a trace of hesitation. "Eleanor, this is Elora Guyton.My mother adopted her years ago. She's like a sister to me."



Elora stepped forward cheerfully, her smile soft and harmless, her tone sweet. "It's a pleasure to meet you,Eleanor. I'm Elora. I've heard so much about you, and you're even more beautiful than I imagined! Nolan kept you hidden from me all this time.Finally,I get to meet you."



The two of them showed no unease, as though nothing was out of place. Still, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that Elora wasn't as simple as she appeared.



Pushing down her doubts, she reached out and shook Elora's hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you too,Elora."



Elora's eyes lit up as she gave a warm invitation."Are you here for dinner as well? Why don't you join us?The more, the merrier. I've been with Nolan and Fannie these days, and honestly, I'm getting a little bored."



Eleanor's chest tightened at those words.



So this was Nolan's urgent matter-keeping Elora company.



A jumble of emotions weighed her down, leaving her breathless.



Yet,looking at Elora's innocent smile, she wondered if she was simply imagining things.


She steadied herself, masking her feelings behind her usual coolness. "No, thank you. My friend is drunk.I need to take her home."



With that, she helped Lillian up and turned to leave.



Something in Nolan panicked as he watched her go.He hurried after her. "Let me help you." He took the drunken Lillian from Eleanor's arms and supported her firmly.



Glancing back at Elora with apology in his eyes, he said, "Elora, I'm sorry to leave you alone. I'll have a driver pick you up later."


Elora waved it off with a knowing smile. "It's fine.Home isn't far. I'll just grab a taxi."



Nolan gave a short nod,then left with Eleanor,guiding Lillian out.



They dropped Lillian at her house, and soon only the two of them remained in the car.



Silence filled the ride.



Eleanor leaned against the window, watching the world outside, unwilling to speak.



She hated feeling that way.



It was as if her man no longer belonged to her completely.


Nolan's grip tightened on the steering wheel. He wanted to explain,but each time the words rose to his lips, he didn't know how to begin.



By the time he stopped at the Benton family's villa,Eleanor felt a twinge of disappointment. She unfastened her seatbelt, her face unreadable "Thank you."



Her tone was flat, stripped of warmth.



She opened the door, ready to leave, when Nolan suddenly caught her wrist and pulled her back.



He leaned in, wrapping her firmly in his arms



His chin rested on her head, his voice low and rough."Are you upset?"


Eleanor froze, his clean scent softening her heart,though she forced herself to answer, "I'm not."



Nolan sighed and tightened his embrace. His hand stroked her hair gently. "Eleanor, I'm sorry for making you feel neglected. Elora is just like a sister. Once things settle, I'll make it up to you."



Nestled in his arms, Eleanor gave him a light pinch in playful punishment.



The couple stayed wrapped in each other, their closeness pulling them toward something deeper.



Just as their lips were about to meet, Elora's call shattered the moment.



"Nolan, help! He's back in the country.He's following me! I'm terrified-" Her voice cut off with sudden chaos on the other end,followed by silence.



Nolan's expression darkened in an instant.



Fear for Elora left him no choice. After giving Eleanor a brief explanation, he said, "Eleanor, I'm sorry,but have to find her."
###Chapter 296 I've Missed You Like Crazy Lately!
Nolan couldn't turn his back on Elora, not when she was practically family.


Swallowing the odd feeling that rose within her,Eleanor replied in her usual calm tone, "I'll come with you."



With no further hesitation, Nolan started the engine and pulled out.



He kept one hand steady on the wheel and used the other to call Erick and shared Elora's phone number with him. "I need you to trace this number. Do it now,"he ordered.



Erick responded instantly, not missing a beat."Understood, Mr. Stewart."


As expected, Erick worked quickly. In under a minute,a small red dot started blinking on the dashboard's GPS.



The signal pointed straight to a deserted alley in Westhaven.



Nolan made a sharp turn and sped in that direction. When he and Eleanor arrived, they spotted Elora huddled in the shadows, arms wrapped tightly around her knees,her body shaking.



As footsteps echoed toward her, Elora's head snapped up,eyes wide with mock fear.



The moment she recognized Nolan, she scrambled upright.



Without thinking, she flung herself into his embrace,her tears spilling freely.



"Nolan! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to drag you into this.I was just... I was terrified. I kept thinking he'll come after me again, and I wouldn't make it out this time."



Nolan's body tensed for a moment, but then he gently rested a hand on her back, offering what comfort he could. "You're safe now. I promise."



Eleanor hung back a few paces, watching the scene unfold with a quiet sense of distance.



In that moment, she felt like an outsider rather than a part of their world.



Sensing Eleanor's presence, Elora quickly stepped out of Nolan's embrace.



She brushed away her tears, offering Eleanor a small, apologetic look. "Forgive me, Eleanor. Whenever1′m frightened, I've always turned to Nolan. It's just how it's always been since we were little. I hope you don't misunderstand."



A subtle, unreadable smile appeared on Eleanor's lips."No worries. I understand," she replied simply.



Turning to Nolan, she spoke gently. "It's late. Let's get her home."



Half an hour later, they pulled up at the villa in Regal Heights.



Eleanor had suspected Elora might end up staying,but watching her disappear into the guest room still left a faint ache in her chest.



The atmosphere in the house felt noticeably different now.



Still, Elora had done nothing wrong, and Eleanor couldn't find any reason to ask her to leave.



Noticing the subtle shift in Eleanor's mood, Nolan pulled her into a soft embrace, his chin resting lightly on her hair. "I'm sorry I've been so distant lately Eleanor."



He leaned in to press a kiss to the corner of her lips.



But for reasons she couldn't quite name, Eleanor instinctively turned away.



She tried to keep her expression composed, meeting his eyes with practiced calm. "It's fine.I understand."



Though Eleanor's words were flat and emotionless,Nolan couldn't shake the sense that something had shifted between them.



An unspoken distance settled between them, subtle yet impossible to miss.



But how could that be possible?



He had only stepped in for Elora out of an old friendship. Nothing improper had happened, and Eleanor was always so reasonable. Surely, she wouldn't be upset over something like this.



Deciding he was simply reading too much into things,he tried to let the worry go.



Just then, the awkward silence between them was broken as Fannie came bounding down the stairs.



"Nolan, where's Elora? Erick told me her ex has been stalking her. I wNas so scared!" Fannie said with concern.



Nolan nodded toward the guest room. "She's alright I brought her home, and she's resting now."


Fannie let out a relieved breath,then spotted Eleanor  and lit up.



She rushed over, latching onto Eleanor's hand."Eleanor! You're here! I've missed you like crazy lately!"



Eleanor tried to get a word in, but Fannie was already chattering on.



"Don't be mad at me or Nolan, okay? This is all because of that horrible ex of Elora's. You wouldn't believe how bad it was! Elora came here half-starved,covered in bruises, crying every other minute. Oh! You know something about medicine, right? Could you take a look at Elora for us?"
###Chapter 297 The Target Seems To Be Your Fiancée
Eleanor took her time before finally giving a small nod."Alright, let me have a look," she replied.



Beneath her calm exterior, Eleanor was determined to find out whether Elora's pain was real or just an act.



She stepped up to the guest room door and gave it a gentle knock. Inside, Elora leaned against the headboard, lost in her book. When the door opened,Elora started to get up.



Fannie hurried to her side, placing a steadying hand on her shoulder. "Don't move, Elora. You're still healing."



Fannie then shared the real reason why they had come.



Elora listened, and her expression became a mix of relief and embarrassment. "Thank you, Eleanor," she murmured, calmly offering her wrist, its bruises clear to see.



Taking a seat beside her, Eleanor began examining Elora.



It was obvious that Elora's body was worn down by long-term neglect and stress.


Everything about her condition supported the truth of her story. There was no hint she was pretending.



Yet, Eleanor couldn't shake a subtle sense of discomfort.



It was so subtle that she couldn't even put it into words.



She had no desire to doubt Elora, especially with Nolan regarding her as family.


Maybe she was simply letting her thoughts spiral.



Eleanor masked any concern with a composed smile before speaking. "You're fine for now. Just remember to look after yourself from now on," she advised.


Fannie let out a quiet sigh, finally at ease.



With a courteous nod, Eleanor excused herself and made her way to the living room. Nolan trailed after her, and she turned to face him. "I got to go," she announced.



Nolan instinctively reached out, not wanting her to leave so soon.



It had been days since they had really connected,and he longed for her company. Still,Eleanor paid no mind to his obvious longing,holding up her phone as if to prove a point. "My mom just messaged. She wants me home early," she explained.



Nolan just watched her go, unable to find the words to make her stay.


Once she left through the grand gates of the villa, she immediately called for the Benton family's driver.


The crisp air outside offered a small sense of relief from her tangled thoughts.



Without her realizing it, Nolan stood quietly by the upstairs window, watching her.


Was she telling the truth just now?


If her mom truly wanted her home right away, she would have sent a car without delay. There was no way she would have been left waiting.



But then,what was the real reason she lied to him?



Letting little things slide had always been her way. On paper, Elora's arrival shouldn't have rattled her at all.


Still, he had messed up. His recent detachment had left Eleanor feeling neglected.



He needed to figure out how to set things right between them.



Suddenly, his phone buzzed, and Erick's name flashed across the screen.



"Boss, I owe you an apology. You trusted me to send Colson and his family away in three days, but l couldn't get it done. I've discovered they're plotting something behind your back. It's already in motion,and this time, the target seems to be your fiancée.The details are still blurry, but I'll dig deeper until I have answers."



Trouble brewing for Eleanor?



A shadow crossed Nolan's face, his mood turning icy."Make sure someone is keeping watch over Eleanor at all times. Her safety comes first. And double our efforts to expose whatever they're planning."


Without missing a beat, Erick responded. "Will do."



Nolan had no idea that his decision was misguided,missing the true danger lurking beneath the surface.That single mistake almost cost him the woman he cherished most.


But that was a story for another day.


As Nolan began climbing the stairs, a gentle voice called out, pulling him from his thoughts. "Nolan?" Elora's words trembled with uncertainty.


She lingered near the steps, her eyes anxious.


"Maybe it's better if I find somewhere else to stay,"she suggested. "I get the feeling Eleanor's upset.Women usually trust their instincts, and I don't want to cause any tension between you two."


Seeing Elora's willingness to step back, even when she was still recovering, softened something in Nolan.



"Eleanor isn't mad at you. She's only frustrated because I haven't been around much lately. You don't need to worry about it. I used to be with her almost all the time," Nolan explained, a hint of fondness brightening his tone as he remembered the old days.



Only then did it truly dawn on Nolan that Eleanor was hurt because he had grown distant.



They had always been close, practically inseparable,but lately, he had let that slip. The fact that she hadn't confronted him or thrown accusations his way made him realize just how patient she was.



A quiet chuckle slipped from Nolan at the thought. He looked back at Elora. "You just focus on getting some rest. Leave the worrying to me." With that,he disappeared into his study.



Reaching for the flashy little romance guidebook he hadn't finished, Nolan settled in and began reading,determined to make things right.
###Chapter 298 I'm Starving


Nolan spent the entire night reading the romance guidebook, searching for a way to make things right.


By sunrise, inspiration struck-he would redo the proposal, but this time, he would change the entire scene and let the world see just how much Eleanor meant to him.



He wanted everyone, especially her fans, to witness the love that had been so real during their first engagement.


Energized by the plan, Nolan dove headfirst into preparations.



Days slipped by without a word from him, leaving Eleanor to wonder if he was still busy keeping Elora company. That thougt weighed heavy, making her feel even more alone.



Sensing her daughter's gloom, Hilda gently brushed Eleanor's hair aside and gave her a warm smile."You've been locked up at home for too long. How about we go out for some shopping and clear your head?"



Eleanor agreed, thinking some time out with Hilda  might lift her spirits.



They headed downtown, ending up at the city's largest mall.



A lavish boutique with gold trim and floor-to-ceiling windows caught Hilda's attention, and she tugged Eleanor toward the entrance. "This place looks interesting. Let's pop in for a look."



Just as Eleanor was about to step through the doors,she spotted two familiar faces reflected in the glass -Ady and Elora.


Inside, Elora knelt at Ady's feet, slipping shoes onto her with careful hands, looking for all the world like a servant.



The sight left Eleanor stunned, and her face fell. Hilda immediately noticed the change. "Sweetie, are you feeling okay? Did something happen?"



Eleanor shook her head and quickly took her mother's hand. "Mom, I think I need to sit down for a bit. Can you come with me?"


Before Hilda could answer, Eleanor hurried her away from the store, doing her best to avoid being seen.



Eleanor settled into a coffee shop, her thoughts spinning in a hundred directions. So Elora was working for Ady all along?



That nagging unease finally made sense.


Still, Elora hadn't crossed any lines, careful never to slip.



Would Nolan even believe her if she spoke up?



Or would he brush it off as jealousy?



That thought made Eleanor pause. Maybe she needed proof. Turning to Hilda, she improvised. "Mom, I think I dropped my earring. Can you wait here for me a second?"



Before Hilda could reply, Eleanor was already halfway out the door.



Left behind, Hilda looked after her, puzzled but patient.



Eleanor raced back toward the boutique, clutching her phone, ready to snap a picture. But when she peeked inside,Ady and Elora had vanished.



She let out a sigh, deciding not to dwell on it.



Deep down, she trusted that Nolan was nobody's fool.


 
If Elora had hidden motives, he would figure it out on his own. And really, without any evidence, what could she even say?



Moments later, Hilda found her lingering by the storefront,lost in thought.


Eleanor perked up and looped her arm through her mother's, forcing a smile. "Mom, I'm starving."



Hilda's eyes softened, her concern melting into a warm laugh. "Perfect timing! There's a new place nearby everyone's raving about. Let's go spoil ourselves a little," she replied,her tone light.


Eleanor nodded, matching her mother's pace as they walked side by side toward the restaurant.
###Chapter 299 Remember Your Task
The underground garage was dim and silent as Elora escorted Ady to her car, politely opening the door for her.



Ady slipped a check from her bag and handed it over."Take it."



Her eyes were cold, her tone sharper still. "Did anyone see you leave?"


Elora's heart raced as she clutched the check, her fingers trembling with excitement. "Don't worry, Ady.Nolan's been so busy lately, he's hardly ever home."


Ady's gaze narrowed. Her voice cut like a blade."Remember your task.Fail me,and you know the price."



Elora shivered. The joy drained from her face,replaced with fear.



She couldn't go back to that man.



She would end up dying at his hand.


Ady had dragged her out of that nightmare, and she wasn't ready to lose the little peace she had found. Her voice wavered as she spoke quickly. "Ady, trust me. I won't disappoint you."


She paused, then explained carefully, "I'm taking it slow. Nolan and Eleanor are too close. If I rush, I might ruin everything."


The frost in Ady's expression softened, approval flickering in her eyes. "Good. Keep it that way."


The door shut, and the sleek black car disappeared into the night.


Elora stood frozen, gripping the check so tightly her palms broke into a cold sweat.


At the villa in Regal Heights, Elora had barely taken off her shoes when she bumped into Fannie,glowing with excitement after her tutoring session.



Fannie's cheeks were flushed. "Elora, were you out?"



Elora lifted a paper bag with a calm smile. "Nolan's been buried in work. I thought he could use something to relax, so I picked up lavender candles."


Then, as if casually, she added, "By the way, do you know what's keeping him busy? He hasn't been home much."



Fannie leaned closer, lowering her voice like she was  sharing a secret. "He's proposing to Eleanor in public today! I was just about to tell you. Come on, let's go see!"



A proposal?



Elora's stomach dropped.



Nolan and Eleanor were already close, but a public proposal would seal it. If that happened, Ady's plan would crumble.



Elora had to act quickly.


She masked her panic behind a gentle smile. "I'd love to,but I don't feel up to it. I'd hate to ruin Nolan's big moment. You go ahead, though. Take plenty of pictures for me-I want to share the excitement too."



Her words were flawless, warm enough to leave no suspicion.


Fannie beamed and dashed out the door.


Meanwhile, Eleanor had finished dinner with her mother, and the two strolled through the mall,chatting and laughing.


The mood was light, but unease tugged at Eleanor's heart.


What exactly tied Elora and Ady together? The evening sky deepened into shades of rose when Eleanor's phone rang sharply.



Her face softened at Lillian's name flashing across the screen.



The moment she answered, a dramatic wail spilled through.



"Eleanor, where are you? I'm miserable. Let's go out and go wild tonight!"



What was Lillian playing at now?


Eleanor couldn't help but sigh in amusement. Lillian hadn't changed a bit-still loud,still over the top.



But she was her best friend.


Eleanor glanced at her mother, silently asking.



Hilda smiled and patted her hand. "Go on. Have fun.I'll head home myself."


Relieved, Eleanor answered, "Alright, send me your location."



The pin came through instantly.



Enigma store?



Her brows lifted in surprise. What was Lillian doing there?



Then she understood.



Business had been booming there, and even the laid-back Lillian had been pitching in, often working late with Besty.



She was probably too tired to go elsewhere.



Eleanor brushed it off, kissed her mother goodbye,and flagged down a cab at the curb.



The cab slipped into traffic, carrying her toward the address.
###Chapter 300 Your Family's Bankrupt
The taxi pulled up infront of the Enigma flagship store.



Eleanor paid the fare and stepped out.



The shop stood in darkness, looking deserted.



Was Lillian pulling another prank?


With that thought, she pushed open the glass door.



"Lillian, are you here?" Her voice echoed as she groped for the switch on the wall.


Before her hand reached it, the room bloomed with light-not from overhead bulbs, but from candles flickering to life.



A long red carpet stretched from the entrance to the far end,lined with people in Enigma fan apparel.



Every one of them held a single red rose.



The first girl stepped forward and offered a flower."Wishing you happiness,Enigma."



Then another, and another. One by one, fans placed roses into Eleanor's arms,each with warm blessings.



Soon the bouquet in her arms grew heavy.



Memories of Nolan's proposal at the Hope House surfaced in her mind.



So this was why he had been so busy? Had he been planning another proposal?


The thought melted away her irritation over Elora.



At the end,Lillian stepped forward with the final rose,her grin wide and playful.


"Well? Surprised? Didn't expect this, did you?" She wiggled her brows proudly, secretly hoping for praise.



She had worked for days under Nolan's orders-even broke a nail-to make this happen.



Eleanor laughed at her friend's antics.


Clutching the bouquet, she instinctively looked down the carpet.



Lillian, understanding, stepped aside. The stage was ready for the main character.


Everyone's eyes turned toward the empty space,waiting for Nolan. A minute passed. Then another.



But no one appeared.



The end of the carpet stayed silent.



A restless murmur swept the crowd, turning sweetness into awkwardness.



Eleanor's smile faltered. She clutched the roses tighter.



What was going on?



Where was he?



Just then, Besty burst inside, heels clicking sharply.
"Mr. Stewart and his sister got a call and rushed out!"


The fans traded uneasy glances.



What could be more important than a proposal?



Poor Enigma.



Eleanor's gut told her Elora was involved. But in the end, it came down to Nolan not putting her first.



Was she hurt?



A little. Broken?



Not quite.


She realized she could no longer pin her hopes on love.



The night had unfolded like their relationship itself-surprise,romance, anticipation, then disappointment.



Seeing her face, Lillian rushed forward. "Eleanor, don't think too much. Maybe... Maybe Nolan really had an urgent matter!"



The fans chimed in quickly, "Yeah! Don't be upset,Enigma.He must have been delayed!"



"That's right-we trust Mr. Stewart!"



Eleanor forced a smile at their comfort.



She wasn't sad, just humiliated.



Abandoned in front of a crowd-how could she not feel embarrassed?



She was about to excuse herself when a mocking voice cut through the room. "Well,well...Mr. Stewart already bored of you? Looks like your charms aren't what they used to be." Eleanor turned to see Vickie at the door,arms crossed, smirking with glee.



She had come for the mall sales, planning to impress other society wives, but instead heard the gossip about Nolan leaving mid-proposal.


To her,Eleanor deserved the humiliation.



Eleanor ignored her, heading straight to Besty to dismiss the fans and have small gifts prepared for them.


But Lillian wouldn't let Vickie's words slide. She strode up,eyeing her from head to toe. "Mrs. Todd? Why are you wearing last season's clothes? Didn't you swear you'd never touch out-of-date fashion?"


She tlted her head,smiling wider. "Oh,right-I forgot.Your family's bankrupt. Who knows how long what's left will last? Next time I see you begging on the street, maybe I'll toss you a tip."


Vickie's face burned red. If not for Eleanor, they wouldn't have fallen so low.



Once proud, now she had to scavenge through sales racks.



She shot Eleanor a venomous glare but left in fury,though vengeance still brewed in her heart.



Lillian huffed in satisfaction, only to notice Eleanor already outside, raising her hand for a cab. Her chest  tightened, and she hurried after her. "Eleanor."


Eleanor turned back with a calm smile. "I'm fine. Don't worry.Go home,too."


A taxi pulled up, and she slipped inside.


Lillian stood on the curb, stomping in frustration.

Damn it-where had Nolan gone at such a moment?
###Chapter 301 Get Her Through This

Eleanor's instincts hadn't failed her-Elora was indeed involved.
She had tried to take her own life.
The moment Lilah called with the news, Nolan and Fannie had bolted out the door without a word.
Now they stood at the hospital.
Lilah hurried toward them, panic tightening her voice. "You're finally here. The doctor says Miss Guyton was looking bad. I didn't know what to do."
Elora might not bear the Stewart name, but she was practically Nolan's family, part of her responsibility. If anything happened under her watch, her job was finished.
Nolan's eyes turned cold as they fixed on the glowing "Emergency" sign.
Fannie clutched Lilah's hand, her face drained of color. "Lilah, how could Elora do this? She seemed fine when I left."
Lilah exhaled shakily, her words spilling in guilt.
"After you left, she looked a little off, but I didn't know what to say. I brushed it aside. When I finished in the kitchen, I realized she'd locked her door. I called, but she never answered. I panicked and grabbed the spare key."
After pausing for a moment, she continued, "I found her lying in a pool of blood, unconscious. I dialed 911right away. It's my fault. I should've paid closer attention."
Her voice trembled with self-blame.
Before Fannie could comfort her,the emergency doors swung open. The doctor stepped out, face grave. "The patient lost significant blood from deep wrist cuts. She's stable now,but unconscious.Mentally-"

He glanced down at the chart. "Her records show depression. As her family, you'll need to watch h closely. She should see a psychiatrist."

Nolan gave a curt nod in gratitude.

As soon as the doctor walked off, he pulled out his phone.

"Erick. Find the best psychiatrist in Elepdon. Now."

"Yes, sir," came the quick reply.

Within the hour, Elora was moved to a VIP ward.

Erick soon arrived with a psychiatrist-a refined man in his forties, gold-rimmed glasses perched on h nose.

He adjusted them nervously. "Mr. Stewart, I'm-"

"Skip it. Get to work." Nolan's icy tone cut him short.

The man-Conroy Morris-swallowed hard and went straight to Elora's bedside, reviewing her charts silence.


Minutes later, he looked up, his face heavy. "Mr. Stewart, her depression is severe. She shows strong sel destructive tendencies and high risk of another attempt. She'll need strict medication, steady emotion support, and eventually therapy."

Nolan's gaze softened as it lingered on Elora's pale face.

He felt the weight of his own neglect.

If he had given her even a fraction of attention all these years, maybe it wouldn't have come to this.

Hlis voice was steady when he spoke. "She's yours now, Dr. Morris. Get her through this."

The pressure in Nolan's words made Conroy's throat tighten. "I...I'll do my best."

With arrangements in place, Erick hesitated before asking, "Mr. Stewart... What about Miss Warren?"

Nolan didn't look away from Elora. "I'll stay here until she wakes. Go explain things to Eleanor. She'll understand."

Fannie nodded in agreement.

But when Erick reached the Enigma store, Eleanor was nowhere tobe found.

With no other choice, he sent her a message, explaining the situation.

Even so, unease gnawed at him.

A text for something this big? Somehow, it didn't feel enough.
###Chapter 302 Take This News Down


When Eleanor received Erick's message, she was already standing at the door of the Benton family's villa.

She glanced at her phone briefly, her face unreadable, then slipped it back into her bag and stepped inside.

The living room glowed with warm light. Hilda and Jeff sat together on the sofa, clearly waiting for her.

"Dad, Mom, why aren't you resting yet?" Eleanor asked in mild surprise.

Hilda rose at once, taking Eleanor's bag with gentle hands and hanging it aside. "We couldn't sleep until you came home. How was your day? Did you enjoy yourself?"

Nolan had planned everything so carefully that even Hilda had no idea about the proposal.

She only thought Eleanor had been out with Lillian.

Not wanting to worry them, Eleanor forced a small smnile. "Yes, it was nice. I'm just tired. I'd like to rest upstairs."

The moment Jeff heard the word "tired," he sprang to his feet.

"Someone help Eleanor to her room." He ordered the servants quickly.

Eleanor, too drained to argue, simply nodded and went upstairs on her own.

The instant she was gone, Hilda's smile slipped away. Concern filled her face.

She was Eleanor's mother-how could she not tell her daughter was upset?

What had happened?

Who had hurt her?

Hilda sat lost in thought, but Jeff missed the signs completely. With a yawn, he slung an arm around her shoulder. "Honey, Eleanor's gone to bed. Let's go rest too." Hilda shoved him off, her eyes flashing. "Do you not care about our daughter at all?"

Jeff straightened instantly, wide awake. "That's not fair! Of course I care. But she looked fine to me.You're overthinking."

Hilda glared at him, too angry to reply.

She was about to message Denny to investigate when her phone buzzed with a new message from him.

It was a news link.

Confused, she tapped it open.

The headline made her blood run cold.

"Breaking News! Stewart Group CEO Nolan Abandons Fiancée Mid-Proposal! Eleanor Humiliated!"

Hilda's hands trembled as she scrolled.

A photo filled the screen.

Eleanor stood alone among roses and candlelight, her expression dazed and wounded-like a child suddenly left behind.

The sight cut into Hilda's heart like a blade.

So this was why Eleanor was upset.

Nolan,that brat!

Didn't he swear he would cherish her, protect her for life?

And this-this was what he did? Hilda's fury burned.

Jeff, standing beside her, saw the headline too. His face darkened in rage.

Without hesitation, he grabbed his phone and barked into it. "Denny! Take this news down. Not another second online!" No one was allowed to mock Eleanor-his brilliant, graceful daughter-as someone abandoned.

If anything, it was Nolan who should be seen as the one left behind.

"Understood," Denny replied immediately.

The next morning, Hilda rose early to prepare an elaborate breakfast with all of Eleanor's favorite dishes.

She and Jeff kept sneaking worried glances at their daughter, piling her plate with food.

"Eat more of this, sweetheart," Hilda urged softly.

"And this too," Jeff added, dropping another dish onto her plate.

Eleanor looked at the overflowing mound, then at their overly eager faces.

She understood at once-they had found out.

She herself had seen the news last night. But before long, every trace of it vanished online.

She knew Jeff must have stepped in.

Setting her utensils down, she met their anxious eyes and spoke first. "Nolan got a call during the proposal.His friend attempted suicide."

She deliberately left out Elora's namne, not wanting them to worry further.

But Jeff didn't care who it was.

All that mattered to him was that his daughter had been wronged.

Hilda quickly nudged him.under the table to stop his temper, then reached across to clasp Eleanor's cool hand.

Her voice was steady but warm."We don't know what's been happening between you and Nolan. But listen to me-no matter what, your father and I will always stand behind you. As long as we're here, no one will hurt you."

Eleanor's nose stung at her mother's words. Tears welled in her eyes. Family,love,care-things she never dared dream of in the last twenty years were now hers for real.

She squeezed Hilda's hand, her voice choked but steady. "Mom,I understand."

After breakfast, she returned to her room.

For a long time, she stared at her phone. Finally, she opened her chat with Nolan, fingers hovering over the keyboard. At last, she typed, "Are you done yet?"

The message sent.

Seconds turned into minutes. Minutes dragged into an hour. The chat remained silent.

Her message went unanswered.
###Chapter 303 Are You Worthy Of Me


Nolan genuinely hadn't noticed Eleanor's message because his phone had completely died.

This was ICU, and the nurse had insisted that no electronic devices be plugged in.

Only when a doctor entered to check on Elora could he head toward the nurse's station to recharge his phone.

The moment he powered it on, Eleanor's message appeared, timestamped two hours prior.

Would Eleanor feel upset?

Anxiously, Nolan tapped out a response. "Baby, I'm sorry-my phone died earlier. Since Elora hasn't woken yet, I can't go anywhere. When she's better, l'll set things right with you."

A strange unease lingered for a moment, though he convinced himself he might be imagining it.

In reality, Nolan's instinct had been correct.

After reading his text, Eleanor deleted it immediately.

She wasn't blaming him; nor was anger present.

Rather, she felt the need to reconsider their relationship.

Eleanor slipped her phone into her bag and walked outside.

Whenever confusion struck, she sought solace at the Hope House.

This situation proved no different.

Yet just as she left the Benton family's villa, an ordinary sedan stopped abruptly in her path.

The window rolled down slowly, revealing a face she despised. It was Jonny.

Eleanor frowned, pivoting to continue.

Jonny, however, refused to retreat. He stepped out swiftly, clutching an ostentatious bouquet of red roses.

"Eleanor!" He blocked her route, wearing a smile he presumed charming and affectionate. "Where are you headed? Let me drive you!"

Her eyes chilled with disdain as she replied, "No need."

Ignoring her rejection, Jonny advanced. "I heard you ended things with Nolan. If you allow it, I'll always wait for you."

Though the trending post disappeared quickly, Jonny had seen it.

To him, it signaled a rare chance.

That explained why he had rushed to linger outside the Benton family's villa.

Eleanor finally lifted her gaze, scanning him with icy contempt as if confronting something revolting. "Are you worthy of me?" she spat.

Seeing her frigid stare, Jonny recalled past missteps and swallowed the words he almost uttered.

A mocking smirk played across Eleanor's lips as she strode away.

Jonny went back to his home.

Hardly had he opened the door when Vickie's sharp voice erupted from inside."What did you say? The trending poost I purchased got removed? Who did it?"

Without hesitation, Jonny shut the door with a loud thud.

Vickie jumped, almost dropping her phone.

She hurriedly ended the call, forcing a tight smile. "Jonny, welcome back. What would you like to eat? I can prepare it now!" Jonny's gaze bore into her, closing the distance with every word. "What did you do?"

Fear gripped Vickie, and she stumbled back, too terrified to respond.

Jonny's patience snapped completely, and he barked, "Speak!"

Her body quivered violently under hiscommand.

Finally, Vickie admitted she had hired trolls to circulate rumors online, claiming Eleanor was abandoned by Nolan.

The posts had barely spread before disappearing without a trace.

Fury consumed Jonny, shaking him as his chest heaved. "Mom, what have you been doing throughout the day?"

Eleanor now held the Benton family's affection as their prized daughter.

How could his mother dare target her now?

Was she deliberately trying to destroy them faster? Jonny couldn't comprehend it.

Vickie, realizing her plot was uncovered, felt partly justified. "I... I did it for you! That woman caused so much trouble. I only wanted to vent and get revenge!"

In her mind, she had committed no wrongdoing.

Eleanor had disrupted Jonny's promising path, not the other way around.

Jonny nearly lost his mind at her foolishness.

He sneered, "Vent and get revenge? For what? Do you even understand that neither the Benton family,nor the Stewarts, nor Eleanor herself, are people we can afford to antagonize? And buying that post must have cost a fortune! Are you aware of our family's situation now?"

It seemed impossible that they had struggled for so long, yet she behaved as though nothing had changed.

Vickie couldn't tolerate the shame after her son shouted at her. She collapsed onto the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, "Why are you yelling at me? Do you still care about that woman? Even if I die, I won't let you near her again! That woman is trouble!"

Jonny observed her tantrum with rising disappointment.

Continuing the argument seemed pointless; every syllable felt wasted.

Therefore, he opened the door and slammed it shut before walking away.

While he was alone in the empty corridor, Eleanor's frosty expression resurfaced in Jonny's mind, along with her dismissive words. "Are you worthy of me?"

Truly, he wasn't. From the moment he trusted Lainey and misjudged Eleanor three years ago, he had forfeited that right.

Realization hit him-he would never regain her favor.
###Chapter 304 Thank Goodness You're Awake!


Eleanor found herself standing outside the Hope House gates.

Something held her back from entering, rooting her feet to the spot despite the familiar pull of home.

Golden autumn sunlight bathed her as she sank down onto the front steps, wrapped in contemplative silence.


This orphanage had been her entire world growing up, the only real home she had ever known.

Yet here she was, feeling like some lost soul too afraid to step through the doors of her one true sanctuary.

Myah stepped outside carrying a trash bag and immediately spotted Eleanor's unmistakable figure.

Her heart clenched with concern.

"Eleanor? What are you doing out here all by yourself?"

Startled from her reverie, Eleanor quickly got to her feet and forced a brittle smile."Oh,,Myah. I was just passing through the neighborhood and decided to stop by."

She couldn't bear the thought of making Myah worry about her. "I should probably get going now."

Myah grasped her hand with gentle firmness. "You haven't had lunch yet, have you? Come inside. There's your favorite braised beef in the kitchen."

Before Eleanor could protest further, Myah guided her through the familiar doors.

Cheerful chatter filled the dining hall as always.

A steaming plate of rich, aromatic braised beef appeared before Eleanor.

She merely pushed the food around with her fork, showing no real interest in eating.

The usual brightness in her eyes had faded to something hollow and distant. Myah watched her carefully before setting down her own utensils with a quiet sigh. "Eleanor, tell me what's really troubling you."

Eleanor's composure finally cracked, and before she could stop herself, everything came spilling out. The recent events tumbled from her lips, each word carrying a pain she hadn't fully acknowledged until this moment.

Myah listened patiently, then offered a gentle smile as she placed another piece of braised beef onto Eleanor's plate.

"Nolan isn't just your boyfriend, sweetheart. He's treated Elora like family. When she faces something this serious, of course he needs to be there for her. Try to see it through his eyes, Eleanor. If someone you considered family was inreal danger, wouldn't you move heaven and earth to help them? Sometimes we need to step back and understand things from their perspective."

Eleanor's fork froze halfway to her mouth.

Had she gotten this completely wrong?

Yet shouldn't love be pure and uncomplicated, free from all these tangled complications?

If Elora meant more to him than her, she would end things with Nolan.

Myah,who could read Eleanor's thoughts as easily as an open book, recognized the dangerous spiral beginning.

Before Eleanor could voice any objections, Myah pressed a warm food container into her hands. "Bring this to Nolan. He's practically living at that hospital and likely hasn't had a proper meal in days."

Text messages could carry words, but never the true emotions behind them.

Only face-to-face could Eleanor really understand what was in Nolan's heart.

Getting trapped in her own overthinking was something she did far too easily

After a moment of quiet consideration, Eleanor accepted the container and hailed a taxi to the hospital. She obtained Elora's room number from the front desk and navigated to the private wing without difficulty.

Just as Eleanor lifted her hand to knock, she glimpsed the scene unfolding through the glass door and went completely still.

Elora,finally conscious,leaned weakly against her pillows looking fragile but alert.

Nolan occupied the chair beside her bed, his entire face radiating pure relief.

Fannie practically bounced with excitement. "Elora, thank goodness you're awake! Nolan and I have been worried sick. Neither of us could manage to eat or sleep properly."

A shadow of remorse crossed Elora's delicate features as she looked at Nolan with hesitant eyes. "Nolan,have I become nothing but a burden to you?"

Nolan's hand moved to rest gently on her head with obvious affection. "Don't overthink."

The warmth in his gaze felt completely authentic.

Fannie smoothly unpacked a meal container, arranging various dishes with practiced care. "Elora, you must be absolutely famished. I asked Lilah to prepare something gentle for your stomach. Please, eat up."

Elora,clearly starved, reached for her utensils but suddenly noticed Eleanor's rigid silhouette framed in the doorway.

Showing no visible reaction whatsoever, Elora simply looked away, a subtle smile playing at the corners of her mouth before she turned back to Nolan with apparent concern. "Nolan, what about Eleanor?"

Nolan's fingers moved through her hair with brotherly affection. "I've already sorted everything out with her.She understands the situation perfectly, so there's nothing for you to stress about."

Relief washed over Fannie's face at those words. "That's good."

Inside the hospital room, the three of them created such a picture of familial warmth with their easy conversation and shared laughter.

Eleanor felt like an intruder witnessing something she had no right to see, a misplaced piece that simply Eleanor felt like an intruder witnessing something she had no right to see, a misplaced piece that simply didn't fit their perfect puzzle. Silently, she backed away and disappeared down the corridor.
###Chapter 305 | Really Don't Mind Being Alone


When Eleanor arrived home, Hilda and Jeff had already returned home from work.

As she saw her daughter's deeply troubled expression, Hilda's maternal instincts kicked in immediately."Sweetheart, what's happened? Has Nolan done something to upset you?"

Eleanor slowly raised her eyes to meet her mother's worried gaze and gave a composed shake of her head."Nothing like that. Just some work stress."

Hilda clearly wasn't convinced, but she knew better than to push when Eleanor put up walls.

The moment Eleanor disappeared upstairs, Hilda whirled around to face Jeff with obvious concern."What are we supposed to do about this?" she asked.

When it came to her daughter's romantic troubles, she felt completely out of her depth.

Jeff let out a dismissive grunt. "Simple. We'Il line Eleanor up with someone better. They're not even officially engaged yet, so there's plenty of opportunity to change course."

Hilda shot him an exasperated look. "Maybe you should focus on getting those sons of ours settled first."

"We've paraded dozens of suitable girls in front of them, and none of them have shown the slightest interest." Jeff's expression darkened at the mention of their sons.

Every single one of them excelled professionally, yet their personal lives remained disaster zones.

Fraser, who shared Jeff's ambition and business acumen most closely, still hadn't brought home a single girlfriend.

This wouldn't do.

He would organize another series of carefully arranged introductions.

He absolutely refused to accept defeat in finding appropriate daughters-in-law. Right now, though, Eleanor remained the more urgent concern.

He would need to reach out to his network of contacts and start identifying promising candidates.

His daughter was an exceptional young woman. Nolan would definitely come to regret losing someone like her.

Completely oblivious to her parents' matchmaking schemes, Eleanor shut herself away in her bedroom.

Desperately trying to concentrate, she threw herself into her work projects.

Yet her thoughts kept drifting back to that heartwarming scene she had witnessed at the hospital.

Nolan, Elora, and Fannie had looked so natural together, like they belonged in each other's lives.

Where did that leave her? Absolutely nowhere in their perfect picture.

Her phone suddenly buzzed with a message from Nolan.

She stared at it for what felt like forever before her trembling fingers finally tapped the message open.

"Elora wants to go camping once she's released from the hospital. We had to cancel last time.Would you like to come with us?"

"Us"?

Exactly who was Nolan including in that"∪S"?

Eleanor found herself staring at the glowing screen, her fingers frozen above the keyboard.

Finally, she managed to type out a response. "I already have commitments that weekend and won't be able to join. You all should go and have fun."

The moment she hit send, Eleanor flung her phone onto the bed and forced herself back into her work.

Perhaps the fracture in their relationship had begun the instant Nolan abandoned her to race toward the hospital.

Back at the hospital, Nolan read her message with a slight frown creasing his features. She couldn't come? Was she still holding onto resentment about the proposal that never happened?

That didn't seem right, though. Petty grudges weren't her style at all.

He had laid everything out clearly for her, and he had complete faith that she would see reason.

Could she simply be drowning in work commitments?

While he wrestled with these thoughts, a soft, hesitant voice interrupted from nearby.

"Nolan, what's wrong?"

Nolan slipped his phone back into his pocket, his composed mask sliding effortlessly back into place."Eleanor won't be able to join us. Looks like it'Il just be the three of us going."

Elora's teeth caught her lower lip as she put on a show of genuine disappointment.

"This is my fault, isn't it? Have I somehow created problems between you two? Maybe I should just stay home by myself.I really don't mind being alone."

Giver her current condition, Nolan absolutely refused to abandon her like that.

"Don't overthink it. Eleanor's likely just buried under deadlines. We'll plan something for all of us another time."

Fannie quickly chimed in with enthusiastic support. "Exactly right, Elora! Eleanor runs Enigma Group. She's constantly juggling a million different projects. Don't worry yourself sick over this. Just concentrate on recovering your strength."

Their combined reassurances seemed to ease Elora's apparent anxiety. "That's good then," she responded.

Nolan studied Elora's relieved expression, yet something nagging continued to twist in his gut.

Something important was slipping through his fingers, but he couldn't identify what.

He told himself it was probably just exhaustion from these last few overwhelming days.
###Chapter 306 I'm Going After Fraser


A few days later, Eleanor saw a Facebook post from Fannie and liked it.

It was a cheerful camping photo of Nolan, Elora, and Fannie grinning from ear to ear. Nolan and Elora sat close together, while Fannie posed in the background, flashing a peace sign.

Eleanor set her phone aside. She stepped into the backyard to breathe in some air, but the moment was broken by/a call from Lillian.

"Eleanor!" Lillian's voice rang with desperate energy. "We're stuck in a rut. Tonight, we're getting wasted.Are you in?"

Eleanor hesitated, but didn't say no. Soon, she found herself in a cab, heading for the bar.

Inside, neon lights pulsed across a crowded floor, music thumping in her chest.

Lillian had arranged for ten male escorts, each impossibly tall and handsome.

The moment Lillian spotted Eleanor, she stumbled over, nearly tipping over. "Eleanor! Finally! I've been waiting forever!"

The mix of alcohol and perfume made Eleanor wrinkle her nose.

Lillian clung to her and suddenly burst into exaggerated sobs. "Fraser! That jerk went on another date! What am I supposed to do?"

Eleanor sighed inwardly.

Lillian could have any man she wanted, yet she was obsessed with Eleanor's distant, infuriating brother.

Guiding Lillian to a seat, Eleanor poured herself a drink. She clinked her glass with Lillian's and downed it in one go.

The sharp liquor burned her throat and dulled her thoughts for a moment. Seeing her boldness, Lillian wiped her eyes and threw back another drink. "I'm going after Fraser. No one's stopping me!" Her words slurred, her balance wobbly.
As she watched Lillian unravel, Eleanor's mind drifted to Nolan.
Love, she realized, was never as simple asit seemed.
They had once been free, untethered, and now they were trapped by it.
Not sure what else to do, Eleanor poured herself another drink and sat back with Lillian.
Lillian, fully drunk now, flailed at the air, muttering, "Fraser....my Fraser... don't leave me!"
Then she slumped back, sobbing. "If you don't want me, fine! You'll regret it when I'm with someone else!"Her eyes landed on Eleanor, and a mischievous grin spread across her face. "Babe, dump Nolan! I'll set you up with a guy who actually has an eight-pack!"
Before Eleanor could respond, Lillian dragged one of the escorts over and shoved him toward her."Take care of my best friend!"
The escort plopped beside Eleanor, flashing a charming smile as he raised his glass. "Drinking alone is boring.Mind if I join?"
Eleanor said nothing, her expression unreadable as she stared at her glass.
Unnoticed, a few men had recorded a video of Lillian before taking a photo of Eleanor.
"Wait, isn't that Nolan's girlfriend? Enigma?"
"Who's that guy with her? They look close."
"Definitely an escort, wow. If Nolan sees this, that guy's finished. He has the nerve to flirt with Nolan's girl."Excited by the potential drama, the man posted the photo and the video in their Elepdon social circle chat and wandered off, oblivious to the storm he had just stirred.
###Chapter 307 Enjoy Yourself


At the campsite on the city's edge, Nolan sat watching Fannie and Elora frolicking on the grass. Though a faint smile curved his lips, his mind wandered, pulled elsewhere by an uneasy thought gnawing at him.

He slipped out his phone, intending to message Eleanor, wanting to know her location and what kept her busy.

Before his fingers moved, a sharp ping rang out-a notification from the Elepdon social circle group.

That chat existed for emergencies only, rarely checked, with Nolan's strict warning that no one disturb him without urgent cause.

Who dared to tag him now?

A frown creased his face as he tapped into the group.

One glance at the feed made his veins burn.

The first image was of Eleanor.

She sat in a booth bathed in neon light, flanked by several stylish men, with Lillian slouched drunkenly beside her.

Following that came a brief clip.

Lillian, words slurred and heavy, rambled about finding Eleanor a man with an eight-pack, while Eleanor failed to resist an escort leaning in close.

Nolan could not bear to watch longer.

He had assumed Eleanor missed the trip because something important held her back.

Yet this was the truth? Drinking with Lillian?

HHis hand stabbed at the screen as he sent a terse message in the group chat. "Where are you?"

Those three words carried the weight of a brewing storm.

Silence swallowed the group. Members cursed themselves for tagging Nolan.

But he had already seen everything.

Moments later, a nervous reply appeared. "Paradise Bar."

Slipping the phone into his pocket, Nolan snatched his car keys and strode toward the parking lot, rage radiating like ice.

From a distance, Fannie and Elora heard the car roar alive and realized Nolan had gone.

They exchanged confused looks.

What urgent matter pulled him away?

...

Inside Paradise Bar,Eleanor remained oblivious to the turmoil forming.

Alcohol dulled her senses, wrapping her thoughts in fog.

Lillian lay sprawled across the booth, fists banging the table while muttering about Fraser being a creep.

Eleanor shook her head, trying to clear it, then checked her watch.

It was already past ten.

Her phone screen showed several missed calls from Hilda.

She quickly texted. "Mom, I'm with Lillian. Everything's fine."

Tucking the phone into her bag, she bent toward the staggering Lillian, preparing to head home.

A nearby escort seized the moment. "Both of you look wasted. It's late. Let us walk you back. Nights like this aren't safe." Fogged by alcohol, Eleanor gave a faint nod, too hazy to think clearly.

Thrilled, the escort slipped one arm around Eleanor, the other around Lillian, and started for the exit with a smug grin.

Before they reached the door, a fierce kick dropped him flat.

He never even saw who struck before darkness took him.

The shock jolted Eleanor's senses.

She lifted her gaze in disbelief, meeting a pair of blazing eyes.

Nolan?

Why was he here?

Wasn't he supposed to be with Elora right now?

While the thought flashed across her mind, Nolan, fury radiating from him, advanced steadily.

The other escorts sensed danger and fled, dragging their unconscious friend along.

Suddenly,the chaotic booth grew still.

Eleanor steadied her throbbing head and forced a faint smile. "Enjoy yourself. It's late. I'm taking Lillian home."

She reached toward Lillian.

But before her hand touched, Nolan caught it and yanked her close, grip unyielding.
###Chapter 308 Could It Have Been Someone Else


Before she could even gather her thoughts, Eleanor was hoisted over Nolan's broad shoulder.

A sharp gasp escaped her lips as she thrashed, fists hammering against his back. "Nolan! Are you insane?Put me down! What about Lillian? What if she's left alone?"

He didn't respond, his long strides carrying her out of the bar. He paused only long enough to send a quick text to Ryland.

Lillian stirred, blinking groggily.

When she saw Nolan lug Eleanor away, her face lit up. "He actually forcibly took her! Oh my God, I love it!"

She grabbed a pillow, flopped back, and immediately passed out again.

Nolan carried Eleanor to his car, setting her into the passenger seat with ease. Before starting the engine, he spoke coolly. "I've already informed Ryland. You should be worrying about yourself, not your friend."

The engine roared to life, and the car raced toward Regal Heights.

Once they were inside, the master bedroom door swung open on a sharp kick.

Nolan didn't give Eleanor a moment to react before pressing her onto the bed.

What followed was a storm of kisses-fierce, relentless, and all-consuming.

Eleanor felt herself suffocating under his intensity.

How.could she remain so distant with him yet laugh and flirt with other men at a bar?

He had waited for her and explained himself, and still she hadn't believed him.

Instead, she had chosen to trust Lillian's drunken chatter.

The idea that she could be acting like this in front of another man sparked a jealousy in Nolan that he couldn't contain.

"You're impossible," he murmured, his hand brushing her skin, breath hot against her ear. "How am 1supposed to handle you,huh?"

Eleanor, flustered from being carried and cornered like this, bristled.

Impossible? She hadn't done anything to provoke this.

If anyone had been at fault, it was Nolan, for ignoring her while keeping another woman company.

Yet now he acted as if she were the guilty one.

Anger flared within her. She twisted her headto dodge his lips.

Nolan's eyes darkened. He cupped her chin, tilting her head back, and kissed her again, harder this time,as if to claim her completely.

Eleanor felt overwhelmed, almost breathless under his intensity.

Just as she began to lose herself, a sudden shiver pulled her back to reality.

Summoning a strength she didn't know she had, she pushed him away, quickly got dressed, and stepped off the bed.

Standing over him, she glared at Nolan, whose eyes still burned with desire.

"What do you think I am?" she asked, her voice shaking faintly.

Nolan noticed the small quiver and quickly stood up, wrapping her in his arms.

His chin rested lightly on her shoulder, his warm breath brushing her neck. "I... I just lost it," he muttered."Seeing him near you... it got to me."

Eleanor gently wrenched herself free, her eyes calm but firm.

"I was simply having a drink with him,"she said evenly. "And you couldn't handle it? Do you even realize how painful it's been watching you and Elora act like some perfect little couple all these past few days?" There was nothing going on between Elora and him, yet he couldn't deny he had been distant with Eleanor.
"I'm sorry," he said, earnest and earnestly. "I won't let anyone come between us again. If Elora bothers you,I'll make sure she stays away.Always."
Eleanor hesitated, her thoughts darkening.

Elora wasn't just a name. She was a problem.

Memories of how Nolan used to treat her clawed at her patience.

"I saw her at the mall a few days ago. She was helping Ady pick out shoes. You know exactly what that means."
Elora's fragile recovery had kept her homebound. It was impossible that she wandered the mall,accompanied by Ady. Even the butler hadn't said a word about any trips.
After pausing to think, Nolan spoke cautiously. "Are you sure it was her? Could it have been someone else?"Eleanor's lips curled into a brief, bitter smile. She didn't speak further. "It's late. I should go," she said,already reaching for her coat.
Nolan rushed after her, feeling as if her leaving was also taking her heart away.
But before he could take another step, his phone buzzed urgently. Hector's voice came through, sharp and anxious.
"Sir! There's trouble! Your father just arrived with a lawyer and several family members. He's demanding your grandfather divide the assets immediately. The security you arranged has been completely neutralized."

Without a second thought, Nolan bolted, leaving the room.
###Chapter 309 Who Else Deserves Your Fortune


A cool breeze brushed Eleanor as she wandered along the quiet avenue.

Earlier, her words had struck too sharply.

Elora had been cautious, so it made sense Nolan hadn't believed her.

Eleanor slowed her pace, waiting for him to catch up with her.

Yet even after a long stretch, the street behind remained deserted.

Nolan had chosen not to follow.

A faint, ironic smile curved Eleanor's lips.

Perhaps that was simply male nature: once desire was satisfied, attention faded.

He had once loved her fiercely, Eleanor could sense it in every shared glance and touch.

Now,that devotion seemed to erode gradually, piece by piece.

It didn't matter.

She was no longer that woman, who would throw away her pride to try to win a man over.

Emotions could now flow freely without restraint.

Since Nolan no longer wished to embrace her heart, she would release him completely.

···

Meanwhile, Nolan gripped the steering wheel, a sudden ache tightening his chest as if a crucial part of him had vanished.

Assuming it involved his grandfather, he pressed the accelerator hard and called Erick, instructing him to send reinforcements to the Stewart family's estate immediately.

Racing through the city, he reached the aged villa within minutes.

Before Nolan stepped inside, Colson's smug tone carried through the air.

"Dad, you're aging. I'm your true heir. Who else deserves your fortune? Just sign the papers. Nolan's occupied elsewhere. No reason to wait for him."

Arrogance radiated from his words, coupled with an unshakable belief.

Ady had orchestrated the chaos perfectly, creating enough friction to distract Nolan and strain his bond with Eleanor.

Tonight belonged to him, a rare opportunity to seize control.

Colson's confidence evaporated quickly. Nolan's mocking tone sliced through the room from the doorway.

"Oh,really?"

Nolan stepped forward, his presence sharp and commanding.

Erick flanked him, a line of impassive bodyguards following in precise formation, all dressed in black suits.

Colson froze.

Wasn't he supposed to be away camping?

Before any reaction formed, Erick motioned calmly.

The guards immediately moved to encircle the living room.

Those bold moments ago-the members of the Stewart family and lawyer-now appeared frozen, dread etched across every face.

One old man, braver than his peers, wavered slightly, forcing a smile uglier than a grimace. "Nolan, we...we were just-"

His words stumbled as he searched for a justification that never arrived. Nolan's gaze passed the flustered man, landing on his grandfather, Norwood, who sat trembling with restrained fury.

A reassuring glance met Norwood s eyes before Nolan drifted to the sofa, sitting with effortless composure,legs crossed elegantly. Cold eyes swept the room.

"You should remember I am head of this family. Inheritance matters are serious, yet you didn't inform me?Who allowed such overreach?"

The old man nearly crumpled under the weight of those words.

Sweat trickled down his temple as he mumbled, "It's a misunderstanding, Nolan! We heard Norwood was unwell and merely came to check on him."

Others nodded eagerly, seizing the chance to flee, practically tripping over themselves.

After all, opposing Nolan directly for Colson's promised gain was far too dangerous.

Colson had assured them he would be absent tonight, which justified their presence.

Now an excuse appeared-when else could they escape if not immediately?

Panic flashed across Colson's face as he looked toward Ady for direction.

She gestured sharply to retreat.

"Uh, Dad, you and Nolan should rest," Colson said awkwardly. "I'll visit later."

He grabbed Ady and bolted, terrified Nolan's men would intercept.

Seeing them depart, Erick and the guards withdrew methodically.

Only grandfather and grandson remained in the silent room.

Norwood sank into.his chair, relief mingling with despair.

How had he fathered such an ungrateful boy in this lifetime?

Thankfully, Nolan stood by him, molded and raised through his guidance. Without the grandson, pride in his lineage would have vanished entirely.

Taking a deep breath, Norwood focused on Nolan."You-"

Darkness swept over him before words could finish, and he collapsed.

Nolan reacted instantly. He caught him in a rush and yelled toward the doorway. "Hector, call 911!"

Hector, stationed just outside, charged in. The moment he saw the scene, his face paled with shock.

Without hesitation, he fumbled for his phone, fingers trembling.
###Chapter 310 Send Her Away Within Forty-eight Hours


At the hospital, following a thorough examination, the doctor delivered reassuring news. Norwood's collapse was simply stress-induced exhaustion. Rest would restore him completely.

Relief washed over Nolan.

Fannie arrived the following day, breathless and apologetic.

Rushing to the bedside, she clasped her grandfather's hand, tears glistening in her eyes. "Grandpa, forgive me for being so late. Yesterday evening, Elora andI were camping in the suburbs. My phone battery died,so I had no idea you'd been hospitalized."

Elora?

Confusion clouded Norwood's features.

Assuming her grandfather's memory might be foggy, Fannie began explaining. "Grandpa, surely you remember? Elora Guyton is living with Nolan now. Poor thing has endured so much tragedy. First her father died, then she escaped an abusive relationship while fighting severe depression. You can't imagine how close we came to losing her just days ago."

Recognition finally dawned on Norwood.

Years had passed since he had last seen Elora, when she was merely a child playing alongside Nolan.

Eventually, her worthless father had dragged her away.

Now she was residing at the Regal Heights villa?

What possessed Nolan to make such a decision?

Housing a servant's daughter who shared no family blood. Surely Eleanor would be furious about this arrangement? Nolan appeared in the doorway moments later.

Without acknowledging his grandson's entrance, Norwood spoke bluntly. "You've taken Elora Guyton in?Send her away within forty-eight hours. Should childhood sentiment cloud your judgment, provide her money and sever all ties."

Nolan suspected his grandfather viewed Elora as another opportunist seeking to exploit the Stewart name.Patiently, he offered his defense. "Grandpa, Elora possesses genuine integrity. She harbors no hidden agenda. Shortly, I'll bring her to visit you. Once you spend time with her, you'll recognize her true character.Remember your initial reservations about Eleanor? Yet see how wonderfully that relationship has flourished."

Disbelief flickered across Norwood's weathered face. His grandson's reasoning bordered on absurd.

Business dealings revealed Nolan's razor-sharp intellect, yet personal relationships left him utterly blind.

Besides, Elora held no family connection whatsoever. How could Eleanor possibly accept such an arrangement?

Last night, he had questioned Eleanor's absence during the hospital visit.

Now everything made perfect sense.

Anger flashed in his eyes. "Age has weakened my authority over you. Mark my words though. Don't expect sympathy when Eleanor walks away for good."

Fannie lingered nearby, catching fragments of their heated exchange.

Her gaze shifted between her brother and grandfather before she ventured carefully. "Nolan, you've been neglecting Eleanor recently. Everyone knows couples require private moments together. Constantly socializing with Elora and me will surely irritate Eleanor."

Norwood dismissed the conversation with an impatient gesture. "I've spoken my mind. Leave now, I require rest. The Benton family treasure their daughter dearly. I doubt they still permit this marriage after your behavior."

Rolling away from them, Norwood closed his eyes firmly. Nolan departed the room, his mind churning with unease.

Eleanor's recent coldness suddenly gained new meaning.

Instructing Fannie to remain with their grandfather, Nolan rushed toward the exit.
###Chapter 311 Grandpa's In The Hospital


Before heading to the Benton family's residence, Nolan made sure the car was loaded with gifts.

As he rolled into the driveway, he spotted Jeff jogging back from his morning run. The man slowed, scowl already in place.

"Well, well, look who it is," Jeff drawled, voice thick with sarcasm. "Mr. Stewart graces us with his presence.Shame I didn't prepare a red carpet."

Nolan didn't flinch. He stepped out carefully, carrying the gifts, his voice even and polite."Mr.Benton,I've come to see Eleanor. Is she home?"

The words made Jeff's anger spike. This was the man who had left his daughter miserable for days, and now he had the nerve to show up and ask for her?

"Oh,you still remember my daughter?" Jeff sneered. "I thought you were far too occupied with your close _"



Before the jab could land, Hilda appeared at the doorway.

She shot her husband a sharp glance, and his words died in his throat.

Hilda turned to Nolan, her tone calm, almost regal. "Go ahead upstairs. Eleanor's in her room."

She knew her daughter's heart better than anyone else.

Sometimes, the best way to support her was to step back and let her navigate her own life.

Nolan nodded in gratitude, set the gifts aside, and hurried up the staircase.

Inside, Eleanor was hunched over her sketchpad, absorbed in her designs. The moment she saw him, her hand froze mid-stroke.

"Wha are you doing here?" she asked. The second those words left her mouth, he pulled her into a warm hug, burying his face in thecrook of her neck.His voice was rough. "Baby, I'm sorry. I haven't been there for you."

Eleanor stiffened for a fraction of a second, then gently pulled back, creating the space she needed. "I'm not angry" she replied softly. "I've just been swamped. There's a shipment of artifacts arriving soon. Dyer and I are buried in research and auction preparations."

Nolan caught the indifferent look in her eyes and felt that familiar sting of helplessness. "How about I attend the auction with you?" he asked.

Eleanor looked at him, her eyes calm and distant. "Elora isn't doing well. You should be there with her more."

She was tired of hope constantly turning into disappointment.

For him,showing up or not might have been just a matter of words, but for her, it was a repeated letdown.

His presence, or absence, no longer shifted her world as it once had.

When he heard her words, panic prickled in Nolan's chest.

He gripped her hand, a little tighter than necessary. "Baby, I promise. This time, I'll be there. I won't let you down."

She offered only a soft hum in acknowledgment and withdrew her hand with calm deliberation.

Nolan stared at his empty hand, the creeping fear of losing her grasped him like a vise.

He floundered for an excuse, a lifeline. "How about lunch? I'll take you to your favorite restaurant."

She shook her head, replying, "I can't. I have to meet Dyer this afternoon."

The finality in her voice left no room for argument.

Nolan's shoulders tensed. He knew her stubborn streak all too well.

Pushing would only deepen her annoyance.

With a sigh, he made his way toward the door, casting glances back at her every few steps. Just as he reached the doorway, a thought struck him. He stopped abruptly."Oh,, Eleanor, Grandpa's in the hospital. He's been asking about you."

With that, he left, carrying a mix of regret and restraint.

Eleanor's hand, holding the pen, paused slightly.

Norwood's health was delicate, and he couldn't take much more strain.

She needed to visit him.
###Chapter 312 | Think I Just Saw Eleanor


The next morning, Eleanor carried her needles and headed to the hospital alone.

Norwood's face lit up immediately he saw her. "Eleanor, what are you doing here?"

Eleanor set the gift bag she had brought on the table and studied him. "Norwood, what's going on with you?"

Norwood brushed aside talk of Colson's foolishness and shrugged. "Nothing serious. Just old age catching up with me."

Eleanor gave him a quiet look. "Let me check you."

Norwood was aware of her gift in medicine. She had eased his, pain before, so he chuckled and nodded."Alright, then. Do your thing."

Eleanor opened her kit without hesitation.

Her hands moved swiftly, placing the needles with steady precision.

Soon, warmth spread from each point, flowing through his body.

The tightness in his chest lifted, vanishing like smoke in the wind.

Norwood felt like a new man:

He recalled someone once mentioned that Eleanor might be the Soul Surgeon.

He hadn't believed it then.

But now, feeling the change in hisbody, he knew her skill was no ordinary thing.

He realized he had almost made a grave mistake-treating a rare treasure like it was nothing special.

He caught the shadow in Eleanor's eyes, his sharp instincts kicking in. "Don't let that fool Nolan get to you.
 If he's upset you, scold him or kick his ass. Don't hold back."

Eleanor paused, her hands still as she packed her needles. She lowered her gaze, hiding the storm in her eyes. "I've been busy lately. I don't have time for relationship troubles."

Norwood's years of wisdom told him the truth-she was shutting her heart.

And who could blame her?

He didn't push; he only played along. "That's the way to go. Focus on yourself. When Nolan finally realizes what he's done, you can decide whether he deserves another chance. That'll teach him."

Eleanor gave no answer. She simply packed her needles, slipped them back into her bag, and said softly,"Take care of yourself and rest well."

She cleaned up, then rose to leave. "I still have things to do, so I'll get going."

Norwood watched her walk away with a long sigh.

His foolish grandson was about to lose her for good.

At the hospital lobby, Eleanor spotted Nolan and Fannieheading her way.

Without slowing, she kept her eyes forward, blending into the crowd until she slipped out the doors.

Nolan and Fannie stepped into the elevator.

As the doors slid shut, Fannie frowned at the passing crowd. "Nolan, I think I just saw Eleanor."

Nolan instinctively looked out, but she was already gone. He shook his head. "You must've been mistaken.If she were here, she would've greeted me."

Fannie clicked her tongue.

To her, Nolan was as self-absorbed as ever.

After visiting his grandfather, Nolan went back to the villa in Regal Heights. He called Erick. "Clear my schedule for the next two day/s. I'll be spending them with Eleanor."

Erick nearly groaned but replied at once, "Yes,boss."

Not far away, Elora overheard. She slipped into her room and quickly sent a message to Ady.

His reply came almost immediately. "Do whatever you can to ruin it."

Elora bit her lip and typed back, "Will do."

She set her phone down with a quiet thought. "Sory, Nolan. What we have matters, but protecting mylife matters more."
###Chapter 313 Just Tell Me What You're Getting At

After leaving the hospital, Eleanor returned home just long enough to pack a few essentials before heading straight to join the temporary project team Dyer had put together.
When she stepped out of a taxi, Dyer nearly froze in disbelief.
The location was pretty isolated. Nolan hadn't come to escort her, nor had he arranged a driver. This felt like too much.
Rumors of a falling out between them had been circulating, and now seeing her arrive unaccompanied made him wonder if the gossip was true.
But Dyer didn't have time to linger on speculation. The auction was just around the corner, and with so much to do and little time left, their focus had to be on getting everything ready for tomorrow.

Clearing histhroat, he called the team together. "The artifacts returning from overseas are arriving soon.I want every one of you focused-no excuses."
He turned his gaze toward Eleanor, pride and trust mixed in his expression. "Eleanor, you'll lead the documentation team. Make sure everyone has the reference materials they need, and double-check every detail. Nothing should be overlooked."
Eleanor nodded promptly, standing tall and confident before her team. She made sure everyone understood their responsibilities and got straight to work.
The team threw themselves into the tasks, working tirelessly through the day and far into the night. Most of them even stayed overnight at the project site, determined to finish preparations for the artifacts before the auction began.
Eleanor stayed alongside them, completely immersed in her work.
Meanwhile, her phone lay abandoned in the locker room, ringing endlessly untiI its battery finally gave out. At Nightfall, Nolan sat alone in a dimly lit room on the top floor, staring at his phone as if willing it to connect.He tugged at his tie and downed the whiskey in front of him in one hard gulp, frustration pressing down on him like a weight.
He had made nearly a hundred calls over the course of the day, each one going straight to voicemail or failing to connect.
It was like yelling into an empty void, powerless.
Was he really about to lose Eleanor?
He hadn't done anything wrong. So why had everything gone off course?
Just then, Ryland appeared beside him, swirling his own glass lazily. "Still haven't patched things up with Eleanor?"
Nolan didn't answer and simply poured himself another drink.
Ryland clicked his tongue and shook his head. "Have you even thought about why it got this bad?"
Finally, Nolan set down his glass, his gaze sharpening into steel as he looked up. "Cut the nonsense, Ryland.Just tell me what you're getting at."
Ryland set his drink down, adopting a serious tone that was rare for him. "I just can't ignore how suspicious it is... Ever since Eloracame back, things between you and Eleanor started going downhill."
Nolan opened his mouth to respond, but Ryland continued, analyzing the situation. "I get it. Elora's been through a lot, she's vulnerable and needs support. But don't you see? The timing of her showing up lines up almost perfectly with when you upset Eleanor. It's hard to ignore the connection."
Nolan's jaw tightened, understanding where Ryland's suspicion was coming from, but he wasn't willing to accept it.
"I've known Elora since we were kids," Nolan said firmly. "I know her better than you ever will. She's just come out of a rough patch and nearly lost everything. Don't jump to conclusions."
He could still see it all. The fear in her eyes, the trembling in her voice, the heartbreak she carried. That pain was real. He had witnessed it firsthand. It couldn't be false.

And yet, suspicion wasn't just coming from his grandfather, but now Ryland was also overanalyzing everything,adding fuel to a fire that didn't exist.

Elora's circumstances were pitiful.

Her life had been filled with struggle and loss. As her childhood friend, he owed her his support and protection. If he doubted her, how could she ever feel safe moving forward?

Ryland exhaled and raised his hands in surrender. "Alright, alright. I get it. My bad. I shouldn't have doubted your innocent little Elora. I was wrong."

Trying to convince this stubborn man of reason was like talking to a brick wall.

Love really could make a man blind.

Ryland leaned closer, changing the subject with a mischievous 'glint in his eye. "Forget arguing now. Your real priority now is winning Eleanor back. You're going to the auction tomorrow, right?"

He gave Nolan a cheeky wink. "Be thoughtful, pay attention, and maybe pick up a few pieces she'd like.With her personality, a little gesture like that could melt her defenses in no time."

Nolan's fingers drummed against the rim of his glass, tracing its edges absentmindedly.

Ryland's advice made sense.

Arguing about who was right or wrong wasn't going to fix anything.

He had to show Eleanor, in every way he could, that she was the only one who mattered.

He drained the rest of his drink, set the glass down with quiet resolve, and finally spoke. "Fine. I'll go tomorrow."
###Chapter 314 I'll Find You Someone Better


Just as Nolan was about to step out the following morning, a single phone call shattered his plans.

Time didn't wait for him.

The auction went on as scheduled.

The moment Eleanor arrived with Dyer's team, reporters rushed at them,thrusting microphones forward.

"Miss Warren, are the rumors true? Did you and Mr. Stewart break up?"

"Is Mr.Stewart coming today? Are you still together?"

Eleanor gave a calm smile, her tone polite yeț distant. "This is a private matter. I have nothing to say."

She added gently, "Please focus on today's auction. These artifacts deserve the spotlight."

Security quickly stepped in, clearing the reporters and restoring order.

The hall grew quiet again.

Yet Eleanor's heart felt hollow.

She was used to standing alone, but somewhere along the way, she had begun hoping Nolan would stand beside her.

Would he come today?

She had no answer.

As she took her seat beside Dyer in the front row, her eyes fell on the empty chair next to her-Nolan's name gleamed in gold on its card.

The auction began, but the seat stayed vacant. He had broken his word.

Maybe because of Elora.

So be it.

Eleanor drew her gaze back to the auctioneer.

Dyer, of course, noticed the shift in her face.

He leaned closer, muttering, "Told you he's not right for you. Don't let it eat at you, kid. I'll find you someone better. Someone who'll make him look like yèsterday/'s news."

Eleanor shot him a half-teasing look. "Got time to play Cupid? Keep your eyes on those artifacts, or you'll be the one crying when they slip away."

When he heard her words, Dyer sat back, focusing on the bidding.

The auction ended on a high note.

Together,they secured several artifacts for the Elepdon Museum.

But when it came time to settle the bill, the staff revealed a surprise-an anonymous donor had already covered the enormous cost.

Seven hundred million.

Who could possibly give that much?

While Eleanor and Dyer pondered, the museum's organizer approached with a wide smile.

"Mr. Curtis, Ms. Warren, we'll be hosting a thank-you banquet in a few days. It would mean so much if you could attend. The community wants to honor you both."

Dyer's grin widened, and he threw Eleanor a knowing glance.

A banquet like that would be full of wealthy young men.

Maybe one of them could help her forget Nolan. He agreed on the spot, and Eleanor, unwilling to appear rude, nodded along.

From the shadows, Brodie watched with keen interest.

He had only come for amusement, but luck had handed him something better.

A banquet meant fine wine.

Once he managed to slip something into her drinks, he could have his way with the elusive Enigma.

And marriage to her would secure his place among Elepdon's elite.

The thought alone sent a thrill through him. He could already picture walking her down the aisle.

Brodie whispered under his breath, "Sorry, Nolan. Don't blame me for stealing your girl. You never knew how to keep her."
###Chapter 315 Was He Caught


The auction venue buzzed behind Eleanor as she politely declined her team's dinner invitation, choosing instead to return to the Benton family's home.

Sharp brakes squealed as a car lurched to a stop mere feet from where she stood at the entrance.

Nolan exploded from the driver's seat, panic and remorse warring across his face. "Baby, forgive me for breaking my promise. Elora's violent ex-boyfriend ambushed her at the hospital and tried to assault her.I couldn't abandon her in that state, so the auction became impossible."

By now, Eleanor recognized this tired dance all too well.

Every single time she arranged plans with Nolan, some crisis involving Elora would magically materialize.

Cool indifference masked her features as she inquired with deceptive calm, "Was he caught?"

Nolan decided to be completely honest with her. "No, he was gone by the time I got there."

At that answer, Eleanor's expression shifted into something like amusement. Looking directly into his eyes,she asked, "Did it ever occur to you that this might not be what it appears?"

Nolan stared at her in complete shock. "You're saying Elora planned this herself?"

The idea seemed completely crazy to him.

The doctor had confirmed that Elora was genuinely terrified and showing real physical signs of trauma.

Nobody could fake something that convincing.

Eleanor could tell he would never believe her, so she didn't waste her breath trying to convince him.

Her gaze moved past him to her parents, who had just stepped outside. "Mom, Dad, I'm exhausted. Would you mind showing our guest out?"

She turned and walked straight into the house without giving him another glance. Nolan started to follow, but Jeff quickly moved to block his way.

Jeff glared at the young man who had caused his daughter so much pain, his voice turning ice-cold. "If Eleanor isn't your number one priority, we'll never give our blessing to this marriage. You need to give up on that idea completely."

Nolan could see that Jeff meant every word.

He answered with complete sincerity, "Mr. Benton, my feelings for Eleanor have never changed. Please let her know that I'm going to take care of Elora's situation once and for all."

With that promise, he turned around and walked away.

Hilda watched his retreating figure and let out a deep sigh. "That boy is incredibly stubborn."

Anyone could see how much Nolan loved Eleanor, but his loyalty toward his close friend kept him from seeing what was right in front of him.

Her poor daughter had to be suffering so much because of this.

Jeff moved closer and wrapped his arms around his wife, rubbing her back in gentle circles.

"Don't stress about it," he told her softly. "If Nolan's not going to work out, we'll find someone much better for Eleanor. There are plenty of decent men in this world."

Hilda nodded in agreement with her husband's words.

She refused to accept that Eleanor wouldn't be able to find true happiness.

Nolan had no clue that the Bentons had already given up on him entirely.

He was behind the wheel, his thoughts spinning in circles.

Why was everyone.convinced that he was making a mistake?

His grandfather, Eleanor, even Ryland... every single person seemed to think he was in the wrong.

Was it possible that Elora really was the source of all these problems? That thought made Nolan grab his phone with one hand. "Pull the hospital's security footage. I want you to verify everything Elora and the doctor told us. Don't overlook anything, and keep this completely confidential."

Erick responded with his usual professionalism, "Understood, Mr. Stewart."

Truth was, he had been questioning Elora's stories for quite some time now.

But being just an assistant, he knew his place and kept those suspicions to himself.

...

Nolan drove back to Regal Heights alone.

The villa greeted him with emptiness, lacking all the life and warmth that Eleanor used to fill it with.

Things weren't meant to turn out this way.

Where exactly had everything started falling apart?

How did they reach this breaking point?

Maybe he really had been wrong about everything.

But Elora was so fragile right now. He couldn't possibly abandon someone who had been his friend since childhood.
###Chapter 316 What, Not Happy To See Me


Nolan had barely collapsed onto the sofa when his phone buzzed. Erick was calling.

"Mr. Stewart, we've got something," came Erick's tense voice. "The hospital cameras caught a suspicious guy wearing a hat and mask sneaking around Elora's room."

So Elora wasn't a liar.

The doctor's words had been right all along.

And yet, why couldn't Eleanor try to see things from his side just a little?

Nolan tugged at his tie, frustration coiling in his chest. "Double the security at the hospital. No one steps near Elora's room without my clearance."

"Understood, boss. I'll handle it immediately."

True to his word, Erick moved quickly, not wasting a moment.

Then, as though recalling another detail, he added, "Also, I've taken care of the auction issue, sir."

"Alright." Nolan set the phone down and slumped onto the sofa, massaging his temples in exhaustion.

Quiet steps sounded from the stairs, and Fannie appeared in her pajamas, still rubbing her eyes. "Nolan,you're home? How's Elora?"

His features softened at the sight of his little sister. "She's fine. Everything's under control. Go get some sleep."

Fannie, holding her water glass, muttered under her breath, but loud enough for him to catch."It's been a while since Eleanor was here.Is she mad at you?"

Her confusion made Nolan's jaw tighten. "Elora hasn't done anything wrong. So why's Eleanor making such a fuss over nothing?" The moment she spoke, Nolan's features stiffened. "Careful," he barked sharply. "Don't ever talk about Eleanor like that."

Fannie flinched, her glass tilting dangerously in her hands.

She had always admired Eleanor, so Nolan's sudden harshness took her by surprise.

With a small huff, she set the glass down and stomped back up to her room.

Nolan sank further into the sofa, thoughts spinning like a storm.

Maybe some distance was exactly what he and Eleanor needed.

Eventually, she would see his side of things,right?

Meanwhile, Eleanor, the one who occupied every corner of his mind, had decided to step back from romance for now.

The Warren Foundation still needed her attention, and she was determined to focus on growing her business and saving every bit she could.

The next morning, she arrived at her store, full of energy and purpose.

Inside,Betsy was already in full boss mode, barking orders at the staff.

"What's going on?" Eleanor asked casually, glancing around.

Betsy spun around immediately and hurried over. "Boss, a major client's coming. They say she's extremely picky, so we're cleaning the entire place from top to bottom."

Eleanor nodded quickly and went on her way.

As she headed up the stairs, the glass door swung open once again.

Ryland appeared, stepping in with a grin.

Betsy's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Wasn't it supposed to be a lady arriving?

Ryland caught her look and chuckled.′′Mymom got tied up last minute. What, not happy to see me?"

Eleanor's brow knitted.

She didn't want to get caught up with anyone associated with Nolan, not now.

She gave a short nod and walked straight upstairs without stopping.

Ryland froze, taken aback by Eleanor's cold reaction.

Before, even before her relationship wvith Nolan, she would have said something, anything.

Betsy noticed the change too. With a knowing glance at Ryland, she muttered, "Men. They're alI the same.Not worth a second thought."
 ###Chapter 317 Who Does He Think He ls


Ryland's expression soured. "Hey, Besty, that's not entirely fair. Good men still exist, like me, for instance."

He tapped his chest with a smug grin.

Besty fought the urge to roll her eyes.

Refusing to indulge his antics, Betsy instructed her assistant to handle him.

Noticing Betsy's firm demeanor, Ryland couldn't resist messing with her.

He sank onto the sofa, legs crossed lazily.′′Amajor client like me, and this is how I'm treated? Maybe |should report your office for poor customer service."

Betsy's jaw tightened, fury simmering beneath her composed surface.

What an insufferable fool!

Forcing a rigid smile, she gritted her teeth. "I'm sorry, Mr. Brooks," she replied.

Ryland nodded, clearly pleased, and motioned to the empty chair beside him.

Betsy inhaled deeply, gathered a pile of the newest design catalogs, and seated herself. "These are our latest designs. Any styles your mother might enjoy?"

Ryland lazily flipped through the pages, dismissing every option. "This color's too loud. Mom wouldn't wear it. That design feels outdated. This fabric looks scratchy."

His criticisms never ended.

Betsy clutched the catalogs until her knuckles ached, resisting the urge to toss them at his smug face.

How could someone as wonderful as Lillian have such an unbearable brother?

It was incomprehensible. Yet Betsy's professionalism kept her temper in check.

All she could do was smile politely beside him.

Once Ryland finally left, satisfied with the minimal progress, Betsy felt utterly drained.

Men were exhausting.

Nolan had been difficult enough, and Ryland offered no relief.

After a brief pause, Betsy went upstairs.

Eleanor was meticulously tracing patterns into fabric, fully absorbed.

Without lifting her gaze, she asked flatly, "Did Mr. Brooks settle on a design?"

Betsy's frustration surged anew at the mention. "He chose one, kind of, but then found flaws in every detail.Said he'd return in a few days."

The more she thought, the hotter her temper flared. "And get this-he actually requested that you handle him personally. Who does he think he is?"

Eleanor calmly set the craft knife on the table, unbothered. "You manage him. I won't meet with him.From now on, all Brooks Group orders are yours."

Betsy's heart sank, her expression crumpling.

Eleanor had just left her with a serious headache.

Yet being a subordinate, what option did Betsy truly have other than to follow orders?

Just thinking about that irritating Ryland made Betsy long to find him and erase that arrogant grin.

Observing Betsy's silence, Eleanor finally glanced up. "What? Something wrong?"

Betsy waved her hands frantically. "No, nothing wrong."

Once she left the store, Eleanor headed to the orphanage. She joined Myah to prepare lunch for the children and then played games with them.

As the kids took a nap, Eleanor perched on the front steps, gazing at the somber gray sky.

Her phone came out, and she lingered over Nolan's contact photo before slipping it back into her bag.

He was probably with Elora right now.

There was no reason to call and set herself up for disappointment.

She needed to get used to being independent again.

After all, she had been alone for a long time.

Besides,herparents were with her now.

She felt content.
###Chapter 318 She Sent Me To Keep You Company


The night of the banquet, Eleanor had barely stepped out of the car when her phone buzzed. Lillian's name lit up the screen.

"Eleanor, I just landed in Breoqua. I can't make it tonight!" Lillian said.

Eleanor froze for a moment. So that was why she hadn't heard from Lillian in days.

She had slipped away to visit Fraser without a word.

"You're terrible," Eleanor muttered, lips pressing into a thin line.

A cheerful laugh crackled through the line, followed by Lillian's playful pleading. "Come on. Don't be mad.
I've already arranged for someone to keep you company. She should be arriving any minute now."

And before Eleanor could scold her further, the call ended.

Eleanor sighed, helpless.

She tucked her phone back into her clutch, lifted the hem of her gown with grace, and stepped inside the glittering venue.

The instant she crossed the threshold of the banquet hall, a familiar figure broke through the crowd.

"Finally!" Dyer's face lit up as he hurried toward her, catching her gently by the arm. "Come with me,Eleanor."

Before she could get a word in, he was already pulling her through a lively sea of sharp-dressed young men,all laughter, polished shoes, and glasses of champagne.

One after another, Eleanor was introduced to a line of bright-eyed, ambitious men-ten in all, each seemingly more eligible than the last.

But her expression remained composed, her heart untouched. She smiled politely, nodding with quiet indifference.
Dyer's expression tightened with unease. He tugged Eleanor gently aside and lowered his voice. "Eleanor,what's your type? If none of these men are up to standard, I'll find better ones for you tomorrow."
Eleanor's lips curved into a faint smile. "Don't trouble yourself. I'm not looking for romance right now."
The wound Nolan had left behind still lingered, a bitter reminder that had stripped her of any illusions about love.

At this point, her heart belonged to her career alone.
Dyer looked as though he wanted to argue, but before he could, a server appeared and bowed slightly. "Mr.Curtis, Mr. Gill is asking for you."
With clear reluctance, Dyer released her arm and disappeared into the crowd to meet his friend.
Eleanor exhaled softly, relieved to have some breathing room.
She drifted toward the buffet table, hoping a quick snack might ground her.
But before she could help herself, Leon-the distinguished curator of the Elepdon Museum-approached with a glass of wine in hand. His smile was warm and respectful. "Ms. Warren," he said, raising the glass,"thank you for your priceless contributions to the revival of cultural relics over the years."
Just then, a server passed by with a tray of wine.
He gently lowered the tray to offer her a glass of red liquor.
Eleanor didn't care much for alcohol, and she was hardly in the mood to drink tonight.
Still, courtesy demanded something, so she reached out to accept a glass.
From a shadowed corner of the hall, Brodie's eyes followed her every move.
As Eleanor's fingers brushed the stem of the glass, a sly grin flickered across Brodie's face from the shadows. Then, just as quickly, he vanished into the milling crowd. Eleanor hesitated, debating whether she might ask the server for juice instead. But before she could,another hand swept in and claimed the glass from her hand.

Betsy had appeared as if from nowhere. With a polished smile directed at Leon, she said smoothly,Ortiz, Eleanor has another engagement shortly. I'll drink this on her behalf."

Without hesitation, Betsy tipped the glass back, downing the wine in a single motion.

Leon chuckled, clearly not taking offense, and after a few pleasantries, drifted away into the throng.

Once he was gone, Eleanor turned to Betsy, puzzled. "What are you doing here?"

Betsy set the empty glass neatly onto the server's tray before answering. "Lillian didn't want you facing this evening alone. She sent me to keep you company."

Realization settled over Eleanor.

So that was it.

Betsy was the one Lillian had promised to send in her stead.
###Chapter 319 It's Unbearable


Eleanor disliked gatherings of that sort.

She offered a quick excuse before telling Besty, "I'm stepping outside for some air. Take care of things inside. Ring me if anything urgent happens."

Afterward,she unpinned the badge from her chest and pressed it into Besty's hand.

The bold letters spelled Eleanor's full name.

Besty hardly reacted with surprise.

Through the years,covering Eleanor's social obligations had become routine.

She answered right away,"Alright."

When Eleanor's figure vanished beyond the doorway, Besty exhaled slowly, dabbing the sweat from her forehead.

A sudden wave of dizziness left her unsettled.

She assumed the drink she had swallowed too quickly was finally taking effect.

Her head shook faintly as she considered finding a chair and resting.

Before she could move, sharp snapping fingers rang beside her ear.

Startled; she turned and found Ryland standing there with a playful grin stretched across his face.

He seemed equally surprised to spot her. With hands buried in his pockets, he teased, "Besty, imagine meeting you here! Or did you plan this encounter on purpose?"

Besty nearly rolled her eyes at his mocking tone.

He appeared arrogant as well as unbearably conceited. She ignored Ryland altogether and tried walking past, irritation clear in her stride.

Yet her steps grew uneven, her balance faltered, and a strange redness spread across her cheeks.

Still joking, Ryland went on, "I know I'm irresistible, so people often chase me. But Besty, that trick feels outdated.Perhaps-

Buzzing filled her ears while her head clouded more heavily.

Unable to endure further, she cut him off through clenched teeth. "Are you finished?"

Only then did Ryland sense something unusual about Besty:

He stepped forward quickly, catching her staggering form.

Her skin burned like firebeneath his hand.

The grin vanished instantly, replaced by a serious frown. "Are you good?"

Besty's breathing came harsh and ragged, her body trembling.

Alone with no trusted faces nearby, she doubted she could manage.

Resigned, she turned to Ryland for support. "I need to lie down."

Seeing her distress, he decided at once. "I'll take you upstairs to rest."

Her weak nod gave consent.

Meanwhile, an attendant upstairs shifted nervously.

Moments earlier, he had been given a generous tip with instructions to wait for a woman wearing Eleanor's badge and escort her to Room 9.

When the elevator doors slid open, he noticed a man helping a woman.

Too anxious to raise his head, he only checked the badge pinned to her chest-it clearly bore Eleanor's name. Convinced she was the guest, he rushed to lead them toward Room 9.

Inside, as Ryland lowered Besty onto the sofa, an odd fragrance lingered heavily.

He glanced at her quickly and realized herstate was deteriorating.

Clawing at her collar, she gasped, overwhelmed by the heat. "It's unbearable."

Ryland grew tense and resolved to summon a doctor without delay.

But the moment he grabbed his phone, Besty, consumed by the fire racing through her, hurled herself at him.

She clutched his collar and drove him backward with unexpected strength.

The sudden force stunned him completely.

As the strange scent thickened, his own mind began slipping.

Their lips met, and both of them were consumed, carried helplessly into the moment.
###Chapter 320 Don't Let Anything Slip

At the corridor's far end, an attendant hurried toward Brodie, lowering his voice. "Mr. Stewart, the individual has been escorted into Room 9," he whispered.

Brodie's eyes narrowed with satisfaction as he retrieved a thick stack of cash from his pocket, passing it over. "Excellent.Mind your words. Don't let anything slip."

The attendant nodded vigorously, securing the money, then retreated silently.

Brodie observed the departing figure, a smug curl forming on his lips.

He convinced himself that once he slept with Eleanor, the Benton family would have no choice but to marry her off to him, all in the name of reputation.

At that point, he would officially become the Benton family's son-in-law.

He felt certain that with their influence behind him, the Stewart Group would eventually fall under his control.


Brodie's steps lightened, a cheerful hum escaping him as he moved toward Room 9.

Distracted, he rounded the corner and collided with the door's number plate.

The "6" flipped over, revealing a "9."

Rubbing his throbbing forehead, he paused, briefly confused.

This was it. The number clearly read 9, no errors.

A grin stretched across his face, and without hesitation, he nudged the door open quietly.

Darkness swallowed the room, the curtains drawn tightly shut.

By the corridor's dim glow, he could barely make out the shape of a woman lying on the bed. Brodie's breathing hitched instantly.

He pulled out his phone, opening Nolan's contact, and typed a bold message. "Nolan, the role of the Benton family's son-in-law belongs to me."

After sending it, he tucked the device away with smug satisfaction and secured the door behind him.

Step by step, he approached the bed, determination etched on his face. "Baby, just surrender yourself to me.I'll take care of you."

Not realizing it, he had been mistaken about the person from the very beginning.

Meanwhile,Nolan returned to the villa in Regal Heights after an exhausting day at work.

His phone buzzed sharply in his pocket.

He pulled it out casually, thinking it could be a message from Eleanor.

Instead, the screen flashed Brodie's name.

Suspicion narrowed Nolan's eyes as he read the text.

The Benton family's son-in-law?

What was Brodie scheming now?

Unease immediately surged through Nolan. He quickly dialed Erick and demanded, "Where is Eleanor tonight?"

Erick froze at Nolan's icy tone, momentarily speechless. Still, he answered without hesitation, "She attended the Elepdon Museum appreciation banquet tonight."

Nolan ended the call abruptly, pivoting sharply as he stormed out of the villa.

Erick, gripping the disconnected phone, stood frozen,perplexed.

What was happening?

Nolan sounded like a man ready to strike. Could Eleanor have been harmed?
By the time Nolan arrived, the banquet was drawing to a close.
Guests dispersed in small clusters, fatigue etched across their faces from hours of mingling.Nolan immediately recognized the familiar figure.
Eleanor stepped gracefully out of the entrance, the pale lavender dress highlighting her poised, elegant form.
She remained unharmed.
Nolan's tense heart, which had been hammering the entire way, finally eased at the sight of her.
The moment Brodie's message arrived, his mind had conjured every terrible possibility.
On his way, he had run countless red lights, driven by a single thought-he could not allow any harm to reach Eleanor.
Thankfully,she was perfectly safe.
Nolan closed the distance with long, purposeful strides and, seeing her bewildered expression, pulled her tightly into his arms.
His embrace radiated warmth and strength, a silent promise that he would never release her.
