###Chapter 1

"I accept your terms." My voice remained steady as I spoke into the phone. "I'll return as the heiress."

The line went dead.

I stared at the bedroom that had been my prison for eight long years. A bitter smile touched my lips. Eight years of devotion. Eight years of patience. Eight years of love. All for nothing.

"How dare you wear my mother's dress!"

The shrill voice shattered my thoughts. I turned slowly to face Liam, his small face contorted with rage.

"You're not going to say anything?" he demanded, tiny hands clenched into fists.

"Your friends are waiting, Liam." I kept my voice soft. "You should go enjoy your party."

"No!" he screamed.

He grabbed the ceramic pitcher from the table and threw its contents at me. Scalding hot coffee drenched my dress and skin. I cried out in pain.

"Serves you right! You'll never replace my mother! You killed her with your evil heart!" Liam shouted. "And now you're wearing her favorite dress!"

A maid rushed into the room. She gasped at the sight of me covered in coffee stains, my skin already reddening from burns.

"I'm so sorry, Miss! Liam escaped from his minders." The maid grabbed the smirking boy and hurried away.

I retreated to the bathroom. The dress had never belonged to Isabella, my stepsister who died giving birth to Liam. It was mine—a gift from my late mother that Isabella had stolen from me. Just like she stole everything else.

Eight years ago, I was supposed to marry Alexander Russo. We were childhood sweethearts. I believed we were in love. Then he married Isabella. She became pregnant. She lived the life that should have been mine.

Then she died. Everyone called me bad luck. They accused me of killing her out of jealousy.

As Isabella's only sister and Alexander's former fiancée, I was sent to care for Liam. My stepmother told me to treat him like my own son.

For eight years, I did exactly that. I loved Liam as my own. I cared for Alexander too. But I was foolish. Alexander never loved me.

They both treated me like garbage. They made sure I knew my place—nothing but a live-in nanny. A servant.

Liam never respected me. He constantly found ways to hurt me. But today, on his eighth birthday, I decided enough was enough.

If this had happened three years ago, I would have begged for his forgiveness. Not anymore.

"The party has started." Alexander's voice came from the doorway. "Where are you, Rachel?"

I emerged from the bathroom just as he entered. He sighed at the sight of my stained dress.

"I heard what Liam did. Don't take it personally. He's just a child who loves you," Alexander said.

I laughed bitterly. "That boy doesn't know the first thing about loving me."

"Don't say that. He's a good kid." Alexander frowned.

I moved away from him and reached for the healing balm on the nightstand. My skin burned where the coffee had scalded it. The ointment would work miracles overnight.

"Let me help you." Alexander took the balm from my hands before I could protest.

His fingers gently massaged the ointment into my burned skin. Years ago, his touch would have made me weak. Now it made my skin crawl.

"Be patient with him," he whispered, his breath warm against my neck.

I pulled away. "I need to tell you something."

"Can't it wait? Liam's birthday celebration has begun."

"No, it can't wait." I met his gaze directly. "Eight years is enough. I'm leaving."
###Chapter 2

"What are you talking about?" Alexander's voice boomed.

I saw his expression darken with rage.

The air grew thick with tension.

But I refused to back down.

"It's been eight years, Alexander. I want out," I stated clearly.

He glared at me. "What's wrong with you? Why cause trouble now? I told you Liam is just a kid. Don't take his actions personally. It's his birthday today. Come with me. I'll deal with him later."

Alexander reached for my hand, pulling me toward the door.

I snatched my hand back. "You promised I could leave when he turned eight. So why am I the one causing trouble?" I challenged.

Before he could respond, an angry voice cut through the air.

"Rachel, you have no shame! Always making everything about you, even on my grandson's special day!"

I recognized that voice instantly.

Victoria. My stepmother. Liam's grandmother.

She was the one who made the deal with Alexander. Eight years, then freedom.

So why were they acting like this now?

"I'm not making it about me, Victoria. You said I could leave after eight years," I reminded her.

She laughed mockingly. "Did you have to bring this up today?"

"It's fine. I'm sure Rachel didn't mean any harm," Alexander interrupted.

In the past, his defense would have made me blush.

Now I knew better. It was just another pathetic attempt to keep me trapped.

"Come on, let's join the party," Alexander said to me.

I stayed silent, letting him lead me to the ongoing celebration.

Liam and his friends were playing happily.

His smile vanished when he saw me.

"Look, Liam, your mom's here," someone said.

He scoffed loudly. "She's not my mother!"

I stood nearby while Alexander sighed and pulled Liam close.

"We don't say things like that. Rachel is your mother. She's taken good care of you," Alexander stated firmly.

Liam's face twisted with anger. "No! She can never be my mother. Everyone, this woman killed my real mom!"

Whispers spread through the party hall.

All eyes turned to me.

"She's the boy's aunt."

"Why doesn't the boy like her?"

"Clearly she's not treating him well."

"Apologize to her right now," Alexander demanded.

I stopped him. "It's fine. It doesn't matter."

I walked away calmly.

In the past, Liam's words would have shattered me.

But I've accepted the truth.

No matter what I do, Alexander's heart will always belong to Isabella.

Liam will always blame me for taking his mother's place.

"Why did you have to make a scene today?"

Victoria's sharp voice cut through my thoughts.

She stepped into view, glaring.

"What do you want, Victoria? I've played my part for eight years. I'm done," I said.

"You should care for Liam like your own son. Tolerate his behavior. Look after him. If my daughter were alive, he'd be treated much better," she snapped.

I shrugged, exhausted. "Too bad your daughter isn't here."

Victoria raised her hand to strike me.

I caught her wrist. "Don't try it. I'm not in the mood. Eight years ago you forced me to come here and take care of them. The contract is over. Liam is eight. I have every right to leave."

She yanked her hand back, rubbing her sore wrist.

She glared at me. "Do what you want, Rachel. This is why no one will ever love you. Even your father can't stand you!" she hissed before storming off.

A bitter smile touched my lips.

Eight years since I last saw my father.

Since his favorite daughter died and he sent me away.

He never cared to visit.

"I'm sorry. I got you a gift."

A small voice spoke behind me.

I turned to see Liam standing there with an innocent smile.

He held a wrapped gift box.

I smiled. "Aww, you shouldn't have."

He giggled. "I wanted to. Please, open it."

I took the box and opened it.

A foul smell hit my nose.

Inside was the lifeless body of my cat, Oliver, killed with an arrow.

"That will be you soon if you don't leave me and my father alone," Liam giggled.
###Chapter 3
I stared in horror at the only pet I’d been permitted to bring to the estate.
My hands trembled as I looked at the arrow piercing Oliver’s small body.
I had raised Liam with the same tenderness.
Yet this was how he repaid me.

“Stay out of my way,” Liam snapped, his voice cold.
“And don’t you dare upset my father because of this.”

He stormed off without a backward glance.
I remained frozen, my gaze locked on the lifeless form of my cat.
The irony was cruel.
I had taught Liam how to handle a bow.
I had taught him so much.
Now he turned every lesson against me.

Cradling the small box, I let a tear escape.
Oliver had been my silent companion through countless lonely nights.

“Rachel, what are you doing out here in the cold?” Alexander’s voice cut through the evening air.
He stepped out into the garden, concern etching his features.
“You’ll catch a chill.”

He moved behind me, draping his jacket over my shoulders.
I shook it off immediately.
His eyes fell to the box in my arms, and his expression tightened with distaste.

“Your son came to apologize,” I said flatly.

Alexander’s frown deepened.
“He’s your son too, Rachel.”

I let out a bitter laugh.
“He despises me, Alexander.
He killed my cat.”

“Come inside,” he urged, his tone softening.
“We’ll discuss this with Liam in the morning.
You can bury the cat tomorrow.
It was just a boy’s thoughtless prank.”

I pulled away, clutching the box tighter.
“I’m not leaving him outside for the animals.”

Though he complained about my stubbornness, Alexander followed me into the garden.
He stood silently as I dug a small grave under the old oak tree.
When it was done, I brushed the dirt from my hands and turned toward the house.

The party had ended.
The guests were gone.
The wind picked up, biting through my thin dress.

I sneezed just as Alexander reached for me.
He guided me inside and up to my room.
He sat me on his lap, but I stiffened, pulling away.

“What do you want, Alexander?” I demanded.

He sighed.
“I’ll get you another cat, Rachel.
A dozen if you wish.”

“I want to leave.
Tomorrow.”

Alexander’s body went rigid.
“Liam is just a child.
I trust no one else with him.
Where would you even go?
You have no one.”

“I’ll manage,” I said, my voice hollow.
“I don’t belong here.
You refused to marry me after eight years, Alexander.”

“You know why I can’t take another wife now,” he replied, frustration creeping into his tone.

“I’m not asking you to.
I don’t want to marry you.
I just want to go.”

“Then have my child,” he said suddenly, his eyes intent.
“A child would secure your position.
No one would dare disrespect you then.
And Liam would have a sibling.”

A sad smile touched my lips.
I had sacrificed everything for this family—my pride, my youth, my self-respect.
And still, he wanted me to bear an illegitimate child.
All to keep me under his roof, all to control me.

“I’ve already instructed the maid on Liam’s routine.
He’s homeschooled—hire better tutors or send him to school.
He doesn’t need me.”

Alexander leaned in and kissed me.
“Sleep on it.
We’ll talk in the morning.”

But I didn’t sleep.
I packed my bags through the night, Oliver’s still face haunting me.

Morning arrived too soon.
After a quick shower, I dragged my suitcases downstairs.
This was it.
I was finally leaving.

But peace was not in the cards for me.

A slow, mocking clap echoed across the courtyard.
Sophia leaned against a pillar, a smirk playing on her lips.
“Well, well.
Finally developed some self-respect, have you?”

I ignored her, continuing toward the gate.

She stepped into my path, blocking my exit.
“Eight years, Rachel.
Eight years you spent waiting for a man who never wanted you.
And now you’re walking away?”
She chuckled.
“Took you long enough to understand.
Alexander and Liam will never love you.
You were always just the worthless mistress.”

I met her gaze, my face expressionless.
“Enjoy your victory then.
Do as you please.
None of this matters to me anymore.”

Her smirk widened.
“Oh, I will.
Soon I’ll be moving in.
I’ll take everything that was never yours.”

Before I could reply, the front doors flew open.

Alexander stepped out, Liam close behind.

In an instant, Sophia’s demeanor shattered.

She fell to her knees, clutching the hem of my dress with theatrical desperation.
“Rachel, please don’t go!” she sobbed, her voice trembling.
“Liam needs you!
How can you abandon him after all these years?”

I stared down at her, numb.

“He loves you, he really does!” she cried, tears streaming down her face.
“He’s just a boy!
Please, I beg you—don’t leave him!”

Alexander let out an impatient sigh.
“Stop this nonsense, Sophia.
You’re making a scene.”
His eyes were cold as they settled on me.
“I said I’d replace the cat.
Don’t upset Sophia over something so trivial.”

I clenched my fists, but before I could speak, Liam rushed to Sophia’s side.

He helped her up, his small hands wiping her fake tears.
Then he turned to me, his eyes burning with hatred.
“You killed my mother with your wickedness,” he spat.
“And now you’re trying to hurt Sophia too?”

His voice shook with anger.
He looked back at Sophia, his expression softening.
“Don’t cry.
Let her go.
I don’t want her here.
I don’t need her.”
He lifted his chin, his words sharp as blades.
“I want you to be my mother.
You should marry my father.”

Then his eyes returned to me, filled with pure scorn.
“You have an evil heart.
That’s why my father could never love you.”
A cruel smile touched his lips.
“I’m glad you’re leaving.”

I swallowed the pain thickening in my throat.
I took one last look at the boy I had raised, the child I had loved as my own.

“After eight years,” I said quietly, “if this is what you believe of me, then there’s no reason left to stay.”

Without another word, I turned and walked toward the gate.

Just as I reached it, I heard the familiar sound of a crossbow being drawn.

An arrow whizzed past, missing my head by inches.
###Chapter 4
Isabella’s POV

“Don’t think pretending to be pitiful will make me keep you as my stepmother!”

“If you have the guts to leave, never come back!”

The sharp arrow flew straight toward me, loaded with the boy’s bitter rage.

I barely moved in time, but it still sliced deep into my shoulder.

A raw cry tore from my throat.

Alexander was at my side instantly, holding me as I clenched my teeth against the pain.

“I’m so sorry, Isabella,” he cried out.

Just then, Sophia screamed, and Liam shouted too.

“Papa, come quick! Aunt Sophia twisted her ankle running to help that witch!” Liam yelled.

Alexander looked torn, his eyes darting between my bleeding shoulder and Sophia’s dramatic fall.

He released me with a heavy sigh.

“It’s a clean wound, Isabella. Go to the hospital—I’ll meet you there. Sophia can’t walk; I have to take her,” he said.

I didn’t let my disappointment show.

I stayed on the ground, watching him walk away from me—again.

He carried Sophia in his arms, bridal style.

She shot me a smug look as they got into the car and drove off with Liam.

There I was, left alone on the cold floor, bleeding from a wound given by the child I had raised, trained, and taught to shoot.

Life could be so cruel.

I struggled to stand when I heard footsteps behind me.

“You wretched girl! Why are you still here? Didn’t you tell the whole city you were leaving?”

I knew that voice. It was Eleanor, Alexander’s mother. She had always despised me.

I forced myself up and turned to face her.

She gasped when she saw my injury and the blood staining my clothes.

“Trying to frame my son? If you want to die, do it somewhere else!” she spat.

“I was leaving when your grandson shot me,” I replied coldly.

She laughed mockingly. “Hurt yourself and now blaming a child? You’re just acting pitiful so Alexander pities you. You lost your place here the moment you decided to go.”

“I want nothing from you or your family, Eleanor. Your grandson did this!” I snapped.

She smirked. “Then you won’t mind getting out.”

Before I could respond, she snatched my luggage and threw it outside the gate.

“Get out!” she hissed, shoving me out too. “Go die somewhere else. Leave my son alone.”

I stumbled and fell, clutching my bleeding shoulder.

“You’ll regret this,” I vowed, fury burning in my chest.

I gathered my boxes just as my Uber pulled up.

“Sorry I’m late, Miss,” the driver said.

“It’s fine,” I muttered, sliding into the back seat.

He eyed my shoulder. “Still heading to the airport?”

I shook my head. “Take me to the hospital first.”

I leaned back and closed my eyes, exhaustion taking over.

I woke to the steady beeping of an EKG machine.

I was in a hospital room. My arm throbbed with pain when I tried to sit up.

My boxes were stacked neatly beside the bed.

The door opened, and a doctor walked in.

“Miss Isabella, how are you feeling?” he asked.

I groaned. “What happened? Last thing I remember, I was in a cab.”

The doctor nodded. “You passed out before arriving. The Uber driver brought you in.”

I checked my phone. I’d missed my flight.

A new text waited. I replied quickly.

Something came up. Reschedule my flight ASAP.

“Miss Isabella?” The doctor pulled my attention back.

I lifted a brow. “Yes?”

“You lost a lot of blood, but you’ve been treated. You’ll be discharged soon,” he explained.

I nodded. “Thank you.”

He smiled and left. I stood and reached for my boxes.

Not a single call or message from Alexander.

His son shot me, and he couldn’t even check if I was alive.

The door swung open.

Sophia walked in, looking pleased with herself.

I rolled my eyes.

“What do you want? I thought you twisted your ankle,” I said flatly.

She giggled. “Oh, that? I just wanted to see who Alexander would choose. And he picked me! Exciting, isn’t it?”

I scoffed. “Have your fun, Sophia. I’m leaving.”

She stepped in front of me, a smug smile on her lips.

“There’s something you should know,” she said, voice dripping with pride. “I’m pregnant. With Alexander’s baby.”

The air left my lungs.

My heart shattered, but I refused to let it show.

I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.

Eight years.

Eight years by his side, and I was never more than a shadow.

He always made me take birth control right after he was done with me.

He always wanted another child.

Just not with me.
###Chapter 5

"Goodbye, Sophia," I told her.

She stood firmly in my path, refusing to let me pass.

My patience was wearing thin. My phone had just buzzed with a flight update—rescheduled, and I couldn't miss it this time.

All I wanted was to get away from these people. Why was she purposely provoking me?

"What do you want?" I demanded.

Sophia gave a sly smile. "I want to see you break down."

I let out a harsh laugh. "Not going to happen."

As I tried to move past her with my box, she threw a few dollar bills at my feet.

"For your taxi fare," she sneered.

Something in me snapped. Before I could stop myself, my hand flew out and struck her across the face.

"How dare you?" I seethed.

Sophia screamed loudly, just as Alexander and Liam rushed into the room.

"What did you do, Isabella?" Alexander shouted, seeing Sophia’s reddened cheek.

I glared back. "What did I do? You come running when she screams. Where were you when your son shot me? Where were you when I was bleeding out?"

"Evil woman!" Liam cried out. "She hurt Sophia!"

"It's not her fault, Liam," Sophia whimpered. "I came to ask her to stay. I offered her money, and she hit me."

"Stop the act, Sophia. Stop playing the victim!" I snapped.

"No, you stop, Isabella!" Alexander shot back. "I’ve been too easy on you. Apologize to Sophia, and I might take you back."

I stared at him, then burst into laughter. "Even if you were the last man alive, Alexander, I would never be with you."

"What is that supposed to mean? How dare you speak to me like that?" he roared.

"Eight years, and you never wanted a child. Then I find out on the same day your son shoots me that Sophia is pregnant with your baby," I stated coldly.

Alexander shot a quick, questioning look at Sophia, as if asking why she had told me.

"We can discuss that later. Just come home. We can work this out," he said, softening his tone.

"In your dreams," I retorted.

I turned and walked away, ignoring his demands for me to stop.

A short while later, I arrived at the airport just in time for my flight.

As I was checking in and about to switch off my phone, it rang.

It was Alexander. Reluctantly, I answered.

"What do you want?" I snapped.

"I know you’re upset about Sophia’s pregnancy. Come home. Give me a child, and I’ll add your name to my will. You and your child will want for nothing," he said.

"Go to hell, Alexander," I replied coldly.

I hung up and blocked his number without another word.

The flight was long. I slept through most of it, relieved when the plane finally landed.

I stepped into the arrivals hall with my boxes and noticed a well-dressed man in a tuxedo holding a sign that read: Isabella Sterling.

I approached him, and he recognized me immediately.

"Miss Sterling, I’m Christopher. Your personal guard," he introduced himself.

"Thank you," I said with a nod.

He took my luggage, loaded it into the car, and opened the back door for me.

I sank into the plush leather seat of the SUV, relaxing as we drove off. Soon, we arrived at a grand mansion.

This was the home of my grandparents, Benjamin and Charlotte Sterling.

Their company, Sterling Enterprises, was the largest in New York, and I was their only heir.

Three years ago, they reached out and revealed they were my mother’s parents. My mother was supposed to marry someone else, but she eloped with my father for love and left her family behind.

Unbeknownst to me, when my mother was dying of cancer, she had contacted them and told them about me.

When they first asked me to take over, I was still deeply in love with Alexander and believed I could win his heart. I had refused their offer.

"Isabella! Welcome home," my grandmother’s voice called out.

She and my grandfather came outside and wrapped me in a warm embrace.

"We’re so happy you’re here," they said.

I smiled. "Thank you for having me."

My grandmother waved a hand. "Nonsense, Isabella. All of this is yours."

My grandfather nodded. "Yes, Isabella. You are now the heiress of Sterling Enterprises."

I smiled.

Because now it was time for payback.
###Chapter 6 

Rachel’s Pov

The moment I entered the magnificent Sterling mansion, the air filled with the rich aroma of fresh roses and polished mahogany.

My grandparents, Benjamin and Charlotte Sterling, guided me into the lavish living room. Their expressions were warm, yet shadowed with unease.

“Rachel, sweetheart, are you absolutely certain about this decision?” My grandmother’s tone was soft but carried weight.

“My mind is made up,” I stated without flinching. “I intend to claim what is rightfully mine. If marrying this man is the requirement, then I accept.”

Grandfather rubbed his temples, releasing a weary sigh. “We only want you to understand what you're stepping into. Sebastian… he wasn’t always this way.”

I raised an eyebrow. “What way?”

“He used to be a formidable force,” Grandfather explained. “Wealth, influence, respect—he commanded it all. But three years ago, his mother died in a tragic accident. After that, he…” He hesitated, searching for words.

Grandmother finished for him. “He lost the use of his legs… and his mental state deteriorated. He behaves like a child now, Rachel. He hardly speaks or engages. Many believe he’s shattered beyond repair.”

I leaned back, processing their words. A disabled man. A shell of his former self. A fallen titan.

“Are you implying he’s… psychologically compromised?” I asked cautiously.

“He hasn’t spoken a coherent word in years. He makes noises—shrieks and babbles like an infant,” Grandmother confessed, sharing a troubled glance with Grandfather. “This isn’t the future we envisioned for you.”

Silence hung between us. A weaker woman might have retreated. But I was not weak.

“It doesn’t matter,” I declared firmly. “If this marriage grants me control of the company, I will proceed.”

Relief washed over their faces, though concern still lingered in their eyes.

“Upon marriage, you will become the official owner of Sterling Enterprises,” Grandfather confirmed. “But we won’t rush you. You’ll meet him tomorrow.”

I gave a sharp nod. “Very well.”

That evening, I dined like royalty.

Maids served dishes with names I couldn’t pronounce. The wine flowed smoother than any I’d ever tasted.

After a long soak in the jacuzzi, I slipped into a silk nightgown and sank into the plush bed. The luxury was unfamiliar, intoxicating.

For the first time in years, I felt powerful. Invincible. Free.

A smirk touched my lips as I grabbed my phone and snapped a picture of my wine glass against the glittering city skyline.

I posted it online with the caption: Living my best life.

In less than five minutes, a notification flashed.

Alexander: Where are you?

My smirk vanished.

Pathetic. The same man who discarded me like garbage now wanted to know my whereabouts?

I deleted his comment and restricted his profile. Moments later, my screen lit up with an incoming call—Alexander, trying to reach me through social media.

I blocked him without hesitation.

That night, I slept like a queen.

The next morning, a soft knock woke me.

“Good morning, Miss Sterling,” a maid said with a slight bow. “Your breakfast is ready.”

I stretched lazily, savoring the feel of silk sheets against my skin. Overnight, my life had transformed.

“Bring it in,” I commanded.

The tray was laden with fresh fruit, fluffy pancakes, and imported tea. Each bite tasted like victory.

After breakfast, I bathed in scented oils that left my skin silken and smooth.

I dressed in a white silk blouse and high-waisted trousers—simple, yet elegant.

Downstairs, my grandparents were already waiting.

“Good morning, dear,” Grandmother greeted.

“Morning,” I replied.

Grandfather signaled the driver. “Shall we go?”

The car ride was smooth, but a knot of tension tightened in my stomach.

“Who exactly is Sebastian Crawford?” I asked.

My grandparents exchanged another hesitant glance.

“He’s Alexander’s half-brother,” Grandfather finally revealed.

My breath hitched. “Alexander’s what?”

“His mother was the mistress of Alexander’s father,” Grandmother clarified. “Sebastian was never fully accepted by the Crawfords, but he was their most gifted son… until the accident.”

I clenched my jaw. Ironic. The man I was to marry was tied to Alexander in ways I never anticipated.

The car arrived at a sprawling estate, every bit as opulent as the Sterling mansion.

A butler greeted us at the door and escorted us into an elegant sitting room.

“We’re here to see Sebastian,” Grandfather announced.

Soon, the sound of wheels rolling across marble echoed through the room.

I turned to see a man being pushed in a wheelchair by a caretaker.

Sebastian Crawford.

His dark hair was slightly unkempt, his sharp jawline dusted with stubble. He was strikingly handsome, but his eyes… they were empty, gazing vacantly into nothing.

Then, without warning, he let out a piercing shriek.

I froze.

He curled his fingers childishly, rocking gently in his wheelchair.

This… was the man I was supposed to marry?

I swallowed hard, uncertainty creeping into my resolve for the first time.

Perhaps I had been too bold.

Perhaps I had just made the worst decision of my life.
###Chapter 7

Sebastian rocked in his wheelchair, clapping with childlike glee.

His eyes sparkled with strange excitement. He made soft, incoherent sounds. His fingers curled and uncurled restlessly.

I stood completely frozen. How was I supposed to react to this?

“This is Isabella, your future wife,” Grandfather announced.

Sebastian showed no reaction.

His expression stayed utterly blank. His lips parted slightly before a small giggle escaped.

I blinked. Was this real?

Grandmother offered a tight smile. “Isabella, why don’t you spend some time with Sebastian? Get to know him.”

I wanted to refuse immediately. But arguing was pointless. “Fine,” I muttered.

“Good.” Grandfather patted my shoulder. “We’ll give you privacy.”

The nanny hesitated, then nodded. She had been gently rubbing Sebastian’s shoulders.

“Call if you need anything.” Then she left, closing the door.

Now we were alone.

I slowly sat across from him.

Sebastian kept staring at the floor. He giggled softly under his breath.

The room was too quiet. Only his strange little noises filled the space.

I cleared my throat. “Sebastian… do you understand what’s happening?”

No response.

I sighed. “I’m supposed to marry you. Did you know that?”

His gaze flickered toward me for just a second. Then he went back to staring at the wall.

I frowned. “Nothing? No thoughts? No opinions?”

Silence.

This was utterly ridiculous.

I leaned back and crossed my arms. “Well, at least one good thing is coming from this marriage.”

His fingers stopped moving.

“At least you can’t hurt me like Alexander did.”

I could have sworn his eyes twitched at Alexander’s name.

My brows furrowed. “Wait… do you actually understand me?”

Again, his expression remained completely neutral.

I narrowed my eyes. “Sebastian.”

Nothing.

I leaned forward. “Alexander,” I said again, watching his face carefully.

No reaction.

I exhaled and shook my head. “Great. Now I’m imagining things.”

I rose from my seat, brushing invisible dust from my clothes. “Well, this has been… something. But I think I’ve seen enough.”

Still, no response.

Annoyed, I turned and walked out.

The driver waited outside. He said nothing as he opened the car door.

I climbed in, my mind racing over what just happened.

The Sebastian Sterling I had heard about was a ruthless businessman. One of the best of his generation. Now he was just a broken shell of that man.

Why did it have to be him?

Back at the mansion, my grandparents waited in the study.

I didn’t hesitate. “Why him?” I demanded.

Grandfather sighed. “Sit down, Isabella.”

I shook my head. “No. I want an answer. Why must I marry an invalid?”

Grandmother’s lips pressed into a thin line. “It’s tradition.”

I scoffed. “Tradition?”

Grandfather leaned forward, clasping his hands. “Your mother was supposed to marry Alexander’s father. But she ran away. She eloped with your father instead.”

I stiffened.

Grandmother nodded. “Your mother broke a crucial alliance, Isabella. Now you’re fixing it.”

I clenched my fists. “By marrying Sebastian?”

“Yes.”

Grandfather sighed and rubbed his temple. “Even now, Sebastian’s name still holds power. The Sterlings may have abandoned him, but his bloodline remains influential.”

“And he was once great,” Grandmother added softly. “Before the accident, he achieved things most men only dream of. A business genius. A true leader.”

“Now he’s just… broken,” I said.

Grandfather exhaled. “That may be true. But he is still Sebastian Sterling. And you, Isabella, are a Blake. This is bigger than personal feelings. This is about legacy.”

I swallowed hard.

Legacy.

Days ago, I was just a woman scorned. Now I must carry my family’s name.

I straightened my posture. “Fine. I’ll do it.”

Relief washed over their faces.

“The wedding is tomorrow,” Grandfather said.

My breath hitched. “Tomorrow?”

“Yes,” Grandmother confirmed. “Best to make it official quickly.”

My heart pounded, but I forced a smile.

Tomorrow, I marry a man who doesn’t understand marriage. Tomorrow, I become Isabella Blake Sterling.

There was no turning back.
###Chapter 8

My wedding morning arrived in utter silence.

I studied my reflection while the maids put final touches on my simple white gown.

It wasn't extravagant, just a plain yet elegant dress suitable for a court wedding.

My makeup remained minimal, my hair neatly pinned back.

"Are you prepared, dear?" Charlotte's voice came from the doorway.

I drew a deep breath and nodded. "Yes."

William stepped forward, his expression firm. "After today, you become Rachel Blake Crawford. There's no going back."

I swallowed the lump in my throat. "I understand."

We proceeded to Sebastian's residence where everything had been arranged.

A judge waited in the living room upon our arrival.

The butler stood rigidly in the corner while Sebastian's nanny adjusted his posture in the wheelchair.

Sebastian sat blankly, his eyes unfocused as he made soft, childish humming sounds.

He appeared completely unaware of the proceedings.

I suppressed a sigh as I took my place beside him.

The ceremony proceeded quickly, devoid of emotion.

"Do you, Rachel Blake, take Sebastian Crawford as your husband?" the judge asked.

"I do," I stated firmly.

"And do you, Sebastian Crawford, take Rachel Blake as your wife?"

Sebastian blinked. Then he released a small giggle and clapped his hands together.

Silence fell.

Heat rushed to my face in embarrassment.

"He does," the nanny quickly interjected.

The judge glanced at Sebastian, clearly uncomfortable, before continuing.

When it came time to sign the marriage certificate, Sebastian simply stared at the document.

The butler sighed and stepped forward, taking the pen to sign on his behalf.

I clenched my jaw.

This felt utterly humiliating.

Finally, the judge handed me the marriage certificate. "Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Crawford."

It was official.

I was married...to an invalid.

After the judge departed, my grandparents turned to me.

"Starting tomorrow, you'll be introduced to the company," William stated. "You'll reside here with Sebastian from now on."

Charlotte offered a reassuring smile. "You'll excel, dear. Just maintain patience."

Then, just like that, they left.

I found myself alone with Sebastian.

I sat before him, folding my arms. "Well, husband," I muttered. "It seems we're stuck together now."

Sebastian blinked, then reached out to poke my arm.

I sighed. "You don't even comprehend what's happening, do you?"

No response came.

I shook my head and stood. "Fine. If I'm living here, I might as well make myself useful."

I turned to the nanny. "You may leave for today. I'll assume his care."

Her eyes widened. "Madam, are you certain? He can be...challenging."

"I'll manage," I stated firmly.

She hesitated, then nodded. "Very well. Call if you require assistance."

After her departure, I knelt beside Sebastian. "Let's begin simply. Can you say my name? Ra-chel."

He stared at me, tilting his head.

I sighed. "Rachel. Say it. Rachel."

Nothing.

I retrieved a book from the table and opened it. "Perhaps pictures will help?"

Sebastian reached forward-and knocked the ink bottle from the table.

Ink splattered across my dress.

I gasped. "Sebastian!"

He giggled.

"You find this amusing?" I crossed my arms. "Fine. You want to play? Let's play."

I took his face and smeared ink on his cheek.

He blinked. Then, surprisingly, he laughed.

A genuine laugh.

I paused. This marked the first normal reaction I'd witnessed from him.

Feeling encouraged, I grabbed paper and handed him a pen. "Here. Draw something."

Sebastian stared at the pen in his hand. Then, slowly, he moved it across the paper.

I leaned closer, curious.

It appeared messy, mere scribbles.

"You're quite a mess," I muttered, standing. "Come on. Let's get you cleaned up."

I wheeled him to the bathroom and ran warm water.

The butler entered as I rolled up my sleeves. "Madam, I can assist-"

"I have it," I interrupted. "It's just a bath."

The butler looked uneasy. "But-"

"Look," I sighed. "He possesses a child's mind, correct? It's not as if he comprehends anything."

The butler hesitated, then eventually nodded and departed.

I turned back to Sebastian. "Alright, let's get you in."

I gently undressed him, lifting him into the tub. He made pleased sounds as warm water touched his skin.

I laughed. "See? Not so terrible, right?"

He splashed water with his hands, giggling.

I shook my head. "Despite acting like a child, you're not unpleasant company."

Certainly better than that ungrateful Liam.

I sighed, rolling my shoulders. Ink stains remained on my skin. "Guess I need bathing too."

I reached for my dress, pulling it over my head.

Just then, Sebastian's hand suddenly reached out.

His fingers brushed over the faint scar on my shoulder-the arrow wound remnant.

I stiffened.

Then-

A husky voice, rough and demanding.

"What?"

I froze.

Had he actually...spoken?
###Chapter 9

My heart hammered against my ribs as I stared at Sebastian.

Did he just speak?

“Sebastian?” I whispered, moving closer. “What did you say?”

But he just giggled, babbling nonsense as he slapped his hands against the water.

His eyes went vacant again. Blank. Like nothing happened at all.

I sighed heavily. Expecting too much again.

Maybe his brain was too far gone. Maybe that sound was just random noise.

“Forget it,” I muttered, shaking my head.

He splashed more water my way, laughing as bubbles clung to his cheeks.

I rolled my eyes. “You’re a mess.”

Sebastian grinned, reaching for my wrist. His fingers traced the fading scar from my arrow wound. His touch was unexpectedly warm.

For a split second, his brows furrowed. Something flickered in his eyes. Something unreadable.

Then it vanished.

He giggled again, distracted by the water.

I imagined it.

I shook off the odd sensation and turned away. “Let’s get you dressed.”

I took a quick shower, washing away the ink and the tension in my shoulders.

After drying off, I changed into clean clothes and helped Sebastian out of the tub.

His body was limp as I dressed him, but he didn’t resist.

Once he was clothed, I wheeled him into the hallway.

The butler stood there, looking uneasy.

I frowned. “Is something wrong?”

He shook his head quickly. “No, Madam. I was just… concerned about you handling Master Sebastian.”

I glanced at Sebastian, who was fiddling with his shirt buttons. “We managed.”

The butler looked relieved, but his gaze lingered on Sebastian a moment too long.

Something about his expression put me on edge.

I brushed my hair back and sighed. “Take him to the garden. I’ll prepare something to eat.”

The butler hesitated. “Madam, we have staff to handle the cooking—”

“I want to do it myself,” I said firmly.

He gave a slight bow. “As you wish.”

The kitchen was quiet except for the sound of my knife against the cutting board.

I focused on chopping vegetables, letting the rhythm steady my thoughts. One slice. Two. Three.

It felt… normal.

For the first time since this forced marriage began, I could breathe.

Then my phone buzzed.

I wiped my hands and picked it up.

A Facebook message.

My stomach dropped when I saw the sender.

Sophia.

I hesitated before opening it.

Pictures flooded my screen—Alexander and Sophia’s engagement party.

Alexander stood tall and handsome in a tailored suit, his arm around Sophia’s waist. She wore an elegant dress, beaming at the camera. A perfect couple. A perfect celebration.

A message followed.

Sophia: How does it feel knowing you wasted eight years with Alexander and he never married you, but a week after you left, he’s engaged to me?

I gritted my teeth.

Of course she’d gloat.

I should have ignored it. Blocked her.

But I didn’t.

Instead, I typed a quick reply.

Rachel: Congratulations.

Then I muted her messages.

I wouldn’t block her. No. That was too easy.

I wanted her to see every success, every bit of happiness I posted. I wanted her to choke on her own jealousy.

I set my phone aside and exhaled. Focus.

I finished cooking, plated the food, and stepped outside to call Sebastian and the butler.

That’s when I heard it.

Low voices.

I froze, listening closely.

I took a slow step forward.

The butler’s deep voice was the first I recognized.

I edged closer, pressing myself against the wall.

“…can’t keep delaying this,” the butler whispered.

I took another step, trying to peek through the hedge.

Just as I moved closer, the doorbell rang.

The sound made me jump.

The voices in the garden cut off instantly.

I turned toward the entrance, my pulse racing.

I glanced back at the hedge, but saw no one.

Something wasn’t right.
###Chapter 10

The door rattled under three sharp knocks.
I tensed immediately.
No one visited at this hour unannounced.

My stomach dropped when I pulled it open.
Eleanor stood there, lips pressed thin.
William loomed beside her, cold and imposing.

My blood ran cold.
Alexander’s mother.
And his father.

Eleanor’s eyes flashed.
“You,” she spat. “What are you doing here?”

I lifted my chin.
“I live here.”

She laughed, harsh and mocking.
“You? In Sebastian’s house? Don’t be absurd.”

Footsteps approached down the hall.
The butler appeared, stern-faced.
Sebastian trailed behind, dragging his stuffed bear.

The butler’s voice cut through the tension.
“Lady Eleanor. Master William. You will address Mrs. Rachel with respect. She is the lady of this house.”

Eleanor’s face twisted.
“Lady?” She turned to William. “Is this a joke?”

The butler didn’t blink.
“It is not.”

William’s gaze swept over Sebastian, then settled on me.
Calm. Calculating.
“You married him,” he stated. “Without telling us.”

Sebastian ignored them, focused on a toy soldier.
Oblivious. Unbothered.

Eleanor smirked.
“What? Afraid Daddy wouldn’t approve?”

William almost smiled.
“Why would I disapprove?” His eyes lingered on me. “You’re a perfect match.”

My nails dug into my palms.
That was no compliment.

Eleanor’s smirk widened.
“Oh, I see. Alexander broke your heart, so you settled for a lunatic?” She gestured at Sebastian. “Pathetic.”

Rage burned through me.
I stepped in front of Sebastian, shielding him.
“Don’t speak about my husband that way.”

“Husband?” She laughed. “How long until Alexander finds out? He’ll—”

“I don’t care about Alexander.”

Eleanor’s laughter echoed. William shook his head, amused.

Enough.
I pointed to the door.
“Leave. Now.”

The butler stiffened. Eleanor’s laughter died.
“You’re throwing us out?”

“Yes. Both of you.”

I turned before she could respond.
My heart hammered.
They left with muttered insults, but I didn’t care.
No one humiliates Sebastian in his own home.

That night, I replayed their words as I tucked him into bed.
He lay still, eyes on the ceiling.
I brushed hair from his forehead.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered.

He blinked, tilting his head toward me.
Then he giggled, soft and airy.

I sighed.
“I’m sorry for what they say. How they treat you.”

He didn’t respond.
Maybe he didn’t understand.
His breathing slowed as he fell asleep, toy still clutched in his hand.

I watched him, chest aching.
Exhaustion eventually pulled me under.

I woke at midnight.
The bed was empty.
Cold.

I sat up, disoriented.
Where was he?

A faint noise came from the bathroom.
I slipped out of bed, padding toward the sound.
Pushed the door open slowly.

And froze.

Sebastian was standing.
Not sitting. Not crawling.
Standing.
Upright. Steady.

My heart stopped.
He shouldn’t be able to do that.

“Sebastian?” My voice was a whisper.

He turned his head slightly.
Glanced over his shoulder.
Eyes clear. Focused.

“Shit,” he muttered.

My breath caught.
Everything I thought I knew—shattered in an instant.
###Chapter 11

Isabella’s Pov

My lungs seized.

Sebastian stood before me—no trace of the fragile man I once believed him to be.

He stood tall. Commanding. Towering over me.

His gaze was sharp. Focused. Calculating. No confusion clouded his eyes.

Innocence had vanished. So had that empty stare.

He looked lethal.

“You… you can walk?” The words left me in a choked whisper.

Sebastian tilted his head. His eyes locked on me like a hawk sighting prey.

“And speak,” he replied, voice smooth and controlled.

My chest tightened. My mind reeled, struggling to make sense of it.

“You’re not disabled? Your mind isn’t… broken?” My voice shook. “Then why—”

He lifted a hand. “Calm down, Isabella.” His tone was firm, leaving no room for panic. “There’s an explanation.”

“An explanation?” I laughed, sharp and unsteady. “I bathed you. I undressed you—thinking you were a child!”

A slow, wicked smirk touched his lips. “I won’t lie. That day tested my control.” His eyes glinted. “I fought hard not to react.”

I went still.

He stepped closer. His voice dropped, low and teasing.

“But looking back…” He sighed, a dark amusement in his tone. “I have no idea how I held back.”

My hand flew out before I could think.

It struck his cheek with a sharp crack.

Sebastian didn’t even flinch. His smirk only deepened. His gaze turned intense.

“You lied to me,” I spat. “You watched me—”

He moved lightning fast.

His hands locked around my waist. He yanked me hard against his chest.

I gasped, struggling.

But I was trapped.

Too close.

His scent wrapped around me—clean aftershave and rich coffee.

My heart hammered. Heat flooded my veins, pooling low in my stomach.

A flutter tightened in my chest. Warmth climbed my neck.

I hated this.

I hated how my body answered his.

“Let me go,” I whispered, but the words sounded weak.

Sebastian leaned in. His lips brushed my ear. “Why?”

My breath caught.

Why was I feeling like this? I’d never seen him this way before.

He had always been helpless. Childlike.

But now…

Now I knew.

I’d been living with a fully aware, dangerous man.

And he was toying with me.

Sebastian chuckled softly. His fingers traced my spine.

“You’re being cold, Isabella.” Amusement colored his voice. “Aren’t you my wife?”

I clenched my jaw, pushing against him. He didn’t move.

His lips grazed my neck. Electricity shot through me.

Then—he bit down.

I gasped at the sharp sting. He pulled back slightly, studying the mark on my skin.

“A hickey,” he murmured, satisfied.

My legs shook. I felt weak in his arms. My own body betrayed me.

Wetness gathered between my thighs. My toes curled.

“Stop,” I murmured, but there was no force behind it.

He laughed softly. “Why? You asked me what marriage means.”

He was enjoying this. Tormenting me. He knew exactly what he was doing.

This couldn’t be happening.

This wasn’t real.

I needed to escape.

Then his voice turned icy.

“Why are you here, Isabella?”

I blinked, disoriented. “W–What?”

His grip tightened.

“What are you planning with Alexander?”

My breath caught.

Alexander?

What did he have to do with this?

Sebastian’s expression shifted. All playfulness vanished. His eyes turned deadly. Sharp.

“Enough games,” he said, tone freezing. “I know Alexander sent you. He wants to know what I’m doing. Doesn’t he?”

I stared, shocked. “What are you talking about?”

Sebastian laughed low—a sound without humor. “Don’t play innocent. We both know you’d do anything for Alexander.” His fingers brushed my jaw, then tightened. “Even sleep with another man.”

Rage blinded me.

My hand struck his cheek again.

This time, he flinched.

My whole body trembled. “How dare you?”

Sebastian turned his face back to me. His expression was unreadable.

Silence fell.

Thick. Heavy. Dangerous.

Then, he smirked.

And that terrified me more than anything.
###Chapter 12

Rachel’s Pov

I slammed the bathroom door behind me, knuckles white with rage.

My pulse hammered in my ears, skin still tingling where Sebastian had touched me.

I would not tolerate disrespect.

“This marriage was a colossal error,” I hissed, marching toward the closet. I snatched my suitcase and flung it open. “I never should have agreed.”

Sebastian’s voice sliced through the tension like a dagger.

“You’re not going anywhere.”

I froze.

His tone was icy, lethal.

“Especially now that you know my secret,” he added.

I turned slowly, gripping the suitcase handle. “You deceived me, Sebastian,” I shot back. “I don’t care about your secret. I’m finished.”

He moved closer, his dark gaze unreadable. “And where exactly will you go?” he asked, voice dangerously soft. “Back to Alexander?”

I stiffened. “Don’t.”

His jaw clenched.

“I never want to hear that name from you again,” I warned. “Alexander means nothing to me.”

Sebastian let out a cold laugh. “You expect me to believe that? After eight years with him, you just walk away and marry me?”

I held his stare, my fingers trembling faintly. “Yes,” I stated firmly. “I left him. I wanted no part of him or his family.”

Sebastian crossed his arms, skepticism written across his face. “Why?”

I drew a sharp breath, struggling to contain my emotions. “Because they destroyed me,” I said, my voice wavering. “Alexander betrayed me. His son, Liam, shot me with an arrow and left me for dead.”

Sebastian’s eyes turned stormy. “An arrow?”

I nodded, gesturing to my shoulder. “Right here.”

His expression shifted, something indecipherable flashing in his gaze.

“You married me to secure your inheritance,” he said slowly, as if connecting dots. “And to get revenge on Alexander.”

I lifted my chin. “Yes.”

A heavy silence fell between us.

Then, unexpectedly, Sebastian exhaled and stepped back. “I misread you,” he admitted.

I frowned. “What?”

His gaze softened slightly. “I thought you were just another one of Alexander’s pawns. But now I see…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “I was mistaken.”

I paused. “Is that an apology?”

Sebastian smirked, but it lacked its usual arrogance. “I suppose it is.”

I blinked, caught off guard.

Then, his expression turned grim. “I can help you.”

I narrowed my eyes. “Help me how?”

Sebastian’s voice was steady. “Get your revenge.”

A knot tightened in my throat. “Why?”

His jaw flexed. “Because I have my own reasons to despise Alexander and his entire family.”

The way he said it sent a cold shiver down my spine.

I swallowed hard. “I don’t know if I can trust you.”

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. “I won’t harm you, Rachel.”

I studied him, searching his face. For the first time, I saw something genuine beneath his arrogance—something raw, almost protective.

“I need to take control of my company tomorrow,” I said finally, breaking the silence. “That comes first.”

Sebastian nodded. “And I need to maintain my disguise.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You mean pretending to be disabled?”

His lips curved. “Yes. I expect we’ll have visitors soon.”

I scoffed. “Wonderful.”

Then I crossed my arms. “Since we now share a purpose in this marriage, I expect you to keep your distance.”

Sebastian’s smirk returned.

“That will be difficult,” he murmured, closing the space between us.

I retreated.

He chuckled, amused. “But since I’ve already claimed you,”—his eyes dropped to the mark on my neck—“I suppose I can exercise some restraint.”

I glowered at him, cheeks flushing.

A sudden knock at the door made me jump.

Sebastian turned and opened it without hesitation.

I heard a sharp intake of breath.

“Master Sebastian!” The butler’s voice trembled with shock. “Why are you—out of your wheelchair?”

I stiffened.

The butler… knew?

Sebastian leaned against the doorframe, completely unbothered. “Rachel knows now.”

I gaped at him. “Wait. He knew?”

The butler hesitated, eyes shifting between us.

Sebastian smirked. “Of course. He’s not just a butler.”

I narrowed my eyes. “Then who is he?”

Sebastian’s voice turned grave.

“My bodyguard. My assistant. And the man helping me uncover the truth.”

I frowned. “The truth about what?”

Sebastian’s expression darkened.

“The truth about whether Alexander and his family were involved in my mother’s death.”
###Chapter 13

My eyes darted between Sebastian and the butler. My thoughts spun wildly.

"This is overwhelming," I whispered, running fingers through my hair. "I can't absorb everything at once."

The butler crossed his arms and faced Sebastian. "Do you truly believe she's trustworthy?" he questioned. "She spent years with Alexander."

Sebastian's gaze remained steady. "Isabella defended me when Eleanor and William visited earlier. She has personal reasons to despise Alexander and his family."

I raised my chin defiantly. "You needn't worry about me revealing your secret," I stated firmly. "I won't."

Silence hung heavily between us.

I released an exhausted breath. "I've had an incredibly long night. I need rest. Tomorrow will be even more demanding."

Sebastian exchanged a look with the butler before nodding. "Very well. Get some sleep."

They departed, and I collapsed onto the bed. Sleep claimed me immediately.

Morning arrived with my alarm's blaring sound. I groaned and turned over—only to find Sebastian watching me with an amused expression.

He lay beside me, a playful smirk on his lips.

"Good morning, wife," he murmured, leaning in to brush a kiss against my cheek.

I pushed him away, blinking in astonishment. "It feels like I had the wildest dream," I mumbled. "I saw you walking and speaking normally."

Sebastian chuckled deeply. "It wasn't a dream," he assured. "You'll need to adjust to this new reality."

I shook my head and rose from bed. "I doubt I ever will."

After a lengthy shower, I dressed in a sophisticated black dress and heels.

Important matters awaited my attention. Today marked my official induction as heiress.

Sebastian observed my preparations, his gaze intense.

"Try not to miss me too terribly," he teased.

I rolled my eyes and grabbed my purse. "Don't let anyone catch you walking about, husband."

His laughter echoed as I left.

At corporate headquarters, my grandparents awaited my arrival.

"You're finally here," Grandpa Benjamin noted as I entered the conference room. "Are you prepared?"

I nodded confidently. "Let's begin."

The board members sat around the lengthy table, their curious eyes studying me.

Grandmother Charlotte placed a comforting hand on my shoulder before addressing them.

"This is Isabella," she announced. "The new heiress of Sterling Enterprises."

Murmurs rippled through the room. Some faces showed approval while others remained unreadable.

"Welcome," one director said with a nod.

I met their gazes unflinchingly. "I appreciate the welcome," I stated. "However, I prefer to keep my identity confidential for now."

More nods followed. No objections.

Excellent.

As the meeting concluded, my grandparents drew me aside.

"How is the marriage progressing?" Grandma Charlotte inquired gently.

I hesitated momentarily—then last night's memories flooded back. Sebastian's teasing smirk.

The mark he left on my neck. Our playful argument in the bathroom.

My fingers instinctively touched my neck as I smiled.

"It's fine," I replied. "The marriage is... progressing well."

Grandpa Benjamin raised an eyebrow. "Are you certain?"

I nodded. "Sebastian can be mischievous, but I can manage him."

Grandma Charlotte chuckled softly. "Remember we're here if you need anything."

I smiled gratefully. "I will remember."

Exiting the building, I released a deep breath. It was accomplished. I was officially the heiress.

But as I approached my car, a sleek black Ferrari pulled up before me.

My stomach clenched.

No.

Alexander and Sophia emerged.

The last people I wished to see today.

I turned sharply, determined to leave, but Sophia's voice stopped me.

"Isabella!"

I closed my eyes briefly before turning back, my expression carefully neutral.

Sophia's lips curved into an overly sweet smile.

"What brings you here?" she asked. "Seeking employment? If you need assistance, Alexander could—"

I scoffed dismissively. "Spare me the act, Sophia." My eyes shifted to Alexander. "Both of you. Drop the pretense."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Stop harassing her, Isabella."

I emitted a humorless laugh. "Harassing her?" I shook my head. "Don't be ridiculous, Alexander."

He stepped closer. "Where have you been?" he demanded. "Why haven't you returned my calls?"

I crossed my arms. "That's no concern of yours."

Alexander ran a hand through his hair, visibly frustrated. "Isabella, I have a meeting with the CEO here. If you need work, I can recommend you."

I stared at him momentarily before bursting into laughter.

Alexander frowned. "What's so amusing?"

I smirked. "You actually believe I need your help?"

He sighed. "You're as stubborn as ever."

I tilted my head. "Congratulations, by the way."

Alexander blinked. "For what?"

"Your engagement to Sophia," I said smoothly. "You'll be marrying soon. Having another child."

For a fleeting moment, guilt flashed across his features.
###Chapter 14

Rachel’s Pov

Alexander’s expression turned to stone. “Don’t make assumptions, Rachel.”

I crossed my arms tightly. “Then explain it to me, Alexander. What am I supposed to believe?”

He released an irritated breath. “You walked away, Rachel. What choice did I have? Liam adores Sophia. She treats him well. Making her his mother was the logical next step.”

I let out a bitter laugh. “I really don’t care what you do, Alexander. You don’t need to justify yourself to me.”

His phone buzzed. He glanced down and his frown deepened. “I’m late for a meeting.”

Sophia offered a sugary smile. “I’ll keep Rachel company outside.”

Alexander gave a curt nod and strode off, vanishing into the corporate building.

The second he was out of sight, Sophia’s pleasant mask shattered. A smug smirk twisted her lips.

“How does it feel, Rachel?” she taunted. “After eight whole years, he still didn’t pick you.”

I rolled my eyes. “Save it, Sophia. It means nothing to me.”

She thrust out her left hand, a massive diamond glittering under the sun. “Alexander bought me the most exclusive ring. He’s obsessed with me. He picked me.”

I shrugged. “Congratulations. I’m over it.”

I moved to leave, but her fingers closed like a vise around my wrist. “I’m not finished.”

I shot her a warning look. “Let go.”

Her grip tightened painfully. “I will make sure you regret ever thinking you were good enough for Alexander.”

My control snapped. “Don’t push me, Sophia.”

She laughed mockingly. “Or what? What could you possibly do?”

I stepped closer, my voice dropping to a whisper. “Say one more word, and I will slap that smirk off your face.”

Abruptly, Sophia gasped and crumpled to the pavement.

I stared, bewildered. “What are you—”

She cradled her hand, a fresh scrape bleeding on her palm. Fake tears brimmed in her eyes. “I’m sorry, Rachel,” she whimpered loudly. “Please don’t be mad he married me and not you!”

A furious voice sliced through the tension.

“Rachel!”

Alexander charged out of the building, his face flushed with rage. “What is wrong with you?”

I frowned. “Excuse me?”

He rushed to Sophia’s side, helping her up gently. “You’re bullying her now? You know she’s pregnant!”

I went completely still.

Sophia buried her face in his chest with a theatrical sniffle.

I released a sharp breath. “I don’t have energy for this drama.” I turned on my heel and walked away without another glance.

My driver was already waiting around the corner.

“Take me home.”

The ride was silent. I leaned my head against the cool window, exhausted more than hurt.

The butler opened the door as I arrived.

Sebastian was waiting inside. His face brightened when he saw me. “You’re home.”

I nodded. “Yeah.”

His perceptive gaze scanned me. “What happened?”

I sank onto the sofa with a sigh. “My day was fine. Then I ran into Alexander and Sophia.”

Sebastian scoffed. “Naturally.”

Before I could elaborate, my phone rang.

My assistant’s name flashed on the screen.

I answered. “Yes?”

“Mrs. Rachel, I’m calling to inform you. Alexander’s company has submitted a proposal for a major deal. Approval would generate millions in revenue for them.”

My jaw tightened.

A deal? With my company?

“Reject it.” My tone left no room for argument. “I want no business dealings with Alexander’s company whatsoever.”

“Understood.”

I ended the call.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. “Alexander wants a deal with Sterling Enterprises?”

I shrugged. “His loss.”

Sebastian chuckled. “He has no idea who he’s dealing with.”

I allowed a slow smirk. “Not a clue.”

The doorbell chimed abruptly.

The butler moved to answer it.

Sebastian swiftly wheeled himself into position. In an instant, he became the fragile man the public knew—shoulders slightly slumped, hands resting limply on the arms of his chair. His eyes went vacant and naive.

A shrill voice pierced the room.

“I told you, Alexander! She’s actually married to him!”

Sophia.

I sighed deeply. “Perfect timing.”

The butler stepped back, revealing Sophia standing in the doorway with overdramatic shock plastered on her face.

Alexander stood beside her, his expression unreadable. His eyes darted between me and Sebastian.

I folded my arms. “What brings you here?”

Sophia sneered. “So it’s true. You actually married this… cripple.”

Alexander’s gaze turned icy. “Rachel. Explain this.”

I lifted a brow. “I think that’s my line.”

Sophia laughed mockingly. “You expect us to believe you’re happily married to a helpless man in a wheelchair?”

My hands balled into fists. “Choose your next words very carefully, Sophia.”

She smirked. “Don’t pretend you actually love him. Did you marry him for pity? Or for his money because you’re desperate?”
###Chapter 15

Before I could even form a response to Sophia’s irritating question, Sebastian suddenly pushed his wheelchair forward.

He let out a gleeful, childlike laugh.

“Ahhh!” he babbled, arms waving wildly as he collided directly with Sophia.

Sophia shrieked loudly as she lost her balance.

She fell backward onto the floor with a heavy thud.

“You little—” she screamed.

Sebastian clapped his hands together, laughing as though he’d just played the most amusing game. “Fun! So much fun!”

I pressed my lips together, holding back a smile.

Alexander’s eyes went wide. “Sophia!” He hurried over to help her up.

Sophia grabbed his arm dramatically, her face contorted with rage. “He’s a menace! He could have killed me!”

Sebastian continued giggling, his innocent expression never faltering.

Sophia turned toward me, her finger shaking as she pointed. “Isabella, how could you possibly marry someone like that?”

Alexander’s jaw tightened, frustration burning in his gaze.

Before I could react, he took a step toward Sebastian, his hand rising.

I instantly moved in front of Sebastian. “Don’t you dare.” My voice was sharp, full of warning.

Alexander froze. “Isabella, move.”

I stood my ground. “Why? Because he accidentally bumped into your precious Sophia? Funny—you didn’t hit Liam when he shot me with his arrow.”

Alexander’s face darkened, but he lowered his hand.

“Take him away,” he snapped at the butler.

The butler glanced at me uncertainly before wheeling Sebastian back toward his room.

Alexander let out a sharp breath and turned to me. “We need to talk. Alone.”

I crossed my arms. “I have nothing to say to you.”

He ignored me and walked outside, clearly expecting me to follow.

I sighed. I didn’t want to play his games, but I wanted this over with.

I stepped outside, arms still tightly folded. “Talk.”

Alexander took a deep breath, studying me. “Why, Isabella? Why him?”

I raised a brow. “Why do you care?”

His jaw clenched. “Sebastian can’t give you what you want.”

I scoffed. “And what exactly is it that I want?”

He moved closer, voice dropping. “I know you. You crave love. Passion. Stability. Do you really think Sebastian understands any of that?”

I rolled my eyes. “That’s none of your business, Alexander.”

He smirked. “I’m sure he can’t even satisfy you in bed.”

I stiffened.

Alexander chuckled darkly. “Oh? Did I hit a nerve?”

Disgusted, I turned to leave. “We’re done here.”

But before I could take another step, he grabbed my wrist and spun me around, pinning me against the cold brick wall.

“Alexander!” I gasped.

His eyes dropped to my neck.

His expression twisted into something dark.

“Isabella,” he murmured, fingers tracing over my skin. “A hickey?”

I swallowed hard.

Alexander’s face hardened, his grip tightening. “You married Sebastian, but you’re sleeping around like some cheap whore?”

I tried to pull away. “Let me go.”

He leaned in, his breath hot against my ear. “If you want to be a whore, why not be mine?”

My stomach turned.

He smirked. “I’ll take care of you. No one will bully you. You’ll spread your legs only for me.”

My hand flew across his face. Slap!

His head jerked to the side. For a moment, he didn’t move.

Then he turned back to me, jaw tight.

“You dare hit me?” he seethed.

I glared. “Don’t ever speak to me like that again.”

Alexander’s eyes darkened. “You really have no self-respect, do you?” His grip on my wrist tightened. “Married, yet sleeping with someone else. Is that how low you’ve sunk?”

I struggled, but he was stronger. His hand moved to my waist, pressing me harder against the wall.

“Alexander, stop!” I pushed against his chest.

He didn’t listen. His face moved closer.

Panic surged through me.

“Alexander, stop!”

Suddenly, a hand yanked him back.

“Enough.”

Alexander stumbled backward, breathing heavily.

I looked up and saw the butler standing between us, his expression furious.

“You’ve overstayed your welcome,” the butler said firmly.

Alexander wiped his mouth, his eyes flicking back to me.

“Isabella—”

Slap!

I hit him again.

And again.

Once more, harder.

Alexander’s cheek was red, his face a mix of shock and rage.

I spat at his feet. “I would rather die than be your mistress.”

His fists clenched.

“You will regret this,” he hissed.

I stepped closer, my voice icy. “No. You will.”

Alexander’s eyes burned into mine, but I didn’t flinch.

He didn’t move at first. Then, with one last look, he turned and stormed off.

I didn’t move until I heard their car drive away.

Then my knees weakened.

I wrapped my arms around myself, trembling.

The butler placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. “Are you alright, Madam?”

I nodded stiffly. “I’m fine.”

I turned and walked straight to my bedroom.

The moment I shut the door, I let out a shaky breath.

I hugged myself again, trying to shake off the disgust clinging to my skin.

Then, warmth surrounded me.

Strong arms wrapped around me from behind.

I didn’t have to turn to know who it was.

Sebastian.

His familiar scent enveloped me, steady and comforting.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered against my shoulder. “I should have been there.”

I swallowed hard.

His arms tightened around me. “I promise you, Alexander will regret what he did today.”

I didn’t respond.

He turned me around gently, cupping my face. “Come,” he murmured. “Let me take care of you.”

I let him lead me into the bathroom.

He turned on the warm water, then helped me step in.

His fingers brushed my hair back as he kissed my temple.

His lips trailed lower, brushing over my neck.

I shivered when he kissed the mark Alexander had seen.

His mouth lingered there, breath hot against my skin.

My fingers gripped his shirt.

“Sebastian…”

He pulled back slightly, his eyes dark.

Then he leaned in and kissed me.

I melted into him, my hands moving to his shoulders.

Then—
###Chapter 16

The Investigation

Sebastian’s Pov

Another knock.

I gripped the edge of the sink, exhaling slowly.

Every muscle in my body was tight, humming with frustration.

Her scent still lingered on my skin, haunting me.

Damn.

I ran a hand through my damp hair and moved toward the door, adjusting my pants as I walked.

My body still hummed with the memory of her—the softness of her skin, the way she yielded against me, the taste of her mouth.

I cursed under my breath. I needed to focus.

I pulled the door open, my glare landing on my butler.

“What?” I snapped, my patience gone.

He cleared his throat, shifting slightly under my dark mood.

“Alexander has left, sir. I thought you’d want an update on the investigation. The private investigator is waiting in your study.”

I let out a sharp breath and nodded. “Fine.”

As I followed him down the hall, my mind was chaos.

All I could think about was Rachel—how she felt in my arms, the way her lips parted just before I kissed her. The dark desire in her eyes.

I clenched my fists.

Then the image of Alexander grabbing her surfaced, and my lust twisted into rage.

That bastard dared to lay hands on what’s mine. He hurt her.

The fury in my chest cooled the heat in my veins.

By the time I entered my study, I was ready for blood.

My PI stood as I entered, a thick folder in his hands.

“What did you find?” I asked, not bothering to sit.

He didn’t waste time.

“Several large transactions were made to a Swiss offshore account just days before your mother’s accident,” he said, placing the file on my desk. “It took some time, but I traced the account.”

I flipped it open, scanning the documents. My eyes locked on a name.

“This is the account owner?”

“Yes. A young man. Early twenties.”

I frowned. “How does a kid get access to that kind of money?”

“My guess? It wasn’t his to begin with,” the PI said. “The account was likely set up under his name as a cover. We’ll know more after we speak with him.”

I leaned against the desk, thinking.

Three years ago. My mother’s accident.

I shut the file. “Where is he now?”

“My men have him. I assumed you’d want to handle this personally.”

A slow smirk touched my lips. “Good.”

The PI nodded and left. My butler stepped forward. “What about Alexander?” he asked, his voice calm, but I heard the tension underneath.

I exhaled slowly, flexing my fingers. “I want to break every bone he used to touch my woman.”

My butler stiffened. “Rachel? Your woman?”

His tone was careful, but the question was clear.

I dragged a hand over my face. “She’s driving me out of my mind.”

He was silent for a moment. “You need to stay focused, sir. Distractions are dangerous.”

“I know,” I muttered, pushing off the desk. “That’s why we need to move faster. I’m done pretending.”

Before he could reply, my phone buzzed.

My PI.

“We have the boy. You should come now.”

I didn’t hesitate. “On my way.”

I turned to my butler. “With me.”

We took the hidden passage, avoiding the main halls. The air grew colder as we descended underground.

I had a secure area here—soundproof, no cameras. Where secrets stayed buried.

When we entered, I saw him.

The boy sat bound to a chair, eyes darting around the dim room. Younger than I expected. Early twenties, scared eyes. He swallowed hard when he saw me.

I stepped closer, my face blank.

“What happened three years ago?” I asked coldly. “And why is there a fortune in your account?”

He hesitated, fingers twitching. “I—I don’t know,” he stammered.

I tilted my head. “Wrong answer.”

He swallowed. “I swear! My father gave me the account. He said it was a trust fund.”

I narrowed my eyes. “Your father?”

He nodded quickly. “Yes. He told me about it before he went to prison. Said the money was for me. I never questioned it.”

I exchanged a look with my butler.

“What is your father in prison for?” I asked.

The boy’s shoulders tensed. “A car crash.” His voice was barely a whisper.

Something cold slid down my spine.

A car crash. Three years ago.

My mother’s accident.

I took a slow step forward, watching him closely. “Tell me everything.”

His hands shook. “I don’t know much. My father said the account was to take care of me.”

I inhaled sharply.

I turned to my butler. “Make arrangements. We’re visiting his father.”
###Chapter 17

I emerged from the underground chamber with a heavy mind.

My butler remained behind to complete the arrangements for our next phase while I returned to my study.

Everything was progressing according to plan, yet it still felt insufficient. I required more. I needed the complete truth.

I sighed, massaging the back of my neck as I approached my bedroom.

Rachel.

I desired to see her.

When I entered, she sat on the bed, her fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of the blanket.

She glanced up the instant I stepped inside, our eyes locking. A soft blush colored her cheeks before she quickly averted her gaze.

Interesting.

"You're awake," I stated, moving closer.

She nodded. "I couldn't sleep."

I settled on the edge of the bed, observing her intently. "I need to leave briefly. But I'll return soon."

She hesitated before nodding. "Alright."

I studied her expression, searching for any indication of unease. "Will you be all right?"

She looked up, meeting my gaze directly. "Yes."

She was lying.

I detected it in the slight fidgeting of her fingers, in the way her lips pressed together as if restraining words. But I didn't press further.

"Be careful," she murmured softly.

I stood, resisting the unusual impulse to touch her cheek. "We'll talk when I return."

She blinked, appearing slightly surprised. Before she could respond, I turned and exited.

The drive proceeded in silence. My butler sat beside me in the vehicle, his expression as unreadable as ever.

"We've secured the prisoner," he finally announced. "He awaits your arrival."

I acknowledged with a nod.

We reached the secluded location—a warehouse on the city's outskirts. Isolated and perfect for such meetings.

Upon entering, I found the man seated in the room's center, restrained to a chair.

He appeared older than his photographs indicated. Years of imprisonment had taken their toll—his face gaunt, hair streaked with gray.

His eyes widened immediately upon seeing me.

"You," he whispered, disbelief flashing across his features. "You're supposed to be dead."

I crossed my arms. "Clearly, I'm not."

He released a bitter laugh, shaking his head. "Now I understand why I've been rotting in that hellhole for three years."

I stepped closer. "Explain yourself."

His jaw tightened, the amusement vanishing from his expression. He sealed his lips, refusing to speak further.

I exhaled sharply. "Very well."

I signaled my men. Within moments, they placed a photograph before him.

His son.

Still restrained.

His face paled. "No... Don't harm him." His voice cracked with desperation. "He knows nothing. Please."

"Then speak." My voice remained icy.

He swallowed hard, his eyes darting between me and the photograph.

"Three years ago," he began shakily, "someone contacted me. Instructed me to crash into a specific vehicle. Promised substantial payment."

My heart hammered against my ribs. "Continue."

"I—I was promised significant money and early release after one year. But there was one condition."

I already anticipated his words, yet hearing them chilled my blood.

"There couldn't be any survivors."

I clenched my fists. My mother and I.

"Who contacted you?" I demanded.

He shook his head. "I never saw their faces. But I know it was a man and a woman. They gave instructions on making it appear accidental. Afterward, I never heard from them again."

A man and a woman.

I turned away, controlling my breathing with measured effort.

"Do you understand what you did?" My voice remained deceptively calm. "The person in that vehicle was my mother."

His eyes widened in horror. "I—I didn't know—"

"Enough," I snapped. "You'll rot in prison for life. Nothing will change that."

He began pleading, his voice breaking. "Please. My son—"

I didn't remain to hear the rest.

I stormed out, rage boiling within me.

My investigator approached me. "We'll track this. There must be a connection between this man and Alexander's family."

I nodded. "Find it."

Back at my estate, I issued a simple command: "Send the boy home."

I no longer needed him. His father had talked, and he was never part of my revenge. Later that evening, my butler entered my study, his expression unreadable.

"It's done," he reported. "We've anonymously acquired the majority shares in Alexander's company."

I leaned back in my chair, nodding.

"All shareholders have sold their shares to us without Alexander's knowledge. Only three remain."

A slow smirk touched my lips. "Excellent work."

I stood, stretching slightly. I needed rest. Or rather, I needed to see Rachel again. When I entered the bedroom, she was curled on the bed, reading.

She looked up at my entrance.

I sat on the bed's edge, watching her. "I couldn't stop thinking about you all day." Rachel's eyes widened slightly.
###Chapter 18

My heart hammered against my ribs as I stared at Sebastian.

Did he actually just say that?

Ever since he walked out, I couldn't erase the memory of our kiss—the pressure of his mouth on mine, the heat of his palms against my skin.

Hearing him admit he felt the same overwhelming pull... it left me breathless.

"Rachel," Sebastian murmured, his voice low and intimate. "I know we have an arrangement, but these feelings are real."

I swallowed hard.

"This isn't just about convenience anymore," he continued. "I want you. For real. But I won't push you. Your terms. Your rules."

My lips parted to respond, but instinct took over.

I seized his face and crushed my mouth to his.

Sebastian froze for a heartbeat before responding, his arms wrapping around me.

His kiss held a raw desperation that made my knees weak.

When I finally broke away, my cheeks burned.

"I feel it too," I whispered.

Sebastian's eyes darkened, a slow smile curving his lips before he kissed me again, deeper this time.

One moment blurred into the next until we were tangled together, consumed by a night of fierce passion.

Morning light poured through the curtains as I stirred, feeling unfamiliar warmth beside me.

I opened my eyes to find Sebastian sitting next to me, holding a breakfast tray.

"Good morning, Mrs. Sterling," he said with a wicked grin.

I blinked in surprise. "You cooked?"

"Naturally." He settled the tray across my lap. "You'll need your strength."

I flushed, memories of last night flooding back.

I picked up a piece of toast and took a bite, trying to ignore his intense gaze.

The moment I swallowed, he leaned in and captured my lips in a soft kiss.

"You're distracting me," I mumbled.

"That's the idea," he murmured against my skin.

Before I could protest, he scooped me into his arms and carried me to the bathroom.

Steam enveloped us as warm water cascaded down—though we both knew washing wasn't the real purpose.

His lips trailed down my neck, marking me with possessive kisses until we ended up making love against the shower wall.

By the time we emerged, dressed and refreshed, my entire body hummed with satisfaction. I couldn't stop smiling.

Sebastian gave me a knowing look. "You're radiant."

I rolled my eyes. "Don't get cocky."

We descended the stairs where the butler approached with an envelope.

"A message for you, sir," he said, handing it to Sebastian.

Sebastian scanned the contents and let out a dark chuckle.

"What is it?" I asked.

"An invitation to William and Eleanor's annual ball."

I immediately frowned. "I don't want to go."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Why not?"

"You know why," I muttered. "They'll use it as another chance to humiliate us."

Sebastian stepped closer, tilting my chin up. "No one will humiliate you, Rachel. Not while I'm with you."

I hesitated.

"Trust me," he said.

"Fine," I sighed. "But I need a dress."

Sebastian smirked. "Go shopping. Buy anything you want."

Hours later, I stood in the city's most exclusive boutique, selecting the perfect gown for the ball.

I was examining a deep crimson dress when a familiar mocking voice cut through the air.

"Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in."

I turned to find Eleanor and Sophia standing nearby, arms crossed.

Eleanor smirked. "Shopping for the party?"

I remained silent.

She glanced at the dresses I held. "Need financial assistance? I'd be happy to help."

Sophia laughed. "You should stick to something affordable, Rachel. Wouldn't want you to overextend yourself."

I forced a tight smile. "I'm perfectly capable, thank you."

Eleanor's eyes glinted with malice as she stepped closer. "I'm particularly excited for this year's ball. Perfect opportunity to celebrate with my future daughter-in-law."

She patted Sophia's arm affectionately. "Isn't that right, dear?"

Sophia beamed. "Of course, Mother."

Their pathetic attempt at jealousy almost made me laugh.

"You two adore playing make-believe," I said, shaking my head.

Eleanor's smile vanished. "Excuse me?"

"Calling her your daughter-in-law when there's not even a wedding date." I gave Sophia a pointed look.

Eleanor scoffed. "It's only a matter of time."

"Good luck with that," I said, turning away.

But Eleanor wasn't finished. Her voice turned sharp. "You think you're so superior because you married Sebastian."

She smirked. "He's nothing but a disgrace. A bastard who will never measure up—"

"Enough," I warned.

But she continued. "Everyone knows he's worthless, Rachel."

My hands clenched into fists.

"You should abandon him while you still can," she hissed.

That was the final straw.

Before I could stop myself, my palm connected with her cheek.

The slap echoed through the boutique.

Eleanor gasped, clutching her face. "How dare—"

Sophia grabbed my arm. "You bitch—"

I yanked free. "I warned her."

Eleanor's eyes burned with rage. "You'll pay for this."

She lunged at me.

Sophia joined in, grabbing my hair while Eleanor scratched at my arms.

I fought back, shoving Eleanor away and elbowing Sophia in the ribs. Clothes flew from racks as we stumbled through the store, drawing stares from other shoppers.

"Stop this immediately!" a deep voice boomed.

Alexander.

He pulled Eleanor and Sophia away from me. "What the hell is happening?"

Before anyone could respond, a man nearby remarked loudly, "Why is Mrs. Sterling, the heiress of Sterling Enterprises, brawling in a boutique?"

Silence fell over the store as every eye turned toward me.
###Chapter 19

The words echoed in my mind, refusing to fade.

Rachel, the heiress of Sterling Enterprises?

When those words were spoken at the luxury boutique, Victoria and Eleanor burst into mocking laughter.

Eleanor crossed her arms, her smirk dripping with contempt.

"Rachel? The Sterling Enterprises heiress? Don't make me laugh! That's impossible."

I studied her carefully. This wasn't the Eleanor I remembered.

Her tone carried a vicious edge, something cruel and calculating.

Rachel remained completely composed. She didn't engage, didn't respond to their taunts.

She simply collected her shopping bags and walked away with silent dignity.

My jaw tightened. Nothing about this situation made sense.

"Let's go," I commanded, leading my mother and Eleanor back to the penthouse.

That evening, I sat alone in my study, swirling the amber liquid in my glass.

The day's events replayed in my mind.

Who was that man at the boutique? Why did he call Rachel the heiress? Why did Eleanor and Victoria react so violently?

A gentle knock interrupted my thoughts. Liam stood at the doorway, small hands gripping the frame.

"Papa..." His voice sounded small and uncertain.

"What is it, son?" I set the glass down carefully.

He stepped inside, hesitating. Then, in the quietest voice, he asked, "Is Rachel going to die?"

My entire body went rigid.

"What did you just say?" My voice came out harsher than intended.

Liam looked up with innocent eyes. "Is Rachel going to die?"

I took a slow, measured breath. "Why would you ask that?"

"Because Aunt Sophia said if Rachel dies, my mama can go to heaven."

The air left my lungs. My chest constricted as his words sank in.

"Sophia told you that?" I asked, my voice dangerously calm.

Liam nodded. "She also said Rachel killed my mama."

I shot up from my chair, heart pounding. "What else did she tell you?"

"She told me to hurt Rachel's cat... as punishment for killing my mama." His voice trembled.

A sick feeling settled in my stomach.

Liam shifted nervously. "She also said Rachel caused my mama's death and that I needed to make things right."

I froze completely. "What do you mean?"

Liam's lips quivered. "Aunt Sophia told me to shoot the arrow at Rachel... that day she was leaving."

The room seemed to tilt.

I clenched my fists, fighting to control my fury. "Sophia instructed you to do that?"

He nodded slowly.

I didn't hesitate. I stormed from my study, blood boiling with rage.

I found Sophia in the living room, casually flipping through a fashion magazine.

"Sophia!" My voice thundered through the space.

She looked up, startled. "Alexander, what's wrong?"

I strode toward her. "Did you tell Liam that Rachel killed his mother? Did you tell him to harm her cat? To shoot her with an arrow?"

Her eyes widened before filling with tears. "Alexander... it's not what you think."

"Then explain it to me." My voice dropped to a dangerous low.

She sniffled, dabbing at her eyes. "Liam is just a child. He misunderstood everything. I only told him stories to help him process his mother's loss. I never meant for him to take it literally."

I stared at her, hands shaking with anger. "You expect me to believe that? You poisoned his mind against Rachel!"

Tears streamed down her face. "Alexander, please... if you love Rachel, and want to be with her, I won't interfere. I just want your happiness."

I ran a frustrated hand through my hair. "I don't need your permission, Sophia. I need the truth."

Before she could respond, my phone rang. I glanced at the screen–my assistant.

I answered sharply. "What is it?"

"Sir, you need to come to the office immediately. There's an emergency board meeting happening right now."

I frowned. "A board meeting? Without me?"

The assistant hesitated. "Yes, sir. We assumed you were informed. The board called for a vote."

Ice ran through my veins. "A vote on what?"

There was a pause. "On your position as CEO."

I nearly dropped my phone.

"I'm on my way," I said before ending the call.

I grabbed my coat and stormed out.

The moment I entered the boardroom, all conversation ceased.

I didn't bother taking a seat.

"Would someone care to explain why this meeting was held without me?"

The chairman cleared his throat. "Alexander, we assumed you were aware."

I clenched my jaw. "Aware of what?"

One of the board members shifted uncomfortably. "You are no longer the majority shareholder, Alexander. You have been removed as CEO."

The words hit like a physical blow.

I let out a cold laugh. "This is my company. You can't simply remove me."

The chairman sighed. "Alexander, you sold shares. Someone else acquired them. It was completely legal."

My patience shattered. "Who bought them?"

No one answered.

I took a deep breath. "I have a pending transaction with Sterling Enterprises. If you think you can push me out, you're mistaken."

Before I could continue, the door opened.

All heads turned.

Sebastian was wheeled into the room by his attendant. Beside him stood Rachel, her expression unreadable.

My stomach dropped.

I frowned, eyes narrowing. "What the hell are you two doing here?"
###Chapter 20

I slammed the front door, my stilettos striking the marble floor like gunshots. Rage pulsed through my veins. Sebastian, reclining in his wheelchair, looked up with an amused grin. “I’m guessing you saw Alexander and his entourage.”

I exhaled sharply. “That’s putting it mildly.”

He took a slow sip of his whiskey. “I’ve arranged a little surprise for Alexander. We’re paying a visit to his office.”

A slow, dangerous smile curved my lips. “Now that’s an idea I can get behind.”

Which is how I ended up outside Alexander’s boardroom, Sebastian seated beside me, his butler standing silently behind us.

My heart hammered against my ribs, but my face remained a mask of cool indifference.

Sebastian, ever the performer, played with his cufflinks like a bored toddler.

I shoved the heavy doors open. Every board member turned, confusion written on their faces. My eyes locked on Alexander.

He sat at the head of the table, his jaw clenching the moment he saw me.

“What the hell are you doing here?” he snarled.

I strode forward, the click of my heels the only sound in the tense silence. “Just wrapping up some unfinished business.”

I dropped a thick stack of documents on the table in front of him. His eyes scanned the top page, and understanding dawned. “The Sterling Enterprises merger…”

I gave a cold smile. “The one you were desperate to sign.”

Before his fingers could touch the papers, I snatched them up and tore them in two.

I ripped them again. And again. Shredded pieces fluttered down onto the polished wood like confetti.

Alexander shot to his feet. “Isabella, have you lost your mind?!”

I brushed my hands together. “Consider the deal terminated. I don’t do business with traitors.”

A deafening silence swallowed the room. Alexander’s face contorted in sheer disbelief.

“You—” He choked on the word, his brain finally connecting the dots. “You’re the Sterling heiress?”

I tilted my head, a mocking smile on my lips. “Took you long enough.”

He looked utterly pale. “Why… Why keep it from me?”

A bitter laugh escaped me. “Oh, you mean between the public humiliations, the betrayal, and letting your darling Sophia turn your son against me?” I leaned in close, my voice dropping to a venomous whisper. “You were never worthy of knowing the truth.”

His fists clenched at his sides. “We can discuss this privately.”

My smirk was icy. “There’s nothing to discuss.”

I turned to address the stunned board members.

“Let me make one thing perfectly clear—I now own every single one of Alexander’s shares.”

Shocked gasps echoed around the table. Alexander’s head whipped toward me. “Impossible!”

I smiled sweetly. “Oh, it’s very possible. And I didn’t buy them for myself.” I placed a possessive hand on Sebastian’s shoulder. “I bought them for my husband.”

Alexander’s expression darkened. “What?”

I gestured toward Sebastian. “Meet the new CEO of your company.”

Rage exploded across Alexander’s face. “You’re choosing this pathetic, broken man over me?” He let out a derisive scoff. “Sebastian can’t run this company. He’s a child.”

I crossed my arms, unwavering. “We’ll see about that.”

His eyes burned with fury. “I will get my company back.”

I snapped my fingers. The security guards at the door immediately stepped forward. “Escort Mr. Alexander out.”

His hateful glare seared into me as the guards seized his arms. “This isn’t over, Isabella.”

I gave him a mocking wink. “I’m counting on it.”

The moment the doors closed behind him, the board members swiveled toward me.

“Welcome to the company, Mrs. Blake,” one of them finally managed.

Sebastian giggled, the perfect picture of innocence. “Do I get a big office with lots of toys?”

The board laughed nervously, unsure how to respond. I played along, patting his head. “Of course, darling. Anything you want.”

Back at the estate, I poured a generous glass of red wine, swaying to the soft jazz filling the room.

Sebastian leaned against the bar, watching me with dark amusement. “Enjoying the victory?”

I took a long sip, savoring the rich flavor. “You should have seen his face.”

He chuckled low in his throat. “Oh, don’t worry. The real shock is still coming.”

I raised a curious eyebrow. “What do you mean?”

He merely offered a cryptic smirk. “You’ll see.”

That night, we celebrated fiercely, passionately, completely consumed by each other.

Surprised?!

The following evening, I arrived at the grand ball alone, draped in a daring crimson gown.

Whispers followed my entrance. Sophia and Eleanor immediately descended.

“Where’s your crippled husband?” Eleanor sneered.

Sophia smirked. “Did he finally realize he couldn’t handle a real woman?”

Even Liam, standing beside Alexander, glared with pure hatred.

I took a steadying breath. “Stay away from me.”

Before I could move, Alexander grabbed my wrist, yanking me away from the crowd.

He dragged me into the secluded garden, his grip like iron.

“Give me back my company,” he demanded.

I ripped my arm free. “Never.”

He growled, stepping closer. “Why are you doing this, Isabella? I know you still love me.”

I let out a cold, hollow laugh. “You know nothing. You’re utterly delusional.”

His gaze dropped, darkening as it traveled over my exposed collarbone.

“You’re trying to replace me with other men?” His fingers reached out, skimming my skin. “I can pleasure you better than anyone.”

I slapped his hand away, disgust rolling through me. “You sicken me.”

I turned to leave, but Alexander grabbed me roughly, spinning me back.

Before his grip could tighten, a powerful fist connected with his jaw, sending him crashing to the ground.

I gasped, whirling around.

Sebastian stood beside me. No wheelchair. No childlike act. He towered over Alexander, his eyes blazing with protective fury.

He took a menacing step forward, his voice sharp and commanding. “Don’t you ever touch my wife again.”

Alexander, sprawled on the grass, stared up in utter, stunned shock. “You. You’re—”

Sebastian’s lips curved into a victorious smirk. “Surprised?”
###Chapter 21

I laughed softly as I watched Alexander’s shocked expression.
He was sprawled on the ground, staring up at Sebastian looming over him.
Sebastian wore a look of pure triumph.

Alexander’s voice came out strained.
“How… How are you standing? How long have you been lying to everyone?”

Sebastian tilted his head with a cold smile.
“Does it really matter?” His tone was cutting.
“You should be more concerned about what happens if you ever touch my wife again.”
His eyes turned dangerous.
“I won’t be so gentle next time.”

Alexander swallowed hard.
He glanced at me, then back at Sebastian as if waiting for one of us to say it was all a joke.
But it wasn’t.
Sebastian wasn’t finished.
He bent down slightly, his voice dropping so only Alexander could hear.

“You thought you were in control, didn’t you? That you could manipulate everyone.
But you made one critical error, Alexander.”
Sebastian stood tall again, smoothing his jacket sleeves.
“You underestimated me.”

Alexander’s hands balled into fists, frustration twisting his features.

I felt Sebastian’s arm wrap firmly around my waist as he turned me away.
He guided me back inside.

My heart raced with excitement, but I couldn’t hold back a grin.
“So that was the big surprise?” I asked playfully as we walked.

Sebastian shot me a sly look and shook his head.
“No, darling,” he murmured. “The real surprise is still coming.”

A thrill shot through me. He had more planned.

Before I could speak, he stopped me near the entrance and turned me toward him.
His hands cupped my face, his thumb stroking my cheek gently.

“No more hiding, Isabella. From now on, I protect you. No one will ever harm you again.”

My breath hitched. He leaned in, his lips meeting mine in a slow, deep kiss.
When he pulled back, his fingers slid down to lace with mine.
“Ready?” Hand in hand, we strode toward the ballroom doors.
As we approached, an announcer’s voice echoed through the hall.

“Presenting Mr. and Mrs. Sebastian Crawford.”

The moment we stepped inside, the entire room went still.

Gasps echoed. Champagne glasses shattered on the floor.
People whispered urgently to each other.

Eleanor’s face went pale. Her eyes bulged, mouth opening and closing soundlessly.

Sophia clut her chest, her fingers twisting tightly around her pearl necklace.

William… the powerful William Russo… sat frozen in his chair, gripping the tablecloth.

His face was a mask, but I could see the rage simmering behind his eyes.

Alexander, who had stumbled in after us, looked utterly stunned.
His body was rigid, gaze locked on Sebastian as if he were seeing a ghost.

Whispers swept through the crowd.

“Is that Sebastian Crawford?”

“He can walk?”

“Have they been deceiving us all along?”

“What’s happening?”

Sebastian paid no attention to the murmurs.
His hand stayed firm on my waist as we moved through the crowd.

But we weren’t finished.

The grand doors opened once more, and silence fell again.

Two imposing figures entered.

My grandparents.

Their presence alone demanded respect.
My grandmother, elegant in a silver gown, held her head high, her expression calm.

My grandfather, in a sharp tailored suit, scanned the room with the authority of a man who built empires.

The energy in the room shifted. Their power was palpable—unshakable, undeniable.

Every guest turned to stare, eyes wide with disbelief.

William finally pushed up from his seat, palms flat on the table.

“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded, voice sharp.

My grandfather ignored him. He stepped forward, his gaze sweeping the room before landing on me.

Then, in a deep, commanding voice, he announced:

“Allow me to reintroduce my granddaughter—the true heiress of Sterling Enterprises.”

The silence that followed was absolute.

It felt like the whole world had stopped.

Then—

Crash!

A glass shattered on the marble floor.

Sophia gasped loudly. Eleanor’s eyes looked ready to pop out.
William’s grip on the table tightened, his knuckles turning white.

A slow, satisfied smile spread across my lips.

This was only the beginning.
###Chapter 22

Rachel’s Pov

Sophia’s face contorted with pure rage as she pointed a perfectly manicured finger toward me.

“This is a complete fraud! Rachel isn’t the Sterling heiress! She must have bribed or threatened these people to lie for her!”

Gasps echoed through the grand hall, whispers quickly swelling into audible disbelief.

I allowed a cold smirk to form. Watching her unravel was deeply satisfying.

My grandfather’s expression turned thunderous. He stepped forward, his voice low but ringing with authority.

“Are you accusing me of lying, Sophia?”

She faltered only for a moment before lifting her chin in defiance.

“I’m speaking the truth. This woman—” she shot me a look of utter contempt “—was a mere housewife for eight years, serving Alexander day and night. Now you want us to believe she’s the heir to the Sterling fortune?” She let out a harsh laugh. “It’s absurd.”

My grandmother moved beside her husband, arms crossed. Her eyes were glacial.

“Choose your next words carefully, Sophia. Slander carries legal weight.”

Sophia laughed bitterly. “I’m only voicing what everyone is thinking! She’s a fake!”

My grandfather’s patience vanished. “One more word against my granddaughter, and I will have you charged with defamation.”

For a heartbeat, fear flashed across Sophia’s face before anger took over again.

I chuckled softly, shaking my head. “Oh, Sophia,” I said, my tone dripping with false sweetness. “You’re just furious because tonight isn’t about you. It must be devastating to realize you’ll never be anything like me.”

Sophia’s face flushed a dark, furious red. “You don’t deserve any of this.”

I raised an eyebrow. “And yet, here I stand. As Rachel Sterling Crawford. And you? You’re still just a desperate woman clinging to the scraps of your pride.”

“You deceitful little—”

“Aunt Sophia, stop!” Liam’s young voice pierced the tension, his small face twisted in anger. “Rachel is evil, Aunt! She hurt Daddy! She lied to everyone! And now she’s bullying you!”

I turned my gaze to the boy, my expression blank. “And to think,” I murmured, “I wasted eight years of my life raising you.”

Liam’s face burned with fury. “You faked loving me!” he yelled, tiny fists clenched. “You made me believe you cared! But you never did! You’re just cruel!”

Before I could respond, a powerful voice cut through the commotion, silencing the entire room.

“What in God’s name is happening here?”

All heads turned as William Russo marched forward, his face a storm of confusion and rage. His sharp eyes swept the room, locking on me first, then shifting to Sebastian.

His brows drew together in disbelief.

“How is this possible?” William demanded, voice rising. “How is my useless son standing? Speaking clearly? And how is the woman who wasted years on Alexander suddenly some heiress?”

The crowd broke into hushed murmurs once more.

I crossed my arms, meeting his glare without backing down. “I owe you no explanations.”

William’s nostrils flared. “The hell you don’t!”

Sebastian stepped forward, his presence dominating the space. “I didn’t remain crippled like those who murdered my mother intended.”

The moment the words left his mouth, gasps exploded across the hall.

Whispers spread like wildfire.

“The accident three years ago…”

“Are they saying it wasn’t an accident?”

“Someone tried to kill Sebastian?”

William’s jaw tightened as he grasped the damage being done.

“Enough,” he snapped, voice laced with threat. “You’re tearing this family apart with these baseless accusations.”

Sebastian gave a cold, hollow laugh. “Really? I thought this family’s name was already destroyed.”

William stepped closer, his voice dropping dangerously. “You believe you can just storm in here and make a circus out of our reputation?”

I leaned in slightly, my voice a venomous whisper. “Oh, William,” I mocked. “I’m not just here to make a scene.”

His glare intensified.

I tilted my head and smiled coldly. “I’m here to ruin you.”

For the first time that evening, genuine fear flickered in William’s eyes.

Before he could reply, Sebastian’s phone buzzed loudly.

I felt him tense immediately. His grip on my hand tightened, his entire body going rigid.

I turned to him, concern knitting my brows. “Sebastian?”

His jaw clenched as he looked at the screen.

Something was very wrong.

###Chapter 23

My phone vibrated in my hand.

I read the private investigator's message, my pulse racing.

"He's found a direct link to your mother's death."

My fingers tightened around the device. My jaw clenched.

This was the breakthrough I had waited years for.

"Sebastian?" Isabella's voice cut through my thoughts. "What is it?"

I slipped the phone into my pocket, schooling my features. "We're leaving."

William stepped in front of us, blocking our path. "Leaving? I'm not finished with you." His tone dripped with the arrogance I loathed.

I met his gaze, my voice cold. "We have nothing left to discuss."

His eyes narrowed. "You crash my event, cause a scene, and now you walk away?"

I moved closer, speaking low so only he could hear. "This is war, William. Everyone involved in my mother's death will pay."

Something flickered in his eyes—anger or fear, I didn't care.

Games were over.

I took Isabella's hand and strode out of the hall. Whispers trailed us, but I ignored them.

Revenge consumed my thoughts.

At home, Isabella watched me with concern. She waited until we entered the living room.

"Sebastian, talk to me."

I exhaled slowly, running a hand over my face. "The investigator found a connection to my mother's death."

Her expression turned serious. "What connection?"

Before I could answer, the butler entered with the investigator.

The older man held a folder, his face grim.

"You got my message?" he asked.

I nodded. "Show me."

He placed the folder on the coffee table and opened it.

Inside were bank statements, transaction records, and an official report.

"The Sterling Enterprises," the investigator said, pointing. "They wired a large sum to an offshore account belonging to the man responsible for the accident three years ago."

Isabella drew a sharp breath. "So it wasn't an accident."

I stared at the documents, fury burning inside me.

The Sterling family had blood on their hands.

"This is enough to ruin them," the investigator continued. "Once this goes public, they can't hide."

I turned to the butler. "Release it. Everywhere."

The butler nodded and left immediately.

Isabella studied me. "What's your plan now?"

I leaned back on the couch, fists clenched. "We wait. With this evidence public, they'll panic and expose themselves."

A slight smile touched her lips. "You handled William well today. No one intimidated you."

I looked at her, my expression softening. "I told you I'm done being weak."

She reached out, touching my hand. "You'll find who killed your mother, Sebastian. They'll regret crossing you."

A smirk formed on my lips. "What about you? What's your plan for Alexander and his family?"

Her eyes darkened with amusement. "Don't you see? Your pain for them benefits me too."

I chuckled, pulling her closer. "I like how you think."

She smiled, and I kissed her.

For a moment, nothing else existed. Just us, bound by revenge and justice.

Then her phone rang.

She pulled back, frowning as she checked the screen.

Her hand trembled slightly as she answered.

"Hello?"

Silence.

Then pure fear washed over her face.

"Sebastian?" I watched her closely, my chest tightening.

She swallowed hard, taking a shaky breath. "I have to go."

I stood immediately. "Go where? Who was that?"

Tears filled her eyes as she stared at me.

Her phone clattered to the floor, shattering.

She grabbed my hand, her voice breaking. "We have to go, Sebastian. It's my... my grandparents."
###Chapter 24

Isabella’s POV

My vision swam with tears as I dragged Sebastian from the mansion.

He attempted to halt my frantic movements, his voice low with worry, but words failed me completely.

Pure terror seized my entire being, my heart hammering violently against my ribs.

I barely choked out directions to the driver, demanding he take us to the hospital immediately, before collapsing into sobs, my face hidden in my hands.

“Isabella, please, speak to me,” Sebastian urged, his tone thick with anxiety.

I drew a ragged, unsteady breath. “It’s my grandparents,” I finally managed to gasp out. “The hospital called. There was an accident.”

Sebastian went rigid next to me, his features softening with immediate empathy. “I’m so sorry,” he murmured softly. “We’ll be there as fast as possible.”

The journey felt endless, each ticking second amplifying my sheer dread.

My phone felt heavy in my trembling hands, every moment spent waiting for another update, praying it wouldn’t bring devastation.

Sebastian never let go of my hand, his grip firm and steady throughout the entire agonizing ride.

The car had barely rolled to a stop at the hospital entrance before I flung the door open, sprinting inside. Sebastian was right on my heels.

“My grandparents,” I panted to the receptionist, my voice strained. “Benjamin and Charlotte Sterling. Where are they?”

The nurse’s expression turned gentle, sympathetic. “They’re currently in surgery. The accident resulted in some internal injuries, but our doctors are doing absolutely everything they can.”

A choked cry escaped me, my legs buckling beneath the weight of the news. Sebastian’s arms shot out, catching me before I hit the floor.

“They’re fighters, Isabella,” he whispered firmly into my hair. “They will get through this.”

I clung to him desperately, my tears staining his shirt. “I can’t lose them, Sebastian. They’re all I have left.”

His embrace tightened, his hand drawing slow, calming circles on my back. “You won’t lose them. Just hold onto that hope.”

The wait outside the surgical wing stretched for what felt like an eternity.

Dark, terrifying thoughts swirled in my mind, but Sebastian remained an unwavering anchor beside me.

He continuously murmured reassurances, keeping me grounded whenever the panic threatened to pull me under.

Finally, the doors to the operating theater swung open. A surgeon emerged, removing his mask.

I leapt to my feet.

“Mrs. Sterling?” he asked.

“Yes,” I breathed out, my heart in my throat. “How are they?”

He offered a small, tired smile. “They pulled through the surgery. They’re stable now.”

A powerful wave of relief washed over me, and I released a shaky exhale. “Can I see them?”

The doctor nodded. “They’ve been moved to a private room. Right this way.”

I nearly ran down the corridor, Sebastian matching my frantic pace step for step.

The sight that greeted me in the room brought fresh tears to my eyes.

My grandparents lay in their hospital beds, looking weary and bruised, but blessedly alive. “Isabella,” my grandmother said weakly, a soft smile touching her lips. “You came.”

I rushed to her bedside, grasping her hand tightly. “Of course I came! You terrified me!”

She gave a faint chuckle. “It was just a little accident, sweetheart. Nothing serious.”

Tears tracked down my cheeks. “It matters to me. I was so scared.”

My grandfather reached for my other hand. “We’re alright, Isabella. No more tears.”

But I couldn’t stop. Seeing them like this, bandaged and vulnerable, made my heart ache fiercely.

Sebastian cleared his throat gently, stepping closer. “I’m relieved to see you’re both okay.”

My grandmother smiled warmly at him. “Sebastian, dear. You’re walking? Why didn’t Isabella tell us?”

I opened my mouth to explain, but Sebastian spoke first. “I should be the one to explain.”

He took a deep breath, his expression turning grim. “Three years ago, I was in the accident that killed my mother. I should have died that day, too. But I survived–just barely.” My grandparents’ faces grew solemn.

Sebastian continued, “The injuries left me paralyzed. My doctors said I would never walk again. My cognitive functions were impaired. I… wasn’t myself for a very long time.”

My grandmother squeezed his hand. “Oh, my dear boy…”

“It took a full year before I began any real recovery,” Sebastian admitted. “And once I did, I knew I had to keep pretending.”

“Pretending?” my grandfather echoed, confused.

Sebastian’s eyes turned dark and serious. “Whoever murdered my mother intended for me to die too. If they discovered I had recovered, they would have finished the job. So, I maintained the act while I secretly hunted for the truth.”

My grandparents exchanged a look of deep concern before turning back to him with profound sympathy. “We’re so sorry, Sebastian,” my grandmother said gently. “You’ve carried this terrible burden all alone for so long.”

Sebastian offered a small smile. “Not anymore.” His gaze shifted to me, and my heart constricted.

I reached for his hand, lacing our fingers together. “We’ll find the truth together. I promise.”

The next morning, after the doctors confirmed my grandparents were stable enough for discharge, I headed to the billing office to settle the expenses while Sebastian arranged their transportation home.

As I passed a doctor’s private office, I heard raised voices.

I hadn’t meant to eavesdrop, but one voice instantly froze me in my tracks.

Sophia.

My heart slammed against my ribs. I edged closer, pressing myself flat against the wall just outside the door.

“If you don’t give me something to induce bleeding, I will ruin you. I’ll destroy your family,” she hissed, her voice venomous.

My eyes widened in sheer shock.

A male voice–undoubtedly the doctor–replied, sounding nervous and apprehensive. “Miss, this is extremely dangerous. You’re not pregnant. Taking medication like that could cause you serious harm.”

Not pregnant?

My breath caught in my throat. Sophia had been parading her supposed pregnancy for weeks, acting as if she carried Alexander’s heir. But if the doctor was telling the truth…

She had been lying the entire time.

I pressed a hand tightly over my mouth to silence a gasp.

“What I do with my body is my business,” Sophia snapped viciously. “Just give me the damn pills.”

The doctor hesitated. “Miss, I must strongly advise against–”

“Now!” Sophia snarled, her voice cutting like ice.

I clenched my fists until my nails dug into my palms. So, this was her scheme. She had never been pregnant at all.

But why fake a pregnancy? And why was she now so desperate to fake a miscarriage?

Disgust and fury churned in my gut. Sophia was a pathological liar–a master manipulator. And now, I had proof.

I needed to find Sebastian. Now.

But as I turned to hurry away, my foot accidentally knocked against a metal cleaning cart parked in the hallway.

The wheels let out a loud, betraying squeak.

I sucked in a sharp, silent breath.

Abrupt silence fell from within the office.

Then–

“Who’s out there?” Sophia’s voice rang out, sharp and suspicious.

I didn’t wait to see if she would come investigate. I spun on my heel and hurried away, my heart pounding a frantic rhythm against my chest.

I had to get away before she discovered I had overheard everything.
###Chapter 25

My pulse hammered in my ears as I sprinted down the sterile hospital corridor.

The words I'd overheard kept replaying in my mind.

Sophia wasn't pregnant.

The entire thing had been a lie.

But what was her endgame?

I had to tell Sebastian immediately.

I dodged through the maze of hallways, constantly checking behind me.

Every shadow made me jump.

My palms were slick with sweat, my breathing ragged and uneven.

I spotted Sebastian standing with my grandparents in the waiting area.

I grabbed his arm tightly.

"We need to leave. Right now," I whispered urgently.

Sebastian's expression shifted to concern. "Eleanor, what's happened?"

"Not here," I insisted. "Please trust me."

He didn't question me further.

His arm wrapped around my waist, guiding me swiftly through the exit.

His protective grip felt both comforting and necessary.

Inside the car, I immediately locked the doors.

Sebastian turned to me, his features tense. "Talk to me."

I took a shaky breath. "I overheard Sophia with a doctor."

His eyes darkened. "What did you hear?"

"She's not pregnant."

Sebastian's face went from confusion to stunned disbelief. "What?"

I nodded rapidly. "She was demanding medication to induce bleeding. She wants to fake a miscarriage."

Sebastian cursed violently, raking his hand through his hair.

"That deceitful-"

He cut himself off, his jaw clenching tightly.

I exhaled shakily. "Why would she do this? Why fake a pregnancy?"

Sebastian's gaze turned icy. "To trap Alexander. To secure her position in his family. Now she's staging a miscarriage for sympathy."

A cold dread washed over me. "She's manipulating everyone."

Sebastian's expression became calculating before he reached for my hand. "We can use this against her."

"How?"

A dangerous smile touched his lips. "If we expose her, Alexander and his family will turn against her completely."

I hesitated. "We need proof."

Sebastian nodded. "We'll get it. You said she threatened the doctor. That means he's vulnerable. We just need to make him talk."

I took a deep breath. "What if Sophia discovers I know?"

Sebastian's expression hardened. "She won't. Because we'll strike first."

His words sent chills through me, but I trusted him completely.

My phone buzzed abruptly.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

I answered cautiously. "Hello?"

A distorted voice spoke. "Stay out of matters that don't concern you. For your own good."

My blood turned to ice.

Sebastian noticed my panic. "Eleanor? Who is it?"

I couldn't form words. My throat had closed up.

The voice continued, "You've been snooping around too much. Stop now, or you'll regret it."

The line went dead.

My hands trembled as I lowered the phone. "Someone knows," I whispered.

Sebastian's face darkened dangerously. "Who was that?"

"I don't know. But they know I overheard Sophia."

His jaw tightened. "They're watching us."

Fear coiled in my stomach.

Sebastian took my phone, examining the number. "It's untraceable." He turned to me, his expression fierce. "You're not alone in this. I won't let anything happen to you."

I nodded, trying to steady my breathing. "What do we do now?"

Sebastian's eyes gleamed with determination. "We set a trap."

"A trap?"

He smirked without humor. "Sophia thinks she's in control. Let's show her she's not."

Back at Sebastian's estate, I paced nervously.

I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.

Someone had warned me to back off. But who?

Sebastian sat calmly on the couch, his focus sharp. "We need to hit her where it hurts. If she's faking this pregnancy, there's more she's hiding."

"How do we get the doctor to talk?"

Sebastian's smirk returned. "We apply pressure."

"Sebastian..."

"I won't hurt him," he assured. "But we'll make him nervous enough to talk."

A knock at the door made me jump.

Sebastian stood immediately. "Stay here."

He opened the door to reveal his butler.

"Sir," the butler said quietly. "We've secured the doctor."

My heart skipped. "What do you mean 'secured'?"

Sebastian turned to me. "He's in the study. We need to hear what he knows."

I followed Sebastian down the hallway, my hands clenched.

We entered the study where Dr. Collins sat trembling in a chair.

"Dr. Collins," Sebastian greeted smoothly, closing the door. "I hear you've been treating Sophia."

The doctor swallowed nervously. "I don't know what you're talking about."

I stepped forward. "I heard everything. You told Sophia she wasn't pregnant. You said faking a miscarriage was dangerous."

Dr. Collins paled. "You misunderstood-"

"Don't lie," Sebastian cut in sharply. His calm voice held a dangerous edge.

The doctor wiped his forehead. "I had no choice. She threatened me."

Sebastian leaned forward. "Tell us the truth. How long has she been lying?"

Dr. Collins hesitated before sighing heavily. "Since the beginning."

I clenched my fists. "She was never pregnant?"

"No." He shook his head. "She came to me with fake test results. Said she'd ruin my career if I didn't cooperate."

I exchanged a look with Sebastian. We had our proof.

Sebastian smirked. "You did the right thing telling us, doctor."

Dr. Collins looked anxious. "Please don't tell anyone I was involved."

Sebastian nodded. "That depends on how useful you continue to be."
###Chapter 26

I let out a slow breath, ending the call with a tap of my finger.

A faint smile touched my lips as I returned the voice modulator to its velvet-lined case.

Rachel should understand the warning now. She’ll back off if she values her safety.

A sudden pounding at the door made me jump.

“Sophia, open up!” Alexander’s voice was harsh, urgent.

My pulse quickened. I shoved the device into a drawer and smoothed my dress.

I unlocked the door just as he pushed inside. His face was tense, eyes burning with rage.

“Why was this locked?” he demanded.

I forced a light laugh, tucking my hair behind my ear. “I was changing, Alexander. You know how Liam walks in without warning. I wanted privacy.”

His eyes narrowed. “You’re lying.”

I held my expression steady. “What’s going on? Why are you so angry?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he snatched the remote and turned on the TV.

The screen lit up with breaking news.

My throat tightened.

BREAKING: STERLING ENTERPRISES IMPLICATED IN MURDER OF SEBASTIAN CRAWFORD’S MOTHER.

My stomach dropped as documents and financial records flashed across the screen. Old footage from three years ago played alongside the report.

The anchor’s voice was grave, detailing how the killer had received funds from Sterling Enterprises before the crime.

I turned to Alexander, chilled. “What is this?”

He gave a bitter laugh. “What does it look like? Sebastian and Rachel did this. It’s their move.”

He ran a hand through his hair, pacing. “First, he takes my company. Now he’s destroying our name. He won’t stop until we’re ruined.”

I swallowed. “Alexander, calm down. Maybe it wasn’t him.”

His head snapped up, fury in his gaze. “Who else, Sophia? You think this just leaked on its own? He’s behind it. I know it.”

I reached for his hands. “We’ll fix this. We always do.”

He pulled away. “How? My family is drowning. If this becomes a criminal case, we’re finished.”

I bit my lip, thinking. “Let’s wait. It might blow over.”

He laughed coldly. “You really believe that? This is Sebastian Crawford. He doesn’t let things go.”

I had no answer.

He sighed, rubbing his temples. “I need to rest.”

I watched him collapse onto the bed, exhaustion taking over.

Once I was sure he was asleep, I slipped out.

I needed to find Eleanor.

Her room was dim when I arrived, but voices echoed from within. It wasn’t just Eleanor.

William was there.

They were arguing.

I paused outside, listening.

“You expect me to believe you knew nothing?” William’s voice was low but sharp.

Eleanor scoffed. “I wasn’t handling accounts then, William. You know that.”

His voice grew edged. “How convenient that the CFO from three years ago died days after the accident.”

Her tone turned icy. “What are you implying?”

“It’s suspicious,” he shot back. “We’re accused of funding a murderer, and the only person who could explain is dead. That’s no coincidence, Eleanor.”

I pushed the door open. “Enough. Both of you.”

Eleanor turned, her expression dark. William brushed past me without a word.

“Fighting won’t help,” I said calmly. “We need a plan now that this is public.”

Eleanor exhaled sharply, moving to her bed. “For now, we do nothing.”

I frowned. “Nothing?”

Her eyes met mine. “Sebastian and Rachel think they’ve found something big, but they’ve only scratched the surface. Let them have this round. We can’t attract more attention.”

I hesitated. “What if they dig deeper?”

Her expression hardened. “Then we stop them.”

I crossed my arms. “You mean we keep lying.”

Her jaw tightened. “We protect this family.”

I swallowed. “What about Alexander? He’s furious. He won’t stay quiet.”

She sighed. “That’s your job, Sophia. Control him.”

I stiffened. “He’s not a child.”

“No,” she agreed. “But he’s emotional. We can’t afford mistakes now.”

I nodded slowly, understanding.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “No one can know the real truth, Sophia. Not Sebastian. Not Rachel. Not even William.”

I swallowed hard. “What do we do now?”

Her gaze sharpened. “Suspend your plans. No more games with Rachel. No distractions. We wait.”

I clenched my fists. “Eleanor—”

“No arguments,” she cut me off. “If you want to remain in this family, you’ll obey.”

I took a deep breath, nodding. “Fine. I’ll wait.”
###Chapter 27

I woke to the rich aroma of coffee and freshly baked pastries.

My eyes opened slowly, taking in the scene before me.

Sebastian stood beside the bed holding a tray, his dark gaze filled with tenderness.

"Good morning, darling," he said, placing the tray next to me.

I sat up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. "What's all this?"

"Breakfast in bed," he replied with a smile. "You had a difficult night after that phone call. I thought you deserved some pampering."

I swallowed, recalling the threatening words I'd heard.

A chill ran through me, but it vanished when Sebastian pressed a warm kiss to my forehead.

"Eat first," he whispered. "Then I have another surprise."

I raised an eyebrow. "Another surprise?"

Sebastian grinned but remained silent.

After eating, I relaxed back into the pillows, enjoying the sunlight streaming through the curtains.

Sebastian moved behind me, his strong hands beginning to massage my shoulders.

I sighed softly. "A massage too? Are you trying to make me adore you even more?"

His lips brushed against my ear. "You already adore me."

His hands moved lower, and soon the massage became something much more intimate.

When we finally lay breathless and entwined, the sun was high overhead.

Sebastian reached for something on the nightstand and handed me a small velvet box.

I stared at it, confused. "What's this?"

He propped himself up on one elbow, his expression serious yet warm.

"Rachel, our first wedding wasn't done properly. It was rushed. No vows, no celebrations–just paperwork. I don't want that for us. I want the world to know you're mine. I want us to have the wedding you deserve."

I blinked, my throat tightening. "Are you...proposing?"

He chuckled. "Yes. But only if you say yes."

I bit my lip, my heart racing. "Of course it's yes, Sebastian. Besides, I'm already married to you."

He slipped the ring onto my finger, and I couldn't help but admire it. The diamond was stunningly beautiful.

Sebastian kissed my knuckles. "Then it's settled. We're going to have the most extravagant wedding this city has ever seen."

I sighed happily, resting my head against his chest. The TV was still on in the background, and just as I was drifting off, the news caught my attention.

BREAKING NEWS: RUSSO CORPORATION IN CRISIS AS INVESTORS WITHDRAW SUPPORT.

The reporter detailed how shareholders were pulling out, refusing to be associated with the company after the recent scandal.

Alexander's family empire was collapsing faster than I'd anticipated.

Sebastian poured us both glasses of wine, and we clinked them together.

"To the downfall of the Russos," he said.

I smiled. "And to our future."

As we drank, I turned to him. "When are we going to reveal Sophia's secret?"

Sebastian's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Later today. When we deliver our wedding invitation."

I laughed. "Oh, this is going to be an interesting visit."

That morning, Sebastian drove me to my office.

I felt lighter than I had in days, but the moment I stepped into my workplace, my good mood vanished.

Alexander was waiting for me.

His face was tight with anger, his usual confident demeanor replaced by desperation.

As soon as I entered, he grabbed my arm, his grip harsh.

"Alexander, what are you doing?" I snapped, pulling my arm back.

His eyes burned with fury. "Why are you doing this, Rachel? Why are you trying to destroy my family?"

I glared at him. "Your family destroyed itself. I'm just ensuring the truth comes out."

His grip tightened. "You don't understand what you're doing. You think you can ruin me? Is this your way of getting revenge? Are you using Sebastian to make me jealous?"

I froze, shocked by his arrogance. "Jealous?" I let out a bitter laugh. "Alexander, you betrayed me. You humiliated me. I don't need to use anyone to make you jealous."

Alexander clenched his jaw. "Then why are you doing this? You've done enough. Stop this nonsense, Rachel."

I pushed him away. "You're pathetic, Alexander. You want me to hide the truth to save your company? Well, guess what? I'm not stopping. By the time I'm finished, you'll have nothing left."

Alexander's face twisted with rage. "You're making a mistake."

I smirked. "No, Alexander. The mistake was ever loving you."

I turned to the security guards near the entrance. "Remove him from my building."

The guards moved in, taking Alexander by the arms. He struggled but couldn't break free.

"You'll regret this, Rachel!" he shouted as they dragged him away.

I took a deep breath, watching him disappear down the hall.

Good riddance.

At the end of the day, Sebastian arrived to pick me up.

As I got into the car, he handed me a gold-plated wedding invitation.

I gasped, tracing my fingers over the elegant lettering. "Sebastian, this is exquisite!"

He smiled. "Only the best for you."

I kissed him gently. "You always know how to amaze me."

As we drove, I told him about my encounter with Alexander. Sebastian listened, his jaw tightening slightly.

"He actually had the nerve to say I was making him jealous," I scoffed.

Sebastian chuckled. "Poor Alexander. He must be losing his mind."

I smirked. "Well, it's about to get worse. Once we deliver this invitation, we'll also reveal Sophia's secret."

Sebastian's eyes darkened with amusement. "It's going to be a memorable visit."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my lips.

And I couldn't wait.
###Chapter 28

Kind Intentions?

53%

Rachel’s Pov

The car halted before the Russo estate. Sebastian’s hand tightened around mine. A faint smile touched my lips.

“Ready?” he murmured.

I nodded, clutching the envelope. “Let the chaos begin.”

We stepped out into the tense atmosphere. William charged toward us before we even crossed the threshold.

His face flushed crimson with rage. “What is the meaning of this? Haven’t you caused enough damage? My company is plastered across every news outlet because of you!”

Sebastian slid his hands into his pockets, completely unruffled.

“If you’re innocent in my mother’s death, the police investigation shouldn’t concern you.”

His voice remained calm, almost playful, but his gaze turned razor-sharp.

William’s jaw clenched. “You have no evidence.”

“Not yet,” Sebastian corrected. “But we will.”

William stepped forward, fists tightening as if ready to strike.

Eleanor glided into the room before he could speak. Her expression radiated serenity.

“William, darling,” she cooed, placing a gentle hand on his arm. “Let’s not mistreat our guests. Sebastian is your son, and this is your daughter-in-law.”

Guests? Son? Daughter-in-law?

What game was this?

I studied her carefully. Eleanor never behaved this... graciously. Something felt wrong.

Sebastian looked equally skeptical. “Since when do you welcome us so warmly?”

Eleanor gave a light laugh. “Now, Sebastian. Let’s be civil. Rachel, dear, why don’t you both come inside?”

Sebastian and I exchanged wary glances. We didn’t trust her, but we followed her inside.

The butler offered drinks. I took a cautious sip, never taking my eyes off Eleanor. She was plotting something.

“Rachel,” Eleanor said suddenly, turning to me with an enigmatic smile. “Would you mind giving Sebastian and me a moment alone?”

Sebastian immediately frowned. “Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Rachel.”

Eleanor waved dismissively. “It’s just a small chat. Nothing important.”

Before we could refuse again, Sophia appeared with a playful smirk. “I’ll keep Rachel company,” she chirped. “We’ll take a stroll. Catch up on old times.”

I stiffened. “No, thank you.”

Sophia laughed and linked her arm through mine before I could protest. “Oh, don’t be so distant.”

I shot one last look at Sebastian. His expression mirrored my unease, but we both knew we had to play along.

Sophia led me through the mansion into the gardens. I immediately pulled my arm away.

“Alright, Sophia,” I said, crossing my arms. “What do you want?”

She tilted her head. “Why do you always assume I want something?”

I scoffed. “Because you always do.”

Sophia sighed dramatically. “If I’m cruel, you complain. If I’m kind, you still complain. Make up your mind, Rachel.”

I narrowed my eyes. “Drop the act. What are you playing at?”

Sophia’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. “You’ll discover soon enough.”

I rolled my eyes and retrieved a gold-plated wedding invitation from my purse. Her smile vanished as I extended it toward her.

“I actually came here for something important,” I said sweetly. “I wanted to personally invite you to my grand wedding. Sebastian and I are remarrying.”

Sophia’s fingers tightened around the invitation, her knuckles turning white. “How delightful,” she said through clenched teeth.

I smirked. “When are you and Alexander finally marrying? After the baby arrives?” I tilted my head, feigning innocence. “That is, if you’re even pregnant.”

Sophia’s entire body went rigid. Her eyes flashed with something dark and dangerous.

“Stop speaking about things you know nothing about,” she snapped.

I stepped closer, lowering my voice to a whisper. “Struck a nerve, did I?”

Sophia opened her mouth to respond, but suddenly the world tilted around me.

I blinked rapidly, trying to steady myself. My vision blurred. My head felt heavy, my body weak.

I swayed on my feet.

Sophia’s voice sounded distant. “Rachel? Are you alright?”

I tried to answer, but the dizziness overwhelmed me.

Everything spun.

And then—
###Chapter 29

A blood-curdling scream ripped me from unconsciousness.

Every muscle felt weighted down. My skull pulsed with a dull, throbbing ache. My limbs moved sluggishly, as though submerged in syrup.

I forced my eyes open, vision swimming into focus. The air caught in my lungs.

Sophia lay beside me, twisting on the ground. Her hands pressed desperately against her abdomen. Crimson stained the grass beneath her.

Her features contorted in pure agony. Another scream tore from her lips.

Then I saw it.

The knife gripped in my own hand.

Drenched in blood. Still dripping.

A choked sound escaped me. I flung the blade away. My heart hammered against my ribs.

“What… is this?” My whisper was fractured, uneven.

Sophia released a weak, broken sob. Her fingers clawed at the earth. “You stabbed me… Rachel… why?”

“No!” I shook my head wildly, stumbling backward. “I didn’t— I wouldn’t—”

Blood coated my hands. My dress was saturated with it.

Raw, icy panic seized my chest. My breath hitched, coming in ragged gasps. This was a nightmare I couldn’t escape.

The pounding of footsteps echoed. Alexander, Sebastian, and Eleanor rushed into the garden.

They froze. Their eyes widened in collective horror.

“What the hell happened?” Alexander yelled, surging forward.

Eleanor pressed a hand to her mouth, her face ghostly pale. “Dear God… Sophia!”

Sebastian’s sharp gaze flicked from me to Sophia. Deep worry etched his features.

“Rachel?”

I tried to speak. No words emerged.

Sophia cried out again.

“She—she attacked me!” she gasped, a trembling finger aimed at me. “She stabbed me!”

“No!” My voice trembled violently. “I swear I didn’t do it! I—I blacked out. I woke up like this!”

Alexander shoved me aside, dropping to his knees beside Sophia.

“Stay with me, baby,” he murmured, pushing her hair back from her sweaty forehead.

He spun toward me, eyes blazing with pure fury. “What is wrong with you, Rachel? She’s pregnant!”

I flinched. “I didn’t do this! I swear!”

Eleanor was already on the phone, her hands shaking. “We need an ambulance! Now! A stabbing victim!”

I turned desperately to Sebastian, tears welling. “You believe me, don’t you?”

His jaw was tight, his eyes shadowed. But he gave a single, firm nod. “I do.”

William arrived then, his furious glare landing on me. “Rachel, how could you? Knowing she carries a child?”

Sophia whimpered, clutching Alexander’s hand. “She… she wanted me dead,” she breathed weakly.

I wanted to scream. To tell them it was all a lie. But the evidence was all against me.

The ambulance arrived swiftly. Paramedics carefully lifted Sophia onto a stretcher.

Alexander turned on me, his face a mask of rage. “If anything happens to her, I swear—”

I couldn’t hear more. My entire body shook. Tears streamed down my cheeks. Helplessness choked me.

Sebastian pulled me into his arms, holding me close. “I know you didn’t do this,” he whispered firmly. “We will figure this out.”

The hospital was all cold surfaces and harsh, bright lights. They amplified the pounding in my head.

Sebastian held my hand tightly as a doctor ran tests.

I sat on the edge of the hospital bed, staring at my clean hands. The phantom sensation of blood refused to fade.

The doctor returned, shaking his head. “There are no drugs in her system.”

My stomach plunged. “Then why did I pass out?”

Sebastian’s brow furrowed. “Something is very wrong here.”

Before we could say another word, Alexander stormed into the room, fury radiating from him.

“You killed my baby!” he roared.

I recoiled. “What?”

Alexander jabbed a trembling finger toward me. “Sophia lost the baby. Because of you.”

The air vanished from my lungs. “No… that can’t be.”

“She was pregnant, Rachel!” he shouted. “And now, because of you, she’s not!”

I clenched my fists, nails biting into my palms. “She was never pregnant to begin with!”

Alexander’s eyes turned murderous. “You’re a liar.”

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice dangerously low. “She is telling the truth. We have proof.”

Alexander scoffed. “Oh yeah? Show me.”

Sebastian looked at me. “I’ll get the doctor who’s been treating Sophia.”

He returned minutes later, his expression grim. “He’s gone.”

Alexander crossed his arms, smirking. “Convenient.”

A different doctor stood nearby. “Sophia did indeed lose the pregnancy due to the stab wound,” he stated.

I stared in utter disbelief. “That’s impossible.”

Sebastian’s hands balled into fists. “This is a setup.”

Alexander’s face twisted with renewed fury. “You’re both pathological liars.”

The door burst open before the argument could continue.

Several police officers entered the room.

Alexander pointed directly at me. “Arrest her.”
###Chapter 30

Tears streamed down my face as I looked at Sebastian. "Please..."

His jaw tightened, eyes burning with suppressed rage. "This won't stand."

The officer recited my rights while pulling me toward the exit.

Alexander wore a smug expression, watching with obvious satisfaction.

Sophia had set me up perfectly. Now I was being taken away for a crime I never committed.

"Release me!" I fought against the officers dragging me toward the police vehicle, cold metal cuffs digging into my wrists.

My heart raced, breaths coming in short bursts. This couldn't be real.

One moment I was in the garden, the next drenched in blood with Sophia screaming in agony.

Now I faced arrest for something I didn't do.

"Stop!" Sebastian's voice cut through the chaos, sharp and angry.

He pushed through the officers, his expression thunderous. "You're not taking my wife!"

The restraining officer didn't budge. "Step aside, sir," he ordered firmly.

"She's innocent!" Sebastian's voice remained steady and determined.

"Interfere and we'll arrest you too," another officer warned, his tone leaving no room for debate.

I shook my head at Sebastian, voice trembling. "Let them take me."

His jaw clenched, hands forming fists, but he finally nodded reluctantly.

"I'll be right behind you," he vowed.

As they pushed me into the police car's backseat, our eyes met through the window.

His face showed both fury and deep concern.

The police station felt cold and unwelcoming, harsh fluorescent lights creating a surreal atmosphere.

They took my fingerprints, captured my mugshot, and led me to a small holding cell with iron bars.

Sebastian arrived shortly after, his face tense with worry. He gripped the bars, knuckles turning white. "I'm getting you out of here."

"I know," I whispered, trying to maintain strength.

Hours passed. The station's distant hum filled the silence. Stale coffee and old paper scents hung in the air.

Then familiar voices echoed down the hallway.

My grandparents.

"Rachel!" Grandmother rushed toward the cell, eyes filled with concern. "Are you alright, dear?"

"I'm fine," I assured her, though my voice wavered slightly.

Grandfather's expression was grim. "We tried to post bail, but they won't process it until morning."

I swallowed hard. "It's okay."

"We're so sorry," Grandmother said, reaching through the bars to squeeze my hands.

I forced a small smile. "I'll be fine."

Sebastian crossed his arms, jaw tight. "I'm staying here."

The duty officer frowned. "That's not permitted."

Sebastian shot him a glare. "Watch me."

He sat on the bench outside my cell, refusing to leave. Hours stretched on, but he remained.

Eventually, the officers made him depart.

Before leaving, he leaned close. "I'll be waiting outside in the car," he whispered.

**

Next morning, approaching footsteps made me sit upright.

Eleanor.

And Sophia.

They stood before my cell, eyes shining with amusement.

"Well, well," Eleanor smirked. "How does it feel?"

Sophia gave a soft chuckle. "You walked right into our trap."

My stomach twisted. "You framed me."

Eleanor tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Did we?"

Sophia folded her arms. "That's what you get for meddling where you don't belong."

My fingers curled into fists. "You're sick."

Eleanor's smirk widened. "Maybe. But you're the one in a cell."

I glared at them, patience thinning. "What do you want?"

Sophia leaned closer, her voice dropping. "You won't be so lucky next time."

Before I could respond, an officer approached.

Sophia sighed dramatically. "I've had a change of heart."

I froze.

"I don't want to press charges," she said sweetly, voice dripping with false kindness. "I'm dropping everything."

The officer gave her a skeptical look but nodded. "You're free to go, Mrs. Crawford."

Eleanor smirked. "Guess today's your lucky day."

I stepped from the cell, head held high despite the storm inside.

I wouldn't let them see me break.

Eleanor and Sophia followed behind, whispering to each other, their giggles chilling my spine.

Sebastian waited outside, posture rigid, eyes scanning the station entrance.

When he saw me, relief flashed across his features.

"Rachel," he exhaled, pulling me into his embrace.

I buried my face in his chest, breathing his familiar scent. "I didn't do it," I whispered, voice cracking.

"I know," he murmured, arms tightening around me.

A mocking voice interrupted us.

Eleanor.

"There won't be a second chance," she said smoothly, stepping forward.

Sophia crossed her arms. "Back off, Rachel. Or next time, you won't walk away."

Sebastian stepped forward, shielding me. His voice turned icy. "Stay away from her."

Eleanor smirked. "Quid pro quo, Sebastian."

I frowned. "Was that a threat?"

Sebastian's expression darkened. "It means they know what happened to my mother."

Heavy silence fell between us.

Eleanor's eyes gleamed with something sinister. "You should've left things alone."

Sophia smirked. "But you didn't. Now you've got a war on your hands."

My pulse accelerated.

Eleanor leaned in, her voice barely audible. "Be careful, Rachel. You might not like how this ends."

Without another word, she and Sophia turned and walked away.

I released a shaky breath, hands trembling. "Sebastian..."

His grip on my waist tightened. "I won't let them hurt you."
###Chapter 31

Liam’s voice trembled with rage.

He glared at Rachel with pure hatred.

“You killed my mother,” he accused.

Rachel’s blood ran cold.

She stared at the boy, her heart aching.

“Liam, no,” she whispered. “I would never—”

“Lies!” he screamed, cutting her off. “Everyone says it! Grandmother says it! You were jealous! You wanted my father back!”

Tears welled in his eyes, but anger held them back.

Rachel took a careful step forward.

He flinched, stepping away from her.

The rejection was a physical blow.

“Your mother was my sister,” Rachel said softly, her voice thick with emotion. “I loved her. I would never hurt her.”

“You’re a liar!” he shouted again, his small fists clenched. “You ruined everything! I hate you!”

Alexander chose that moment to arrive.

He strode into the room, his expression dark.

“What is going on here?” he demanded, his voice echoing in the tense space.

He saw Liam’s distraught face.

He saw Rachel’s pale, shaken expression.

His eyes narrowed.

“Liam, what happened?” Alexander asked, his tone slightly softer as he addressed his son.

The boy ran to his father, burying his face against his leg.

“She was here,” Liam cried, pointing a shaky finger at Rachel. “She was trying to talk to me.”

Alexander’s gaze snapped to Rachel, cold and accusing.

“I told you to stay away from him,” he said, each word like ice.

“He’s my nephew, Alexander,” Rachel argued, her own frustration rising. “He believes I killed Isabella. He heard it from Victoria. You have to tell him the truth.”

Alexander’s jaw tightened.

He looked down at his sobbing son.

He looked back at Rachel.

The silence was heavy, suffocating.

“Leave,” Alexander commanded, his voice low and dangerous. “Now.”

Rachel stood her ground for a moment longer.

The injustice of it all burned inside her.

She had lost her sister.

She had lost the man she loved.

Now she was losing her nephew to a vicious lie.

She turned and walked out.

Her steps were measured, but her heart was breaking.

She could still hear Liam’s crying as she left.

The sound followed her down the hall.

It echoed in her mind.

She leaned against the wall, taking a deep, shaky breath.

This had to stop.

She couldn’t let Victoria poison the boy’s mind any longer.

She needed a plan.

She needed to prove her innocence, once and for all.

Not for Alexander.

Not for Victoria.

But for Liam.

For Isabella.

And for herself.

She pulled out her phone.

Her fingers moved quickly across the screen.

She sent a text to Christopher.

I need everything you can find on Isabella’s accident. Everything.

She put the phone away.

A new resolve settled over her.

The game had changed.

She was no longer just fighting for her company.

She was fighting for her family.

She would clear her name.

No matter the cost.

Liam suddenly spoke as we drove to finalize the divorce. "You and Christopher..."

"Not your concern," I cut him off sharply.

He let out a bitter laugh and went quiet.

The car radio crackled with a breaking news alert. "Emergency report - a woman threatens to jump from Sterling Enterprises headquarters. She claims the family used her daughter and abandoned her."

Liam's face went pale instantly.

"The woman states her daughter is pregnant with heir Liam Sterling's child..."

I turned to see Liam staring at his phone screen.

His secretary had sent photos from the scene. Eleanor stood dangerously on the rooftop edge, her face contorted with rage.

Sirens wailed in the background. The area swarmed with police and reporters.

The moment Liam stepped out, camera flashes surrounded him.

"Mr. Sterling! Is it true about Ms. Sophia's pregnancy?"

"Will the family recognize this child? Have you divorced already? Or is this a mistress situation?"

Liam pushed through the crowd with a dark expression. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward the elevator.

His palm felt sweaty but his grip remained tight.

"Release me," I said coldly.

He seemed to awaken from a trance. His voice came out hoarse. "Apologies... I merely..."

"A life hangs in the balance. I comprehend." My tone dripped with sarcasm. "No explanations required."

Upon hearing about Eleanor, he'd immediately ordered the driver to turn around.

I felt no patience for these repeated divorce delays. My expression showed no warmth.

During the brief elevator ride, Liam's phone rang three times.

He finally answered the last call. Even I could hear William's furious咆哮. "Control this now! The media is live-streaming! If she jumps, our stocks will crash tomorrow!"

A bitter wind whipped across the rooftop. Eleanor stood at the edge, her makeup streaked with tears.

Spotting Liam, she screamed instantly. "Liam! You heartless monster! My daughter carries your child and you choose to remarry this slut?"

Every reporter's camera swung toward me.

Liam instinctively moved to shield me. "Eleanor, step down please."

"Never!" she shrieked hysterically, waving her arms wildly. "Swear you'll marry my daughter today! Vow it publicly! Or I'll jump! Let the world see how the Sterlings torment us helpless women!"

As police tried approaching, Eleanor took another half-step backward. The crowd gasped collectively.

Liam's back showed dark sweat patches through his suit. He glanced back at me, conflict swirling in his eyes. "Promise her," I stated calmly.

"Isabella..."

"I said promise her." My voice turned icy. "We were divorcing regardless."

This disaster wasn't of my making. I refused to be labeled as the woman who drove a mistress's mother to suicide.

Liam's Adam's apple bobbed repeatedly. Finally he turned to Eleanor. "Very well. I promise. Now please come down."

Eleanor smiled triumphantly. With police assistance, she climbed shakily back over the railing.

Reporters surged forward instantly. Microphones and cameras engulfed Liam.

I turned and walked toward the elevator. Behind me, Liam's anxious voice called out. "Isabella! Wait!"

But the elevator doors already closed between us.

Sophia rested weakly in bed, morning sickness leaving her exhausted.

Her phone buzzed suddenly. A live-stream link from her best friend made her sit upright instantly.

"Mother?" She stared at the screen, face paling as she watched her mother's hysterical performance.
###Chapter 32

Her mother’s victorious tone echoed through the phone. “Wendy! It’s done! Liam swore to marry you right in front of all those journalists!”

Wendy’s fingers clenched the bedsheet. “Have you lost your mind? Making a public spectacle…”

“Why are you so scared? I’m helping you! That Isabella…”

Everything tilted. The phone dropped from her hand. Darkness swallowed her vision. She fell hard against the mattress.

It was finished. All of it.

She knew Liam. Pressure made him stubborn. Her mother’s aggression would only fuel his hatred.

Once the baby arrived, he might discard her completely.

The lamp light glowed over the divorce papers. Liam’s signature was still wet.

The clerk gave us the filing receipt. His voice was monotone. “Return in thirty days to finalize after the cooling period.” After pulling Isabella from the roof, I didn’t let Liam delay. I drove directly to the courthouse to submit the divorce. Liam’s fingers drummed the table. His gaze locked on me. “Isabella, these thirty days…”

“We have nothing left to discuss.” I tucked the receipt into my purse and rose.

He followed me outside. He blocked my path on the courthouse steps. “At least let me drive you.”

“Unnecessary.” I moved past him toward the idling cab. “Mr. Sterling, tend to your expecting girlfriend.”

News of the divorce filing brought a relieved sigh at the Sterling mansion. “Thirty days? Ideal. Enough to arrange suitable matches for you.”

Liam yanked his tie loose. “Father, the entire city knows about Wendy now. Who would possibly—”

“Meetings are set with the Zimmer, Carter, and Scott families,” his father cut in coldly. “With sufficient incentive, many will overlook… indiscretions for a beneficial union.”

Liam didn’t argue. He attended the meetings reluctantly, praying for disinterest.

He still saw himself as the coveted, devoted husband he’d once been.

The first match asked immediately, “Mr. Sterling, is it true your wife left due to infidelity?”

His fork screeched against the plate.

“Simply curious,” the woman said, tilting her head. “How does one manage affairs with two women simultaneously and incite a public feud?”

The second woman remained standing. “My father values this merger, hence my presence. But frankly…”

She turned, her eyes icy behind her shades. “I don’t share public facilities.”

After seven consecutive rejections, Liam slammed his front door. Rage burned in his eyes.

What was wrong with these society women?

They’d once called him the most eligible bachelor in the city!

Had I been there, I would have laughed.

They said those things because his devotion to me had seemed real. Everyone envied my perfect husband.

But that “perfect husband” was just a filthy lie.

Victoria descended the staircase. Red wine swirled in her glass. Her silk robe flowed with each step.

“Rejected again?” A soft laugh escaped her. “How pathetic.”

“Leave me alone.” He snatched the bottle and drank deeply. “If you hadn’t—”

“If I hadn’t, what?” She moved closer, her finger tracing his chest. “Did I force you into Wendy’s bed? Or make you betray Isabella repeatedly?”

He shoved her away violently. “You know I was drunk that night!”

“But you were sober later.” She advanced, pushing him toward the sofa.
###Chapter 33

“She’s never returning to you, you know. Isabella is probably laughing right now. Thinking how pathetic you look, Alexander. Willing to debase yourself just to win her back.”

Alexander’s breathing turned ragged. “What’s your point?”

“My point is…”

Sophia’s fingers slid beneath his shirt.

“What if you stopped trying? Acted like you couldn’t care less. Maybe then she’d come running back.” The sofa groaned under their weight.

Just as Alexander began losing himself in her once more, a flicker of movement caught his eye from the upstairs landing.

Eleanor stood there, swaying. She stumbled backward, hands pressed to her mouth. Her eyes flooded with tears.

“Alexander,” she whispered, voice shaking. But her words vanished beneath their heavy breathing.

A searing pain suddenly ripped through her abdomen. She folded in half, cold sweat drenching her nightgown.

She tried to cry out but missed a step. Then she was falling, tumbling down the staircase.

Her scream shattered the moment.

Alexander shoved Sophia away and bolted toward the stairs. Eleanor lay curled on the landing. A dark pool of blood spread beneath her.

“The baby… my baby…”

Her face was ghostly white. Trembling fingers clutched at his sleeve. “Help me… please.”

Outside the operating room, Victoria’s cries echoed down the hall. “My grandchild! My precious grandchild!”

She grabbed Alexander’s collar and shook him hard. “Give me back my grandbaby! Give my daughter her dignity back!”

It took three nurses to pull her away.

The doctor emerged, removing his mask with a grim shake of his head. “We lost the baby. It was a fully formed boy.”

Eleanor’s mother crumpled to the floor, her makeup streaking. “No! That’s impossible! I had his fortune told. They said he’d bring great wealth!”

She launched herself at Alexander. “This is your fault! You murderer!”

Alexander stood frozen, letting her nails rake bloody lines down his face.

Strangely, he felt no grief. Only relief. Like a weight had been lifted.

That child never should have existed. It was a chain holding him down. Now it was gone.

Alexander pulled out his phone. His hands shook slightly as he dialed.

It rang several times before she answered.

“Isabella,” he rasped, voice raw. “Eleanor lost the baby.”

A beat of silence. “And?”

“We can try again. Start over.” He spoke urgently, like it was the most obvious thing.

“No baby. No Eleanor. No more obstacles. Just like you said—we never legally married. Now the baby’s gone too.”

“Alexander.” Her voice was ice. “Have you lost your mind?”

He froze. “What?”

“I’ll repeat myself. Have you completely lost your mind?”

The line went dead.

Alexander stood there, phone in hand. The scratches on his face burned.

Did he really believe she’d come back without Eleanor? Without the child?

Without Eleanor, there would be someone else. Another woman. Another complication.

The problem was never another person.

It was him.

His faithlessness. His betrayal. His weakness.

The heartless one wasn’t her.

It was him.
###Chapter 34

Nora's sobs echoed down the sterile hallway, mingling with the doctor's futile attempts at comfort. But Alexander heard none of it. My final words reverberated through his mind on an endless loop.

His phone illuminated with a new message from Victoria. [Your father demands your immediate return. Nora and her daughter are insisting on answers.]

He stared at the screen until a bitter laugh escaped him.

Tears splashed against the glass as he chuckled.

How utterly pathetic. He'd believed eliminating the child would restore what we once had. He'd forgotten the Isabella who loved him had died through his countless betrayals.

Upstairs, Wendy stirred from anesthesia. Her hand drifted to her flattened abdomen. A soul-shattering scream tore through the recovery room.

Since learning I couldn't conceive, I'd dedicated myself to supporting orphanages.

With the studio on hiatus, I visited one of the homes I sponsored in my hometown.

Sebastian had become my shadow. He insisted on accompanying me when he learned of my plans. The early winter sun cast gentle warmth across the playground. A dozen children swarmed around me, their voices rising in excited pleas for games.

I knelt to secure a little girl's untied shoelace. She immediately threw her arms around my neck. "Ms. Isabella," she whispered, "you be the mother hen!"

"Alright!" I laughed, spreading my arms to shield my line of giggling chicks.

Their laughter echoed like wind chimes across the yard. I laughed with them, feeling the weight of my anxieties lift and drift away.

Sebastian stood beneath a barren tree, camera poised. He captured every moment silently.

His eyes never left me. Whenever I turned, I found his gentle gaze waiting.

"Ms. Isabella! Look!" A pigtailed girl proudly thrust a paper rabbit toward me.

I accepted the crinkled creation. The gesture reminded me of years ago, when Alexander would clumsily fold paper roses for me.

I smiled. Some memories remain forever etched. Even though I no longer loved Alexander, I'd once cherished his sincerity.

"Penny for your thoughts?" Sebastian appeared beside me, offering a warm cup of water.

"Nothing important." I took the cup. "Just admiring these wonderful children."

He followed my gaze to the classroom where children bent over craft projects. "Are you still struggling to make peace with it?"

I knew he meant my infertility.

My fingers instinctively brushed my abdomen where life had once grown.

"Perhaps a little regretful," I admitted. "But modern medicine offers hope for the future."

"Isabella." Sebastian's voice turned earnest as he met my eyes. "Children aren't meant for inheritance or marital obligations."

He gestured toward the orphanage director helping with crafts. "Look at Ms. Grace. She never married or bore children, yet she's mother to hundreds."

Sunlight through the window illuminated his profile, his lashes casting delicate shadows. My heart fluttered unexpectedly.

His voice softened further. "Never feel inadequate with me because you can't conceive."

"Big brother!" A young boy crashed into Sebastian's legs. "Come play football with us!"

Sebastian shot me an apologetic smile before being dragged away by the eager children.

I watched him run across the field, warmth blossoming in my chest.

As evening fell, I swayed gently on the orphanage swing.

Sebastian approached with two steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He handed me one.

"Enjoy today?" he asked.

I sipped the rich, sweet liquid. "Very much. Thank you for coming with me."
###Chapter 35

Liam's eyes burned with pure hatred.

He stared at Rachel like she was something disgusting.

His small hands clenched into tight fists.

"You killed my mom!" he screamed.

The words cut through the air, sharp and painful.

Rachel felt her heart crack.

She took a step back, shaking her head.

"No, Liam. I would never—"

"Liar!" he shouted, cutting her off.

Tears streamed down his furious little face.

"I heard them talking! Grandma Victoria and Dad!"

He was trembling with raw emotion.

"They said you did it! You made the car crash!"

Rachel's blood ran cold.

She looked over at Alexander.

His face was pale, his expression unreadable.

He didn't deny the accusation.

He didn't say a word to defend her.

He just stood there, silently watching.

Rachel's mind raced.

She thought of Isabella.

Her beautiful, vibrant step-sister.

Gone in an instant.

A tragic accident.

Or so she had always believed.

Now this child was screaming a different story.

And his father wasn't correcting him.

The implications were terrifying.

"Alexander," Rachel said, her voice barely a whisper.

"Tell him. Tell him it's not true."

Alexander finally met her gaze.

His eyes were dark, hollow.

He looked like a man carrying a terrible weight.

He opened his mouth to speak.

But no sound came out.

Liam sobbed, his small body shaking.

"I hate you! I wish you were dead!"

He turned and ran from the room.

His cries echoed down the hall.

Silence fell.

Thick and heavy.

Rachel couldn't breathe.

She stared at Alexander, waiting.

He finally found his voice.

"It's complicated, Rachel."

"Complicated?" she repeated, stunned.

"How is that complicated? Either I caused the accident or I didn't."

Alexander ran a hand over his face.

He looked exhausted, defeated.

"You weren't there," he said quietly.

"That's what everyone said. You weren't in the car."

Rachel felt a chill.

"What are you talking about? Of course I wasn't."

"But you were supposed to be," Alexander said.

His words hung in the air.

Rachel's mind flashed back.

To that day.

The rain.

The phone call.

Isabella asking her to come shopping.

Rachel had said no.

She had a migraine.

She stayed home.

Isabella went alone.

The car skidded on the wet road.

It hit a tree.

Isabella died instantly.

Guilt had haunted Rachel for years.

If she had gone, maybe she could have helped.

Maybe things would be different.

But she never, ever thought...

"You think it's my fault because I didn't go?" she asked, horrified.

Alexander's silence was her answer.

"That's insane," she whispered.

"Victoria thinks you knew," he said, his voice flat.

"Knew what?"

"That the car had brake problems. That I'd been meaning to get it fixed."

Rachel stared at him, utterly bewildered.

"I didn't know anything about the car's brakes."

"Victoria says you overheard me talking about it. That you deliberately didn't go with Amelia that day. That you let her drive a death trap."

The accusation was so monstrous, so vile.

Rachel felt physically sick.

"You believe that?" she asked, her voice trembling.

"I don't know what to believe anymore," Alexander admitted.

He sounded broken.

"The investigation said it was an accident. Just a tragic accident."

"But Victoria... she's my son's grandmother. She's in his ear every day. Feeding him this poison."

"And you let her?" Rachel cried.

"What was I supposed to do? Lock him away from her? She's family."

"I was family!" Rachel shouted, her pain finally erupting.

"Wasn't I? I was going to be your wife!"

Alexander flinched.

"That was a long time ago."

The dismissal was a knife to her heart.

All those years.

All that pain.

And now this.

A child's hatred, fueled by a bitter woman.

And a man who was too weak to stop it.

Rachel took a deep, shaky breath.

She had to get out of there.

She couldn't stand to look at him for another second.

She turned to leave.

"Rachel, wait," Alexander said.

She stopped, but didn't turn around.

"Stay away from my son," he said, his voice low.

"Don't come here again."

The finality in his tone shattered her.

She walked out.

Each step felt heavy.

She made it to her car.

She slid inside and gripped the steering wheel.

Tears blurred her vision.

The past was a prison.

And she was still trapped inside.

She thought she had moved on.

She had Sebastian now.

She had a new life.

But the ghosts were still there.

Whispering.

Accusing.

A little boy's hate-filled eyes would haunt her forever.

She started the car.

She had to see Sebastian.

She needed to feel his arms around her.

She needed to hear him say it wasn't true.

She drove toward Sterling Enterprises.

Her mind was a storm of confusion and hurt.

She replayed that day over and over.

The phone call.

Her headache.

Isabella's cheerful voice.

"Come with me, Rachel! It'll be fun!"

Why did she say no?

Why did she stay home?

If she had gone, would Isabella still be alive?

Or would they both be dead?

She would never know.

And now, because of her absence, she was being accused of murder.

It was a nightmare.

She pulled into the underground garage at Sterling Enterprises.

She took the private elevator up to Sebastian's office.

The doors opened directly into his space.

He was at his desk, talking on the phone.

He looked up, saw her face, and immediately ended the call.

"Rachel? What's wrong?"

He was on his feet in an instant.

He came around the desk and took her hands.

They were ice cold.

She looked up at him, her eyes full of tears.

"Liam... Alexander's son... he said I killed his mother."

Sebastian's expression darkened.

"He what?"

"He said I caused the car accident. That I killed Isabella."

"That's ridiculous," Sebastian said, pulling her close.

"Who would tell a child such a lie?"

"Victoria," Rachel said, her voice muffled against his chest.

"And Alexander... he didn't deny it. He just let him believe it."

Sebastian held her tighter.

His body was tense with anger.

"I'll deal with my brother."

"No," Rachel said, pulling back.

"Please, Sebastian. Don't. It will only make things worse."

"He can't let his son believe that. He can't let that woman poison the boy against you."

"But he has," Rachel said, her heart breaking all over again.

"He told me to stay away. He doesn't want me near Liam."

Sebastian's jaw tightened.

He was silent for a moment.

Then he cupped her face in his hands.

"Listen to me. You are the most kind, caring person I know. You would never hurt anyone. Especially not Isabella. You loved her."

Rachel nodded, fresh tears falling.

"I did. I really did."

"I know," he said softly, wiping her tears away.

"This is Victoria's doing. She's a bitter, vengeful woman. She's always blamed you for everything."

"But why?"

"Because you were everything Isabella wasn't. Strong. Independent. Successful. She was jealous. And when Isabella died, she needed someone to blame. You were the easiest target."

It made a terrible kind of sense.

Rachel had always felt Victoria's dislike.

But she never imagined it could go this deep.

"This has to stop," Sebastian said, his voice firm.

"I won't let them destroy you with their lies."

"How?" Rachel asked.

"We'll find a way," he promised.

"We'll get the police reports. The mechanic's records. We'll prove it was an accident. Nothing more."

He sounded so sure.

So determined.

Rachel wanted to believe him.

She needed to believe him.

But a small, fearful part of her wondered.

What if they couldn't prove it?

What if the doubt remained forever?

What if a little boy's hatred was a seed that would never die?

She buried her face in Sebastian's shoulder.

She held onto him like he was her only anchor in a raging sea.

And for now, he was.

But the storm was far from over.

In fact, it was just beginning.

His swing gently nudged against mine. “I didn’t come because of you. I came because I wanted to.”

The setting sun wrapped his figure in a warm golden light. We sat together, watching the caregivers guide the children back inside.

A small boy turned at the doorway and waved in our direction. Julian instantly returned the gesture.

“Julian,” I began suddenly, “What if we—”

He turned toward me, his eyes bright with anticipation.

But I couldn’t bring myself to finish the thought.

Distant laughter echoed from the playground while wind whispered through the trees.

In that ordinary evening, within those lively grounds, I suddenly believed new beginnings could heal old wounds.

Snow began falling softly outside my window. I sat at my workstation, pen moving effortlessly across my drawing tablet.

“Daphne! Tea break!” My French coworker, Marine, tapped my desk and waved a box of macarons. “They’ve released a new pistachio flavor!”

In the lounge, artists from various countries enthusiastically discussed Christmas market preparations.

I accepted the black tea from Marine and joined the animated conversation about gingerbread house decorations.

This vibrant and welcoming environment was something I never could have envisioned before.

Having my own profession felt incredibly empowering.

Reintegrating into society brought me genuine joy.

My phone buzzed with a photo from Julian.

The orange tabby was playfully rolling with a new ball of yarn. Behind them, I spotted a half-finished hand-knitted scarf. He mentioned wanting to complete it before Christmas as my gift.

We hadn’t defined our relationship yet, and I found myself becoming comfortable with that uncertainty.

A smile touched my lips as I prepared to respond. Jonathan’s call suddenly flashed across my screen.

This marked his seventeenth attempt to contact me since our separation began.

His persistence mirrored his earlier pursuit of me.

But I had transformed. I wouldn’t make the same mistake again.

My thumb hovered briefly before firmly pressing the decline button.

Late evening found Jonathan’s shadow stretching across the Zander mansion floor beneath the chandelier.

Wendy huddled in the bed’s corner, clutching the sheets with pale, trembling hands.

Her post-miscarriage weakness had left her gaunt with pronounced dark circles beneath her eyes.

“Get up.” Jonathan stood beside the bed, his voice icy.

Wendy flinched but remained motionless.

“I said get up!” he suddenly shouted, tearing the blankets away.

She gasped sharply. Her thin nightgown provided no protection against the chill, raising instant goosebumps across her skin.

“Jonathan,” her voice shook, “The doctor prescribed rest.”

“Rest?” Jonathan sneered, grabbing her wrist and dragging her from the bed. “You destroyed my child and still expect rest?”

Wendy stumbled onto the carpet, her knees striking the floor painfully.

She looked up at Jonathan through welling tears. “It wasn’t me.”

A sharp slap silenced her words.

Jonathan bent down, gripping her chin with bone-crushing pressure. “If you and your mother hadn’t created all those scenes, Daphne would never have left me!”

Blood trickled from Wendy’s mouth, but she dared not wipe it away. “I’m sorry. I know I was wrong. Truly.”

“Wrong?” He released her face, wiping his hand disdainfully on his suit. “Tomorrow you will apologize to Daphne.”

Wendy’s head jerked upward. “What?”
###Chapter 36

“Get on your knees and beg her for mercy.” Jonathan turned his back, moving toward the liquor cabinet. “Tell her you’re the one who seduced me. Admit it was all your doing.”

Wendy’s face lost all color instantly.

“By tomorrow.” He pushed her aside roughly. She staggered and collapsed onto the floor like a shattered porcelain doll. “If Daphne doesn’t accept your apology, you and your mother will be thrown out of this city.”

The door slammed shut behind him. Wendy remained curled on the ground, weeping silently while clutching her abdomen.

The physical pain from her miscarriage still lingered faintly. But a deeper, colder ache gripped her as the truth settled in. To Jonathan, she had always been disposable. Replaceable.

She had believed herself special. Thought removing me would secure her place as the lady of the house.

She was mistaken.

Jonathan never truly cared. It was nothing more than a passing obsession.

Not long after, he shipped Wendy overseas to track me down.

I stirred my latte slowly, studying the weary woman across the table.

No amount of makeup could hide the dark circles under her eyes. Or the faint red mark on her left cheek.

“Ms. Lancaster.” Her hands were clenched tightly in her lap, knuckles bone-white. “Please. Have pity on me and my mother.”

I noticed her right hand drift unconsciously to her flat stomach.

“You’re apologizing to the wrong person,” I said quietly, setting my cup down. “It’s Jonathan you should be begging.”

Tears pooled in Wendy’s eyes.

“He won’t listen!” Her voice rose sharply before she remembered we were in public. She lowered it to a strained whisper. “Only you can make him stop. He demands I kneel to you! He even struck me yesterday…”

A waiter walked by carrying a tray of lemon water. Wendy flinched and quickly wiped her face.

Once he passed, she gritted her teeth. “He said if you don’t forgive me, he’ll exile me and my mother. But I was born here. I have nowhere else to go.”

Suddenly, she slid off her chair. Her knees hit the café floor with a hard thud.

“I’m begging you!” Her forehead nearly touched the tiles. “My mother is elderly. She can’t handle this stress. Please, just forgive me!”

Her dramatic move drew every eye in the café.

Even the waiter paused, uncertain whether to step in.

I drew a slow breath and leaned down to help her up. “Get off the floor. We can speak standing.”

But Wendy refused to move. “Not unless you promise.”

I looked down at her and let out a cold laugh.

“Then stay there.” My voice was steady. “You’re not afraid of Jonathan, Wendy. You’re afraid of losing the Zanders’ fortune.”

Her head snapped up. Her lips trembled. “That’s not—”

“If you weren’t so greedy, you could have left with your mother ages ago.”

I cut her off, my tone sharp with disdain.

“You’re kneeling here not out of desperation, but because you’re still gambling. Betting that I’ll pity you. Betting that I can sway Jonathan so you can remain his little mistress.”

Wendy’s face went ghostly pale.

“Stop acting like the victim.” I stood up, gazing down at her coldly. “I know exactly who you are. Should I list all the ways you seduced him? How you flaunted your ‘status’ in front of me?”

Her breathing grew ragged. She glanced around nervously, but had no retort.

“Kneel if you want.” I grabbed my bag and turned to leave. “But I’m not Jonathan. I don’t feel sorry for you.”

Suddenly, she lunged forward and seized my wrist. Her nails dug deep into my skin. “Daphne! How can you be so cruel?”
###Chapter 37

I pulled my hand away sharply and turned my back on her.

Her voice rose to a frantic pitch behind me, cutting through the café. “You believe you’ve triumphed? Alexander will never release you! You’ll never know peace again!”

The glass door swung shut, silencing her completely.

The sun outside was blinding. I shielded my eyes and checked my phone. A text from Sebastian glowed on the screen. [Finished? I’m at the corner bookstore.]

I glanced back at the café one final time.

Through the window, Victoria remained on her knees, her body trembling uncontrollably. I couldn't discern if her tears were genuine or just another performance.

That part of my life was finally closed.

The day our divorce was finalized, Sebastian brought me to the ocean.

Soft waves rolled onto the shore before retreating, leaving the sand dark and wet.

Sebastian stood where the water met the land, his sleeves pushed up, sifting through the sand with his fingers.

Oliver crouched nearby, head cocked, his tail sweeping arcs in the damp grains.

“Isabella!” Sebastian stood suddenly and beckoned. “Look what I discovered!”

I walked toward him barefoot, the cool water swirling around my ankles.

He uncurled his fingers. A smooth, blue-grey stone lay in his palm, polished to a shine by the sea.

“It reminds me of the ones we collected by the creek as children,” he said, smiling. The setting sun glittered in his eyes.

I took the stone. My fingers grazed the rough skin of his hand.

When we were eight, Sebastian took me to the creek after a heavy rain. He insisted on finding the most beautiful stones. He claimed they were treasures to be kept forever.

We returned home caked in mud, looking like drowned rats, and were scolded for hours.

“You told me they were dragon eggs,” I chuckled. “You said they would hatch and guard me.”

Sebastian rubbed his neck, his ears flushing pink. “I only wanted an excuse to shield you always.”

Oliver leaped at me suddenly, covering my dress with sandy paw prints.

Sebastian bent to brush them off, but the mischievous cat bumped him, sending him tumbling into the shallow water.

We both laughed until our sides ached at the absurd sight.

As the water crept higher, he took my hand and guided me back to dry sand.

He produced a small metal box from his jacket pocket and set it on the ground. The rusted lid still bore a faded cartoon decal. “Recall this?” He pried it open gently. Inside lay yellowed glass marbles, a crumpled candy wrapper, and a short pencil.

I picked up the wrapper, astonished. “This is from the orange candies we had in grade school!”

“You always shared yours with me,” His fingers traced the pencil, where the name “Isabella” was carved in clumsy letters. “That was the first time you showed me how to write your name.”

“Sebastian.” I cradled the marble. “Why do you…”

Why do you cherish me so?

“Because from the moment I saw you at six years old, I knew. I wanted to shield this girl.”

His voice was gentler than the ocean breeze.

“I adore you, Isabella.”

Oliver had scampered away, chasing seaweed left by the tide.

Sebastian drew a deep breath and sank to one knee in the soft sand. It wasn’t a proposal; he simply lowered himself to look directly into my eyes.

“I understand you doubt forever. I know you resist chains.”

“So I vow not forever. Only now. I wish to declare to the world that I am Isabella Lancaster’s boyfriend.”

The sea wind grew quiet. All I heard was the wild drumming of my own heart.
###Chapter 38

“I want to make your favorite corn chowder every morning. Help you organize all those sponsorship files. Even join forces to buy Oliver that expensive shampoo he despises.”

His voice dropped to a whisper. “Unless you’d prefer not to…”

I pressed a smooth stone against his temple. “I’d love that.”

Nobody had ever waited for me like this before.

Maybe it was the ocean breeze. Maybe it was the moonlight. I found myself kissing the edge of his mouth.

His arms locked around me. We stumbled together, falling into the soft sand in a laughing heap.

Oliver padded back on silent paws, sniffing our intertwined fingers with feline curiosity.

Sebastian laughed, scratching under the cat’s chin. “No more canned tuna without Papa’s approval.”

No wedding plans. No grand promises.

We had all the time in the world.

Meanwhile, Benjamin had gotten another woman pregnant.

The hospital corridor smelled of antiseptic and stale warmth. Benjamin leaned against the wall, waiting nervously.

He couldn’t believe it. Isabella had just lost her baby. Now Victoria was expecting.

Victoria emerged from the examination room, clutching an ultrasound printout. A faint smile played on her lips.

“Well?” William asked from his wheelchair. His health had deteriorated since his last major illness.

Victoria knelt gracefully beside him. She unfolded the paper across his lap. “The doctor says everything looks perfect. Six weeks along.” She pointed at the grainy image. “See those tiny buds? Those will become arms and legs.”

At this stage, it was impossible to distinguish any features.

William traced the ultrasound photo with trembling fingers. “Excellent. Truly excellent.”

He never imagined having another grandchild at his age. “Benjamin, come look at your little brother.”

Benjamin’s throat tightened.

He bent stiffly, glancing at the blurred black-and-white image.

That indistinct shadow felt like a bad omen. Cold dread crept up his spine.

Was this child his? Or his father’s?

“Don’t overexcite yourself,” Victoria said soothingly, rubbing William’s shoulder. “The doctor insisted you need calm.” She gazed up at Benjamin, her eyes deceptively gentle. “Benjamin will take excellent care of us, won’t you?”

Benjamin’s head pounded.

“Yes.” His voice came out rough and strained. “I’ll… take care of you.”

This child couldn’t be his.

That night, Benjamin sat alone in his room. He stared at his phone screen, secretly browsing my social media.

I had posted a new picture. It showed Sebastian’s back as he cooked in our kitchen. The caption read: “Home.”

The screen reflected his distorted face. Bloodshot eyes rimmed with exhaustion.

He couldn’t accept how quickly I had moved on. As if our decade together meant nothing.

The door opened softly.

Victoria entered carrying herbal tea. Her silk robe clung to a newly visible curve.

“Your father’s asleep.” She set the cup down, letting her fingers graze his hand. “The doctor says stress is bad for the baby.”

Benjamin shot to his feet. “What do you actually want?”

Victoria calmly wiped a drop of spilled liquor from her robe. “I want my child to legally carry the Sterling name.”

She continued smoothly. “Besides, you always wanted children. When Isabella couldn’t conceive, you blamed her constantly. You even found another woman to bear your child. Now that Isabella miscarried, I’m pregnant. Shouldn’t you be happy?”

Benjamin stared at her in horror. “Wait. Is this child really mine?”
###Chapter 39

Isabella gave a careless shrug. “Who can say? Perhaps it is.”

Liam’s eyes flushed a dangerous red. He itched to wrap his hands around her throat but held himself back.

His father was ecstatic about this pregnancy. If anything went wrong now, Liam would have no defense. More importantly, his father must never discover he had slept with Isabella.

This child, this child…

He had once craved an heir desperately. Now the very idea filled him with dread.

Regret washed over Liam in a cold wave. Why had he thrown everything away for the sake of a baby?

Neither Victoria nor Isabella loved him.

The only woman who truly had was gone—driven away by his own actions.

Liam stood before the bathroom mirror, fingers pressing hard into his temples.

The man reflected back had hollowed cheeks and shadows beneath his eyes. His sharp jawline stood out from recent weight loss.

Cold water dripped from his chin into the sink, each drop echoing in the quiet room.

“Liam, breakfast is ready,” William’s gruff voice called from downstairs.

Since Isabella’s pregnancy, the old man’s health had taken a surprising turn for the better.

Liam mechanically adjusted his tie. His hands shook slightly as he touched his throat.

He studied his pale face and suddenly remembered last night’s nightmare: the baby Isabella bore had his eyes, but called him “brother” in Eleanor’s voice.

A violent shudder ran through him. His headache pulsed worse.

“The doctor says the baby is perfectly healthy,” Isabella announced at the dining table. She pushed a glass of warm milk toward William. Her hand drifted over her rounded belly. “We can hear the heartbeat next week.”

William beamed, wrinkles crinkling at his eyes. “Liam, you will accompany Isabella to the appointment.”

Liam’s fork screeched against his plate.

He looked up and met Isabella’s gaze—smug and victorious.

Those eyes… so like Eleanor’s, but now he saw only cunning manipulation.

“I have a merger to finalize,” he said, dropping his napkin. His tone was hollow. “I’m leaving.”

He all but fled to the office.

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, sunlight streamed brightly. Yet Liam felt a deep chill settle in his bones.

He unlocked his phone and instinctively navigated to Eleanor’s social media.

The latest post was a candid shot of Sebastian’s back as he cooked in the kitchen—a photo she had taken secretly.

In the image, Sebastian’s sleeves were rolled up, revealing strong forearms.

A pot of soup simmered on the stove. Oliver sat on the counter, looking curiously about.

That cozy, domestic warmth seemed to bleed through the screen, piercing Liam straight through the heart.

It reminded him of when he and Eleanor had first married.

Except back then, she had been the one standing at the stove.

He suddenly locked his phone, grabbed a whiskey bottle from the cabinet, and took a long swig.

Meanwhile, I was arranging flowers with Sebastian.

“This Lisianthus has a perfect curve,” I said, holding up a pale purple bloom. “Would it look nice in the entryway vase?”

Sebastian was trimming stems. He glanced up and smiled. “It’s beautiful.”

He walked over and gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear. “But I believe a white tulip might complement it even better.”

Oliver tumbled playfully beneath the flower shelf, knocking over a pail of baby’s breath.

Tiny white petals clung to his orange fur like scattered stardust.

“You little troublemaker,” Sebastian murmured. He crouched down and scratched Oliver’s chin. Sunlight caught his eyelashes as he teased, “That’s one less fish treat for you tonight.”

I laughed softly and captured the moment with a quick photo.

Sebastian looked up at me, his expression tender. When he rose, his arms slid naturally around my waist. He pressed a soft kiss to the top of my head.
###Chapter 40

Liam jolted awake again, gasping.

The nightmare had returned.

For two years, he had been tormented by Isabella and their child. The stress had aged him beyond his years.

He pulled the crumpled paper rose from his drawer. A bitter smile touched his lips as he threw it away. Then he poured a full glass of whiskey.

The liquor burned his throat. Suddenly, he remembered. Years ago, how my eyes had sparkled whenever I held that paper rose.

But now. My latest social media post showed two hands clasped together. The caption read: “Slow and steady wins the race.”

He couldn't take it anymore. He broke down completely, sobbing into his hands.

The week before Christmas Eve brought the first snow.

I was curled on the sofa under a blanket, watching a film. Oliver purred softly on my lap.

Sebastian was busy in the kitchen. The rich scent of beef bourguignon filled the apartment.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, snow fell silently.

“Victoria.” Sebastian peeked out from the kitchen. “Can you grab the cinnamon from the top shelf?”

I scratched Oliver’s head and stood. My bare feet sank into the plush rug.

Reaching for the small brown bottle, I felt arms suddenly encircle me from behind.

“Got you,” Sebastian murmured, his chin resting on my head.

His hand covered mine, easily retrieving the spice jar. But he didn't release me.

“The beef will burn,” I laughed, nudging him playfully.

“I didn’t need the cinnamon.” He turned me gently, pressing me against the counter. The stove’s flame flickered in his eyes. “I just wanted to hold you.”

Oliver had padded over. He sat at our feet, head tilted, observing us.

Sebastian bent and scooped him up. He placed the cat in my arms. “Let’s take this little chaperone to the balcony.” He wrapped the three of us in a large blanket like a giant cocoon.

Oliver wriggled free and pounced on the thin layer of snow dusting the railing.

We watched the snow fall. Then Sebastian pulled a small box from his pocket.

“What’s this?” I asked.

“I had this ring made when you were still with him.”

He opened the box. A simple platinum band lay inside.

“I’ve held onto it. I have other rings, but this one felt right.” Oliver suddenly jumped and batted the box. The ring tumbled into my palm. It felt cold, yet it burned.

Sebastian rarely spoke of his years loving me from afar. He only hinted at it sometimes, in unguarded moments. “Victoria,” he whispered, holding my trembling hand. His voice was softer than the falling snow. “I know you don’t believe in forever. So I won’t promise that.”

“I just want to be the next name on your marriage certificate.”

In the distance, church bells began to ring. Oliver’s tail brushed gently against my ankle.

“Okay,” I heard myself say, my voice lost in the quiet night. “But you have to add Oliver’s paw print too.”

Sebastian froze, as if paused. Oliver meowed impatiently. Finally, Sebastian snapped out of it. With shaking hands, he slid the ring onto my finger.

It fit perfectly. It shimmered with a soft silver glow under the snowy sky.

“I wrote a whole speech,” he mumbled into my neck, his voice thick. “I forgot every word.”

I smiled, kissing his reddened ear. “This was better.”

A sudden poof came from the kitchen.

Oliver immediately scratched at the glass door, alarmed. Sebastian dashed to save our dinner, but he never let go of my hand.

We stumbled into the kitchen together, laughing. The windows were fogged from the steam. Three blurry shadows were cast upon the glass.

Outside, the first snow continued to fall. It covered every trace of the paths we had walked before.

(The End)
