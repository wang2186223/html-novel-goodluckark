###Chapter 1: She Finally Woke Up

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers trembled slightly as she pushed open the gates of Royal Gardens.

The servants' whispers floated from behind the flower trellis:
"Didn't Lord Alex take Miss Winslow to the gala last night? How dare she show her face here?"
"I heard Miss Winslow has already moved into Alex's private estate. Yet this one still won't leave."
"Tsk tsk, acting like she's the lady of the house..."

Seven years. She'd walked this corridor to the master bedroom countless times, but today it felt endless.

"Miss Sinclair," Mrs. Wilson suddenly blocked her path with a plastic smile, "Lord Alex has made it clear his bedroom is off-limits to outsiders."

Outsiders?

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

Yesterday's car accident hadn't killed her, but Alexander Kingsley's words now tore her heart open.

"Move." Her voice was soft but carried an icy finality.

Mrs. Wilson took an exaggerated step back. "Miss Sinclair, don't make this difficult for us servants. If anything valuable goes missing—"

"Auntie Wilson," Evelyn suddenly smiled, "After seven years as the Kingsleys' lapdog, haven't you learned to read the room?"

The sound of polished shoes clicking against marble echoed behind her.

Evelyn turned to meet Alexander's glacial stare.

Morning light gilded his silhouette but couldn't melt the frost in his eyes.

"Apologize." His first words were a command.

Evelyn studied the man she'd loved for thirteen years and suddenly saw a stranger.

"Why?" she whispered. "Because she's your new lover's distant relative? Or because I mean less to you than a stray dog?"

Alexander's brow furrowed as he seized her wrist.

White-hot pain blinded Evelyn—his grip perfectly aligned with her car accident injuries.

"It hurts..." She instinctively struggled.

Alexander slammed her against the wall, his breath hot against her ear: "Stop acting. You put on quite the performance when you crashed my club last night."

Evelyn shuddered.

She'd gone to beg for her sister Sophie's life, but he'd mistaken desperation for manipulation.

"Sophie needs—"

"Enough." Alexander cut her off. "Stop using your sister as an excuse."

He tore open her collar with the brutality of dismantling an object, not touching a person.

Staring at the swaying chandelier, Evelyn remembered the crystal light fixture twelve-year-old Alexander had gifted her.

He'd said he chose it specially because the glow complemented her.

How pathetic—she'd mistaken charity for love.

Afterward, Alexander adjusted his tie with mechanical precision. "Grandfather's birthday next month. Behave."

So that's why he'd returned—to ensure she wouldn't speak out of turn before the Kingsleys.

Evelyn wrapped herself in the sheets and suddenly laughed.

"What's so funny?" Alexander frowned.

"Nothing," she murmured. "I just finally understand."

The wardrobe doors slid open, revealing rows of white dresses that stung her eyes.

All these years, she'd molded herself into Alexander's ideal, erasing her true self.

The cruelest joke? She'd believed herself special—until seeing Isabella Winslow glowing in scarlet on his arm.

It wasn't that he disliked color. Just her in color.

Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows as Evelyn methodically packed each white dress into her suitcase.

At the very bottom, she found a forgotten floral sundress—the last gift from her late mother.

The dam broke.

She slipped into the dress and wiped her tears before the mirror.

The reflection showed clear-eyed determination, as if she'd traveled back thirteen years to before she'd met Alexander.

Her credit card remained on the vanity, along with all those years of foolish devotion.

From this day forward, Evelyn Sinclair's name would never again be tied to Alexander Kingsley.
###Chapter 2: Rebirth

Sunlight filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Sinclair stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling slightly over the graduate school admission notification.

She immediately dialed the memorized number.

"Alex, I got the recommendation for grad school!" Her voice brimmed with excitement.

A cold laugh came through the phone. "Julian helped you again, didn't he?"

Evelyn's smile froze.

"Evelyn," Alexander Kingsley's voice turned icy. "Can't you achieve anything without relying on men?"

The phone slipped from her hand, landing on the carpet with a dull thud.

That day, she tore up the admission form—along with her dreams.

Looking back now, it all seemed absurd.

......

The glow of the computer screen reflected off Evelyn's pale face as she mechanically submitted resume after resume.

The Kingsley family's supplementary credit card sat on the desk corner like a burning brand.

From now on, she wouldn't touch a single cent from them.

Ding—

A new email notification popped up.

[Horizon Media Interview Invitation]

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

Three years ago, she'd rejected Horizon's offer. Now fate had circled back to give her another chance.

The sharp scent of hospital disinfectant hit her as she entered.

"Sis!" Sophie's delighted voice called from the hospital room.

The sharp-eyed girl immediately noticed Evelyn's stiff gait, her small face scrunching in concern. "You're hurt?"

Evelyn paused.

Last night, she'd fallen hard at the airport while chasing the surgeon. Yet Alexander had kept her up until dawn without noticing her bruises.

"Just a strained back," she forced a smile, ruffling Sophie's thinning hair.

Sophie suddenly grabbed her hand. "When I get better, I'll work so Alex can't yell at you anymore."

Evelyn's nose stung.

Even a ten-year-old could see what she'd refused to acknowledge for years.

......

Horizon Media's skyscraper towered before her.

The interviewer frowned at her resume. "Your qualifications are impressive, Ms. Sinclair, but there's a three-year gap..."

"I'll start at entry-level," Evelyn straightened her spine.

"The monthly salary would only be six thousand."

"That's fine."

The interviewer looked up in surprise. "Entertainment reporters work long hours, travel frequently, even—"

"I can handle it," Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "I can start immediately."

Leaving HR, she froze mid-step.

At the end of the hallway, Julian Ashford stood smiling at her. Sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows gilded his silhouette.

"Welcome back, Evelyn."
###Chapter 3: When Love Fades, the Pain Disappears

"Long time no see, junior." Julian Ashford stood in the light, his lips curved in that familiar smile.

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers trembled slightly. "Senior, it's been a while."

She thought he was still abroad.

After all, when he left, he'd said he wouldn't appear before her again—to avoid complications.

She never expected to meet him here.

"Did he agree to let you work?" Julian took her onboarding documents, his tone casual.

Evelyn's breath hitched before she forced a smile. "We broke up."

Julian froze mid-step. Surprise flickered behind his glasses. "Does the Kingsley family know?"

"No need for them to." Her voice remained steady. "He ended it."

The memory of Eleanor Kingsley threatening suicide to force their relationship still haunted her.

Love obtained through coercion was nothing but a farce.

"You've suffered." Julian's gaze drifted to the Entertainment Department's sign. "If you don't like it here—"

"It's fine." Evelyn cut him off. "I enjoy this job."

She owed him too much already.

The Entertainment Department buzzed with activity.

"Isabella Winslow had to announce her relationship today, didn't she? Ruining everyone's evening." Martha Nash sucked on a lollipop and slammed a stack of photos onto the desk.

Evelyn's heart clenched.

So soon?

She'd left Royal Gardens this morning. By afternoon, their official announcement was already circulating.

He couldn't even wait a single day.

"New girl!" Martha suddenly pointed at her. "These are fresh exclusives. Give me copy in two minutes!"

"Help us out, will you?" Simon York handed her several photos with an ingratiating smile.

No one dared mistreat someone brought in by Julian.

Especially when Evelyn was breathtakingly beautiful—enough to make even jaded entertainment reporters hold their breath.

Evelyn took the photos, her fingers unnaturally steady.

One minute later, the copy was submitted.

Her heart remained perfectly calm.

There was a time when just hearing Isabella's name would make it hard to breathe.

Turns out letting go wasn't as difficult as she'd imagined.

The photos were taken late last night.

Alexander Kingsley stood at the club entrance, gently draping a coat over Isabella's shoulders.

That was around the same time Evelyn had been turned away at the door.

So he did have time. Just not for her.

Isabella, heiress to the Winslow fortune and graduate of Imperial Media University's acting program, flourished in entertainment under Alexander's patronage.

They did make a striking couple.

...

The phone rang while Evelyn stared blankly at her screen.

"Where are you?" Alexander's voice was glacial.

She answered reflexively. "I—"

"Be back in thirty minutes."

The line went dead.

Evelyn clutched her phone and suddenly laughed.

Her screen still displayed Alexander and Isabella's tender moment.

At 1:30 AM, he still remembered to check on her?

How ironic.

She used to wait obediently for him. Now he thought he could order her around?

Evelyn powered off her phone.

"Breaking news!" Simon jumped up. "I got footage of them ring shopping!"

The office erupted.

On screen, Alexander and Isabella leaned close together, surveying an array of glittering jewels.

So this was the "important business" that kept him from seeing her.

Evelyn quietly closed her laptop.

This time, there was no pain.
###Chapter 4: Her Misplaced Devotion, His Heartless Betrayal

The True Love jewelry store glinted harshly under the sunlight.

Evelyn Sinclair stood across the street, watching the perfect couple walk arm-in-arm into the boutique. Alexander Kingsley's tall frame was rigid as a pine, while Isabella Winslow clung to him with a radiant smile.

A memory surfaced—her fifteen-year-old self.

She'd once pressed her face against True Love's display window, mesmerized by a diamond wedding ring. Alexander had dragged her away with a scowl, though his ears had turned pink.

"You'll buy it for me someday, Alex!" she'd chirped.

"Fine," he'd muttered without looking back.

That simple promise had become her most cherished hope.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Thirty minutes." Alexander's voice was glacial.

Evelyn stepped into an alley. "What do you want?"

"Where are you?" The sound of knuckles cracking carried through the line.

Gazing at True Love's sign, she laughed softly. "Watching you two pick out an engagement ring."

Silence.

"Evelyn," he bit out each syllable, "are you trying to die?"

"Congratulations." Her tone was breezy. "Finally getting rid of your burden."

She hung up, blocked the number, then powered off her phone.

Dawn reflected off Horizon Tower's glass facade.

"Get some rest, but keep your phone on." Martha Nash patted her shoulder. "The Isabella situation is cooling down, but we need to monitor—"

There won't be updates.

Evelyn watched the pale morning sky. If the Kingsleys consented, Alexander could marry Isabella tomorrow.

A silver Maserati pulled up silently.

The window lowered, revealing Julian Ashford's striking features. "Get in."

As colleagues' laughter approached behind her, Evelyn hastily entered.

"Where to?" Julian handed her a warm milk carton.

"A hotel." The heat seeped into her chilled fingers.

"Still overworking." His chuckle held fondness. "Remember in America when—"

"Julian!" She cut him off sharply.

Silence filled the car.

"He'll never know, will he?" Julian's grip whitened on the steering wheel. "What you sacrificed—"

"It's over." She turned to the window.

Love wasn't charity or repayment. She and Alexander had reached this point through their own choices.

Her phone buzzed to life with dozens of missed calls.

A new text flashed: [Don't you dare ignore me again.]

She calmly blocked the number.

The Maserati stopped at a five-star hotel.

"This is too much." Evelyn shook her head.

"Company expense." Julian pressed the keycard into her hand. "Rest."

As he turned away, darkness flickered in his eyes.

She'd left the Kingsley mansion with nothing—not even spare clothes. Alexander truly was merciless.

The suite's floor-to-ceiling windows framed a river view worthy of a painting.

Evelyn hit the curtain switch. When the last sliver of light vanished, she finally let tears fall.

Two days ago replayed vividly.

Isabella had stolen her butterfly brooch—her mother's only keepsake—in her absence.

At Kingsley Group headquarters, Evelyn had slapped Isabella. Alexander emerged to find Isabella weeping dramatically.

"Alex, she accused me of theft—"

"It was the butterfly brooch!" Evelyn's lips trembled.

"Enough." Alexander's voice could freeze hell. "Even if she took it, violence is unacceptable. You're spoiled rotten, Evelyn."

Yes, she'd been spoiled.

Spoiled enough to believe Alexander would always indulge her.

"I hit her. What will you do about it?" She lifted her chin defiantly.

His glare turned arctic. "Apologize, or forget being Mrs. Kingsley."

Her voice shook. "And if I refuse?"

"Then we're done." No hesitation. "Choose: apology or breakup."
###Chapter 5: The Truth About the Butterfly Brooch

Tears fell silently, soaking the pillowcase.

Alexander Kingsley had completely forgotten the story behind that butterfly brooch.

Or perhaps, he never cared to remember.

At thirteen, Evelyn Sinclair had clutched three years' worth of saved allowance and gone alone to the auction.

She stood in the last row, watching helplessly as bidding paddles rose again and again for the multicolored diamond butterfly brooch.

The final price was ten times her entire savings.

She cried under her blankets for seven straight days after returning home.

On the eighth midnight, Alexander kicked open her bedroom door.

"Take it."

The butterfly brooch landed in her lap, its diamonds glittering in the moonlight.

"When a Kingsley wants something, they take it." He looked down at her coldly. "If you can't take it yourself, come find me."

Evelyn cradled the brooch, tears welling as she gazed up.

Suddenly, Alexander flicked her forehead.

"Keep crying and I'll take it back."

That was the first—and only—time he showed her tenderness.

Orphaned too young, it was Alexander who taught her how to survive among the elite.

"Fight for what you want," he'd told her. "If you can't win, I'll fight for you."

Now she'd finally learned to fight.

And he called her spoiled, demanding to break off their engagement.

How ironic.

The phone's shrill ring shattered her memories.

Martha Nash's roar exploded through the receiver: "Alexander sent a cease and desist letter!"

Evelyn rushed to check out.

The front desk clerk smiled sweetly. "Your room is prepaid for a month."

She insisted on leaving, transferring the remaining balance to Julian Ashford.

[Senior, consider this an IOU.]

Horizon Media was in an uproar.

"He took her ring shopping! Put his coat around her shoulders! Seven years of secret dating confirmed!" Martha waved the legal letter. "Now he's suing us for defamation? Bullshit!"

Evelyn accepted her copy.

"Why am I the primary defendant?"

"Picking the easy target." Martha rolled her eyes. "The whole company got sued, but you got special attention."

Simon York whistled. "Junior's article broke click records. Alexander's panicking."

Others chimed in: "He wouldn't lash out unless every word was true."

Evelyn looked pointedly at Martha. "The editor-in-chief said there wouldn't be major repercussions."

Martha crunched her lollipop. "I'll piss on the Kingsley family graves!"

Legal department staff came for her ID.

Alexander was specifically suing over Horizon Entertainment's exposé about his seven-year secret affair with Isabella Winslow—Evelyn's all-nighter masterpiece.

As she reached for her wallet, a slender hand intercepted.

Rip.

The letter became confetti in Julian Ashford's grip.

"Let him sue." The crown prince's expression turned glacial. "Can't handle the truth?"

No one had more right to condemn Alexander than Evelyn.

The legal team hesitated.

Julian's gaze sharpened. "Can't Horizon protect one employee?"

He'd never let Evelyn stand in a defendant's box.

Alexander didn't deserve that privilege.

...

"Still nothing?"

The Kingsley Group CEO's office radiated lethal tension.

Ethan Miller's back was drenched in sweat.

Alexander's expression hadn't softened since last night.

Miss Sinclair had vanished.

"Check spending records." Alexander massaged his temples.

A shattered phone and snapped credit card lay on the desk.

Ethan's legs still trembled remembering last night's scene.

"Already did... no transactions."

"Hotels?"

"N-none either."

Dead silence spread.

Ethan held his breath.

"Horizon's side?" Alexander's eyes were bloodshot.

Ethan nearly wept. "They refused to retract... said bring it on..."

Crash!

The coffee table exploded under Alexander's kick.

Ethan almost dropped to his knees.

Forty-eight hours without sleep.

"Lord Alex, the jet's ready." Nathan Carter appeared timely.

Alexander fastened his cufflinks, storming out with stormcloud eyes.

Ethan moved to speak, but Nathan's look stopped him.

Work always came first for Alexander.

Especially over some woman he despised...

"Call the police. Pull surveillance." Alexander threw over his shoulder.

Ethan scrambled for the phone fragments and card.

The SIM card might still work.

The broken card needed immediate replacement.

"Madam asked about Miss Winslow..." Ethan forced out before takeoff.

Alexander's glacial stare froze him.

Ethan hastily offered the new phone and replacement card: "Police are already notified."

As the runway blurred past the window, Alexander's jaw tightened.

That scheming Evelyn—always wanting more than her due.
###Chapter 6: Direct Confrontation

"Evelyn, don't believe a single word of those gossip articles!" Eleanor Kingsley's voice trembled with fury. "They're all fabricated lies! They'll write anything for clicks!"

"You're the only daughter-in-law we recognize in the Kingsley family. No one else stands a chance!"

"I already called and gave Alexander an earful..." Though the call never went through, leaving Ethan Miller to bear the brunt of her wrath.

"Aunt Eleanor, I'm fine." Evelyn Sinclair's tone remained steady.

Eleanor exhaled deeply. "Evelyn, you're always so understanding. That stubborn boy does care for you—he just won't admit it. Once you're married, he'll treat you right."

He does care for you...

Evelyn had heard those words too many times.

She used to cling to that hope, but reality had slapped her hard. Love couldn't be faked—it either existed or it didn't.

Expecting a man who treated her with indifference before marriage to suddenly become affectionate afterward?

Wishful thinking.

She still couldn't bring herself to say the words to end it.

If there was one thing Evelyn regretted about this dying relationship, it was hurting Eleanor.

But the truth would come out soon enough.

The staff at Royal Gardens wouldn't keep her secrets forever.

......

"Evelyn, you and Charlie are covering the Starlight Awards in the capital tonight." Martha Nash lowered her voice. "Isabella Winslow will be there. Get her to admit something—anything. Once she confirms it publicly, let's see how Alexander Kingsley dares to sue you."

The Starlight Awards carried little prestige in the industry, which was why seasoned reporters avoided them.

Originally assigned to someone else, the task now fell to Evelyn, the rookie. Surprisingly, her colleagues rallied behind her.

"Go get 'em, rookie! Bring back solid evidence to shove in Alexander's face!"

"We've got your back!"

"Just sneak under their bed and snap the proof—victory will be yours!"

Good grief...

Martha nodded. "Crude but true. Do your best, Evelyn."

Though the "Crown Prince" had promised protection, Kingsley Group's influence was formidable. A head-on collision would benefit no one.

If Alexander insisted on suing Evelyn, would Horizon Media really risk a feud with Kingsley Group over one junior reporter?

More likely, they'd throw her under the bus immediately.

Martha studied Evelyn's delicate profile with a quiet sigh.

The girl had beauty, talent—everything but luck.

A meteoric rise followed by an equally swift fall.

Crossing Alexander Kingsley, that living demon, meant either destruction or losing a layer of skin.

......

Charlie had already set up the camera.

At the Starlight Awards, Isabella Winslow's lips stayed sealed tighter than a clam.

Reporters swarmed, only to be blocked by bodyguards.

"Miss Winslow, is your relationship with Alexander Kingsley real?"

"Isabella! Is that diamond ring on your finger an engagement ring?"

"How do you respond to Alexander's lawsuit against the media for spreading rumors?"

Isabella ignored them all, maintaining a flawless smile as she hurried away.

Evelyn didn't join the frenzy.

She and Charlie headed straight for Isabella's hotel, aiming for the heart of the matter.

Martha had given her this chance to fight for survival.

But...

Evelyn scanned the lurking paparazzi around them.

She wasn't the only one with this idea.

"Waiting here won't get us anything useful," Evelyn murmured.

Everyone was fixated on Isabella's hotel window, desperate for even a shadowy glimpse.

The problem? Alexander wasn't even in the capital...

"I'll go up." Evelyn loosened her pinned-up hair.

Charlie blinked at the cascade of dark silk, then snapped back to attention. "Eve, this is Karl's Boutique. How are you getting in?"

The five-star members-only hotel restricted ordinary guests to the lower ten floors.

Isabella occupied a VIP suite on the fifteenth.

Evelyn pushed aside foliage in the landscaped path. "I have a card."

From Eleanor.

Investigating her ex-fiancé's new flame wasn't painless.

But Evelyn needed this job. Needed the money. Sophie still lay in the hospital, clinging to hope.

More evidence meant better odds.

Alexander wanted to sue her?

Fine.

She'd meet him head-on.

His lawsuit would become the stepping stone to her career.

Charlie watched Evelyn stride into the hotel lobby.

Under the glittering lights, her poised elegance made her indistinguishable from the elite clientele.

Rubbing his eyes, Charlie wondered—

With Julian Ashford's special treatment of Evelyn...

Was the Crown Prince secretly grooming his girlfriend here?

......

Evelyn requested a fifteenth-floor suite.

The front desk nearly refused until spotting the name on her card. A manager was summoned, and her stay was promptly arranged.

Evelyn exhaled inwardly.

Her biggest fear had been Isabella booking the entire floor.

Fortunately, Eleanor's membership carried enough weight.

The VIP elevator held only Evelyn. Mid-ascent, her phone rang—Isabella's number flashing unexpectedly.

"Miss Sinclair, I assume you've seen everything by now."

Isabella's voice dripped with triumphant glee.
###Chapter 7: Unexpected Encounter

Evelyn's fingertip tapped lightly on the screen. "What am I supposed to see?" Her voice remained calm.

"The news about Alexander and me getting engaged," Isabella's laughter crackled through the phone. "We just picked out the diamond ring yesterday. Don't tell me you're still in the dark?"

"Is that so?" Evelyn's tone didn't waver. "But I heard he's preparing to sue the media for spreading rumors. This so-called official announcement seems to be your doing alone."

The laughter died abruptly.

"Evelyn Sinclair," Isabella's voice turned sharp. "Your family is already in ruins, yet you still put on this act of superiority?"

"Alexander isn't going public yet because he's worried about the stock prices of both companies," Isabella's words grew more heated. "Even if reporters ask him directly, he'll deny it. But the ring is real, and so are our feelings!"

Evelyn traced the edge of her phone absently. "Seeing isn't always believing."

"Horizon Media just published our seven-year love story today!" Isabella nearly hissed through gritted teeth. "Go read it—it's all solid proof!"

Evelyn suddenly asked, "Would you stake the Winslow family's reputation on it?"

"Of course! My word is the Winslow family's stance!"

"Good. Then I wish you happiness."

The moment the call ended, Evelyn swiftly slipped into the emergency stairwell. Her fingers moved deftly as she edited the recording, encrypting and saving the crucial segments.

"Martha," she dialed another number, her voice steady. "I have Isabella admitting to the relationship on tape."

"My God!" Martha gasped on the other end. "The entire industry couldn't get her to talk. How did you manage it?"

Evelyn allowed herself a faint smile. "Luck was on my side."

After hanging up, she paused in thought before calling another contact. "Charlie, keep watching tonight. Update me immediately if anything happens."

A tiny camera embedded in her bag's clasp glinted faintly.

Alexander Kingsley, you brought this upon yourself.

......

The elevator doors slid open on the fifteenth floor of Karl's Boutique Hotel.

Alexander strode forward, phone pressed to his ear.

"Lord Alex," Ethan's voice carried tension. "Madam Kingsley has followed you to the capital. She's staying right next door in 1553!"

Alexander's steps faltered. "You're certain it's her?"

"The hotel registered her exclusive card." Ethan swallowed hard. "She seems... emotionally unstable at the moment."

Alexander's gaze landed on the door ahead—1553.

Without hesitation, he turned toward the emergency exit. Years of experience had taught him to avoid his mother when she was in a rage.

Evelyn had just pushed open the door to the hallway when a tall figure suddenly stepped into the stairwell.

Their eyes met in the dim lighting.

The air between them froze.
###Chapter 8: How Dare You Compare Yourself to Her

The motion-activated light flickered in the stairwell.

Evelyn Sinclair stood at the border between light and shadow, her figure seemingly split in two.

Alexander Kingsley's footsteps halted abruptly.

He barely recognized the woman before him.

The Evelyn who always wore white dresses now sported a black motorcycle jacket over a wine-red velvet blouse. Skinny jeans accentuated her slender legs.

She'd even cut her hair short, the curled ends brushing against her collarbones.

Bold. Rebellious.

Alexander's pupils constricted.

The Evelyn in his memory had always been docile and obedient—white dresses, straight black hair, like a still ink painting.

But now...

"Following me?" His voice turned glacial. "Since when did you resort to such cheap tactics, Evelyn?"

Her fingers absently traced the strap of her shoulder bag.

She hadn't expected to encounter Alexander here.

Nor had she anticipated his immediate accusation upon their reunion.

"I'm here for an interview," she said calmly.

Alexander scoffed, his gaze sweeping over her new attire. "Dressed like that for an interview?"

He stepped forward, trapping her against the wall. "Or did you know Isabella would be here tonight?"

Her back pressed against the cold surface.

His familiar cedarwood scent mixed with faint traces of alcohol surrounded her.

"So," she met his eyes directly, "the rumors about you and Isabella Winslow are true?"

Darkness flashed in Alexander's gaze.

He seized her wrist with bruising force.

"Is this your game?" Danger laced his words. "Did you think a makeover would make me notice you?"

Evelyn struggled futilely against his grip.

A humorless smile curved her lips. "Why so defensive, Mr. Kingsley? Afraid I'll ruin your plans?"

His knuckles whitened.

He searched her eyes for the familiar adoration and timidity.

Only calm indifference stared back.

The realization unsettled him.

"Who I choose is none of your concern." Releasing her with disdain, he sneered, "Don't humiliate yourself, Evelyn."

She rubbed her reddened wrist.

She should be used to this by now.

Alexander never gave her straight answers.

"I read that article," she said softly. "The evidence seemed compelling."

His expression darkened.

"Evidence?" He laughed coldly. "Reporters will fabricate anything for clicks. Just like you'll use any means to get close to me."

The words pierced her heart.

Yet she merely lifted her chin. "So you deny the relationship with Isabella?"

Alexander suddenly gripped her chin.

"Evelyn," his voice dropped dangerously low, "since when do you speak to me like this?"

His thumb traced her lower lip with deceptive gentleness, his eyes glacial.

"Have I been too lenient with you lately?"

Her breath caught.

She knew that look too well.

That mocking half-smile always preceded his punishments.

"Answer me," she persisted. "You and Isabella—"

"Enough!" He released her violently. "Evelyn, how dare you compare yourself to her?"

The words stabbed like a knife.

She bit her lip until copper flooded her mouth.

The recorder in her bag kept running.

She needed this confirmation.

"So it's true then? You're together?"

Alexander studied her before smiling cruelly.

"What if we are?" He adjusted his cufflinks leisurely. "Surely you didn't think I'd choose you over Isabella?"

Her nails dug into her palms.

Her expression remained unreadable.

"Thank you for the interview, Mr. Kingsley." She inclined her head slightly. "I wish you happiness."

Turning to leave, she found her arm seized again.

"Just like that?" Disbelief colored his voice. "What game are you playing now, Evelyn?"

She turned back with a flawless smile.

"The interview," she said softly, "is over."

Alexander's pupils dilated.

Suddenly, he realized—this Evelyn felt different.

The girl who once gazed at him with adoration now looked at him like a stranger.

The realization tightened his chest.

"Evelyn," he ground out her name, "you think this act will make me notice you?"

She freed herself effortlessly.

"You flatter yourself." She stepped back politely. "I'm simply doing my job."

Her spine remained straight as she walked away.

Alexander stood frozen, watching her disappear around the stairwell corner.

An unsettling sensation crept over him—as though something vital was slipping through his fingers.
###Chapter 9: The Moment the Mask Shattered

Evelyn Sinclair's fingertips trembled slightly.

She stared into Alexander Kingsley's eyes, waiting for the answer that would crush him.

If he dared admit it.

She would humiliate this arrogant man in court.

"Did Isabella send you?" Alexander suddenly closed the distance between them.

Before Evelyn could react, he seized her wrist and yanked her against his unyielding chest.

"Don't move," he growled.

A camera flash briefly illuminated the stairwell.

Alexander moved swiftly, pulling her into the hallway and slamming the fire door shut.

Evelyn's face pressed against his chest, his familiar cold cologne filling her senses.

"Your doing?" He threw her onto the bed the moment they entered the room.

His icy gaze raked over her. "I warned you not to scheme for public recognition."

His grip on her jaw made her wince.

Evelyn suddenly laughed. "You overestimate yourself, Lord Alex."

Once, she might have hoped. But now...

"You and I are nothing to each other."

Alexander released her and adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm.

"Remember those words."

He pulled a black card from his wallet and tossed it onto the bed.

"Behave before Grandfather's birthday banquet."

Evelyn eyed the card with bitter amusement.

She flicked it away. "Is this hush money?"

Alexander's expression darkened. He threw a blue velvet box at her.

The True Love logo burned her eyes.

Inside lay a multicolored diamond dragonfly brooch, its facets gleaming coldly under the lights.

"Like it?" His tone dripped sarcasm.

Evelyn lifted the brooch, its sharp edges digging into her palm.

"Did you buy this..." she asked softly, "with Isabella's butterfly brooch?"

Alexander frowned. "What difference does it make?"

Evelyn doubled over with laughter.

Tears welled in her eyes before she tossed the brooch back into the box.

"Thank you for your generosity, Lord Alex."

Alexander's eyes flashed. He hauled her upright.

"Two million plus this isn't enough?"

Evelyn tilted her head defiantly. "The lobby's swarming with reporters. Aren't you afraid they'll catch the great Alexander Kingsley with his ex in a hotel room?"

She leaned closer, her breath brushing his jaw. "Imagine the headlines—"

"Evelyn!" He shoved her away violently.

Disgust churned in his eyes. "Finally showing your true colors?"

Evelyn smoothed her rumpled collar and smiled brightly. "Why pretend?"

She picked up the brooch box and weighed it in her hand.

"I'll keep this." Walking toward the door, she added, "Best wishes to you and Isabella."

Her fingers touched the doorknob.

A deafening crash echoed behind her.

Alexander had smashed the vase on the coffee table.

"Get out!"

Evelyn didn't look back as she opened the door.

At the end of the hallway, another camera flash went off.
###Chapter 10: Relentless Schemes

The ringing phone shattered the morning silence.

Alexander Kingsley groped across the nightstand, his fingers meeting only cold wood. "Evelyn..." he murmured instinctively.

The name barely left his lips when he jolted awake.

His bleary eyes cleared instantly, replaced by icy sharpness. He stared at the empty nightstand where a glass of warm water should have been.

For years, this had been his routine.

Waking to perfectly tempered water—sometimes infused with lemon—because his work demanded constant availability. That glass was always there.

Except today.

He remembered with crystal clarity: Evelyn Sinclair had slept on the living room sofa last night.

The phone kept ringing.

Alexander answered hoarsely, "Speak."

"Lord Alex, Horizon Media just released Miss Winslow's phone recording." Ethan Miller's voice held tension. "She admitted to the relationship with you in it."

Alexander's brow darkened.

Horizon was determined to defy him. Even after the cease and desist letter, they dared to leak more.

"Investigate Isabella," he ordered coldly.

Hanging up, Alexander moved to the window. Sunlight spilled over his face but couldn't melt the frost in his gaze.

Evelyn's words from last night surfaced. His lips curled.

Finally showing your true colors?

Good. Let the world see.

Descending the stairs, his attention snagged on a white dress displayed in the boutique window. Ethan appeared promptly, holding a bank card and jewelry box.

"Left by Miss Sinclair."

Alexander didn't glance at them. "Where is she?"

"Gone."

"Let her be." His laugh was brittle. "The same trick loses its charm the second time."

Exiting the hotel, he immediately spotted lurking paparazzi. So Evelyn hadn't given up yet.

Ethan hurried after him with a shopping bag containing the white dress.

"The Patriarch's birthday banquet..." Ethan ventured carefully. "If Miss Sinclair attends..."

Alexander gave a slight nod.

A dress was a small price to silence her.

Back in Kingsbury, Isabella Winslow awaited at the airport, tear-streaked and trembling in her floral dress like a startled butterfly.

"Alex, I was framed..." The leaked recording had plunged her into scandal.

"I said those words, but they were sarcastic..." She dabbed her eyes. "Evelyn edited them maliciously..."

Alexander's gaze sharpened. "What does she have to do with this?"

"That call was to Evelyn..." Isabella sniffled. "She accused me of stealing the brooch, stealing your affection... I lost my temper..."

She peeked up timidly. "Isn't Horizon's editor-in-chief Evelyn's senior?"

Alexander's expression turned stormy.

"My social media is locked by the company..." Her lashes fluttered. "Evelyn must despise me now..."

"You did nothing wrong." His tone softened marginally. "I'll handle it."
###Chapter 11: That Woman Must Crawl Back

The master bedroom at Royal Gardens remained cold and empty.

Alexander Kingsley stood in the center of the walk-in closet, his gaze sweeping over the meticulously arranged dresses. Each one was a limited-edition piece he'd personally selected—expensive, untouched.

"Twelve hours." His voice was glacial. "Make her crawl back to me."

Ethan Miller felt sweat trickle down his spine.

Miss Sinclair had left without even taking her favorite clothes. This was a direct challenge to Lord Alex's authority.

"Horizon Media..." Ethan forced himself to report. "They claim to have more evidence. They're advising us to withdraw the cease and desist letter."

Alexander smirked, long fingers tapping the armrest.

"That journalist. Did you dig deeper?"

"Duan Sheli." Ethan handed over the file. "New rising star at Horizon."

"Duan Sheli?" Alexander's eyes darkened. "Destroy him."

Ethan's pulse spiked. Lord Alex was truly enraged this time.

Years ago, he'd shown mercy to Julian Ashford only because Evelyn had begged on her knees. Now it seemed they'd nurtured a viper.

"Assemble the legal team." Alexander rose, his tailored suit accentuating his long legs. "I want him ruined."

As Ethan retreated, Mrs. Wilson intercepted him in the hallway.

"Looking for Miss Sinclair?" She lowered her voice. "I might have an idea..."

——

Horizon Media's conference room.

Martha Nash was outlining this month's editorial focus when Evelyn Sinclair's phone vibrated.

She stepped into the corridor. Her face paled the moment she answered.

"Sophie?"

Her sister's frail voice came through. "Sis... this nice lady says she'll help me get treatment..."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palm.

"Isabella," she said tightly. "Leave my sister out of this."

Isabella Winslow's laugh slithered like a serpent. "So tense, Evelyn. I'm just visiting." A deliberate pause. "Such a sweet child. Accidents happen..."

Evelyn saw her mother's falling body flash before her eyes.

"What do you want?"

"One hour. The hospital." Isabella's tone was singsong. "Tick-tock."

The line went dead. Evelyn's hands still trembled. Outside, storm clouds gathered—mirroring that day when a silhouette had plunged from the sky.

Mom, don't jump—

She squeezed her eyes shut. When they reopened, all emotion had been locked away. She turned toward the elevators, footsteps urgent and resolute.
###Chapter 12: You Don't Get to Mention My Parents

Dusk had settled when Evelyn Sinclair finally arrived at the hospital.

The ward stood empty, save for Isabella Winslow leaning against the window, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

"Where's Sophie?" Evelyn rushed forward in three quick strides.

Isabella turned leisurely. "How prompt of you, Miss Sinclair." She twirled a lock of hair around her finger. "Pity your sickly little sister has already—"

"I asked where Sophie is!" Evelyn seized her wrist.

Isabella winced but smiled wider. "What? Afraid I'd toss her out the window?" Her gaze flicked meaningfully downward. "Like your mother all those years ago?"

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

"Guess what?" Isabella whispered in her ear. "When she learns her specialist flew abroad, and her beloved sister got thrown out by the Kingsleys—"

Evelyn lunged for the window before she could finish.

The lawn below lay deserted.

"Pathetic," Isabella sneered behind her.

A rush of air—Evelyn sidestepped, catching Isabella's wrist and shoving her halfway out the window.

"Kill me?" Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "You?"

Isabella paled, legs flailing. "L-let go—"

"Was my mother this terrified," Evelyn tightened her grip, "when she fell?"

"Evelyn!"

Alexander Kingsley's roar shattered the room. He yanked Evelyn away as Isabella collapsed, sobbing theatrically.

"Alex..." She clung to him. "I was just trying to contact specialists for Sophie..."

Alexander's glare cut into Evelyn. "Have you lost your mind?"

Staggering upright, Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Care to hear what she just said?"

"Enough!" He knocked the phone from her hand. "Even if she insulted your parents, does that warrant murder?"

The words cleaved Evelyn's heart like a blunt knife.

"My parents?" Her voice trembled. "Alexander Kingsley, you dare speak of them?"

Memories surged—

A teenage Alexander programming her fingerprint at the Kingsley estate gates.

"Remember, this is your home now."

Little Evelyn gazed up, eyes sparkling.

"Then who am I to you?"

"Alex!"

Her arms reached for a hug, met with his recoil—until warm fingers enveloped her icy hand.

"Come home."

...

A tear hit the floor.

Evelyn lifted bloodshot eyes. "Alexander, you're unworthy."

She picked up the shattered phone and turned toward the door.

"Stop!" Alexander commanded.

Her footsteps didn't falter.

"I said STOP!"

The door slammed shut behind her.
###Chapter 13: Tears in the Standoff

Alexander Kingsley's pupils constricted sharply.

He had never seen Evelyn Sinclair like this before.

Her usually calm eyes now shimmered with unshed tears. The droplets trembled at her lash line, stubbornly refusing to fall—their precarious balance more heartbreaking than any loud sob.

"You..."

Before he could speak, a figure stepped between them.

"Alexander Kingsley," Julian Ashford's voice was glacial, "since when did you stoop to bullying women?"

He shielded Evelyn, his heart wrenching when he saw that single tear clinging to her lashes.

The girl who had once endured snowstorms with gritted teeth was now crying before him.

That tear shattered Julian's restraint.

He bent to retrieve Evelyn's dropped phone, but instead of returning it, he seized her wrist.

"Come with me."

A dangerous glint flashed in Alexander's eyes.

He grabbed Julian's collar, his fist cutting through the air—

"Stop!" Evelyn's cry froze Alexander's punch mid-swing.

He sneered. "Does it hurt you to see this?"

Evelyn took a steadying breath, her gaze clearing.

"Yes," she met Alexander's eyes squarely, "I care about Julian because he cares about me."

Her words were a spark igniting gasoline. Rage blazed in Alexander's stare.

Julian's fist struck like lightning.

Alexander dodged, but the blow still grazed his cheekbone, drawing blood. The minor injury detonated his fury.

He yanked Julian closer and delivered a brutal punch.

Julian staggered back, colliding with Isabella Winslow.

"Mr. Ashford, please!" Isabella clung to Julian from behind, pretending to mediate while immobilizing him.

Alexander's second punch whistled toward its target.

"Alexander!" Evelyn lunged, wrapping her arms around his waist. "How dare you hit him!"

Julian broke free and retaliated with a strike that sent Alexander reeling.

"Evelyn!" Isabella shrieked. "You're helping an outsider attack Alexander!"

The men clashed again in a vicious brawl.

When Isabella tried to interfere once more, Evelyn seized her hair and yanked her away.

"Where's my butterfly brooch?" Evelyn demanded coldly. "I warned you last time—I'd hit you every time we meet."

Isabella flailed wildly. Evelyn's palm cracked across her cheek.

"Alexander! Help!" Isabella wailed.

Distracted, Alexander was tackled to the floor. Julian pinned him down, knee pressing against his throat, eyes blazing.

"Did you think I'd still be the pushover from seven years ago?"

They rolled across the tiles in a violent struggle.

Meanwhile, another sharp slap echoed through the room.

Isabella howled like a slaughtered pig.

"Evelyn! Enough!" Alexander roared.

"Alexander!" Julian snarled back, "You dare defend Isabella in front of Evelyn, yet accuse me of spreading rumors?"

"Shut up!"

As the fight escalated, a small, trembling voice came from the doorway.

"Big sister... Alexander..."

Silence fell instantly.

Sophie sat in her wheelchair, pale-faced, eyes wide with terror.

"Sophie..." Evelyn immediately released Isabella and rushed to embrace her sister. "I'm so sorry we frightened you."

"Does your neck still hurt?" Sophie touched Evelyn's throat, tears welling up.

Outside, bodyguards dispersed the gathering crowd. Medical staff entered to assess the damage.

Isabella's face was swollen beyond recognition. Though bruised, Alexander and Julian each retained their signature demeanor—one icy, the other composed.

Only Evelyn's torn blouse revealed a glimpse of porcelain skin—and the lurid bruises marring her collarbone.

Alexander's expression darkened. He shrugged off his coat and draped it over her shoulders.

"Put this on," he ordered gruffly.
###Chapter 14: Her Treasure, His Trash

Evelyn flicked her fingers, letting the coat slide off her shoulders and land precisely in Alexander's arms.

Her lips curved into a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Lord Alex, save your concern for those who need it more."

Alexander's gaze turned icy, his voice dangerously low. "Evelyn Sinclair, don't test my patience—"

"I wouldn't dare." She took half a step back. "Your generosity is too much for me to bear."

Once, she had been foolish enough to cherish even his cruelest gestures, treasuring the wounds as proof of love.

Now she saw them for what they were—faded, worthless scars, like cheap trinkets from a street vendor.

"Sophie." Evelyn turned to her sister in the hospital bed, her expression softening instantly. "Focus on getting better. Work's been busy, so I can't visit as often."

Though young, Sophie was perceptive. Evelyn didn't want her worrying and hindering her recovery.

Her fingers brushed the knit cap covering Sophie's bald head, a result of chemotherapy. "But I promise," she whispered, firm yet gentle, "no one will hurt you. No matter what schemes they plot—"

She paused meaningfully. "—my Sophie is the strongest, isn't she?"

In the hallway, Isabella clung to Alexander's sleeve, sobbing. "Alex, I arranged specialists for Sophie, and Evelyn hit me! She even implied I'd harm her sister. I know I shouldn't care, but it hurts..."

Evelyn's words were veiled, but the threat was clear: If anything happened to Sophie, someone would pay.

Alexander seized Evelyn's wrist. "You're coming with me."

As he dragged her away, Julian moved to intervene.

Alexander shot him a cold smirk. "Thought you cared about your sister? Let's see who fears death more."

Evelyn bit her lip and shook her head at Julian. Tonight had been messy enough.

Besides, it was time to settle things with Alexander.

The lights of Royal Gardens glared as curious servants peeked. He hauled her into the bedroom and locked the door.

"Take it off."

Before she could react, he ripped her collar open—

The bruises on her neck and shoulders stood stark under the harsh light.

Alexander gripped her wrist, scanning the injuries with a dark glare. "Explain."

"I fell."

Behind the casual reply echoed the screech of brakes from that night.

His laugh was cold. "Fell? Or let some man mark you?"

The yellowing bruises could've been from when she followed him.

Served her right.

Evelyn trembled—then laughed.

"Something funny?" He seized her chin. "Guilty?"

His fingers tightened. "Was it Julian? Or someone new?"

His hand slid to her waist, where the worst bruises were. She gasped in pain.

Alexander's eyes glinted. "Others can touch you, but I can't?"

Evelyn swallowed her tears, her smile self-mocking.

"Wait here, Lord Alex. I have something for you."

The sudden formality made him frown.

A knock interrupted them.

She slipped into the walk-in closet, emerging in a pale blue qipao. Alexander was examining something in his hand.

His gaze lingered on her, the anger fading slightly.

"Take it." He tossed it carelessly.

The object landed at her feet like a bone thrown to a stray.

A tube of ointment.

"Not just a stiff neck?" His tone dripped condescension.

Evelyn picked it up, then retrieved an engraved wooden box from her bag. She placed the ointment inside and held it out.

"These belong to you now."

The box looked familiar.

Alexander took it, flipping it open. The gleam of jewelry illuminated his suddenly stormy expression.

"Birthday gifts from you over the years." Her voice was calm. "Returned intact."

She remembered losing the sunflower hairpin he gave her at fourteen, crying as she searched the garden all day.

Later, he'd tossed her this box, telling her to keep valuables safe.

Just like everything else he gave—carelessly discarded.

The box slammed against the wall, scattering jewels across the floor.

Evelyn's heart ached.

Her most cherished treasures were nothing but trash to him.
###Chapter 15: Cast Aside Like Trash

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly, but she maintained her composure. "Lord Alex has always been generous. These items are priceless. Perhaps... Miss Winslow would appreciate them more..."

It would be such a waste to destroy them.

"Do you think Isabella would want your trash?" Alexander's lips curled in disdain. "She's not like you, dazzled by shiny baubles."

In his eyes, Isabella was an untouchable goddess, while Evelyn was nothing but a gold-digging social climber.

Hypocritical. Opportunistic. A status-seeker hiding behind false purity.

"The Kingsleys treated you well all these years." He loosened his tie, gaze sharp as a blade. "Yet we somehow raised someone with such vulgar tastes."

His eyes swept over the scattered gifts, his smirk deepening. "You hoarded every trinket I tossed your way like treasures. Now you return them with this pathetic display. Disgusting."

His tall frame was silhouetted against the frosted bathroom glass. "If you don't want them, throw them away properly. Don't litter my home."

Evelyn stared at the discarded presents, her eyes hollow.

He'd given her extravagant jewelry, military training medals, even rare collector's edition game cartridges...

Some were indeed worthless.

But his accusation of greed...

If longing for someone's warmth was greed, then yes—she had been greedy.

Ravenously so.

Now his cruel words fell like hail on frozen ground, leaving no trace.

As she turned to leave, a maid entered.

The middle-aged woman's eyes gleamed with avarice at the glittering mess. Pretending to clean, she slipped a necklace into her pocket.

"Miss Sinclair, don't take it so hard," the maid simpered. "All that fiancée talk was just for show. Everyone knows you were just a bed warmer. Let's be honest—a pheasant can't become a swan by dressing up..."

The bathroom door flew open.

Alexander emerged in a robe, water dripping from his hair, his expression glacial.

The maid immediately hunched like a frightened quail.

"Wait." His voice cut through the air.

Evelyn turned to see the maid's stiffened back.

"Hand it over." Alexander's tone could freeze hell.

Trembling, the maid held up a trash bin. "My lord, Miss Sinclair told me to throw these away—"

"Shall I search you myself?"

The maid collapsed to her knees, shaking violently. After a long pause, she produced the necklace. "M-Miss Sinclair gave this to me..."

She suddenly turned pleading eyes to Evelyn. "Miss Sinclair is so kind! I was ungrateful! Please tell Lord Alex the truth—"

The necklace landed at Evelyn's feet like something contaminated.

"You gave this to her?" Alexander narrowed his eyes.

Evelyn's expression remained impassive. "Mrs. Wilson's talent for framing others is wasted in service. She should be in theater."

The maid grew frantic. "Miss Sinclair told me to take whatever I wanted! Her silence proves she's setting me up!" She glanced at Alexander. "Even when beating a dog, one considers its master. She's insulting you, my lord!"

In the past, she'd never have dared such insolence.

But everyone at Royal Gardens knew—Miss Sinclair had fallen from grace.

A discarded woman held less status than a senior maid.

Beneath her fearful act, the maid preened with triumph.

Evelyn didn't even grant her a glance. She gave Alexander a slight nod. "Everything's accounted for. Dispose of them as you wish."

As she walked away, her skirt brushed past the necklace—like sweeping away a painful memory.
###Chapter 16: I'm Not Your Possession

Evelyn Sinclair was about to step out when Alexander Kingsley already had his phone to his ear.

"Ethan, get up here now." His voice was glacial. "And call the police. We have a thief in Royal Gardens."

Mrs. Wilson's face drained of color at his words.

She dropped to her knees with a thud. "Lord Alex, I would never—"

"Save your excuses for the officers." Alexander cut her off. "Judging by your expertise, this isn't your first time."

Ethan Miller arrived breathless. "Lord Alex, the police are en route..."

Alexander's gaze darkened. "Thoroughly investigate her. And check if there are other sticky fingers in this house. The Kingsleys pay for loyalty, not theft."

Security immediately hauled the trembling housekeeper away.

Only then did Alexander turn to Evelyn, his tone indifferent. "Satisfied?"

Evelyn blinked before letting out a cold laugh.

"Lord Alex cleaning house has nothing to do with me." Her lips curled in mockery. "As long as you're pleased. An outsider like me isn't worth your concern."

Ethan gasped audibly.

This... this couldn't be the same Evelyn who used to hang on Lord Alex's every word?

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Have you lost your mind? Who are you putting on this act for?"

He suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

Something felt different. This wasn't her usual tantrum.

She'd changed.

Changed enough that even his habitual indifference couldn't ignore it.

But he couldn't be bothered to care.

Yanking her forward, her shoulder collided painfully with his chest. "Enough. It's late."

Normally, she'd understand the unspoken command.

This time, Evelyn wrenched free, her eyes glacial. "Unless Lord Alex is deaf, you heard every vile word Mrs. Wilson said."

The shower had stopped long ago.

Alexander had heard every insult.

His punishment wasn't for her sake—just petty theft.

This belated justice meant nothing.

"What more do you want?" Alexander advanced, eyes flashing dangerously. "Would killing a servant over a necklace satisfy you?"

Wasn't calling the police enough? A full investigation insufficient?

How vicious could she be?

"Evelyn, don't test my patience."

For the first time, Evelyn saw the chasm between them.

She'd actually dreamed of marrying this man?

How laughable.

"Lord Alex," she murmured, her voice feather-light, "I'm not your plaything."

It was over.

By his own decree.

Alexander's frown deepened. "Can't handle servant gossip? I thought journalism taught you thicker skin. After thirteen years of groveling, now you want dignity?"

......

Evelyn simply watched him.

Her expression indescribably complex.

How had she endured him?

The cruelty. The barbs. For thirteen years?

When he called her pathetic, she couldn't even argue.

Because he was right.

She'd been pathetic to her core.

"You're absolutely right." Her sudden smile was razor-sharp. "Pity it took me this long to see it."

For once, Alexander studied her for two full seconds.

"Enough," he said, uncharacteristically placating. "Mrs. Wilson's been dealt with. No one will speak out of turn again."

"You punished her for theft, not for humiliating me," Evelyn countered.

"Silence!" Alexander's temper flared. "How long will you harp on this nonsense?"

His concession wasn't license for her demands.

He despised her greed, yet she insisted on provoking him.

But what infuriated him more was her rejecting his rare mercy.

Evelyn's smile turned lethal. "So to Lord Alex, this is trivial."

Ignoring his thunderous expression, she continued, "Then don't trouble yourself over trifles. You may ignore it, but I can't."

Her calm demeanor made Alexander's jaw clench.

He seized her wrist again, voice dropping dangerously low. "Was the maid wrong? Aren't you just my—"

He broke off abruptly.

Someone was still present.

"Why are you still here?" His murderous glare sent Ethan trembling.

"Lord Alex... Madam Kingsley arrived with Miss Isabella and Mr. Julian. They're downstairs..."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Why wasn't I informed?"

Ethan stammered, "Madam forbade me. I only knew when you summoned me..."

Alexander released Evelyn and strode toward the stairs, pausing halfway to fix her with a warning glare.

"Watch your tongue. Understood?"

As he rounded the staircase, Eleanor Kingsley's gentle voice floated up.

"Violence is unacceptable. I'll make certain she apologizes properly."

Hearing footsteps, she turned sharply. "Look what you've done! Have you no—"
###Chapter 17: The Queen of Double Standards

Eleanor Kingsley's words trailed off abruptly.

Footsteps echoed from the staircase as Alexander Kingsley descended with a stormy expression. A purple bruise marred his temple, his cheekbone bore a sickly yellow hue, and dried blood crusted his split lip. Deep scratches ran along his jawline.

He looked even worse than Julian Ashford lounging on the sofa with an ice pack.

Eleanor's temper flared.

"How dare you show your face?" Her phoenix eyes flashed. "Starting a fight was idiotic enough, but getting your ass handed to you? You've humiliated the Kingsley name! Why didn't Mr. Ashford finish the job?"

Julian: "..."

That insult seemed to target both men.

Alexander stalked toward his mother, though his glare remained fixed on Julian. "Get out."

The air turned glacial.

Eleanor suddenly exhaled, diffusing the tension.

"Thank goodness." She pressed a hand to her chest, her gaze softening toward Evelyn Sinclair on the stairs. "At least Evelyn's unharmed..."

Seeing Isabella Winslow's swollen face had made her fear the worst. But Evelyn stood composed, her clothes pristine—a sight that eased Eleanor's panic.

Isabella bristled.

"Aunt Eleanor," she whimpered behind her hands, "you just said violence is wrong—"

"I meant those two." Eleanor's tone stayed pleasant. "Girls roughhousing isn't fighting, it's bonding."

She continued before Isabella could protest, "If she hit you, why didn't you hit back?"

"Losing means you're weak, dear. Fragile flowers are outdated—sometimes you need claws to get what you want."

Isabella: "..."

Last week Eleanor had praised Evelyn's classical elegance while complaining modern girls were too vulgar.

This hypocritical old hag!

"Mrs. Kingsley."

Evelyn approached, only for Eleanor to seize her hands.

"Evelyn, I came after hearing disturbing rumors." Eleanor beamed. "Seeing you here reassures me."

Evelyn's throat tightened at the familiar face.

"I only came to return some things today. I'm leaving soon."

Since arriving at the Kingsleys at ten, Eleanor had treated her better than her own daughter. The kindest repayment was accepting that love.

But today, she had to disappoint her.

"Alexander and I... broke up. I ended it."

She said "I ended it"—not "I chose this."

One final act of grace for them both.

Silence swallowed the room.

Triumph flashed in Isabella's eyes. Julian lowered his gaze thoughtfully.

Eleanor paled.

Alexander's expression darkened to murderous.

He'd warned Evelyn to watch her mouth, yet she'd dropped this bombshell the moment Eleanor appeared.

Did she crave attention so badly? Even exploiting Eleanor's concern?

Ungrateful wretch.

Eleanor recovered first. "Evelyn, Alexander's been spoiled rotten. I'll discipline him properly—"

"Don't worry, Auntie," Isabella cut in sweetly. "Ms. Sinclair has such a devoted suitor in Mr. Ashford. He fought quite passionately for her earlier—"

"My issues with Alexander are personal." Julian's voice turned icy. "They don't involve Evelyn."

"Really?" Isabella smirked. "The way you brawled, I assumed—"

"Ms. Winslow—"

"Oh, it's perfectly normal!" Eleanor laughed, waving a hand. "Pretty girls always have admirers. Our Evelyn's beauty and virtue would be wasted without suitors."

Isabella's eye twitched.

Even after Alexander's disgraceful brawl, Eleanor could still praise Evelyn?

The Sinclairs' deaths were the best thing that ever happened to that bitch!

"Of course," she said acidly. "Most girls would be called sluts for less."

"Ms. Winslow," Julian said coldly, "shall I play the recording where you confess your relationship?"

Isabella faltered, shooting Alexander a wounded look.

"I only said that to humor Grandpa... The media twisted my words..." Her glare shifted to Evelyn.

This scheming woman had monopolized Alexander for years. Even dumped, she refused to leave.

"Your grandfather's ill?" Eleanor asked.

"He's recuperating abroad, thanks to Alexander arranging Dr. Xu—"

CRASH.

Evelyn's teacup shattered on the floor.
###Chapter 18: She Had Settled All Accounts with the Kingsleys

Crash—

The glass slipped from Evelyn Sinclair's fingers, shattering on the floor.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

Dr. York...

The surgeon who was supposed to operate on Sophie also shared that surname.

The same doctor who suddenly flew abroad the night Sophie's condition turned critical, forcing Evelyn to chase after him in the rain and nearly lose her life.

"Evelyn?" Eleanor Kingsley noticed her distress and grasped her icy hands. "You've gone pale. What's wrong?"

"Pathetic acting," Alexander Kingsley remarked coldly from the sidelines. "Spare us the theatrics at home."

Eleanor shot her son a withering glare.

"Dr. York..." Evelyn stared directly at Isabella Winslow, her voice strained. "From Kingsbury General's surgical department?"

Isabella shrank closer to Alexander like a frightened rabbit.

Alexander's arm encircled her protectively.

"What else?" His lips curled in mockery. "You think the Winslow patriarch isn't worthy of Kingsbury's finest surgeon?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

She stood and bowed slightly to Eleanor. "Aunt Eleanor, I should leave now."

"Evelyn!" Eleanor caught her wrist. "Explain this instant."

"I'm fine." Evelyn gently withdrew her hand. "You should rest early."

She turned away without sparing Alexander a single glance.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Alexander surged to his feet.

Julian Ashford blocked his path. "That surgeon was Sophie's designated doctor."

"And?" Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously.

Julian smirked. "If Miss Winslow means so much to you, stop tormenting Evelyn. She's settled all accounts with the Kingsleys!"

With that, he strode after Evelyn.

As Alexander moved to retaliate, Eleanor's calm voice cut through. "Stay."

She rose leisurely. "First, explain this surgeon business."

"Aunt Eleanor, it's all my fault..." Isabella interjected hastily. "When Grandfather fell ill, I had no choice but to—"

"Isabella dear," Eleanor smiled sweetly, "let mother and son talk privately."

Isabella immediately fell silent.

Eleanor turned to Alexander, then suddenly glanced back. "Oh Isabella, did you know Dr. York was Sophie's surgeon?"

"I...I only found out later..." Isabella's eyes welled up. "Today I arranged specialist consultations, but Evelyn—"

"Perfect timing then." Eleanor patted her hand gently. "Best not visit Royal Gardens again. Wouldn't want you catching bad luck."

Isabella turned ghostly pale before tearfully excusing herself.

Once the footsteps faded, Eleanor's expression hardened. "Ethan, bring them up."

In the second-floor bedroom, she directed servants to pack Evelyn's belongings.

"Mother!" Alexander frowned.

"I'm done with this daughter-in-law." Eleanor sighed. "Spare me explanations about surgeons or Sophie."

She brushed imaginary dust from her sleeves. "From today, neither girl sets foot in this house again."

Before leaving, she tapped Ethan's forehead. "Missing one item costs your annual bonus."

......

The night wind cut like knives.

Evelyn tightened her coat, but nothing could ward off the chill seeping into her bones.

Now she understood—the humiliation outside the club, the life-or-death chase through the storm—all because of him.

For Isabella's sake, he'd extinguished Sophie's last hope.

Rich heiresses could toy with lives as they pleased, and Alexander Kingsley would always enable them.

Evelyn slowly crouched down, tears splattering the pavement.

Sophie, I'm sorry...

She could never outmaneuver Isabella, much less Alexander.

To people like them, she and Sophie were just playthings for their amusement.
###Chapter 19: Love That Wounds

"Evelyn..." Julian's voice carried through the hedges, laced with unmistakable concern.

His car had been following her at a crawl.

Evelyn Sinclair drew a deep breath, forcing back her tears.

She lifted her chin, summoning a faint smile. "I'm fine."

Crossing the greenery, she opened the passenger door and slid in.

As she buckled the seatbelt, she flashed Julian a brilliant grin. "I always overestimate myself. Only after hitting rock bottom do I face reality."

"Don't say that." Julian pressed the accelerator. "You're stronger than anyone."

Evelyn fell silent, gazing at the passing city lights. Her fingers absently drifted to her abdomen...

That snowy night seven years ago.

For the secret that would change everything, she'd climbed out the window, shimmying down a frozen pipe.

The brittle pipe snapped. A jagged edge stabbed deep into her flesh.

To avoid detection—to deliver that secret—

She packed the wound with snow. Hid for two hours in the blizzard.

Until Julian found her.

Not strength. Not courage.

She'd spent a lifetime's worth in that moment...

Like loving someone with your whole heart, leaving nothing for anyone else.

"Look at this." Julian handed her a document. "The company can handle it if you'd rather not get involved."

Alexander Kingsley was determined to sue her.

Horizon Media had wisely forwarded the legal notice to Julian this time.

Evelyn skimmed the signature. "I'll deal with it myself."

She had nothing left to fear.

After years with Alexander, she knew his methods. Warnings came from Kingsley Group's legal team.

This bore his personal lawyers' seal.

Her grateful eyes met Julian's. "I can't always hide behind you."

She didn't need him to say it—he planned to claim authorship of the "Duan Sheli" pseudonym.

Alexander didn't know who really wrote those articles.

Otherwise tonight's argument wouldn't have centered on a maid.

His lawsuit fixation suggested he believed Julian was behind the exposé.

"I'll find more evidence." Evelyn set the letter between them, resolve hardening. "No one can break me again."

No one...

Would make her flee through subzero snow with an untreated wound.

"Full company support," Julian said, glancing at her profile. "Don't be afraid."

"I'm not." Evelyn relaxed into the seat.

Only matters of the heart could frighten her now.

...

Royal Gardens staff spent all night packing Evelyn's belongings.

The delivery didn't reach Madam Kingsley's tea garden until noon.

The flower-obsessed matriarch ran an exclusive tea house for select guests.

Golden sunlight drenched the courtyard.

Madam Kingsley sipped tea, eyes closed beneath blooming branches.

"Madam, Miss Sinclair's items have arrived. Where shall we put them?" Ethan Miller supervised every detail, not daring to cut corners.

He stole a glance at Alexander standing in the doorway's shadow, barely breathing.

Madam Kingsley opened a crate. Pristine fabrics spilled out.

"What's discarded was never treasured." She sighed. "Store it. If she ever changes her mind, I'll return everything. Unless—"

She broke off, looking up.

"To what do I owe this honor?" The legendary beauty's smile still dazzled. "Too much free time? Must you micromanage such trifles?"

Her gaze shifted to Ethan. "How incompetent are you that Lord Alex needs to oversee a simple delivery?"

Ethan kept his head down.

She'd noticed her son immediately. The delayed greeting was pure spite.

"Well? Don't just stand there." She beckoned. "I need to speak with you."

Alexander finally approached.

Overnight, his bruises had faded. Dark circles now underscored his eyes, though his expression remained icy.

The Kingsley matriarch ruled through beauty and terror. Even her son knew better than to cross her when displeased.

Upstairs, Alexander spoke first. "Mother, you're enabling her. She's grown reckless from your indulgence."

"Oh?" Her laugh was sharp. "What's done is done. Need I remind you who saved your life?"

Her face darkened. "I only regret Evelyn lacked ambition. Any other girl I spoiled would've become royalty. She settled for being a bedwarmer!"

"Mother!" Alexander's expression turned murderous. "Who told you that?"

"What?" Her smile widened. "Your sieve of a mansion can't keep secrets, yet expects me to hear nothing?"

Alexander's jaw clenched.

He rarely interfered with Royal Gardens' staff—many were his mother's appointments.

Besides, hadn't Evelyn lived there too?

The man handled external affairs; household matters were the woman's domain. If servants gossiped, wasn't that her failure?

"Why so tense?" Madam Kingsley nudged her son.

Her carefree nature had somehow produced this ice sculpture of a man.

She teased, "You've never cared about servant chatter before. Their words don't reach your exalted ears, do they?"

"Did Evelyn tell you this?" Alexander could think of no other source.

"Please. If Evelyn had half their sharp tongues, she wouldn't have—"

"Mother." His voice could freeze hell.

He humored her whims, but even mothers had limits.

"Fine." She changed subjects smoothly. "Look what I found..."

She produced a booklet.

Alexander reached for it—

Ethan burst in, panic-stricken. "Lord Alex! Emergency! Evelyn—"
###Chapter 20: The Truth Revealed

The teacup in Eleanor Kingsley's hand suddenly slipped and shattered on the floor with a crisp sound.

Alexander Kingsley turned sharply.

Ethan Miller stood at the doorway, his face deathly pale.

"What's going on?" Eleanor demanded sharply.

Ethan swallowed hard. "It's about... that article from Horizon Media..."

Alexander's gaze turned icy.

A cold sweat instantly broke out on Ethan's back.

"Wait," Alexander said coldly.

He flipped open the photo album Eleanor had handed him, glanced at it once, then slammed it shut.

"What is this?"

Eleanor swiveled her chair, tapping the desk lightly with her fingertips.

"I haven't told your grandfather about you and Evelyn yet..."

"What about us?" Alexander's voice rose abruptly.

Eleanor ignored him. "With your grandfather's eightieth birthday approaching, you'd better bring a new girlfriend home."

A vein throbbed at Alexander's temple.

"Mother, enough."

Eleanor opened the album, displaying photos of society debutantes one by one.

"These are all carefully selected. Pick one soon so I can arrange things for Evelyn."

Alexander narrowed his eyes.

"Arrange what for her?"

Eleanor pulled out another album. "The second son of Eastlink Group. A perfect match for Evelyn."

"She's not for him!" Alexander slammed his palm on the desk.

Eleanor smirked and tossed the album toward him.

"The Kingsleys can survive without a son, but not without a daughter-in-law!"

Alexander shot to his feet.

"I'll bring her home tonight."

Eleanor watched him silently, a flicker of something complex in her eyes.

Alexander turned to Ethan.

"Speak."

Ethan glanced uneasily at Eleanor, hesitating.

"Now!"

"Lord Alex..." Ethan took a deep breath. "That journalist Duan Sheli from Horizon... is Miss Evelyn!"

The air froze.

"What did you say?" Alexander grabbed Ethan by the collar.

Eleanor suddenly laughed.

Of course she knew Duan Sheli.

That exposé on Alexander and Isabella Winslow's "romance" had been written by that very person.

But she never imagined.

Duan Sheli was Evelyn Sinclair!

Evelyn had penned those words herself.

Eleanor gave her son a meaningful look.

Duan Sheli.

Cutting ties.

Eleanor's lips curled coldly. "And here I was playing mediator while she'd already gathered all the evidence."

Alexander's face darkened. He turned and stormed out, the mahogany door crashing shut behind him.

The impact reverberated through the room.

......

Outside Horizon Media's building.

Alexander melted into the night.

Ethan hid in the car, silently praying Evelyn would appear soon.

No one understood Alexander's obsession better than he did.

What he couldn't have, he would wait for endlessly.

Evelyn had blocked all contact.

She came and went with Julian Ashford.

She'd even fabricated those articles.

In the early hours of dawn, a figure finally emerged in Horizon's lobby.

Alexander's gaze turned predatory.

The prey had arrived.
###Chapter 21: Only for You

Ethan Miller's gaze locked onto the brightly lit exit of the skyscraper.

A flash of white.

The thought barely crossed his mind when his eyes caught a woman in a white dress. But disappointment surged instantly—her bearing was nothing like Evelyn Sinclair's.

No other white figures emerged from the lobby.

Just as Ethan relaxed, the headlights of Alexander Kingsley's car suddenly flared to life.

The door swung open violently.

Alexander stood beside the vehicle, his dark eyes fixed on the building's exit. Even through the night, Ethan could feel the suffocating tension radiating from him.

Then, a soft shade of sage green entered his vision.

Evelyn walked out, her hair loosely tied, the wide legs of her gray trousers swaying with each step. She laughed with a colleague, the night breeze lifting the edge of her jacket to reveal a pale yellow camisole underneath.

Ethan's pupils contracted.

For the first time, he realized how unfamiliar Evelyn looked without her usual white attire. Starlight danced in her eyes, her smile bright and vivid—nothing like the subdued shadow from his memories.

Alexander remained motionless until Evelyn bid her colleague goodbye. Only then did he take a slow step forward.

A silver Maserati abruptly cut between them.

"Julian? What are you doing here so late—"

"Just passing by," Julian Ashford interrupted. "Need to inspect the new place."

......

The flickering hallway light of the rundown apartment complex cast uneven shadows.

Julian frowned at the peeling paint on the walls. The moment the door opened, the musty smell hit him like a wave.

"Just needs some airing out," Evelyn said quickly.

The tiny studio apartment was painfully bare—yellowed bedsheets, a peeling wardrobe, a grease-stained stove on the balcony. A broken tile in the bathroom exposed the dark concrete beneath.

Julian's chest tightened.

The Sinclair heiress, reduced to this.

Clang!

The wardrobe door suddenly crashed down, barely hanging on by its last screw. Evelyn hurriedly pulled out a toolkit. "I found a tutorial online, I can—"

Her words cut off.

Julian seized her wrist. The once-delicate fingers were now marred with angry purple blisters.

"First time fixing things..." She tried to pull away.

He snatched the toolkit from her.

Julian ducked into the wardrobe, clumsily adjusting the hinges. Evelyn hovered close, warning, "Careful, the door's heavy—"

"Screwdriver."

"Hold this steady."

The Ashford heir, now kneeling in a musty wardrobe, his white shirt smeared with dust. But seeing the sparkle in Evelyn's eyes, he suddenly thought it was worth it.

"You're amazing!" she cheered as the door finally settled back into place.

Julian tapped the rusted hinge with a wrench. "Only for you..."

"Hmm?"

"I said," he swallowed, "I've had enough of being the 'nice guy.'"

Evelyn was about to laugh—

Crack!

The sound of splintering wood exploded through the room. Julian's right leg plunged straight through the bottom of the wardrobe, sending him lurching forward.

She reached out to steady him.

A dark figure suddenly stepped between them.

Alexander coldly separated the two, slamming the wardrobe door shut with a sharp bang.
###Chapter 22: Alexander, Let Me Go

"Alexander?" Evelyn's pupils constricted violently, the screwdriver slipping from her fingers with a clatter.

She never expected to encounter him here.

The man snatched up the tool, deftly jamming the cabinet handle beyond repair within seconds.

"What are you doing? There's someone inside!" She lunged for the screwdriver.

Alexander seized her wrist with bone-crushing force, hurling her onto the bed.

"How long have you been planning this?" His voice was glacial, eyes dark with barely restrained violence. "With Julian Ashford."

Evelyn froze.

She couldn't comprehend his accusation.

Her apparent confusion only deepened the storm in his gaze.

"Fabricating scandals about Isabella and me to clear the path for your beloved senior?" He caged her beneath him, his breath hot against her face. "Impressive tactics, Miss Duan."

His proximity allowed her to study every detail—the furrow between his brows, the sharp angles of his phoenix eyes, the undisguised fury twisting his handsome features.

What once would have terrified her now left her numb.

A humorless laugh escaped her lips. "Fabricated? You overestimate me, Mr. Kingsley."

She reached for her bag, flinging a stack of photographs at him.

"Seven years ago. The Autumn Detail rooftop. You embracing Isabella."

"Her birthday gala. Your arm around her waist."

...

"Last week outside the club. Your intimate moment."

"True Love jewelry shopping—announced the same day. I'm not stupid, Alexander."

Her voice trembled. "For my mother who jumped from Autumn Detail for your sake—let me go."

The photos scattered like falling snow.

The topmost image showed that damning rooftop embrace seven years ago.

Why did it have to be Autumn Detail?

Her deepest wound.

Alexander suddenly gripped her chin with brutal force, spots dancing across her vision.

"You've been carrying on with Julian," he sneered. "Why shouldn't I have Isabella?"

Tears of pain welled up, yet Evelyn smiled. "I'm content. Truly content with our breakup."

No more explanations.

These days without him were the first time she'd felt human.

"My relationship with Isabella changes nothing." His thumb traced her throat. "You'll always belong to me."

He straddled her, radiating danger. "Time you remembered who owns you."

CRASH—

The cabinet door shuddered violently, the screwdriver teetering.

"Alexander Kingsley!" Julian's enraged roar echoed through the wood. "You goddamn animal!"

His first-ever curse.

Years of restraint shattered seeing her treated this way.

Alexander released Evelyn, striding toward the cabinet with chilling calm.

He produced electrical tape, sealing the door shut with methodical precision.

Then pressed his shoulder against it, inching the entire unit toward the open window.

"ALEXANDER!" Evelyn's scream tore from her throat.

She flung herself at him, nails digging into his arms as fifth-floor wind howled like a yawning abyss.

"You're insane! Stop!" She pulled with desperate strength, drawing blood through his sleeves.
###Chapter 23: The Bloodstained Cage

Alexander kicked Evelyn away.

She crumpled to the floor like a fallen leaf.

With a violent shove, Alexander sent the wardrobe screeching across the floor.

"Alexander!" Ignoring the searing pain in her knees, Evelyn lunged forward and clung to his leg. "Alex... It's all my fault..."

She couldn't take the risk.

Julian's life was the heaviest debt she'd ever carry.

"I'll do anything..." Her voice shattered. "I'll die if you want... Just spare Julian."

"Evelyn!" Julian barked. "Don't beg him!"

When she'd applied to Horizon Media, he'd given her the offer.

It was all he could give.

A job. A fragile door left ajar.

He'd watched her emerge from her walking corpse state, slowly regaining color.

He'd rather die than see her enslaved again.

Alexander suddenly stilled.

He crouched, tracing the tears on her cheeks with icy fingers.

"First time I've seen you cry," his voice dripped frost. "For another man."

He yanked her hair back.

"You kneel for him. You plead for him..." Scarlet rage burned in Alexander's eyes. "Now you weep for him?"

Evelyn trembled violently.

She'd never seen this feral version of Alexander.

"I'll push him over," he whispered against her ear. "Watch him splatter on the pavement... Evelyn, tonight we become murderers together."

He hurled her to the ground.

"No!" Scrambling up, Evelyn threw herself before the window.

Her arms spread wide, hair wild.

"Kill me first," she rasped. "Step over my corpse to commit your crime... Alexander, the blood will be yours alone."

Alexander sent the wardrobe crashing.

Amid the deafening impact, he seized her throat, shoving her toward the yawning darkness.

"You think I won't die with you?" His words howled with the night wind. "The Sinclairs dare death—are the Kingsleys cowards?"

Black spots danced in Evelyn's vision.

Something warm splattered her face.

"If you die, it'll be with me!"

......

Somehow, Evelyn found herself back inside.

She collapsed, coughing until her ribs ached.

The wardrobe gaped with a jagged hole.

Blood streaked the broken wood.

Two factions stood locked in stalemate.

Julian's knuckles dripped crimson.

Alexander, restrained by his men, smeared blood across his lips.

Ethan knelt beside her, pleading. "Miss Sinclair, please... Lord Alex hasn't slept in two days..."

Evelyn laughed between coughs.

He'd nearly murdered her and Julian.

Yet she was the tormentor?

"Lord Alex remembered your dress shopping..." Ethan's eyes reddened. "Just apologize..."

Evelyn swayed to her feet.

She moved toward Julian.

Gazing at his mangled hand, she whispered, "Julian... Does it hurt?"
###Chapter 24: Evelyn, No Turning Back

Julian Ashford remained silent, his gaze traveling over Evelyn Sinclair's shoulder to land on Alexander Kingsley.

Evelyn kept her back turned to the man, refusing to spare him even a glance.

A muffled cough sounded behind her.

"Miss Sinclair!" Ethan Miller's voice cracked with urgency.

She didn't look back.

From this moment on, that man's joys and sorrows meant nothing to her.

She drew a deep breath, her voice clear and resolute. "Alexander Kingsley, we're done. You chose Isabella Winslow. I choose freedom."

The air froze.

After a long pause, Alexander's low voice cut through the silence. "Leave."

Shrugging off supporting hands, he strode away with decisive steps.

"Lord Alex!" Ethan chased after him.

Alexander unclenched the hand covering his mouth. Blood smeared between his fingers as he crushed it into his palm, casually wiping the crimson trail from his lips with his sleeve.

Ethan's eyes reddened.

He'd witnessed this man's transformation from youth to adulthood.

Alexander showed no mercy to enemies but remained fiercely loyal to his own.

To the world, he was the perfect heir. Only before Evelyn did he shed all pride.

"Lord Alex..." Ethan's voice trembled.

"Silence." Alexander's icy tone brooked no argument.

"At least go to the hospital—" Ethan persisted desperately.

Alexander gave no reply, using his other hand to wipe away fresh blood welling up.

......

The room returned to stillness.

Evelyn entered the bathroom and lifted her gaze to the mirror. Blood streaked her face like tear tracks.

She numbly touched the dried stains.

When had this happened?

She wasn't injured.

Julian dismissed his subordinates and approached with a damp towel.

"Don't be afraid." Gently turning her shoulders, he wiped her face with tender care. "It's over now..."

Evelyn noticed the gruesome wounds on his hands, flesh torn open at the knuckles.

"I'm sorry, Julian." Her voice shook.

"You saved me," he murmured.

When the cabinet collapsed, he'd battered his way out despite his injuries.

"I contacted my team immediately. You bought us crucial time."

Alexander had been staking out Horizon Media.

Julian had prepared for this.

When he broke free, reinforcements arrived just in time.

Evelyn stared at the bloodied towel. "You always think ahead."

"Move somewhere else," Julian suggested. "Alexander knows this place."

"He won't return." Evelyn shook her head.

Rage might make him lose control, but Alexander was ultimately rational.

Her words had severed all possibilities.

Julian stayed silent.

Some things he left unsaid.

Evelyn thought his blood had transferred to Alexander.

In truth, Alexander had already been drenched in crimson when Ethan pulled him from the window.

He left not because of her cruelty.

But because... he couldn't hold on any longer.

The blood on Evelyn's face had dripped from Alexander when he pinned her down.

These truths Julian would never reveal.

He too had selfish motives.

If Evelyn hesitated, he wouldn't mind giving fate a push.

"Evelyn, are you certain?" He sought final confirmation.

She closed her eyes and nodded.

This path had been irreversible since thirteen years ago.

......

Hospital room.

Isabella wept delicate tears. "Aunt Eleanor, how could Evelyn do this... She made Julian attack Alexander..."

Eleanor Kingsley's cold gaze rested on her son in the hospital bed.

Isabella continued through sobs. "Horizon got that recording because Evelyn planned it—"

"Enough." Eleanor cut her off. "Isabella, when did you become so tiresome?"

Isabella covered her mouth in wounded innocence. "I just care about Alexander..."

"My son has no shortage of people who care." Eleanor's words held no warmth. "You'd do better visiting your grandfather."

Isabella finally understood where Alexander inherited his sharp tongue.

Dabbing her eyes, she adopted a submissive tone. "Auntie, I was just worried—"

"Worry quietly then." Eleanor massaged her temples. "My son's hospitalized. He doesn't need your theatrics."
###Chapter 25: Eleanor Kingsley Outshines Her Own Son

"Auntie, I just want to take care of Alexander..."

"You?" Eleanor scoffed, her manicured fingers tapping the hospital bed rail. "Miss Winslow, do you have a nursing license? Or perhaps a medical degree?"

Isabella's smile froze.

Eleanor adjusted her cufflinks with deliberate slowness. "The Winslows are a respectable family. How did they raise someone with such poor judgment?"

Isabella's grip tightened on her purse strap.

As a top actress, she was accustomed to being worshipped.

"Auntie, Alexander and I—"

"Enough." Eleanor raised a hand. "What you do outside these walls is none of my concern. But the Kingsley estate?" Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "You'll never set foot in it."

Isabella shot to her feet.

She glanced at Alexander lying motionless with closed eyes, as if oblivious to her humiliation.

His defense of her at Royal Gardens yesterday now seemed like a cruel joke.

She stormed out, stiletto heels striking the floor like gunshots.

Eleanor exhaled deeply.

Turning to her "sleeping" son, she pinched his ear hard. "Quite the charmer, aren't you? Last time it was bruises, now a hospital stay?"

Ethan watched Alexander's ear turn crimson but ventured, "Madam, Lord Alex was—"

"Want to be the next Mrs. Kingsley?" Eleanor's glare silenced him.

She pulled up a chair, her tone suddenly sweet. "Regrets now? When she chased you, you ignored her. This brooding act is pathetic."

Ethan edged toward the wall.

"Madam, Lord Alex has been overwhelmed with work—"

"Forgot to eat and sleep, did he?" Eleanor arched a brow. "How did my carefree nature produce such a lovesick fool?"

Ethan became one with the wallpaper.

"Ethan," Eleanor commanded, "order three commemorative plaques."

She counted on her fingers: "First one—'Obsessed With Love.' Second—'Reaping What You Sow.' Third..." She paused. "'Early Death, Early Rebirth.'"

Alexander's eyes snapped open.

"Ethan. Leave."

Any longer and his mother might invent worse epitaphs.

"Mom," he said bluntly, "she's at Serenity Heights. Bring her home."

Eleanor smirked. "I won't bully my benefactor's daughter."

"Not Royal Gardens," Alexander rasped. "The Kingsley estate. Keep an eye on her."

She crossed her arms. "Now you're concerned? Where was this urgency before?"

Alexander frowned. "At least wait until Grandfather's birthday banquet ends."

Mother and son spoke past each other, neither listening.

Eleanor suddenly tossed two booklets onto the bed.

"Read these during your convalescence."

Alexander didn't glance at them. "Not interested."

"Premium edition," Eleanor flipped one open. "Every profile is personally vetted."

She added the second booklet: "Pick someone for Evelyn too. You know her tastes."

"Mom." His voice turned glacial. "We're still together."

Eleanor gasped. "So you admit to cheating?"

After a beat, Alexander muttered, "She and Julian Ashford—"

"Only children tattle." Eleanor rolled her eyes. "Adults cut their losses."

Alexander yanked out his IV and stood.

"What are you doing?" Eleanor panicked. "Lie back down!"

Buttoning his shirt one-handed, he stated, "I'm fetching her."

"Alexander!" She grabbed his arm. "Wake up! You're broken up!"

He frowned. "Since when?"

She felt his forehead. "Did the stomach bleeding damage your brain? You gave her the ultimatum!"

The Royal Gardens staff had recounted that day in vivid detail.

Recognition finally dawned on Alexander.

His expression hardened. "She always throws tantrums. The more you indulge her, the worse she behaves."
###Chapter 26: Pathetic Love Fool

Eleanor Kingsley's fingers trembled with rage.

Evelyn Sinclair had endured until now before breaking up with Alexander?

How much suffering had that poor girl endured all these years?

"It's over between you." Eleanor's voice turned glacial.

"Evelyn admitted it herself. Everyone around you says so. The whole world believes it. Alexander Kingsley, how long will you keep lying to yourself?"

Her lips curled in disdain.

"My son was never this pathetic."

Alexander remained silent.

Kingsbury's elite social circle praised Eleanor's diplomatic charm.

Only Alexander knew how venomous her words could truly be.

"Fine. You claim she's pulled this stunt before. Even if that's true, didn't you say ignoring her would work?" Eleanor adjusted her cuffs with deliberate slowness.

"Then ignore her now. Stop harassing her. Look at your recent behavior—does any of it resemble the Alexander Kingsley I raised?"

A mocking laugh escaped her.

"Though I suspect greater humiliation awaits you."

Alexander didn't understand her implication.

But her words struck a chord.

He remained at the hospital. By evening, Nathan Carter delivered the backlogged documents.

"The Horizon Media lawsuit," Alexander tapped the desk after concluding his video conference, "proceed as planned."

"Understood." Nathan scribbled notes. "Still assigning it to Ethan?"

"No. You'll handle this personally."

......

"Evelyn, Legal wants you." Martha Nash tapped her shoulder, glancing at the draft on her screen. "Finish this later."

Alexander had made his move.

The Crown Prince's bold promise to protect Evelyn had been empty after all.

Martha sighed as Evelyn walked away.

Even if Julian Ashford provided temporary shelter, how could he shield her forever?

If Alexander was determined to crush a rookie, what did winning one lawsuit matter?

Horizon Media would become just the beginning. No company would dare hire her.

Could an ant topple a redwood?

Martha knew the history.

Years ago, Kingsley Group's coordinated attack nearly bankrupted this legacy media house.

Only Julian's overseas intervention saved Horizon from collapse.

And the mastermind behind that corporate war?

None other than the now-untouchable Alexander Kingsley.

"With her looks," Martha crunched her lollipop, "I'd have married rich instead of suffering here."

"Why's Alexander suing us for libel?" a colleague asked.

"Him suing her, not us," another corrected. "Thank God I didn't write that piece!"

"The Kingsley-Winslow merger should be good news. Why's Kingsley Group overreacting?"

"Who knows? Maybe they've got special plans..."

"Ridiculous. What difference does early announcement make?"

"Isabella's in showbiz. Probably wants privacy..."

"Enough!" Martha snapped. "Where's the Ryan Holt update? Finish your drafts!"

......

Evelyn pushed open Legal's door.

"Miss Sinclair, Kingsley Group sent negotiators." The director spoke gently. "Don't worry, we'll accompany you."

Nathan and his legal team stood ready in the conference room.

Of Alexander's two lieutenants, Ethan handled emotions. Nathan dealt in cold logic.

His presence signaled Alexander's deadly seriousness.

"Miss Sinclair." Nathan offered a perfunctory smile.

"Three demands." He cut to the chase. "First, Horizon must issue a public apology."

"Second, eighty million in damages."

"Third, permanent ban on reporting Mr. Kingsley's private life."

Horizon's lawyer scoffed. "Is Kingsley Group delusional?"

Public humiliation? Extortionate fines? A gag order?

Did they think Horizon was spineless?

Nathan remained unperturbed. "If these terms are unacceptable..."

His gaze lingered meaningfully on Evelyn.
###Chapter 27: Evelyn, Let's Run Away Together

The negotiation request from Kingsley Group came unexpectedly.

Horizon Media's executives held an emergency overnight meeting, ultimately deciding to settle out of court. No one wanted a public legal battle over such trivial matters.

When Nathan Carter entered the conference room with his elite legal team, Horizon's attorneys braced for tough negotiations. But no one anticipated the opening move—a demand that would overturn the entire negotiation table.

Evelyn Sinclair lowered her eyes with a faint smile.

This familiar tactic... Wasn't it Alexander Kingsley's specialty to first present impossible terms, then offer a "merciful" alternative?

"Horizon Entertainment fabricated the romantic relationship between Mr. Kingsley and Ms. Winslow, severely damaging their reputations," Nathan adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze piercing Evelyn. "However, Mr. Kingsley is magnanimous enough to offer Horizon a dignified solution—"

He flipped open a folder, his tone turning icy.

"If journalist Evelyn Sinclair publicly admits to fabricating the story, submits a handwritten apology letter, records a video confession, and vows to permanently leave the media industry, this matter will end here."

The conference room fell deathly silent.

Horizon's lead attorney snapped his laptop shut. "Are you suggesting we either sacrifice a journalist or have the entire Horizon Media apologize?"

Nathan ignored him, staring at Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair, you should understand Mr. Kingsley is currently recuperating in the hospital. If you resign today and personally apologize to him there..."

He paused deliberately. "We'll withdraw the lawsuit immediately."

The legal team exchanged uneasy glances. These humiliating terms placed Horizon Media and a single journalist on equal footing as bargaining chips.

And the absurdity—

Since when did Isabella Winslow, a public figure, have privacy? Weren't celebrities profiting from selling their personal lives?

"I'll resign," Evelyn suddenly spoke.

Meeting Nathan's gaze, her lips curved into an almost imperceptible smile. "But I won't apologize. Tell Alexander Kingsley to file the lawsuit quickly. On trial day... he should dress presentably."

Nathan's pupils contracted.

This version of Evelyn was unsettlingly unfamiliar. He quickly composed himself, straightening his suit as he stood. "I hope you won't regret today's decision, Ms. Sinclair."

The Kingsley Group representatives left as abruptly as they'd arrived.

Only stunned silence remained in the conference room.

This negotiation had been bizarre from start to finish—they'd merely been background props in a larger game.

At the end of the hallway, Julian Ashford leaned against a window, cigarette in hand.

"You don't have to leave," he stubbed out the cigarette. "The coming days might be difficult..."

His voice trailed off.

Studying Evelyn's profile, his Adam's apple bobbed before he finally murmured, "Just remember—don't beg him again."

Evelyn nodded and turned toward the office.

Behind her, words almost too quiet to hear: "...I'll take you away from Kingsbury."

Evelyn, let's run away together...

The office atmosphere was palpably different.

"Evelyn!" Martha Nash rushed over, waving her phone. "Ryan Holt's team specifically requested you for his exclusive interview!"

The rising superstar held three major luxury endorsements, with interview requests booked through next year. Media outlets had been fighting for his "first feature"—yet this golden opportunity had fallen into Evelyn's lap.

"Every cloud has a silver lining!" Martha shoved a box of chocolates at her. "If not for Alexander Kingsley's drama, our team would never get this chance!"

Colleagues' expressions turned complex.

Those who'd genuinely congratulated her during the Isabella Winslow interview now watched with envy and calculation.

"Do your research. The magazine will arrange the photoshoot," Martha whispered. "You're professionally trained—your skills should still be sharp, right?"

At quitting time, Simon York intercepted her furtively. "Junior, about today's Kingsley Group..."
###Chapter 28: Paid with Two Lives from the Sinclair Family

"It's fine." Evelyn Sinclair gave Simon York a faint smile. "The company will handle it."

The office fell silent. Remaining colleagues pretended to work while eavesdropping.

Only after Evelyn disappeared into the elevator did whispers erupt like tidal waves.

"Who does she think she is?"

"If I had the Crown Prince backing me, I'd act just as entitled! Interviewing whoever I want, scooping exclusives..."

Simon attempted mediation. "Ladies, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?"

"What? Can't handle the truth?"

"Lucky her, having Lord Alex's protection. Even daring to provoke Alexander Kingsley. We commoners should know our place—unless we want to disappear mysteriously."

"What kind of 'talent' exactly?" A female colleague snorted. "Bedroom talents?"

The office erupted in suggestive laughter.

Most of the entertainment department had left. Only the gossipmongers remained.

"This is infuriating!" The instigator slammed files onto her desk. "I worked three nights on Ryan Holt's interview! Researched for days! Then some parachuted social climber steals it!"

Her words ignited collective resentment.

"Anyone but her! A rookie who hasn't learned the ropes, relying on her looks to—"

"Enough. How far can such methods take her? Just wait—the Crown Prince will toss her aside eventually."

"Think she'll try seducing Alexander Kingsley next?"

"Alexander? He has Isabella Winslow. Why would he glance at her?"

"Don't be so sure. If she's shameless enough to spread her legs instead of working hard like us..."

"Let her try. We journalists know how to expose such gold diggers..."

———

Evelyn walked briskly down the street.

She'd scheduled apartment viewings and left work early.

Julian Ashford had unilaterally terminated her lease and forced his spare keys upon her.

She couldn't accept his charity but needed immediate housing.

For journalists, apartments were mere sleeping pods between overtime and assignments.

Julian's overprotectiveness frustrated her.

He refused to believe she could survive independently, fearing hardship might drive her back to Alexander.

He forgot—she was never a hothouse flower.

"Miss Sinclair." Ethan Miller materialized before her.

"Ethan?"

"Miss Sinclair, stop this." Ethan looked pained. "Lord Alex left the hospital today against medical advice just for you. What will it take for you to return?"

Evelyn couldn't fathom his logic.

Alexander had initiated the breakup. Yet somehow, she was at fault?

"Miss Sinclair, even if you feel nothing for Lord Alex, consider the Kingsleys' kindness."

Everyone knew how well the Kingsleys had treated her.

How could she be so ungrateful?

"The Kingsleys' kindness?" Evelyn laughed coldly.

Why did everyone—from Alexander to Ethan—act like she owed the Kingsleys some unpayable debt?

Yes, they'd provided for her.

But it was paid with two lives from the Sinclair family...

Given the choice, she'd trade all their care for her parents' survival.

"Step aside, Ethan. I have appointments."

Explaining to Alexander wasn't worth her breath—let alone his assistant.

She was done.

"Miss Sinclair!" Ethan nearly grabbed her arm. "Lord Alex is waiting in that car over—don't look! He forbade me from telling you..."

Nathan Carter handled the Horizon Media lawsuit.

Whatever Nathan said prompted Alexander to defy doctors and wait outside Horizon all afternoon.

His car had trailed Evelyn for blocks until Ethan intervened.

"Ethan, I'm on a tight schedule."

Evelyn checked her watch.

Alexander's motives didn't interest her.

"Miss Sinclair, just apologize. You don't need the money. Why torment Lord Alex at Horizon? His health can't take this strain."

Evelyn studied his anxious face and smiled. "You tell me not to look, yet demand I return?"

In his hesitation, she turned.

A black Maybach waited across the street, windows tinted. But she knew Alexander watched.

The irony...

For seven years at Royal Gardens, she'd rarely seen him.

Always busy—meetings, negotiations, business trips... or dates with Isabella.

If she wanted him, she'd wait endlessly at home or humiliate herself visiting Kingsley Group.

The executive office staff feigned respect while mocking her behind her back.

And Alexander? He'd freeze her out—leaving her invisible in his office.

She'd wait foolishly, staring hopelessly, treasuring any accidental glance.

Now they'd broken up.

Yet suddenly, he kept seeking her out...
###Chapter 29: The Long-Awaited Fall

So the squeaky wheel really does get the grease.
Evelyn Sinclair finally understood this truth today.

Had she known earlier, she would've cast aside all restraint—making small scenes every three days and big ones every five, turning the Kingsley household upside down.
At least then she might have seen him more often.

What did it matter if he already despised her?
What had all her caution gained her over the years?

...

But it was too late for regrets now.
She no longer needed any of it...

The Maybach's windows were black as ink, like Alexander Kingsley's perpetually inscrutable eyes.
The stubbornness in the Sinclair bloodline had sealed their fate thirteen years ago.

Evelyn's lips curled in self-mockery.
The only thing she'd ever given up halfway in her life was her feelings for Alexander.

Once was enough.
Life offered no second chances.

While Ethan Miller still hesitated anxiously, Evelyn had already walked past him without looking back.
"Ms. Sinclair—" Ethan didn't dare stop her again.

The Maybach suddenly roared to life, cutting sharply across Evelyn's path.
"Get in."
Alexander's voice came through clearly.

Evelyn's lashes trembled slightly, but her gaze remained fixed ahead.
Now it was her turn to ignore him.

"Stop her."
At Alexander's icy command, the Maybach lurched onto the sidewalk, blocking Evelyn like an impenetrable wall.

The door slowly opened.
"Get in," Alexander repeated.

Evelyn had no choice but to look inside.
His chiseled profile appeared slightly pale, thin lips pressed tightly together.

She'd been mistaken...
Alexander still couldn't even grant her the courtesy of eye contact.

"Say what you need to say here," Evelyn replied calmly, knowing escape was impossible.
Her gaze met his evenly.

"Resign. Retract the article. Apologize—" He turned fully toward her, his haggard features no less striking, "—to Isabella Winslow."

Evelyn bit her lower lip.
So all this pursuit had been for Isabella's sake.

To spare his beloved any discomfort...
To ensure no third-party blemishes tainted their love story.

Evelyn suddenly laughed.
"I thought Nathan made our position quite clear."

"I'll resign, but the article stays." Her tone brooked no argument. "As for an apology—"
"Whether I've spread lies, Lord Alex knows the truth."

Alexander's jaw clenched audibly.
"Evelyn, this is your last chance—"

"When have you ever given me chances?" Evelyn interrupted, eyes flashing with derision. "Spare me the false generosity."

A glacial chill entered Alexander's gaze.
Evelyn had already lowered her head. "I won't waste any more of your time."

She turned and strode quickly away, disappearing down a one-way street.
This time, Alexander didn't follow.

Perhaps because of the traffic laws.
Or perhaps because she was no longer worth the effort.

Evelyn exhaled deeply.
She was far too busy now for these games.

She almost understood Alexander's perpetual impatience with her.
She'd had too much free time before...

Enough to fixate entirely on one man.
And in the end, she'd only cheapened herself.

...

Her interview with Ryan Holt was scheduled for three days later.
Coincidentally, he'd be in Kingsbury for a commercial shoot—his team had miraculously carved out three hours.

When the news spread, her colleagues' stares grew frostier.
Ryan was notorious for his packed schedule, planned down to the minute.

There was only one explanation for Evelyn securing three hours: nepotism.
"The Crown Prince really dotes on her."
"Too much favor can backfire..."
"Let's see how this plays out."

Evelyn heard every word.
She didn't care.

After thirteen years beside Alexander Kingsley, what insult hadn't she endured?
If the person who mattered most couldn't hurt her, why would strangers?

Arriving at Ryan's hotel after his shoot, his assistant made her wait thirty minutes before granting entry.
Upon entering, his manager produced a sealed bag.

"All electronic devices, please."
Evelyn blinked.

"That wasn't part of our agreement." What journalist didn't use recording devices?
Ryan's previous interview refusals had cited time constraints, not diva behavior.

"Our oversight," the manager smiled apologetically. "Ryan gets nervous around recording equipment—mild social anxiety."

It made sense. Ryan was famously reticent in public, which fans praised as authenticity.
"Fine, I'll take handwritten notes." Evelyn surrendered her devices.

The manager handed back the bag. "Just place it aside."
Entering the inner suite, an assistant scanned her with a metal detector.

"Apologies—paparazzi tactics keep evolving." The assistant offered an ingratiating smile.
Evelyn nodded understandingly.

She was led to the suite's sitting area, where the assistant poured water before exiting.
Evelyn arranged her notepad. Without recordings it would be challenging, but her shorthand skills remained sharp.

The room was silent save for pen scratches.
Minutes ticked by with no sign of Ryan.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, raising the temperature steadily.
The sealed room felt like a greenhouse.

Evelyn wiped her forehead, glancing at the AC vent.
Odd—cold air was clearly flowing.

"Could we adjust the—" She turned to find herself alone.
The door was shut, the assistant gone.

...

Every nerve in Evelyn's body went on high alert.
She approached the thermostat.

23°C.
It shouldn't be this hot—either the AC was broken, or...

"See something interesting?"
A male voice whispered directly in her ear.

...

Evelyn's entire body erupted in goosebumps.
###Chapter 30: The Price of Being Spoiled

"What are you looking at?"

A strange male voice suddenly whispered in her ear.

Evelyn Sinclair spun around, her back hitting the cold air conditioning panel.

The metal's chill seeped through her silk blouse like a venomous snake slithering up her spine.

Ryan Holt's face was inches from hers.

She could even smell the scent of his body wash mixed with lingering dampness.

"Hello." Evelyn forced composure, sidestepping half a step away.

Plink.

A drop of water fell from his hair onto her hand.

The rising superstar was undeniably handsome—his sharp features beneath wet hair even more striking than on screen.

But Evelyn sensed danger.

Unlike Alexander Kingsley's reassuring dominance, this man made her entire body tense.

"Horizon Media, Evelyn Sinclair." She flashed her press pass. "Scheduled interview."

Ryan suddenly raised his arm, trapping her against the wall.

"How deep?" He raised a suggestive brow.

Disgust churned in Evelyn's stomach.

A nobody three months ago, now he thought he could look down on everyone.

"Mr. Holt," she met his leering gaze, "maintain professional distance."

His eyes locked onto her flushed cheeks like he'd discovered treasure.

The room was stifling, yet this woman's stare remained icy.

"Aren't you hot, Miss Sinclair?" He deliberately leaned closer. "Want to... relocate?"

Before she could react, he suddenly bent to grab her.

"Ah!"

A scream echoed through the suite.

By the time Ryan collapsed to his knees, his forehead already bore a dark bruise.

His assistant barely opened the door before a flying phone smashed into his face.

"Stop her!" Ryan roared, clutching his arm.

When the entourage rushed in, the hallway stood empty.

"Isabella..." Ryan's trembling fingers dialed. "There's been a... complication..."

"Useless!" Isabella Winslow's shriek nearly shattered his eardrum. "Do you know how hard I worked to convince Alexander to catch her in the act?"

The call ended with a violent click.

Ryan slumped onto the sofa, cold sweat beading on his forehead.

......

Inside the black Maybach, Alexander's knuckles whitened around an anonymous letter.

"Trading your body for an interview?" His冷笑 dripped with contempt. "How impressive, Evelyn."

Ethan Miller shrank in his seat, not daring to breathe.

Suddenly, his eyes widened. "Sir! It's Miss Sinclair!"

Near the hotel's revolving doors, the staggering figure could only be Evelyn.

Her cheeks burned crimson, steps unsteady—yet she death-gripped a recorder.

Alexander's gaze darkened.

This was the Evelyn his mother called "poorly raised"?

Spoiled rotten enough to abandon all principles?
###Chapter 31: Her Damnable Sweetness

Evelyn Sinclair's steps were quick yet steady. Only she knew the fire raging inside her was threatening to consume all reason.

Her fingers tightened around the stun ring on her wrist, its metal surface still warm to the touch.

When Ryan Holt tried to embrace her, she'd struck without hesitation.

The electric current hit his forehead with precision, filling the air with the acrid scent of burning flesh.

His screams echoed through the confined space.

This pretty-faced celebrity wouldn't dare show his face on camera for at least two weeks.

Seven years at Royal Gardens hadn't turned Evelyn into some fragile hothouse flower.

Losing her parents' protection had forced her to sharpen her claws in the shadows long ago.

She'd come prepared for this interview.

From Ryan's financial backers to Summer Sky Entertainment's gamble, no detail escaped her notice.

Isabella Winslow's trap was cleverly laid, but she'd underestimated her prey's vigilance.

The moment Evelyn spotted that white patch near the air vent, everything became clear.

The abnormal temperature settings on the control panel only confirmed her suspicions.

Ryan was merely a puppet—with the Winslows pulling his strings.

Sunlight stabbed at Evelyn's eyes as she stumbled into the street.

She staggered into the shadow behind an office building, letting the fountain's mist cool her fevered skin.

The antidote she'd taken earlier preserved her sanity, but couldn't suppress her body's reactions.

As she leaned against the cold brick wall gasping, a shadow fell over her.

Alexander Kingsley stood before her, his arrival silent as a panther's.

Evelyn's pupils contracted before she curled her lips in a mocking smile. "Did Isabella send you to inspect her handiwork?"

She knew this script by heart.

Isabella wanted Alexander to witness her "betrayal" firsthand—to sever their last remaining ties.

Alexander didn't answer.

His hand closed around her wrist with bone-crushing force.

"Are those lowlifes really so irresistible?" His voice was dangerously soft, his gaze tracing the flush across her cheeks.

Evelyn had to tilt her head back to meet his eyes.

The dark turbulence in those depths was a warning she knew too well.

Her legs gave out suddenly, sending her collapsing against Alexander's chest.

The unexpected contact froze them both.

His breathing grew noticeably ragged.

Strong arms locked around her, trapping her against him.

"Let go—" Her voice trembled in a way she didn't recognize.

"Let you go?" Alexander's laugh was icy. "So you can keep throwing yourself at trash?"

His thumb brushed her burning lips, his gaze darkening further.

Evelyn knew—this battle had only just begun.
###Chapter 32: The Stain of Disgrace

"The Kingsley family's reputation?"

Evelyn Sinclair let out a soft, mocking laugh.

She stopped resisting. Instead, her slender arms wound around Alexander Kingsley's neck like vines. Her fingertips traced the skin at his nape, teasing with featherlight touches.

Her thumb grazed the curve of his ear, trailed along his sharp jawline, and finally hovered before his eyes.

A perfect balance of provocation and restraint.

Tilting her face up, she parted her lips. Warm breath laced with damp mist brushed against him. "You worry too much, Lord Alex. My last name is Sinclair. Even if I did something shameful, it wouldn't disgrace the Kingsleys..."

What connection remained between them?

Back when she lived at Royal Gardens, if not for the Kingsleys' reluctant courtesy, Alexander's attitude made clear she didn't even deserve the title of girlfriend.

"What's wrong?" Her voice dripped with deliberate insolence. "Is Lord Alex angry..." Her fingertip pressed against his lips. "...or scared that his toy ran away?"

Alexander seized her wrist with crushing force.

The next instant, her back slammed against the fountain's edge.

Icy droplets soaked through her thin blouse. His scorching palm branded her waist while his mouth claimed hers with savage intensity.

Evelyn didn't resist.

In the brief moment their lips parted, she nearly laughed aloud.

This madness would become evidence against her later.

Her submission was a crime. Her devotion was a crime. Even her existence was a crime.

"Mmm—" Sharp pain bloomed on her lips.

He bit her again.

Like she was an inanimate object to be marked with his teeth and blood.

Evelyn shoved against his chest and bit back hard.

The metallic tang of blood filled their mouths.

Alexander froze. Suddenly, his hands gripped her waist and lifted her entire body. She clung to him instinctively, like a drowning woman clutching driftwood.

"Evelyn Sinclair." His eyes burned crimson, voice ragged. "How could you be... so filthy?"

Without warning, he dragged them both into the fountain.

Freezing water swallowed them whole—

......

"Evelyn Sinclair, how could you be so filthy?"

She'd heard those same words five years ago.

On her eighteenth birthday, the Kingsleys threw her a grand celebration.

Alexander never showed.

After the party, she hid among the rose bushes, wiping away tears.

Then his voice came from the shadows: "Evelyn, come here. I have a gift for you..."

That night was a blur of sweetness and aching pleasure.

But at dawn, when she tentatively wrapped her arms around him—

He shoved her away violently.

The look he gave her was like she was something vile.

"Evelyn Sinclair, how could you be so filthy?"

......

Water roared in her ears.

The icy cascade shocked her feverish skin into shivers.

Alexander gripped her chin underwater. "Where did he touch you?" His rough thumb ground against her lips. "Here? Or—"

"You're insane!" Evelyn shoved him away.

"Alexander! Let her go!" Julian Ashford's voice cut through the chaos.

Alexander finally released her and stepped out of the fountain.

Evelyn staggered onto the pavement—then the world spun violently.

"Evelyn!"

Julian's shout was the last thing she heard.

......

Cold.

Hot.

The alternating extremes tortured her nerves.

Her throat felt stuffed with cotton, mute.

In the darkness, someone kept calling her name: "Evelyn... Evelyn..."

Like that summer when Alexander broke his leg hiking and burned with fever.

She stayed by his bed, her wrist trapped in his grip.

Half-asleep, she'd heard him murmur her name repeatedly.

When she shook him awake and asked if he'd had a nightmare—

He stared at her for a long moment before saying, "Julian pushed me. Stay away from him."

......

Her eyes opened to a sterile white ceiling.

No warm embrace. No familiar voice.

"Won't you eat more?" A woman's voice, sweet as honey. "I simmered this porridge for three hours."

Evelyn forced herself upright.

"Miss Sinclair, you're awake!" A nurse exclaimed.

Then froze mid-step.

The scene before her was unmistakable—
###Chapter 33: Their Affection Stung Her Eyes

Evelyn Sinclair blinked awake as harsh sunlight streamed through the curtains.

She squinted to see Isabella Winslow leaning over Alexander Kingsley's hospital bed, her delicate fingers holding a spoon. "Just one more bite, Alex?" Her saccharine voice dripped with false sweetness.

The spoon touched Alexander's lips as Isabella turned to shoot Evelyn a triumphant look.

Evelyn's throat constricted. Her fingernails dug into her palms.

"Awake?" Alexander's voice cut through the tension.

He pushed Isabella away, sending the porcelain spoon clattering against the bowl.

Evelyn realized she lay on a cot beside his bed, an IV needle taped to her hand.

Ethan Miller approached quietly. "Miss Sinclair, you collapsed outside. Lord Alex carried you here himself—"

Evelyn turned her face away.

If Alexander hadn't intervened, she could have endured the drug's effects. Now her skin burned, her throat raw as if scorched by fire.

"The doctor said it was an allergic reaction," Ethan added, glancing nervously at Alexander.

Alexander's brow furrowed, his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Ethan didn't dare mention how Lord Alex had cradled her for hours before Isabella arrived.

"Since everyone's here," Alexander said abruptly, "let's settle this."

The room fell silent.

"Isabella and I don't have the relationship you fabricated." His eyes bore into Evelyn. "You'll issue a public apology. I might overlook this, but her career could suffer."

Evelyn almost laughed.

She only needed to look at them—Isabella practically draped over Alexander, their hands nearly touching on the sheets.

No relationship?

When she remained silent, Alexander continued, "As for your job, your probation period is terminated."

Evelyn's head snapped up, shock flashing in her eyes.

"With your current performance," Alexander sneered, "do you even deserve to be a journalist?"

"What performance?" She lifted her chin in defiance.

Alexander's eyes darkened.

Always this way—outwardly compliant, yet challenging him at every turn.

"Your first article was libelous. Now you nearly got yourself assaulted during an interview." His voice turned icy. "If I hadn't arrived, would you have just—"

When the doctor revealed the drug's effects, he'd nearly put a bullet through Ryan Holt right then.

"After all the Kingsleys have done for you, this is how you repay us?"

The air turned frigid.

"Lord Alex," Evelyn finally spoke, "the Kingsleys' generosity and my parents' sacrifices for your family cancel each other out."

This was the first time she'd invoked her parents' legacy. Once, she'd feared being accused of exploiting their memory. Now, she wielded it like a blade to sever ties.

"From today onward, I live by my own strength." Her quiet words cut deeper than any shout.

Evelyn yanked out her IV.

Blood bloomed on the white sheets like crimson petals.

"If you think I libeled you, sue me. As a journalist, I'll face the consequences." She stood. "No need for your concern."

Bodyguards blocked the exit. Without Alexander's order, no one dared let her pass.

"Evelyn," Isabella simpered, "you mustn't upset Alex in his condition. Don't be unreasonable."

Evelyn watched her performance coldly.

This mastermind now played the peacemaker.

Ignoring her, Evelyn turned to Ethan. "Where's my bag?"

After checking her belongings, she sat on the cot's edge, packing methodically while tuning out Isabella's theatrics.

"Alex, time for your medicine..."
"Should I peel you an apple?"
"Which script do you think suits me best?"

Isabella's tinkling laughter grated, but Evelyn refused to react.

"Any charging cables?" she asked Ethan.

Ethan glanced at Alexander.

"Get it yourself," Alexander snapped.

Evelyn acted as if she hadn't heard.

Isabella jumped up. "Let me hel—"

"Help with what?" Eleanor Kingsley's cheerful voice rang from the doorway. "My, has this become a shared room?"

Behind her, Julian Ashford's silhouette came into clear view.
###Chapter 34: Protective Eleanor Confronts the Scheming Isabella

"Mom..."

Alexander finally understood where Evelyn got her stubbornness.

Eleanor Kingsley had actually brought Julian Ashford into the hospital room!

Was she deliberately stirring up trouble?

"Alex, this is unacceptable," Eleanor scolded without hesitation. "I found Mr. Ashford waiting outside when I arrived. He came specifically to see you, and you left him standing there?"

She pushed past Ethan Miller to sit beside Evelyn's bed. "Evelyn, what happened? I heard you fainted. No job is worth sacrificing your health."

She took Evelyn's hand and frowned. "Why are your hands so cold?"

Her sharp gaze immediately turned toward Alexander.

Isabella Winslow had already sprung away from his bedside, sitting rigidly upright.

The memory of Eleanor's previous public humiliation still fresh, the actress regarded the unpredictable socialite with visible fear.

"Hmph," Eleanor sneered. "When your heart turns cold, of course your hands would freeze."

Alexander found his mother utterly unreasonable.

"Mom—"

"Don't call me that! I should've birthed a dumpling instead!" Eleanor's temper flared.

She'd thought her son finally came to his senses by arranging their shared hospital room.

Only to find him cozying up with Isabella right in front of Evelyn!

"Mr. Ashford, sit here," Eleanor deliberately provoked, smiling sweetly at Julian. "Silly me—of course you're not here for Alex. Sit beside Evelyn. Poor girl has no one keeping her company during her hospitalization. Thank you for remembering her."

Even the usually composed Julian looked uncomfortable.

After Alexander forcibly took Evelyn away, he'd worried for her safety but was barred from entering.

Contacting Eleanor had been his last resort...

Her blatant falsehoods now made him flush with secondhand embarrassment.

"You called my mother?"

Julian hadn't even sat down before Alexander confronted him.

He'd specifically ordered his staff to keep Evelyn's condition from Eleanor.

Only Julian—this man would stoop to any level to get close to Evelyn.

Julian scoffed, redirecting the accusation: "Miss Winslow, I heard Ryan Holt signed a betting agreement with your company. Did you arrange that interview?"

Evelyn looked up in surprise.

Both Eleanor and Alexander instantly focused on Isabella.

Eleanor's eyes burned with undisguised hostility, though she didn't yet grasp the full situation.

Alexander's gaze turned glacial.

"I-I don't know..." Isabella trembled. "I never involve myself in company affairs... Mr. Ashford, what interview? I don't understand..."

She had to play dumb!

Without concrete proof, no one could confirm her scheme.

After coming this far, she couldn't fail at the final step!

Julian lacked solid evidence.

Ryan wouldn't dare talk.

Even if Alexander uncovered the betting agreement, it wouldn't prove she targeted Evelyn.

Gaining confidence, Isabella pressed: "Mr. Ashford, what exactly happened? Did Ryan cause trouble?"

Eleanor demanded: "Explain properly, Mr. Ashford!"

She hated these half-spoken accusations!

Julian's vague hints only confirmed Isabella's malice without specifics—infuriating!

Naturally, Julian wouldn't elaborate.

Evelyn's reputation was at stake, and he lacked complete information.

Yet he continued pressuring Isabella: "That anonymous tip came from you, didn't it? They knew the exact location. What were you planning, Isabella?"

He advanced step by step. "You notified Alexander too, didn't you?"

"Did you want to ruin Evelyn? Have us witness her humiliation?"

"Or when your plan failed, you needed me to clean up the mess?"

He'd stood close enough during Evelyn's blood test to hear the results.

"You set Evelyn up, wanting Alexander to see her compromised. When that failed, you panicked and called me to snatch her away... Isabella, you've mastered the Winslow family's scheming perfectly!"

Cold sweat trickled down Isabella's temples.

He'd deduced everything...

Julian had unraveled her entire plot.

No wonder he was Horizon Media's heir apparent—a media genius.

Yet this brilliant man remained hopelessly devoted to Evelyn.

How did that plain girl deserve this?

Eleanor abruptly stood.

"Isabella Winslow! Explain yourself!" Though only grasping seventy percent, Eleanor's fury ignited. "Shall I teach you the lesson your mother failed to?"

"Aunt Eleanor, I'm innocent!" Isabella shook like a leaf, tears cascading. "I'll investigate to clear my name... I love Alex, but I'd never break them up..."

Her pitiful weeping failed to move Eleanor. Desperate, she clutched Alexander's sleeve.

"Alex, you know me best. Would I do this? Anyone can doubt me, but not you... If you don't believe me, I'll jump from this window right now!"

"Then jump!" Eleanor sneered, gesturing toward the window. "If you won't, I'll gladly assist!"

Isabella had no real intention. Sobbing hysterically, she tried collapsing into Alexander's arms.

"Alex, I've worked so hard to reconcile you and Evelyn..."

Alexander raised an arm to block her.

"I'll investigate." His voice could freeze hell.

Isabella's blood ran cold.

He doubted her!

"How can you believe Julian over me?" She grew frantic. "Alex, after everything between us, you'd trust him instead? I... I..."

Eleanor stepped aside, clearing a path to the window.

"By all means," she said coolly. "Take the leap."
###Chapter 35: What's Wrong With Men These Days

Isabella Winslow shot to her feet, her face deathly pale.

Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

"I swear I'll prove my innocence!" Her voice trembled. "If I can't, then I'll—"

Before finishing, she turned and stormed out of the hospital room, leaving behind a heavy silence.

Madam Eleanor Kingsley scoffed. "That's all she's got?"

She hurried over to Evelyn Sinclair, scrutinizing her. "Evelyn, did she hurt you?"

Before Evelyn could answer, Madam Kingsley slammed her hand on the table. "So what if something happened? Are men the only ones allowed to have fun these days?"

"If you're interested, darling, I'll find you a dozen handsome men to play with—a different one every day!"

Evelyn massaged her temples.

Madam Kingsley never failed to surprise her.

"Oh!" Madam Kingsley suddenly remembered something and turned to Alexander Kingsley. "Where's that male model catalog I left here?"

Alexander's face darkened. "Burned it."

"Burned it?" Madam Kingsley laughed instead of getting angry, pulling a brand-new catalog from her bag. "Good thing I printed ten backup copies."

She eagerly shoved it toward Evelyn. "Take a look, darling—"

Julian Ashford leaned in curiously.

Alexander abruptly stood and strode over to snatch it away.

"Wait, Aunt Eleanor," Evelyn suddenly picked up her phone. "It's Martha Nash."

Martha's furious voice blasted through the speaker. "Evelyn Sinclair! Do you have any idea Ryan Holt's interview fell through? The entire team's hard work went down the drain!"

"I'm sorry, Martha, I—"

Madam Kingsley snatched the phone. "Who do you think you are, yelling at my Evelyn like that?"

Martha paused. "...Who is this?"

"Someone you don't want to mess with!" Madam Kingsley unleashed her full fury. "Are employees not human? Do they need permission to get sick? Is your company a prison?"

Alexander frowned.

Madam Kingsley only grew more heated. "Why don't you yell at Alexander Kingsley instead? Coward!"

Alexander, caught in the crossfire: "?"

Ethan Miller seized the moment to stir the pot. "Horizon Media is a joke!"

Madam Kingsley redirected her anger. "Julian Ashford! How do you run this company?"

Julian: "..."

Ethan pressed on. "Miss Sinclair should join Kingsley Group! Lord Alex always protects his own!"

Evelyn rubbed her forehead. "Thanks, but no."

Alexander's expression darkened further.

Madam Kingsley smirked.

This was just the beginning.

He'd be crying soon enough.

Two days later, Evelyn returned to the office.

Martha dragged her aside. "What exactly did you do to Ryan Holt?"

Evelyn blinked. "What could I possibly do to him?"

"Then why did he say you..." Martha hesitated. "...made inappropriate advances?"
###Chapter 36: Ruin Him Within Three Days

Martha Nash narrowed her eyes, fingertips tapping the desk. "My professional instinct tells me Ryan Holt is about to crash and burn."

She leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "Rumor has it he changed his hairstyle overnight—that fringe is so thick it could double as an umbrella. Don't you find that suspicious?"

The entertainment industry had no secrets.

Ryan had abruptly broken contract, then granted an exclusive interview to Horizon Media's rival. Leaked photos showed his heavy fringe obscuring half his face—ironic for someone who'd once mocked celebrities relying on bangs to hide flaws, boasting he was a "true heartthrob unafraid to show his forehead."

...

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent.

Ryan's hatred for her was justified.

In showbiz, looks were currency. Her slap had threatened his livelihood.

But she didn't regret it.

Drugged and disoriented, she'd meant to strike his cheek. In that panicked moment, she'd dialed her stun ring to maximum voltage—ensuring he'd never forget the lesson.

Mrs. Kingsley always called Evelyn a pushover.

She never realized this seemingly soft dumpling hid a needle laced with venom.

Ryan could only swallow his rage. If he dared complain, people would ask: Why would a journalist attack him so viciously?

Unless she'd been pushed to the brink.

Everyone knew the industry's dirty secrets. No one ripped off the veneer unless facing utter ruin.

"By the way," Martha suddenly changed subjects, "who was that woman protecting you?"

Evelyn paused. "My aunt."

"Thought it was your mom," Martha clicked her tongue, eyes gleaming. "Feisty. I like that..."

Evelyn: "..."

Was her boss a sadist or a masochist?

Martha clapped her shoulder. "When you sue Alexander Kingsley, bring her along. Bet she'd shred him so badly he'd crawl away in shame."

Evelyn sighed. "You're a born journalist, Martha."

Mrs. Kingsley wouldn't just curse—she'd pelt her own son with slippers!

A sudden cheer erupted from nearby cubicles.

Simon York rushed over. "Martha! Team Two snatched Moon Over Misty Peaks!"

"What?!" Martha's lollipop clattered to the floor.

Moon Over Misty Peaks was Horizon's summer blockbuster bet, tracked since casting. Martha's team had fought hard for promotional rights—only to lose them at the final hurdle.

Like nurturing a fruit tree, only for someone to uproot it at harvest!

Daniel Young strutted over smugly. "Martha, Victoria wants all Misty Peaks materials transferred to me. Hurry up—don't waste our time."

Martha stormed into the department head's office. Soon, Victoria Henn's icy voice carried through the floor:

"Your team's instability makes Misty Peaks too risky. Daniel delivered last quarter's best performance—he's the safe choice."

Martha protested, "That was unpredictable—"

"As editor, you lacked contingency plans?" Victoria cut in sharply. "Sending a rookie out alone reflects your leadership?"

"Ryan specifically requested Evelyn—"

"Enough!" Victoria's voice spiked. "Fix your team first. One more failure, and even I can't save you."

Martha muttered something, but Victoria's next words silenced the office:

"I don't care who backs her. Entertainment doesn't carry dead weight. If she's so talented, let her prove it elsewhere—not drag the entire department down!"

Martha emerged pale with fury.

The floor held its breath.

Evelyn traced her keyboard's edge.

Julian Ashford had promised no blame would fall on her—but workplaces wielded soft knives.

Victoria's reprimand targeted Martha, yet every word stabbed at Evelyn. Unable to fire her directly, they'd pressure her to quit.

At noon, Julian invited her to lunch.

Declining, Evelyn carried her meal to the cafeteria—freezing at overheard gossip:

"She handed Ryan to Orange Media on a platter, yet the Crown Prince still shields her?"

"Maybe she's got... special skills."

"Just transfer to Corporate already. Stop poisoning Entertainment."

"Kingsley Group sued for eight million? Is the Crown Prince really paying her debts?"

...

Evelyn had grown immune to such whispers.

But slandering Julian crossed the line.

She marched inside, lunchbox slamming onto a table.

Silence fell.

Coworkers exchanged uneasy glances.

Evelyn scanned the room, her voice glacial:

"Three days. That's all I need to ruin Ryan Holt."
###Chapter 37: She Ran Away, Now I Regret Chasing Her

"Ryan Holt's career will be ruined within three days?"

Melissa Lee tapped her fingers on the desk, a mocking smile curling her crimson lips. "Does she really think Julian would move against Ryan for her sake? That cash cow was handpicked by investors—does she think she can just take him down?"

"But Melissa, the whole company's buzzing about her being the Crown Prince's..."

Melissa tossed her long hair back. "What do they know? Back at Imperial Media University, Evelyn Sinclair was always clinging to Julian. He was just being kind to a junior—yet she took it as permission to overstep." She twisted a lock of hair around her finger. "Couldn't even land a proper job, so she shamelessly latched onto him."

"Exactly," agreed Victoria Henn, head of the entertainment division. "Gossip spreads like wildfire among low-level staff. Everyone in management knows about your history with the Crown Prince. Those rumors make my blood boil."

"Julian let the Ryan incident slide out of respect for their shared alma mater. Yet she actually thinks she's special." Melissa's grip on her hair tightened.

As the daughter of Horizon Media's co-founder, Melissa had been parachuted into the finance division after graduation. She and Julian Ashford were classmates in the same program—campus royalty, the perfect match.

Both families had long considered them destined for each other.

Until Evelyn enrolled in their graduate program.

Julian changed.

Always courteous, he became animated whenever Evelyn appeared. His eyes would follow her unconsciously, his lips curving into unguarded smiles.

Melissa had probed their relationship once.

Julian answered plainly: "Evelyn and I grew up together. I've always seen her as a younger sister."

True enough—after graduation, Julian joined Horizon, pursued further studies abroad, then returned... with no sign of Evelyn.

Melissa made her moves, hinting at her feelings through words and actions.

Julian never took the bait.

Only once did he slip.

Years ago, when Horizon was under siege by Kingsley Group and other investors, Julian returned from overseas to salvage the crisis.

At the victory banquet, he drank too much.

Melissa found him perched on a hotel rooftop windowsill, legs dangling over the edge.

"Tell me," his voice floated on the wind, "do only the dead get remembered?"

"If I died... would she think of me for the rest of her life?"

Melissa lunged forward and dragged him down.

Julian collapsed into her arms, tears streaming.

"I was such a fool..." His voice broke. "Why did I abandon her? Why did I lie? She trusted me completely..."

"I pushed her away with my own hands. Now I regret it and chase after her... How pathetic am I?"

Melissa asked, "Who is she?"

Julian hugged his knees in silence until sobriety returned.

That night was never mentioned again.

Melissa didn't dare ask.

She feared the answer.

Now, Evelyn had reappeared.

"Normally, probationary employees who make such mistakes should be fired immediately," Victoria said. "But I can't do it overtly."

Melissa raised a hand. "Don't fire her."

Her eyes narrowed. "Transfer her to the finance division."

At Imperial, Julian had shielded Evelyn from her reach.

Now, finance was her territory...

......

Office gossip grew uglier.

"Half a day left—where's that 'Ryan Holt will be ruined' promise?"

"Ryan's the industry's model professional. Even rival companies can't dig up dirt on him. Does she think she can conjure some?"

"If she actually had leverage, would Ryan have refused the interview? Overestimating herself after riding on her looks?"

"Did that Alexander Kingsley profile give her delusions of genius?"

"What was so special about that article? Martha spoon-fed her all the research!"

"This Ryan mess makes my blood pressure spike! Anyone else would've had the magazine on shelves by now! Now Orange Media gets the scoop!"

"How long has it been since Horizon lost to Orange? The whole company's efforts wasted because of one person!"

"Horizon's disgrace!"

"Shh—here comes Eight Million!"

......

Evelyn rather liked her new nickname.

Eight Million.

Sounded valuable.

Her colleagues fascinated her. They had private chats for backbiting, yet insisted on snide remarks within earshot.

The moment she appeared, they scattered like startled birds.

During work, they exchanged sudden laughter or meaningful glances...

Evelyn remained unruffled.

Martha Nash cracked first.

"Evelyn, do you actually have dirt on Ryan?" she asked.

The entire office strained to listen.

"Of course." Evelyn's tone was breezy.

"Then produce it!" Martha was sweating. Victoria had slashed her resources again, hinting everything would improve if she ditched Evelyn.

Martha wasn't fooled.

Victoria kept pushing her to play the villain.

"This Ryan situation is catastrophic," Martha whispered. "I might not be able to protect you. Maybe... a transfer?"

"No." Evelyn's voice was calm. "I said three days. There's still half a day left."

"What are you waiting for?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "I hear I'm Horizon's disgrace because Ryan chose Orange?"

The office fell silent.

Everyone pretended to work.

Then she smiled—a rare, fleeting bloom.

"Martha, what if I could turn this around? Make Orange lose their prize and their leverage?"
###Chapter 38: Scandal Erupts, Cheater Exposed

"Holy shit! Is this woman insane?"
The private chat group exploded with messages.

"If she can turn this around, I'll livestream drinking bubble tea upside down!"
"Bubble tea? I'll swallow a keyboard!"
"Keyboard's child's play. I'll eat a monitor!"

The group fell silent for a second.
"Anyone dare to eat shit?"
"I will!"

The journalism circle never lacked daredevils.
Entertainment reporters were the most ruthless of them all.

Victoria Henn's roar cut through the office noise: "Are you all deaf? Check the work group chat!"
Instant silence fell.

Her next words froze the air:
"Ryan Holt just got exposed by his ex! Cheating, sleeping with fans, forcing abortions! Are you all dead—"

The sharp crack of a keyboard slamming on a desk made everyone jump.
Evelyn Sinclair stood up with a dark expression and left.
Stunned silence filled the room.

"She dug this up?"
"Why wait until now to drop such explosive news?"
"How did she even get this?"
"She looks... upset?"

Ten minutes later, Evelyn returned to her desk.
Her expression had softened slightly, but her brow remained furrowed.

Martha Nash's laughter broke the tension: "Evelyn! Orange Media just recalled their freshly printed magazine! All pre-orders canceled. Bet they're fuming!"
Evelyn pressed her lips together.

Orange Media had specially added a Ryan Holt feature.
Fans had pushed pre-orders past 100,000 copies.
Their editor-in-chief had bragged about "Orange Media speed" on social media.
Now reality had slapped them hard.

Horizon Media staff worked overtime tracking developments.
Strangely, previously unverifiable rumors now flooded out like a broken dam.
Even his kindergarten teacher claimed he'd kissed girls at age three.

At 4 AM, as they wrapped up, someone muttered:
"Who promised to livestream eating shit earlier?"
"Ugh—" Someone actually gagged.

Martha walked Evelyn downstairs:
"Brilliant work, but warn me next time."
Evelyn looked down: "No one believed me..."

Martha looked guilty: "It's not that. Orange Media... they tried to acquire Horizon during our crisis years."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered.
Was that the rainy night?
When she'd knelt outside Royal Gardens begging Alexander Kingsley to believe her...

Julian Ashford's car waited below.
"It's late. Your parents asked me to look after you."
Evelyn seemed lost: "Before age ten... I don't remember."

The night her mother jumped, trauma stole her voice.
After recovery, all memories before ten had vanished.

The Kingsleys said her parents died saving their family.
Each mention felt like a boulder on her heart.
Tears welled but never fell.

She'd scoured every Autumn Detail report:
[Annual Corporate Rankings]
[Industry Trends]
[Short-Selling Legends]
[Fraud Scandals]...

Alexander would never understand.
"Mommy, the brooch is gone..."
This lone memory haunted her childhood.
###Chapter 39: A Fake Apology? Not Accepted!

The night deepened, streetlights casting dappled shadows across Evelyn Sinclair's face.

She stood beside Julian Ashford's car, fingers absently tracing the strap of her purse.

"Senior, you really don't need to drive me," she murmured.

Julian rested one hand on the steering wheel. "I'm going that way anyway."

As they spoke, a slender figure emerged from the shadows.

"Always so considerate, Julian." Melissa Lee approached in clicking heels, her gaze sweeping over Evelyn. "Long time no see, junior."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Senior Lee."

This childhood friend of Julian's had regarded her with hostility since freshman orientation.

Evelyn remembered sophomore year when Melissa cornered her outside the library.

"Orphaned, I hear?" Melissa had smiled sweetly, her words razor-sharp. "No wonder you're so good at clinging to powerful people."

Those venomous words had coiled around her heart, making her avoid Julian for a month.

"Lucky junior." Melissa's voice snapped her back to the present. "Julian helped with your thesis, and now he digs up dirt for your work—"

"Melissa!" Julian's expression darkened. "Evelyn completed her thesis independently. The Ryan Holt situation has nothing to do with me."

Melissa's smile froze.

She hated nothing more than Julian's protective stance toward Evelyn.

Evelyn abruptly opened the car door and slid inside.

"You—" Melissa grabbed for the rear handle, finding it locked.

"Julian!" She rapped on the window.

He lowered it slightly. "Isn't your car parked over there?"

Evelyn waved through the glass. "Goodnight, senior."

In the rearview mirror, they watched Melissa hurl her handbag to the pavement.

......

Silence filled the car.

Julian chuckled unexpectedly. "You've grown bold."

Evelyn watched neon lights streak past the window. "I cared too much about others' opinions before."

She finally understood—no matter how carefully you tread, those who despise you will always find fault.

Better to live unapologetically.

"About Ryan Holt..." She turned to Julian.

"Wasn't me." He kept his eyes on the road. "I know you have your own plans."

Evelyn blinked.

This didn't align with Julian's usual approach.

He preferred supporting her from the sidelines, not taking over.

Then who?

The car stopped at her apartment complex.

Evelyn had barely stepped out when she felt piercing eyes upon her.

Alexander Kingsley leaned against a black Maybach, Isabella Winslow beside him wrapped in a silk shawl.

Evelyn turned to leave.

"Evelyn!" Isabella rushed forward. "I came to apologize... I've waited four hours..."

Evelyn paused. "Did I ask you to wait?"

Isabella's tearful eyes sought Alexander. "Alex..."

"Evelyn." Alexander's voice was glacial. "Isabella came to make amends."

"So?" Evelyn's laugh was brittle. "Her apology obligates me to accept it?"

Alexander frowned.

When had she become so confrontational?

"Evelyn, I truly didn't know about Ryan's contract..." Isabella's eyes welled up. "I've already terminated it..."

Julian exited the car. "Your affairs don't concern her."

He positioned himself before Evelyn like an impenetrable shield.

Isabella's tears froze mid-track.

Alexander's gaze turned murderous.

Under the night sky, tension crackled between the four like live wires.
###Chapter 40: A Cornered Beast's Revenge

"Shut up!" Alexander's knuckles turned white, veins bulging.

Julian's holier-than-thou attitude never failed to ignite his fury.

Always pretending to care about Evelyn, yet abandoning her when it mattered most.

Julian ignored the provocation.

He subtly shifted position, shielding Evelyn behind him.

She seized the chance to swipe her access card, disappearing into the apartment complex.

Their seamless coordination made Alexander's face darken.

The quicker she left, the cleaner the break.

Julian was right—they shouldn't disturb her life anymore.

After leaving Royal Gardens, even the air smelled fresher. Isabella had transformed from a loathsome rival to a ridiculous clown.

Julian feared she might look back...

What pointless worry.

Golden afternoon light filtered through sheer curtains.

Evelyn lounged on the sofa, sipping milk while scrolling her phone.

Ryan Holt's scandal still dominated the top three trending spots.

Predictable—no amount of money could stop rival companies from piling on now.

His fans had gone berserk.

Most attacked everyone involved, from the whistleblowing ex-girlfriend to Orange Media's shutdown comment section.

Some even flooded Orange's website with false reports...

Evelyn suspected Horizon had instigators among them.

Orange's frantic damage control couldn't outweigh Ryan's shocking dirt or his fans' insanity.

Human nature at work.

Who'd admit falling for trash?

Even heartbroken, they'd screech "We stand with Ryan!"

Soon enough, they'd quietly find new idols.

Fickle little creatures.

Company chats buzzed with updates:

[Luxury brand ambassador status revoked! Removed from fall campaign!]

Evelyn arched a brow.

Dropped that fast? Capital had clearly abandoned him.

[Betting contract leaked! Summer Sky cutting losses!]

[Variety show rescheduling—AI face replacement likely!]

The dominoes kept falling.

She scrolled further.

[Skincare ad pulled, but客服 claims "contract intact."]

[Noodle endorsement playing dead, blaming "platform glitch."]

One last cash grab.

But boycott trends were spreading, with consumers vowing to avoid his products.

Ryan's career crumbled in real time.

From A-lister to pariah in twenty-four hours.

Her phone vibrated.

"Ryan's coming for you..." His ex-girlfriend's voice trembled.

Evelyn had been the first reporter to get her evidence.

"His manager threatened everyone involved... I didn't name you, but they suspect..."

"Who else contacted you?" Evelyn pressed.

"Sorry, I promised secrecy." The line went dead. "Be careful—he'll lash out now that he's fallen..."

Evelyn dressed for the department's victory celebration.

The orange polka-dot dress swayed as she applied rose-tinted lipstick.

She opened her door—

And immediately tried closing it.

Thud.

Alexander's palm blocked the way.

Dark circles shadowed his bloodshot eyes. "Where are you going?"

The cheerful outfit—fluttering skirt, loose braid—stabbed at him.

Evelyn released the door.

Resistance was futile against his strength.

She stepped back.

He invaded her colorful sanctuary: abstract art, stuffed animals, scattered clothes...

Not a trace of white.

Even her sneakers were denim blue.

The vibrant space disoriented him.

"Well?" Her entire body tensed.

His presence turned the room icy.
###Chapter 41: Lord Alex, Please Behave Yourself

"You still haven't told me where you're going." Alexander Kingsley crossed his long legs on the cramped sofa.

He casually pushed aside the floral dress beside him, his fingertips brushing against the cheap fabric's rough texture.

Evelyn Sinclair's wardrobe used to be his domain. These vibrant new dresses only appeared after she left.

For the first time, Alexander noticed how striking she looked in colors other than white.

Gone was that ethereal, untouchable aura. Now she radiated playful vitality.

Evelyn checked her watch. She'd be late for the team building.

"Lord Alex, I have my own life now." She paused. "Why are you here?"

"Come here." Alexander lazily lifted his arm, draping it over the sofa back.

The pose was an open invitation—one that used to send her rushing into his embrace.

Evelyn remained rooted, detachment flickering in her eyes.

Alexander's gaze darkened. "Will you come, or shall I fetch you?"

Her eyes darted to the open door.

The hallway was silent, but she knew Alexander never traveled alone.

With a sigh, she perched on the sofa's farthest edge.

"Alex—"

His hand shot out, yanking her against his chest before she could finish.

She struggled, but he flipped her beneath him. One hand pinned her wrists. The other gripped her chin.

"Skip the apologies," he commanded from above. "Quit Horizon Media. Come home. All is forgiven."

Evelyn knew this script by heart.

He wanted his usual release.

Just like before—impromptu visits to Royal Gardens, hurried satisfaction, then vanishing for days.

She'd been expected to wait on call, with no life or freedom of her own.

The absurdity struck her suddenly.

"Lord Alex—"

"Call me Alex." His thumb stroked her cheek, an uncharacteristic softness in his voice. "Keep using that formal nonsense, and I'll have your tongue."

"Alexander." She met his gaze without her old trepidation. "We're over. Show some respect."

His grip turned punishing.

"So?" A storm brewed in his eyes. "Rushing to Julian Ashford?"

Dolled up like this... for another man.

"It's a team building." Her voice was glacial. "Normal socializing. The kind of human existence I can finally have—now that I'm free of you."

A human existence.

She'd been his marionette before, every emotion tethered to his whims.

Alexander's laugh sent chills down her spine. "Did the Kingsleys mistreat you?"

"Your words, not mine." Her lashes cast shadows as they fluttered. "I was just the family's pet dog."

His jaw clenched.

She remembered every angry word, yet forgot years of care.

Such selective memory.

Unbecoming of a Sinclair.

"Lord Alex..." Nathan Carter's voice carried from the hallway.

Evelyn recognized his tactical timing—unlike Ethan Miller, Nathan knew when interruptions were safe.

Alexander shifted slightly, eyes still locked on her. "Wait."

"I'm traveling for business," he said abruptly. "Join me."

Evelyn froze.

Alexander never included her in his world, let alone work trips.

That invitation would've once sent her heart soaring.

Now, only quiet bitterness remained.

"Alexander," she repeated. "We're done."

Over. Finished. She'd said it countless times. He simply refused to hear.

Evelyn understood—it wasn't that Alexander couldn't accept their breakup. He simply didn't care about her feelings. His domineering nature conquered boardrooms but suffocated hearts.

"Lord Alex..." Nathan's voice came again. "We're on schedule."

Finally, Alexander rose.

His icy stare pinned her. "Be home before Patriarch Kingsley's eightieth birthday."

Don't test me, Evelyn Sinclair...

The door clicked shut.

Both Evelyn and Nathan exhaled in unison.

"Lord Alex?" Ethan Miller, now relegated to the car, proffered a steam eye mask. "The airport's still a distance. Some rest?"

Alexander had kept vigil outside Evelyn's apartment since last night. This noon's visit marked his first break.

He ignored the offering. "Send Nathan in."

Ethan's face fell. Was he being replaced?

Under Ethan's wounded stare, a bewildered Nathan entered the vehicle.

As the engine purred, Alexander spoke: "What exactly is her grievance?"

It was his first personal discussion with Nathan.

Nathan chose his words carefully. "Could it be... the Butterfly Brooch?"
###Chapter 42: When Love Fades, Contempt Follows

Evelyn Sinclair stormed into Kingsley Group's headquarters.

Isabella Winslow sat leisurely sipping coffee in the reception room.

Nathan Carter stood nearby, his gaze shifting uneasily between the two women.

"The Butterfly Brooch?" Alexander Kingsley tapped the desk with his slender fingers. "Who do you think is lying?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, fury burning in her eyes. Isabella wore an innocent expression, tear stains still visible at the corners of her eyes.

"Hard to say," Nathan answered cautiously. "Miss Sinclair appears genuinely angry, while Miss Winslow seems truly wronged."

Alexander suddenly produced a multicolored dragonfly brooch from his pocket. "Both are my possessions. Why does she only care about one?"

Beads of sweat formed on Nathan's forehead.

This question was too dangerous.

She treasured it before because she loved him. Now she scorns it because that love is gone.

But he didn't dare say that aloud.

"Perhaps... that brooch holds special meaning for her?" Nathan ventured. "Like how some people only wear one particular scent."

Alexander nodded thoughtfully.

Nathan exhaled quietly in relief.

Alexander leaned back in the car seat, a faint smile playing on his lips.

He remembered.

That year Evelyn turned sixteen. She'd secretly torn a page from an auction catalog. Seeing her disappointment, he'd gone to great lengths to acquire that butterfly brooch.

When she accepted it, her eyes had sparkled like stars.

He'd given her countless jewels since, but never saw that same radiance again.

"Research this brooch's history," Alexander sent Nathan the photo. "Find out who else in the country owns one."

Inside the KTV private room, Evelyn found herself surrounded by colleagues.

"Latecomers must drink!" they chanted.

Three shots of strong liquor sat before her. Evelyn waved her hands in refusal. "I really can't drink..."

She recalled Mrs. Kingsley's warnings and Alexander's words.

"The first time matters most," someone urged. "You'll need to socialize for future news assignments."

As Evelyn hesitated, a pair of masculine hands suddenly lifted the glasses.

Julian Ashford threw back his head and drained all three shots in quick succession.

The room fell silent.

He scanned the crowd with an impassive expression. "How many more penalties?"

No one dared respond.

"We're in the next room." Julian gave Evelyn a nod before leaving.

The colleagues exchanged glances, their gazes toward Evelyn growing complicated.

Evelyn stood at the restroom sink, washing her hands.

"Junior," Simon York sidled closer. "How did you dig up those scandals on Ryan Holt?"

Evelyn worked the soap into lather, smiling without answering.

Her reflection showed exquisite features. Simon quickly averted his eyes. "So... do you have more dirt on him?"
###Chapter 43: False Accusations

Hot air rushed from the hand dryer.

Evelyn Sinclair focused on drying her hands, the machine's roar filling her ears.

"What?" She turned to Simon York.

Simon patiently repeated himself.

"I've already said everything," Evelyn blinked, her tone light. "Any new discoveries, senior?"

"I could never compare to you." Simon shook his head with a smile. "You're the expert here."

"You're too modest." Evelyn waved her hands dismissively. "My first article only succeeded because of your guidance..."

They chatted amiably as they returned to the private room—only to find it relocated.

Julian Ashford had upgraded to a luxury suite, merging both departments together.

Evelyn froze in the doorway.

The room now held unfamiliar faces—likely Horizon Media's upper management.

She moved to retreat with Simon, but Victoria Henn seized her arm.

"Evelyn!" Victoria beamed, her demeanor a stark contrast to usual. "We owe you big this time. Without you, we'd be ruined."

She eagerly introduced the assembled executives.

"We've met." Melissa Lee interjected, her smile strained. "Evelyn was quite the campus celebrity."

The social affairs editor leaned in with interest. "Heard you made the Kingsley heir lose his temper?"

"Oh, that's not all!" Victoria cut in. "Ryan Holt's scandal was Evelyn's doing too."

"Orange Media took a massive hit."

"They had to halt printing last-minute."

"All thanks to Evelyn!"

"Here, a toast to you!"

Julian, seated in the corner, suddenly spoke. "She doesn't drink."

The room chilled momentarily—then erupted again.

"Evelyn, ever considered joining social affairs?"

"Nonsense! She's entertainment through and through!"

"Sports has more eye candy—think about it!"

"You're all tactless. Let's discuss this privately..."

Amid the clamor, Evelyn was placed on a pedestal.

Even colleagues who'd mocked her earlier came forward with apologies.

"Evelyn, I was blind. Forgive me."

"I'm genuinely impressed now."

"How did you dare refuse Ryan's interview?"

"She must've had a plan all along..."

Julian's frown deepened.

As he rose to intervene, the room abruptly silenced.

Phones chimed in unison.

A notification flashed across every screen:

【Horizon reporter Evelyn Sinclair accused of seducing Ryan Holt and fabricating scandal! Legal notice issued by Holt's studio...】

The luxurious suite plunged into icy stillness.

"My apologies, Lord Alex!"

The club manager bowed profusely, a white-clad girl kneeling behind him—her dress stained with liquor.

Alexander Kingsley sat coldly on the sofa.

This was a business dinner.

He'd noticed a white-clad figure upon entering.

After a second glance, the girl approached with a drink.

Alexander had thrown the contents in her face.

"Lord Alex, perhaps another venue?" The mediator offered nervously.

Nathan Carter received a call. "Lord Alex, we have a lead on the brooch."

"Speak."

"Vincent Sullivan may have owned a similar piece."

Alexander nodded. "Schedule for the day after."

"Lord Alex—" The investor tried to interject.

"Tomorrow." Alexander stood, leaving.

Nathan knew their return would be delayed.

For years, Alexander had operated like a relentless machine.

Only Royal Gardens offered brief respite.

"Julian Ashford!"

Melissa chased him down the hallway. "You're really surrendering all our resources? I'll tell your parents!"

Julian halted. "Melissa, I'm editor-in-chief now."

"Why?" she demanded, voice shaking. "Firing Evelyn would solve everything! Just like with Alexander last time!"
###Chapter 44: The Mole Exposed, She Held the Trump Card

The phone screen lit up with a push notification.

Julian Ashford immediately dispatched someone to contact Orange Media.

Their attitude was brazen, claiming to possess irrefutable evidence of Evelyn Sinclair seducing Ryan Holt.

For now, the news was only circulating in small circles.

If Horizon Media ignored it, the scandal would trend by morning.

Ryan would inevitably flip the narrative, dragging both Horizon and Evelyn into a PR nightmare...

"Name your price," Julian replied with just two words.

Orange Media refused monetary compensation.

Their representative sent a mocking voice message: "Mr. Ashford, your pockets run deep, but Orange isn't short on cash. Here’s a list of demands. Take it or leave it."

The demands soon landed in the hands of every department head.

Melissa Lee slammed the table. "We pulled thirty all-nighters compiling that financial report, and they want it handed over?"

The sports editor scoffed. "Our exclusive with Williams was built on five years of rapport. They think they deserve it?"

The social affairs chief shook the paper in fury. "This is outrageous. Our reporter risked his life for that exposé, and now they want co-byline credit?"

Last month, their undercover journalist had been discovered infiltrating a black-market ring. He died clutching the evidence after a staged car crash.

Horizon had defied threats to publish, sparking public outrage.

Now Orange wanted to claim the fruits of their sacrifice?

This wasn’t about credit—it was a slap to Horizon’s face.

Yet Julian, uncharacteristically, didn’t outright refuse. "Tell them I need time to consider."

He stepped out of the private room, Melissa hot on his heels.

The door cracked open behind them—just wide enough for prying ears.

In their line of work, curiosity was second nature.

The gap widened as Melissa’s accusation rang out: "Julian, Horizon isn’t your personal playground! Dote on Evelyn all you want, but don’t bankrupt the company for her!"

"Proof?" His voice was ice.

"How did she win the thesis award? How did she land the job straight out of school? And now we’re cleaning up her mess!"

Melissa had snapped.

The golden girl who’d once been Julian’s childhood companion—his prom date, his butterfly-chasing partner—now stood humiliated.

Who was Evelyn Sinclair to steal her place?

"She’s the one you mentioned at the victory party, isn’t she?" Tears streaked Melissa’s face.

Julian frowned. "You need a leave of absence."

She wiped her cheeks violently.

Professional pride forced her voice steady. "Fine. Let’s talk business. Orange has evidence of Evelyn seducing Ryan Holt and wants our core assets in exchange. Firing her solves everything. Which will you choose?"

She pointed to the ajar door. "Every department head is listening. Tell them your decision!"

Julian studied the woman unraveling before him. "Why assume Orange’s evidence is real?"

Melissa froze.

"Why assume Evelyn would debase herself for someone like Ryan Holt?" His laugh was cold.

Of all people, she should know—Evelyn never would.

That third-rate celebrity wasn’t worth the dirt beneath her shoes.

"You’re defending her?" Jealousy seethed in Melissa’s whisper. "We haven’t even seen the proof!"

"Exactly. Yet you’re convinced it’s genuine?" His gaze sharpened. "Unless... you already know something?"

A chill crawled down her spine.

She’d forgotten Julian was Imperial Media’s top debater—his logic far outmatched hers.

"I—I overreacted," she backpedaled. "But Orange wouldn’t bluff. They’d risk a defamation suit!"

A soft voice cut through from the doorway:

"Because they think... I’ve run out of moves."

Evelyn leaned against the frame, smiling.

That smile turned Melissa’s blood to ice.

"Don’t worry, Melissa. If I truly seduced Ryan, I’ll resign immediately." She turned to Julian. "Don’t concede. I’ll handle this myself. Enjoy the rest of your evening."

Ryan’s counterattack hadn’t caught her off guard.

Alexander Kingsley was right—traps lurked everywhere. Only clarity could shield her.

He’d failed her in love but taught her survival.

"You have more leverage?" Melissa couldn’t resist asking.

Evelyn glanced back, her smile serene. "No. But truth prevails. That’s what we journalists believe in."

As she left, Julian spoke words that made Melissa’s skin crawl:

"There’s a mole in this room tonight."
###Chapter 45: The Storm Approaches

Ethan Miller stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows in Alexander Kingsley's office, his fingers absently tracing the edge of his suit sleeve.

His gaze lingered on the shattered phone lying on the floor. Beneath the cracked screen, the name "Evelyn Sinclair" glared back at him.

The same intel had earned Nathan Carter praise, yet when he delivered it, Lord Alex's fury erupted. This was the second phone destroyed this week.

"Lord Alex," Nathan interjected smoothly, "Orange Media's attack seems calculated. The Wu family might be pulling strings behind this."

Alexander's long fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, his stormy eyes fixed on the computer screen.

Displayed was Orange Media's latest explosive article: [EXCLUSIVE: Horizon Reporter Evelyn Sinclair's Seduction of Ryan Holt Exposed].

A blurred surveillance still accompanied the piece—a woman's indistinct figure captured from behind.

"Investigate," Alexander's voice cut like ice. "I want the puppet master's name."

Nathan responded immediately while Ethan hesitated.

He couldn't shake the thought—why did every piece of news about Miss Sinclair send Lord Alex into a rage?

——

Orange Media's exposé detonated across the internet like a bomb.

First came an audio clip released by Ryan Holt's team, allegedly documenting Evelyn's repeated invitations.

Then a hotel housekeeper's testimony claiming Evelyn bribed her way into Ryan's room.

The fatal blow? A drug-laced adhesive film discovered in the ventilation system, confirmed by lab reports.

"Impossible!" Horizon's legal director slammed the table. "Reporter Sinclair was clearly—"

"Clearly what?" Melissa Lee interrupted sharply. "Where's your proof?"

The legal director faltered. Security footage from that day was mysteriously corrupted, and Evelyn had indeed visited that hotel.

——

The air in Victoria Henn's office hung thick with tension.

"Evelyn Sinclair, do you see what they're saying about you?" She shoved a tablet forward.

The screen displayed a fan-created hashtag—#EvelynSinclairDie—with over a million engagements.

[Whore deserves to rot!]
[Horizon protects criminals!]
[Dox this bitch now!]

Evelyn skimmed the vitriol without flinching.

"Director Henn," her voice remained soft, "these constitute illegal threats."

"Illegal?" Victoria sneered. "By the time courts act, your reputation will be garbage!"

Evelyn lifted her gaze, steel flashing in her eyes. "Then what do you suggest I do?"

Victoria stiffened. She'd expected panic, not this unsettling composure.

"At least... issue a statement!"

"Stating what?" Evelyn countered. "That I drugged Ryan Holt?"

Victoria's face purpled with rage. This seemingly fragile girl had spines of tempered steel.

——

Melissa's office door burst open.

"Director Lee!" Victoria gasped, bloodless. "Evelyn—she—"

"What now?" Melissa snapped.

"She submitted evidence to the police! Claims it proves Ryan lied!"

Melissa's pen clattered onto the desk.

"What evidence?"

"I—I don't know..." Victoria trembled. "But Ryan just got summoned for questioning!"

Melissa shot up, her chair screeching across the floor.

She grabbed her phone with shaking hands and dialed. "Young Master Wu... we have a problem."
###Chapter 46: The Scumbag Exposed, No Mercy in Retaliation

Beads of sweat dotted Ethan Miller's forehead inside the private jet cabin.

"Lord Alex," his voice tightened, "we've confirmed Miss Sinclair did visit the hotel, but the timeline doesn't add up."

Alexander Kingsley's fingers tapped rhythmically on the armrest, his gaze darkening.

"Go on."

Ethan swallowed hard. "The housekeeper said it was the day after Miss Sinclair was hospitalized. Ryan Holt had already checked out by then."

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly as he dialed Eleanor Kingsley.

"Evelyn?" Eleanor chuckled lightly. "Oh, I took her there that day. Why?"

"Those online rumors—"

"Please," she cut him off. "Keyboard warriors with nothing better to do. My Evelyn is worth hundreds of millions. Why would she chase some B-list celebrity?"

A vein throbbed at Alexander's temple.

He hung up, his expression darker than before.

This woman could've cleared her name anytime. Instead, she’s hiding at Horizon Media, playing dead.

"Nathan," he ordered coldly. "Dig into Orange Media's schemes."

By the time the jet landed, Nathan had an update.

"Lord Alex, it's handled."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Julian Ashford stepped in?"

"No," Nathan shook his head. "A paparazzo leaked video evidence."

Victoria Henn stared at her computer screen, fingers trembling.

"This can't be..." she muttered. "How did they get this footage?"

The video showed Ryan Holt instructing his assistant: "Make sure you remove the pills. No evidence left behind."

The scene cut to Ryan rubbing his forehead, complaining, "Didn't even get the reporter, almost ruined my face."

His assistant giggled. "Couldn't sleep with her, so you're coming to me?"

"Don't act innocent," Ryan sneered. "It's not your first time."

"But what if I get pregnant..."

"Take maternity leave then," he shrugged. "Let your boyfriend deal with it."

Melissa Lee paled.

The video was the final nail in Ryan's coffin—
He spiked drinks.
He slept with fans.
He forced abortions on his staff.

In the executive meeting room, Julian slammed his phone onto the table.

"Footage from five days ago," his voice cut like ice. "And not a single person in Entertainment bothered to verify?"

Victoria shrank in her seat, avoiding his gaze.

"Monthly bonuses revoked." Julian's tone was arctic. "You've disgraced Horizon."

The Entertainment Department sat in stunned silence.

Victoria's legs wobbled as she returned to her desk.

Her eyes flicked toward Evelyn Sinclair, who calmly organized files as if untouched by the storm.

Ryan Holt was finished.

Endorsements dropped. Accounts banned. Even his fan club disbanded.

The internet erupted: "Still know a Ryan Holt fan? Run!"

Others wondered: What did that reporter look like, to haunt a superstar's thoughts?

Outside Horizon Tower, paparazzi swarmed with cameras ready.

In the underground garage, Evelyn strode toward Julian's private elevator.

"Here." Julian handed her an envelope.

She opened it—and froze.

"This is..."
###Chapter 47: The Finality of a Snowy Night

The envelope felt heavy in Evelyn's hands. She opened it to find a neat stack of cash inside.

She turned to Julian in the driver's seat.

"Your monthly bonus," he said calmly, steering with one hand.

"But the department just had bonuses revoked." She distinctly remembered him signing the penalty notice himself.

"This is yours." Julian glanced at her, warmth softening his features. "I can't let you lose money chasing exclusives. At least... the five hundred you gave the janitor..."

Evelyn immediately pulled out five bills and pushed the rest back.

"This is enough."

She knew this money came from Julian's pocket, not Horizon Media.

The envelope landed back on her lap.

"There's a form to sign inside," Julian said, eyes on the road. "Finance needs it for records."

Evelyn reopened the envelope and found the bonus receipt.

"Sour Lemon already paid well," she murmured.

The unassuming studio had surprised her with their generous offer.

"You earned it." Julian chuckled. "The only thing Horizon provided was a camera."

Getting Orange Media to publicly apologize had been unthinkable before.

When Evelyn hid the camera in the couch seam, she never expected it to capture anything useful.

But caution was necessary—especially after learning about Ryan Holt's alliance with Isabella.

In her haste after the interview, she'd almost forgotten the device. Later, under the guise of shopping with Mrs. Kingsley, she retrieved it from the janitor for five hundred.

So what if the janitor's testimony had inconsistencies?

Once Ryan's lies were exposed, who would care about minor details?

Evelyn understood exactly what the audience wanted—they only craved the truth that fit their narrative.

Whether Horizon and Orange Media suspected her involvement no longer mattered.

Ryan's career was over. The media had already moved on to the next scandal.

"Know who orchestrated this?" Julian asked suddenly.

Evelyn nodded.

That explained why he'd remained hands-off. These minor waves were just warm-up exercises for her.

"Ryan would never implicate Isabella, even facing prison," Julian added.

"Of course." Evelyn watched the glittering cityscape pass by. "I never planned to use him against her."

She'd long stopped caring whether Alexander believed her.

Julian suddenly reached over to brush a stray hair from her face.

"Hmm?" She turned.

"Just a loose strand." He withdrew his hand quickly, fingertips still tingling from the contact.

To shift focus, he asked, "Do you know the West family backs Orange Media?"

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "The Wests still have survivors?"

Her hatred for that family needed no disguise.

"Evelyn." Julian's voice tightened. "You're safer with the Sinclairs. If William West finds an opening..."

"Let him try." Her smile was razor-sharp. "We'll see who destroys whom this time."

The Wests had shattered her family. The Sinclairs had nearly exterminated them in return. This feud now spanned generations.

"If you're ever in danger," Julian said hoarsely, "remember I'm here."

"Of course." She laughed lightly. "You saved me once, Julian. Would you mind doing it again?"

"Preferably not." His response was barely audible.

That snowy night seven years ago, when he'd found Evelyn barely conscious, she'd been clutching a hard drive.

"Julian...give this to Alexander..."

It was the first time she'd called him that since they were ten.

But Julian knew better than anyone—his place in her heart had vanished long ago...
###Chapter 48: The Art of Shamelessness

The girl who used to chase after him was gone.

She would always call him "Brother Julian" with stars in her eyes.

He took it for granted, even looked down on it, constantly testing her limits...

He only tolerated her company because of their families' business ties. She wasn't his real sister—why bother?

The funniest part? No matter how cold he was, she'd still greet him sweetly next time, like an annoying piece of gum that wouldn't come off.

Last time, Alexander Kingsley spent an entire afternoon with her, but the moment Julian called, she immediately abandoned Alexander and ran back.

Julian Ashford always thought Evelyn Sinclair was just an insignificant little follower.

Until the day she walked straight into Alexander's arms without looking back...

Evelyn squinted at the imposing mansion before her.

The vermilion gates were tightly shut, the walls loomed high, and even an electrified fence had been installed.

"It's just a weekend retreat. Why the military-grade security?" she muttered.

Three days earlier.

The entertainment department launched a new project interviewing veteran artists.

By tradition, each team was assigned two interviewees.

But Victoria Henn called Evelyn into her office alone.

"Evelyn, your team got Vincent Sullivan. It's a heavy responsibility, so the whole team will support you."

Evelyn frowned. "Why me?"

She hadn't even passed her probation. Such an important interview should go to a senior reporter.

Victoria smiled mysteriously. "I'm being transferred. The new director will be promoted from existing editors, leaving a vacancy..."

It was practically a direct hint.

"You've stood out. I have high hopes for you."

Evelyn sensed a trap. "I haven't even been regularized yet."

"Secure Vincent's interview, and I guarantee you'll get an exceptional promotion," Victoria vowed. "I'll handle HR."

After the assignment was announced, even Martha Nash looked at her differently.

Evelyn whispered, "Editor, is this a trap?"

Martha patted her shoulder. "Not a trap."

Evelyn relaxed slightly.

"It's a volcano crater," Martha added.

Evelyn: "..."

Vincent Sullivan was a national treasure but hadn't given an interview in ten years.

What was Victoria thinking, dumping this hot potato on her?

The entire team's next-month bonus depended on this.

If she failed, forget promotion—she might lose her job entirely.

Could she refuse?

No.

No one else could take this task, and failing consecutive assignments would doom her probation.

Her "achievements" so far were staggering:

Alexander's report cost Horizon Media eight million.

Ryan Holt's interview sparked a media war.

Martha crunched her lollipop. "Others coast through probation, but you choose nightmare mode?"

Evelyn sighed. "Guess it's fate."

"Ask the Crown Prince for help?"

"No!" Evelyn said firmly.

Martha groaned. "Not using connections when you have them is stupid! You think people don't assume you're relying on them anyway?"

Evelyn held her back. "Calm down!"

Martha couldn't calm down.

She liked this girl—smart, capable, seemingly sweet but secretly cunning, with an aunt who could level cities...

But the chaos Evelyn brought was exhausting.

Martha hadn't slept well since she arrived.

"Don't worry, I'll handle Vincent," Evelyn promised.

Martha brightened. "Got another shady trick?"

Evelyn: "..."

She relied on skill, thank you very much!

But now...

Even sunbaking into jerky wouldn't help.

Evelyn shielded her eyes from the sun and sighed.

Vincent was impenetrable.

Three days of dead ends led her here, only to face locked gates.

Why?

She'd tapped every connection, even asked Eleanor Kingsley and Julian, but no answers.

Vincent attended events but refused interviews.

There had to be a key detail she'd missed.

This mansion's location came from Eleanor.

Evelyn said guiltily, "I left without a word and only come back when I need help. Feels pretty shameless..."

Eleanor laughed. "Drop the 'feels.'"

Then she gave the address without hesitation.

"If you're going to be shameless, own it. Be shameless with style, with flair."

Evelyn's eyes stung.

If she ever regained her memories before age ten, she hoped her mother was just like Eleanor.
###Chapter 49: Never Hurt Her Again

The scorching sun baked the asphalt, heat waves distorting the distant scenery.

Evelyn Sinclair narrowed her eyes as a sleek black luxury car approached. Its polished surface gleamed coldly under the sunlight, like a lurking panther.

Her spine stiffened instinctively.

The window rolled down, revealing Alexander Kingsley's sharply defined features. His gaze cut into her like a blade.

"What a coincidence?" Evelyn took half a step back, fingers digging into her palms.

Alexander pushed the car door open, his tall frame casting a shadow over her. The dark gray suit he wore accentuated his pale, icy complexion.

Evelyn turned to leave.

Footsteps closed in behind her. She quickened her pace, only for his hand to clamp around her wrist.

"Running away?" Alexander pressed her against the sunbaked wall, his breath hot against her ear. "Didn’t you come here just to see me?"

She tilted her head up, her gaze clear. "I’m here to interview Vincent Sullivan."

Alexander scoffed. "You can’t even lie properly. The old man never gives interviews."

His thumb traced the delicate curve of her wrist, his voice laced with danger. "The ten-day deadline isn’t up yet. Couldn’t wait to come back?"

"Who else but you would bully me?" Evelyn suddenly smiled, though her eyes remained frozen.

Alexander’s expression darkened. He gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "You call that bullying?"

Flecks of sunlight scattered between them.

Evelyn turned her face away, her voice barely a whisper. "Think whatever you want."

Her indifference ignited his fury. He dragged her toward the car. "Enough games. I have business to attend to."

Just as Evelyn struggled, the vermilion gates of the Sullivan estate creaked open.

The butler emerged, his eyes flickering between them. "Mr. Kingsley, the master is expecting you."

Alexander shoved Evelyn toward Ethan Miller. "Keep an eye on her."

Inside the traditional hall, sandalwood incense curled through the air.

When Evelyn rose to use the restroom, Ethan followed like a guard dog. She glanced back. "Planning to follow me into the ladies' room?"

Ethan flushed and stopped at the corridor’s bend.

...

In the archives, Vincent Sullivan adjusted his reading glasses as he searched. "The butterfly brooch... Found it!"

Alexander took the yellowed catalog, his breath hitching. The brooch in the photo matched the one Evelyn treasured perfectly.

"Will you sell it to me?"

Vincent shook his head. "It was auctioned off a decade ago." He pointed at the record. "Charity auction. Proceeds went to an orphanage."

Alexander studied the date, brow furrowed. The timing was too coincidental.

"Where did you acquire it?"

Vincent’s eyes flickered. "A friend transferred it to me." He lowered his voice. "This wouldn’t happen to belong to your family, would it?"

Without missing a beat, Alexander fabricated a story. "It’s a family heirloom of a friend. His mother was wearing it when she died..."

Vincent took the bait, vowing to help trace its origins.

When they returned to the courtyard, Ethan was pacing in a sweat.

"Where is she?" Alexander’s voice turned glacial.

Ethan paled. "M-Miss Sinclair... She’s gone."

At the end of the corridor, Evelyn slipped behind an ornate wooden door. She pulled out her phone and dialed swiftly.

"Grandfather Sullivan, it’s Evelyn. About the butterfly brooch—I have crucial information..."
###Chapter 50: An Offer You Can't Refuse

"Gone?" Vincent Sullivan shot up from his chair, rattling the teacup on the table. "Who is this Miss Sinclair?"

His sharp gaze darted between Alexander Kingsley and Ethan Miller, fingers tightening around the armrest.

Ethan wiped his damp forehead. "She—she just stepped into the restroom. When I turned around, she vanished..."

"You lost track of a young woman?" Vincent roared. "Steward! Fetch the steward now!"

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly. "No need for alarm, Mr. Sullivan. She might be exploring the grounds."

Despite his calm tone, his eyes turned glacial. Ethan shivered under that piercing stare.

"This is my estate!" Vincent slammed the table. "Mr. Kingsley, stay seated!"

The steward arrived in haste. "Ah, the journalist?"

"Journalist?" Vincent's expression darkened.

The steward hurried to explain. "The reporter who's been requesting an interview. She showed up uninvited today. I meant to send her away, but Lord Alex..."

Vincent whirled toward Alexander, fury blazing in his eyes. "A clever diversion, Mr. Kingsley."

Alexander stiffened.

Evelyn Sinclair came here for an interview?

"I'll find her." He rose to leave.

"Halt!" Vincent commanded. "Escort our guest out!"

Alexander paused mid-step, then turned and settled back into the antique chair.

"I brought her here." His voice carried quiet intensity. "I'm not leaving without her."

The mansion plunged into eerie silence.

......

Half an hour later, Vincent returned grim-faced.

"Your friend has left."

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Confirmed?"

"Young woman in red culottes, correct?" Vincent stated firmly. "The staff saw her depart."

"Security footage?"

"Malfunctioning." Vincent waved dismissively. "I detest surveillance gadgets."

Alexander's gaze flicked to the electrified perimeter fence before he stood to take his leave.

......

The Rolls-Royce idled by the tree-lined path.

"Keep watch," Alexander ordered, eyes closed.

Ethan blinked. "For what?"

"Until she emerges." Alexander's voice could freeze hell itself.

......

"He's gone."

Vincent sighed outside the courtyard gate.

The wooden door creaked open. Evelyn stepped out.

"My thanks, Mr. Sullivan."

"Enough pleasantries." He gestured wearily. "Ask your questions."

Evelyn hadn't expected such cooperation.

Their conversation flowed from tea ceremonies to rare artifacts, lasting until sunset painted the sky.

"Return another day." Vincent surprised her with an invitation. "I've more treasures to share."

......

When the side gate finally opened at dusk, Ethan nearly jumped.

"Miss Sinclair!"

The Rolls-Royce glided forward, blocking Evelyn's path.

The window lowered, revealing Alexander's elegant fingers tapping the doorframe.

His lazy drawl contrasted with the fire in his gaze.

"How will you thank me?"
###Chapter 51: You Have No Idea How Much He's Sacrificed for You

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes.

"Thank you?"

"Do you think you could've stepped into the Sullivan residence without my permission?" Alexander finally looked up, dark currents swirling in his gaze. "How was the interview, Miss Sinclair?"

He emphasized the last three words like a predator baring its fangs.

Evelyn's lashes trembled.

"You misunderstand, Mr. Kingsley." Her expression remained composed. "Mr. Sullivan never grants interviews. I came here to..."

A sly smile curved her lips. "...play hard to get."

Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

Her sharp tongue had certainly improved.

"Evelyn," his voice dropped dangerously low. "Don't test my patience."

She knew exactly what happened to those who crossed him.

Suddenly, Evelyn beamed. "How about... I give you half my salary this month?"

"Cough—"

Ethan nearly choked in the front seat.

He turned hesitantly, surprised to see Alexander's calm expression.

"Deal." The man pulled out his phone and opened his QR code. "Add me first."

Evelyn froze.

She'd blocked all his contacts when she left Royal Gardens.

Now he wanted to reconnect?

Absolutely not!

When she didn't move, Alexander's tone grew even gentler. "Or just give me your number?"

Her jaw clenched.

He still had her number saved.

This was clearly a trap to make her admit she'd blocked him.

"I..." She grasped at straws. "I'll pay you in cash."

"Add me first." Alexander pressed relentlessly. "In case you try to cheat me."

"I..."

"Or," his gaze turned arctic, "were you planning to renege all along?"

Their standoff was interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Sullivan butler.

"Miss Sinclair, the master asked me to escort you home."

Evelyn seized the lifeline, quickly stepping behind the butler.

The action ignited Alexander's fury.

His eyes darkened like storm clouds, the air around him turning oppressive.

"She's riding with me." Alexander yanked the car door open.

The butler remained unflappable. "The master prepared documents for Miss Sinclair to review during the ride."

Evelyn seized the chance to bow. "Please thank Mr. Sullivan for me."

Without a backward glance, she climbed into the Sullivan family car.

In the rearview mirror, Alexander's figure grew smaller until it vanished into the night.

......

The butler remained silent until they reached her apartment complex. "The master said you may take the documents home."

Evelyn thanked him and worked through the night to finish her article.

At dawn, her doorbell rang.

The security monitor showed Ethan fidgeting outside.

"Yes?" she asked warily.

"Miss Sinclair!" He lowered his voice. "I came secretly."

Evelyn opened the door cautiously.

Ethan's eyes were red-rimmed. "Lord Alex waited for you all day. He postponed important meetings and is still working now."

"And?" She arched a brow.

"Please come back!" His voice cracked. "He hasn't slept properly since you left. Last time he was hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer—"

"Stop." Evelyn massaged her temples. "He's a grown man."

"But I'm his personal assistant!" Ethan said indignantly.

She moved to shut the door.

"Are you still upset about Isabella?" He braced against the door. "Nothing happened between them!"

"Noted." Her face remained blank.

Ethan suddenly raised his voice. "Do you have any idea what Lord Alex has done for you?"
###Chapter 52: Her Unhealed Wounds

Evelyn didn't want to listen.

But Ethan's booming voice penetrated the door.

"Miss Sinclair, do you really think you could've handled Ryan Holt alone? Without Lord Alex pulling strings behind the scenes, those vultures would've devoured you alive!"

Her fingers twitched.

"Explain."

Ethan spilled everything in one breath.

"Lord Alex's team dug up all of Ryan's dirty secrets! The studios wanted to protect him until Lord Alex personally intervened! Every endorsement deal? Canceled after his calls!"

"Even Isabella Winslow—Lord Alex had no proof she was involved, yet he forced her to apologize to you!"

His voice grew louder with each word.

"After everything he's done for you, you parade around with Julian Ashford like—"

Evelyn's grip on the doorknob turned white-knuckled.

"Enough!"

The Kingsleys' so-called kindness was her deepest wound.

No matter how well they'd treated her, whispers of "repaying debts with favors" had followed her for years.

She didn't understand.

Why did everyone act like she'd won some grand prize?

They called her lucky.

Blessed.

As if losing her parents had been some clever trade for becoming the future Mrs. Kingsley.

But the ones who paid the ultimate price were her family.

The dead carried no weight.

Even the most tragic tales faded with time.

Her parents had been her entire world—to others, just gossip over afternoon tea.

Now even their memory had become a weapon against her.

Isabella did it.

Melissa did it.

Even the Kingsley servants whispered:

[...only got where she is because of that old favor...]

[...orphan girls never amount to anything...]

[...as if she deserves Lord Alex...]

Now that she'd finally left the Kingsley mansion, even Ethan—usually so decent—had come to twist the knife.

"I had more than enough evidence against Ryan," Evelyn said coldly. "If Alexander hadn't interfered, I would've—"

"Been torn apart by online mobs!" Ethan cut in. "Lord Alex stationed security around your apartment! If not for—"

"Tell him to save his efforts."

Her voice held terrifying calm.

"This is a lawful society. The young master needn't trouble himself."

Ethan froze.

That tone...it sounded exactly like Eleanor Kingsley.

Seizing his hesitation, Evelyn slammed the door.

"Miss Sinclair!" Ethan pounded on the wood. "There's a bounty for your photos online! Lord Alex is the only reason—"

She dialed building security.

"There's a disturbance outside my unit. Please handle it."

......

Kingsley Group Headquarters.

Alexander massaged his temples.

"Lord Alex, the chairman advised you to rest." Nathan spoke cautiously.

"The evaluation reports?"

Alexander didn't look up.

Dark circles shadowed his eyes after back-to-back international meetings. Since Evelyn left, he'd practically moved into the office.

"Miss Winslow sent supper..."

"Distribute it to the night shift."

His icy tone made Nathan swallow further words.

Today's mood had been lethal—one executive misquoted a figure during the meeting and left in tears.

......

In the waiting lounge,

Isabella's red-rimmed eyes lifted hopefully.

"He..."

"Miss Winslow, please go home."

Nathan's face remained impassive.

......

Midnight silence swallowed the office whole.

Alexander stared at his monitor, finger hovering over the mouse.

One last task.

Complete it, and there'd be nothing left to do.

Return to Royal Gardens?

That empty bedroom suffocated him.

Go to the Kingsley estate?

At this hour, he'd only wake his grandparents.

His phone screen lit up.

Alexander's pupils contracted.

That familiar number froze his hand mid-air.

Hadn't Evelyn blocked him?

Why...?
###Chapter 53: Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex Is Dying

The phone's ringtone pierced the silence of the room.

Evelyn Sinclair stared at the flashing name on her screen, only answering at the last possible moment.

"Yes?"

Alexander Kingsley's voice came through the receiver like an ice-cold blade.

Evelyn was accustomed to this frostiness. She could practically see his expression—brows slightly furrowed, lips pressed thin, as if answering this call was beneath him.

"Mr. Kingsley." Her voice remained soft yet distant. "Please refrain from interfering with my work in the future. The Sinclairs may have fallen from grace, but we can handle our own affairs."

The sound of a pen tapping against a desk echoed through the line.

"And your assistant, Ethan Miller." Evelyn's light laugh tinkled like wind chimes—pleasant yet sharp. "He keeps insisting how much you've done for me. Let's not repeat that joke."

Her tone turned bitter. "An orphan like me could never deserve Lord Alex's concern."

The call disconnected abruptly.

Alexander stared at the darkened screen, his knuckles whitening.

Three seconds later, he redialed.

"The number you have reached is currently unavailable..."

The robotic voice confirmed he'd been blocked again.

......

"Please, Nathan." Isabella Winslow's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "Just let me see him for a moment—"

A deafening crash erupted from the office.

Before Nathan Carter could react, a second explosion of sound followed.

The shattering of glass was unmistakable.

"Ms. Winslow, you should leave." Nathan barred the doorway, his gaze steely.

Isabella bit her lip in frustration.

Once she became Mrs. Kingsley, this guard dog would be the first to go.

......

Alexander's office resembled a war zone.

The computer monitor lay in spiderweb fractures, documents scattered everywhere. The floor-to-ceiling window had vanished entirely, allowing the night wind to howl through the gaping hole.

He stood motionless amidst the wreckage, his breathing even.

"Clean this up."

Nathan watched his employer stride away—suit immaculate, steps measured—as if the violent outburst had never occurred.

......

Ethan Miller crouched on the sidewalk like a discarded stray.

The black Maybach pulled up before him.

As the window lowered, Alexander's gaze made his blood run cold.

"You went to see her?"

The three words hit Ethan like blunt force trauma.

"Get in."

Alexander's calm tone was more terrifying than any shout. "It's over between us."

Ethan opened his mouth, but no sound emerged.

He'd never imagined Evelyn would actually leave. For years, she'd been Alexander's shadow—inescapable, indelible.

"Did you hear me?!"

Alexander suddenly lunged, gripping Ethan's shoulder with bruising force.

Blinding headlights split the darkness.

"Alex—"

The world spun violently.

Ethan's last conscious thought was the screech of twisting metal.

......

At six in the morning, the phone's shrill ring shattered the silence.

Evelyn awoke drenched in cold sweat.

"Miss Sinclair!" Ethan's sobbing voice crackled through the receiver. "Lord Alex... he's dying... He keeps calling your name..."

Her fingers clenched the bedsheet unconsciously.

"Late-night accident... truck driver fell asleep at the wheel..." Ethan babbled hysterically. "The front's completely crushed... I'm fine... Why wasn't it me..."

Evelyn's throat constricted.

"If you don't come, I'll have Sophie thrown out of the hospital!" Ethan suddenly snarled.

"Shut up!"

She slammed down the phone, grabbing her coat as she bolted from the apartment.

In the hospital corridor, she collided with Eleanor Kingsley.

The woman's ashen face made Evelyn's legs buckle.

Mr. Kingsley steadied his swaying wife, his gaze meeting Evelyn's with unreadable complexity.

The ICU lights burned painfully bright.
###Chapter 54: Lord Alex, This World Doesn't Deserve You!

"Evelyn!"

Eleanor Kingsley rushed forward and grabbed Evelyn Sinclair's wrist.

Evelyn's palms were clammy with cold sweat. "Where's Alexander? How bad are his injuries?"

"He's fine, he's fine," Eleanor reassured her, though her fingers trembled uncontrollably. "It just looks worse than it is..."

"Ethan said he was critical..." Evelyn's voice shook.

"That boy was dazed from the crash!" Eleanor suddenly raised her voice. "The doctor just said his condition is stable!"

Hurried footsteps echoed from the end of the hallway.

Ethan Miller charged forward with red-rimmed eyes, skidding to a stop when he saw Evelyn.

"Happy now, Miss Sinclair?" He gritted his teeth. "Lord Alex wouldn't be here if he hadn't been chasing your car!"

"Nonsense!" Mr. Kingsley snapped. "The surveillance shows the truck was at fault!"

Eleanor pulled Evelyn toward the hospital room. "Ignore him. Let's go see Alex."

The door suddenly swung open.

The attending physician removed his mask. "The patient is awake, but..." He hesitated, glancing at Evelyn. "I'd advise against agitating him right now."

Evelyn froze mid-step.

"I'll check on him." Mr. Kingsley strode into the room.

Less than three minutes later, he emerged grim-faced and caught Eleanor before she could enter.

"Don't go in," he muttered. "The kid is... crying."

Eleanor's eyes widened.

"He's hugging a pillow and calling for Evelyn," Mr. Kingsley said awkwardly. "And swearing he'll haunt Vincent Sullivan even as a ghost..."

Evelyn took a half-step back.

"I should check on Sophie." She turned to leave.

Eleanor hurried after her. "Evelyn, it's just the anesthesia wearing off—"

A loud thud came from around the corridor corner.

Ethan had collapsed to his knees, sobbing into his phone. "Lord Alex! Miss Sinclair really left!"

A deafening crash came from the hospital room.

"Code blue!" The doctor paled. "Patient tore out his IV stand!"

As Mr. Kingsley burst inside, he heard his son roar: "Bring Vincent Sullivan to me—now!"

Evelyn stood by the elevator, quietly pressing the down button.

Her phone vibrated.

"Mr. Sullivan? Yes, I've already emailed you the draft..."

She didn't notice Eleanor recording the entire scene from the emergency stairwell.

"Darling," Eleanor sighed into the video. "Do you think our son can still be saved?"

Mr. Kingsley watched Alexander frantically pressing the call button inside the room and shook his head gravely.

"What if..." Eleanor's eyes suddenly lit up. "We show him Sophie's paternity test results?"

"No!" Mr. Kingsley cut her off. "In his current state, he'd jump out the window the second he saw it!"

A shrill alarm blared from the nurses' station.

"Patient in 302 pulled out his IV!" a nurse cried. "Says he's going to kill some Vincent Sullivan!"

The elevator doors slid shut behind Evelyn.

The last thing she saw was Ethan slumped on the floor, wailing into his phone: "Lord Alex... why must you torture yourself like this..."

As the elevator descended, Evelyn received Eleanor's video.

The footage showed Alexander punching a pillow against the wall, treating it like Vincent.

The caption read:
[Evelyn, I think he's truly lost his mind]
###Chapter 55: He Said He Can't Live Without Her

Evelyn Sinclair had just taken a step forward.

Sudden hurried footsteps sounded behind her.

"Miss Sinclair! Lord Alex—"

Ethan Miller's words were cut off as a long, strong hand clamped over his mouth.

Evelyn turned.

Mr. Kingsley had Ethan in a chokehold, one arm locked around his throat while the other hand muffled his protests, pinning him against the wall.

Evelyn froze.

Eleanor Kingsley smoothly stepped between them, waving Evelyn off. "Go ahead. I'll inform you about Grandfather's birthday celebration."

Evelyn glanced at the struggling Ethan before turning away without another word.

Once Evelyn was out of earshot, Eleanor gave her husband a look.

Mr. Kingsley released Ethan.

To their surprise, Ethan grabbed Mr. Kingsley's hand, tears and snot streaming down his face. "Chairman Kingsley, how could you let Miss Sinclair leave? Lord Alex said he won't live without her—"

"Then let him die!" Mr. Kingsley shook Ethan off in disgust. "A grown man threatening to kill himself over a woman? Pathetic!"

After cursing his son, he immediately turned to Eleanor with fawning devotion. "Of course, I'm nothing like that useless boy. Before my wife, I am nothing..."

Evelyn returned to Horizon Media with Vincent Sullivan's exclusive interview.

The entire news department erupted.

Company group chats exploded instantly.

This entertainment reporter, who had been employed for less than a month, had already achieved three miracles:

First, her exclusive scoop about Alexander Kingsley's scandal with Isabella Winslow resulted in an eight-million lawsuit.

Then, during an interview with Ryan Holt, she turned the tables on his slander and caused the superstar's career to collapse overnight.

And now—she'd secured an interview with Vincent Sullivan!

The legendary artist who hadn't given an interview in ten years!

[The Crown Prince must've pulled strings. That's some serious favoritism.]

Private chats buzzed with speculation.

[Didn't you see how Melissa got taken down last time?]

[What happened to Melissa?]

[The Crown Prince nearly fired her over Evelyn. Melissa was bawling, but he didn't even blink.]

[I hate nepotism, but damn, she's gorgeous.]

[Pretty face, empty head.]

[I like pretty girls!]

[Would you take her if you could?]

[Hell yes! If the Crown Prince wants her, why wouldn't I?]

[Could you handle Alexander Kingsley's eight-million lawsuit? Survive a Ryan Holt-level scandal? Get Vincent Sullivan to talk?]

[Now that's what I call real connections...]

The private chatter was vicious.

In the official company group, the tone shifted dramatically.

[Junior is amazing!]

[No one can compete with Evelyn!]

[Evelyn is the GOAT!]

[Teach us your ways!]

Evelyn: "..."

A private message from Martha Nash popped up.

Martha: [Spill. Did the Crown Prince help?]

Evelyn: [No.]

She couldn't be bothered to elaborate.

If even Martha was asking, she could imagine what everyone else thought.

But Evelyn didn't care.

Let them gossip in private. No one dared say anything to her face.

Even if some idiot did speak up, they'd only embarrass themselves.

All she cared about was completing assignments, earning bonuses, and securing her permanent position.

As for the jealousy and backhanded comments...

Consider it stress relief for her coworkers. Bottling things up caused health problems.

During lunch, colleagues swarmed her for details.

"How did you pull it off?"

"Did Vincent Sullivan give you a hard time?"

"Did you blackmail him or something?"

Evelyn smiled gently. "Nothing special. Just three days of persistence. Got lucky, I guess."

They dispersed in disappointment, returning to their private chats to whisper like mice who'd failed to steal cheese.

"Nice work." Martha patted Evelyn's shoulder. "Your permanent position is secured."

Evelyn gave a modest smile, neither arrogant nor obsequious.

Martha nodded inwardly.

This girl was far more complex than she appeared.

Everyone was blinded by her beauty, missing the steel and cunning beneath.

Hospital.

Alexander Kingsley slowly opened his eyes.

Harsh white light made his vision swim.

His last memory was gripping Ethan's shoulders...

Then blinding headlights, the world spinning.

A car accident?

A hand waved before his face. "Awake?"

His mother's voice.

Alexander tried to move. Pain shot through his body like shattered glass. His neck was stiff, immobile.

Gritting his teeth, he turned his head to see Eleanor watching him with an odd expression.

"Who am I?" She leaned in, eyes glinting strangely.

"Mom?" Alexander felt unnerved by her stare.

Her expression suggested he'd drunk poison instead of medicine.

Hearing his answer, Eleanor immediately lost interest. "You woke up too fast."

Alexander: "?"

"How long was I out?"

"Not long." Eleanor shrugged. "Seven or eight hours since last night."

Alexander relaxed.

The pain told him his injuries weren't severe—probably just soft tissue damage.

"Mom, press the call button for me."

With no one else in the room, he had to ask his mother.

Eleanor rolled her eyes. "No hands?"

Alexander: "..."

Was he adopted?

Shouldn't accident victims be pampered? Why was his mother looking at him like he was a nuisance?

Noticing his sulk, Eleanor waved her phone. "It's not that I don't care. You've been thrashing around so violently these past two days it took multiple people to restrain you. I refuse to believe you can't press a button now."

Alexander froze.

"You said I was only out for a few hours—"

"Correct." Eleanor drawled. "This time it was seven or eight hours. Before that, you were so agitated we needed sedatives. The doctors were ready to quit."

Alexander: "..."

"Oh!" Eleanor suddenly brightened, holding up her phone. "I recorded everything. Want to watch?"
###Chapter 56: Was He Actually Waiting for Her?

Alexander Kingsley's fingers tapped lightly against the hospital bed railing.

Something felt off.

Eleanor Kingsley's smile today was too bright, her eyes gleaming with mischief. Knowing his mother, this couldn't mean anything good.

"Send me the videos," he demanded.

"Oh dear, they're too large to transfer." Eleanor fiddled with her phone. "Each of your episodes lasts hours. My storage is almost full. Just watch them here."

......

Ten minutes later.

Alexander's face turned ashen.

"Finished already?" Eleanor's smile turned knowing. "Hey! What are you—don't delete them! Do you know how hard I worked filming these? You ungrateful—"

Alexander had already wiped every video clean, not even sparing the recycle bin.

Did his mother have some bizarre fetish?

Most mothers would nurse their son after a car accident. Not her—she'd spent two days filming instead.

"Who else has seen these?" Alexander tossed the phone back, eyes sharp. "Who knows?"

"Oh, plenty." Eleanor smoothed her hair. "Doctors, nurses, the staff, your assistant... Oh heavens! What's wrong?"

Alexander suddenly doubled over, breath ragged. Darkness clouded his vision as blood spilled from his lips.

Eleanor's scream pierced the ward. "Doctor! Get a doctor!"

Despite stable post-accident recovery, Alexander ended up in emergency care after regaining consciousness.

The chief physician admonished gravely: "Mr. Kingsley needs complete rest. Emotional distress severely hinders recovery. Combined with his irregular meals and preexisting gastric condition, this hematemesis was life-threatening..."

Eleanor finally panicked.

When Alexander was wheeled out, red-eyed Eleanor dialed Evelyn Sinclair's number.

"Evelyn, please come see him... He's my only son. I may complain about him, but if anything happens..."

Evelyn paused mid-sentence while editing an interview draft.

"Don't worry, Aunt Eleanor. I'm on my way."

She rushed to ask Martha Nash for leave, only to be intercepted by Victoria Henn.

"Evelyn Sinclair! My office. Now."

"I have an emergency—"

"What emergency outweighs work?" Victoria frowned. "Inside. Now."

......

Eleanor hung up, torn between hope and guilt.

At the Sinclairs' graves years ago, she'd vowed never to pressure Evelyn.

Yet now...

She was just a selfish mother after all.

"Mother," Alexander rasped upon waking. "You called her?"

Eleanor wiped her eyes. "Be civil when Evelyn arrives—"

"Unnecessary." Alexander turned away. "We're over. I feel nothing for her."

Eleanor sighed inwardly.

Why must he lie?

Anyone could see he was barely functioning without Evelyn.

"I need air." Eleanor stood. "Mind your manners when she comes."

Once alone, Alexander summoned Ethan Miller.

"These past two days..." He hesitated. "Did she visit?"

Ethan's dark-circled eyes blinked. "Miss Sinclair came right after the accident."

Then vanished.

Alexander shut his eyes. "Did she... see me?"

Ethan shook his head. "She left quickly to meet a deadline."

"And you?" Alexander's eyes snapped open, sharp as blades.

Ethan's back chilled. "M-me?"

"Did you enter?"

Ethan gulped. "Madam Eleanor mostly—"

Alexander nodded.

"Nothing leaves this room about what happened here."

Ethan nodded fervently, relieved Evelyn hadn't witnessed Lord Alex's state that day.

His life wouldn't be worth living if she had!

......

Silence reclaimed the ward.

Alexander stared out the window, fingers absently tracing his phone.

An hour passed.

Evelyn never came.

From Horizon Media to the hospital—just thirty minutes by subway.

Alexander tilted his head back, eyes closed.

Memories flooded unbidden.

That summer he broke his leg, Evelyn kept vigil day and night.

Waking in pain, he'd always find her curled at his bedside, tiny fingers clutching his, fast asleep.

From this angle, he'd watch her fluttering lashes, petite nose, rosebud lips.

The slightest movement would rouse her. Half-asleep, she'd murmur: "Doesn't hurt anymore, Alex..."

He'd grit through agony to say: "No. It doesn't."

Just to see her eyes sparkle, hear her soft voice:

"You're so brave, Alex. I'll be brave too..."

"Lord Alex," Ethan whispered through the door. "Miss Sinclair is here. Shall I let her in?"
###Chapter 57: The Severed Kite

The office door closed behind Victoria Henn. Evelyn Sinclair glanced at her watch—forty minutes behind schedule.

Her phone vibrated. A message from Eleanor Kingsley flashed:
"Evelyn, delete after watching. Tell no one."

Inside the elevator, her finger hovered over the video. She hesitated.

Only after exiting the hospital did she finally put on her earbuds.

"Evelyn..."

Alexander Kingsley's hoarse voice shattered her composure. Her grip faltered, nearly dropping the phone.

"Come here..." His words scraped like sandpaper, weak with illness. "I'm not angry anymore... Stop hiding from me."

She flipped the phone face-down against her palm.

"After I die, the Kingsleys will be yours..." His voice cracked. "If you want to be with Julian... then be with him."

A ragged inhale hissed through the earbuds. "Just promise me... Visit my grave once a year. Don't tell me about your life together. Never say you've broken up."

Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

She couldn't look. Couldn't bear seeing his pallor or tear tracks.

Couldn't risk relenting.

Had Eleanor sent this because his condition worsened?

The elevator's chime startled her. She'd missed her floor.

When she finally reached the ward, she froze at the corridor's turn.

"Miss Sinclair?"

Ethan Miller's surprised voice came from behind. Before she could respond, his footsteps hurried away.

Her fingers tightened around her bag strap.

Should she call after him? Or leave?

"Well, if it isn't Miss Sinclair."

Isabella Winslow's voice sliced through the air. She wore a new Chanel ensemble, carrying a thermal flask branded with a Michelin-starred restaurant's logo.

"Here to see Alex?" Her red lips curled. "Didn't I make myself clear last time?"

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Isabella's meticulously styled curls. "Trouble sleeping, Ms. Winslow? Your concealer isn't hiding those dark circles."

Isabella's smile stiffened. "You—"

"Heard Summer Sky has to cover Ryan Holt's breach penalty?" Evelyn's laugh was light. "Will your bonus still cover this month's handbag, Director Winslow?"

Crimson nails dug into Isabella's palm. "Evelyn Sinclair! How dare—"

"Miss Sinclair." Ethan reappeared, wringing his hands. "Lord Alex said... he's too tired for visitors today."

Isabella's laugh rang out. "Hear that? He doesn't want to see you."

Evelyn kept her eyes on Ethan. "I'm here for Mrs. Kingsley."

"She's at the ICU," he admitted awkwardly.

"I see." As Evelyn turned to leave, Isabella blocked her path.

"Know who's been tending to Alex these days?" She hissed. "We're closer than ever. Take the hint."

Evelyn walked away without looking back.

At the corner, her peripheral vision caught Ethan holding the ward door open for Isabella.

An invisible fist squeezed her heart.

[Too exhausted to see anyone.]

Not a courtesy. A dismissal.

And she'd actually hesitated...

The video vanished from her phone with a tap.

Perhaps this was for the best.

Some strings needed severing to move forward.

Inside the ward, Alexander's eyes opened. "Who let her in?"

Isabella froze, thermal flask extended. "Alex, I brought your favorite—"

"Get out."
###Chapter 58: Just Another Fish in Her Pond

Ethan Miller froze.

Had Alexander Kingsley's words just now been meant for someone other than Evelyn Sinclair?

He'd been lying in a hospital bed all day, not even working. How could he possibly be tired?

Isabella Winslow immediately put on her most tender expression. "Alex, I won't disturb your rest—"

"Get out."

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. "Who invited you here?"

Isabella stood rooted to the spot.

Seven years. In all that time, he'd never spoken harshly to her, never looked at her with such undisguised irritation...

"Alex..." Her eyes welled up instantly, voice trembling. "How could you speak to me like this..."

Alexander's face grew stormier, like gathering thunderclouds.

What shattered Isabella most was how he refused to even glance at her, instead snapping at Ethan:

"Ethan, are you brain-dead?"

Ethan jolted into action, practically shoving Isabella toward the door. "Miss Winslow, Lord Alex needs rest. Please come back another time."

Isabella tried to resist.

BANG!

The hospital door slammed shut.

The sound of curtains being drawn followed, blocking even the observation window completely.

Ethan leaned against the door, watching Alexander's fury with a stutter. "M-my lord... they're... they're all gone now..."

Alexander ground his teeth. "All?"

Ethan nodded frantically. "Y-yes, Miss Sinclair and Miss Winslow both left... You... you can rest properly now..."

"Ethan. Miller."

Alexander spat out the name through clenched teeth.

How had he tolerated such an idiot for over twenty years?

......

Evelyn hadn't even reached Sophie's ward when her phone rang.

Julian Ashford.

"I heard you're transferring departments?"

Evelyn answered absently. "Mhm."

"Why didn't you tell me first?" His voice held unusual reproach.

"The paperwork's already signed. It makes no difference which department I'm in." Exhaustion weighed on Evelyn's words.

At the office, she'd been in a hurry to visit Mrs. Kingsley at the hospital.

When Victoria Henn pressured her for an immediate decision, she hadn't hesitated.

"HR needed an answer. I didn't want to delay things." Her voice softened. "Getting early regularization is good."

Silence stretched on the other end.

That silence became a tangible pressure transmitted through the line.

"Julian," Evelyn suddenly felt an inexplicable tightness in her chest, "I'm sorry, don't be angry..."

"I'm not." Julian answered almost too quickly, urgency in his tone. "Evelyn, where are you?"

"The hospital." She answered truthfully.

Julian misunderstood immediately. "Is Sophie hurt?"

"Nothing serious..."

"I'm coming. Wait for me."

......

When Julian arrived, Evelyn sat on a bench in the hospital garden, radiating indescribable weariness.

Sometimes, secondary wounds drained one's spirit more than the initial injury.

"Evelyn, what happened? Is Sophie alright?" Julian's sharp instincts caught the unusual atmosphere.

Evelyn looked up calmly. "Everything's fine. Why did you come?"

Julian exhaled in relief. "I wasn't scolding you. But you secured Vincent Sullivan's exclusive—that alone qualifies you for early regularization. There was no need to transfer."

Some things needed saying face-to-face. He couldn't rest easy otherwise.

He knew certain habits of his were hard to change, but he refused to let them hurt her again.

Evelyn smiled, having regained her composure. "What's wrong with Finance Department?"

Julian hesitated.

"You said yourself before that I should experience other departments when possible." Evelyn met his gaze. "So I took the opportunity when it came."

Victoria had clearly used early regularization as bait to force her transfer.

All that talk about "now or never"...

Their previous promise about promotion after securing Vincent's interview had been empty words after all.

Had today's events not piled up, Evelyn might have deliberated more.

But now, she saw no reason for hesitation.

Would staying in Entertainment Department truly be safer?

She understood Julian's unspoken concerns perfectly.

"Evelyn." Julian called her name.

"Yes?"

"Are you... alright?" He asked cautiously.

Evelyn shook her head. "Perfectly fine. Why do you ask?"

"You're at the hospital..." He wanted to ask more but held back.

"I got regularization and a transfer today." Evelyn stood, rising slightly on her toes. "Let me treat you to celebrate?"

She deftly changed the subject.

Julian played along with a smile. "Sure. What are you buying?"

"My wallet's light right now." Evelyn counted on her fingers. "Only street food stalls, I'm afraid..."

"No problem. Didn't we eat at roadside stands all through university?" Julian agreed readily.

"True. The shops near Imperial Media were all so good." The conversation naturally turned nostalgic, a reminiscent smile appearing on Evelyn's face. "Too bad Kingsbury's so far..."

"No matter. There's a new food court near Ashford University. Shall we try it?"

"Perfect!" The shadows over Evelyn had lifted completely. "But I need to check on Sophie after."

With Mrs. Kingsley currently at Sophie's ward, Evelyn couldn't visit now.

Julian nodded, chatting lightly while subtly positioning himself to block her view in one direction, his eyes flickering toward the garden's depths...

......

Alexander stood there, gaze locked onto their retreating figures.

The aura around him transcended mere darkness.

He'd arrived just one step too late, only to watch her leave willingly with Julian...

In Evelyn Sinclair's pond, he'd never been the only fish.

"Discharge me." He ordered Ethan coldly.

Ethan panicked. "My lord—"

Demanding discharge the same day as surgery? This was suicidal!

Alexander's glacial stare silenced him. "Find a replacement if you refuse."

For all Ethan's years of service—though mediocre in skill, his loyalty had been unquestionable—Alexander had always overlooked minor mistakes.

This marked the first time Alexander explicitly threatened to replace him.

Trembling, Ethan went to process the discharge while secretly messaging Mrs. Kingsley to tattle.

"Madam, Miss Sinclair has no sense of propriety! Lord Alex merely asked her to wait briefly, yet she left with Julian Ashford! His lordship is so enraged he's demanding discharge!"

Mrs. Kingsley...

Ethan's sole virtue might be his inability to lie.

Mrs. Kingsley cursed outright: "Wait briefly? Who's being unreasonable here! Let him discharge himself if he wants! Who does he think he's threatening?"

She was done!

Consider this child a lost cause—let the world burn!

......

"Melissa, Evelyn reports to Finance Department tomorrow." Victoria Henn raised her glass. "Planned her welcome yet?"

"Finance has plenty to keep her busy." Melissa Lee smiled contentedly. "We'll see. I expected Ashford to come demanding explanations—prepared a whole speech for nothing."

"I told you—the Crown Prince's just amusing himself with her. Young girls dream big with pretty faces," Victoria agreed, "but actually marrying into aristocracy? Old money cares about pedigree. Everyone at Horizon knows you're the families' chosen match..."

Victoria had initially wanted no part, but Melissa made an irresistible offer—

Horizon Video needed a deputy head. All Victoria had to do was maneuver Evelyn to Finance Department, and Melissa would recommend her.

Money talks.

So Victoria assigned Evelyn the impossible: securing Vincent Sullivan's interview.

When Evelyn miraculously succeeded, the plan simplified further—

Victoria dangled early regularization to pressure Evelyn into transferring.

They'd analyzed every angle, certain Evelyn would complain to Julian.

Instead, Evelyn signed without argument.

Julian never came demanding answers.

Their scheme had succeeded beyond expectations. After work, they'd met to celebrate.

Near Ashford University, a new barbecue place had opened.

They chose a window seat—perfect for chatting while people-watching.

As Victoria flattered, Melissa smirked smugly... until her expression froze.

She stared through the window, eyes sharp as blades.

Victoria followed her gaze and gasped: "Is that the Crown Prince with—"
###Chapter 59: The Sugar Butterfly That Pierced Her Heart

Neon lights flickered across the food plaza in the night.

Melissa Lee sat by the café's floor-to-ceiling window, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her cup.

Her hand suddenly froze.

Outside the glass, Julian Ashford and Evelyn Sinclair walked side by side.

The man was scrolling through his phone, occasionally showing the screen to the girl beside him. Evelyn shook her head with a soft laugh, taking a bite of the sugar art in her hand.

It was a butterfly, its wings spread as if ready to take flight.

Melissa's nails dug deep into her palms.

She knew better than anyone about Julian's obsession with butterflies. Those precious specimen albums in his study—he wouldn't even let her touch them.

"Julian, can I have one butterfly specimen?" she had once cooed.

"Buy your own," he'd replied without looking up.

Yet now, he'd specially commissioned this enormous sugar butterfly for Evelyn. The golden syrup glistened under the lights, stinging Melissa's eyes.

The pair stopped in front of a barbecue stall.

Melissa saw Julian frown. Evelyn said something, and suddenly he laughed, following her inside.

The glass cup creaked ominously in Melissa's grip.

Julian detested the smell of grease. Every time their department dined out, she made sure to avoid hotpot and barbecue places.

Yet now, he willingly entered a street-side grill.

Soon, Julian emerged alone to pick ingredients. Rolling up his sleeves, he carefully selected items from the freezer, occasionally turning to ask for Evelyn's input.

Melissa finally slumped forward onto the table.

Across from her, Victoria Henn didn't dare breathe.

"Not a word about what you saw today," Melissa said as she lifted her head. Her makeup remained flawless, but her eyes gleamed with venom.

......

In the Finance Department's break room, a group of female employees huddled together.

"Did you hear? Evelyn Sinclair is being transferred to our department."

"That performance harvester from Entertainment? Great, she'll steal all our resources."

"Just riding on her looks, isn't she? Alexander Kingsley, Ryan Holt, Vincent Sullivan—which exclusive interview didn't she land by batting her eyelashes?"

"Let's see how Melissa deals with her..."

......

An HR specialist escorted Evelyn into the Finance Department's workspace.

The noisy office instantly fell silent, everyone pasting on professional smiles.

Melissa emerged from her office, scanning the room.

"Welcome, Evelyn," she said with a polished smile. "Penelope, you'll mentor our new colleague."

Penelope Pope glanced around helplessly. "Melissa, we don't have any free desks."

"What about that one over there?" Melissa pointed casually.

In the corner sat a small, dust-covered table, glaringly out of place amidst the modern office setup.

Evelyn walked over without batting an eye.

Last night at dinner, Julian had asked worriedly, "What if they give you a hard time?"

"Could it be worse than now?" She'd chuckled around a bite of rib.

Those who've already hit rock bottom can't be broken by petty workplace games.

......

Julian remembered that rainy day.

He'd waited at the school gates for Evelyn, only to see Alexander's car parked nearby.

"Evelyn, come here," the young man had called coldly.

Without a backward glance, Evelyn had run to Alexander like a kite with its string cut.

As the car window passed, Julian heard her soft voice: "Alex, don't be mad. I'll never talk to him again..."

Standing in the rain, Julian had felt his heart shatter.

He'd once promised to return the financial empire to her.

But now, he couldn't even protect her.
###Chapter 60: Workplace Bullying

Evelyn's phone buzzed violently.

Martha's messages came rapid-fire: [Evelyn! Check Vincent's interview now! Emergency!]

Evelyn looked up from her mountain of manuscripts, rubbing her sore neck. [Haven't seen it. What's wrong?]

Martha sent a voice message: "Still proofreading? Finance Department's treating you like slave labor!"

Evelyn smiled bitterly.

Since transferring to Finance, she'd fallen into a bottomless pit.

Editor Penelope Pope always looked half-dead: "Newbies need extra proofreading practice."

Yet the entire department's workload landed on her.

"Finance isn't entertainment," colleagues chimed in. "One typo costs fifty bucks. Can you afford that?"

Evelyn stared at the dense financial reports, her temples throbbing.

Martha texted again: [Check the byline! They put you last!]

Evelyn opened the digital edition, her eyes turning cold.

Victoria Henn, Charlie Young, Martha Nash... Her name was shoved to the very end.

Martha raged: [Why's that useless Charlie second? He didn't even attend the interview!]

Evelyn actually laughed: [Let them fight over it.]

"Evelyn!" Someone called across the office. "Can you fetch our bubble tea?"

She looked up to see a colleague's fake smile. "Accidentally chose store pickup."

Evelyn closed her laptop. "Delivery won't come upstairs?"

"Everyone's busy..." The woman avoided eye contact.

Evelyn grabbed her phone and left.

At the tea shop, she messaged the department group: [No order here.]

Instant chaos:
[Oops wrong location!]
[It's three blocks over...]
[Be a dear and go there?]

Penelope made her entrance: [We're all swamped. Be understanding.]

Evelyn typed coldly: [Whoever ordered can fetch it.]

Dead silence.

Then Melissa Lee appeared: [One less proofread if you go.]

Evelyn replied instantly: [Which one?]

More silence.

Finally she selected the thickest financial report and hailed a cab.

Her arms trembled loading sixty drinks into the trunk.

"Was this slave labor worth fighting for?"

Alexander's mocking voice came from behind.

He leaned against his car, eyes glacial.
###Chapter 61: This Woman Grows More Untamable

Evelyn Sinclair knew Kingsley Group was nearby.

But she never expected to bump into Alexander Kingsley while buying bubble tea.

She didn't even glance up, taking the paper bag from the cashier and heading straight for her trunk.

"Lord Alex has such broad horizons. Everything seems remarkable to him."

Alexander's eyes darkened. Barely gone for any time, yet her tongue had grown sharper—wild and untamed!

He opened his mouth to retaliate—

"Miss Sinclair, careful..." Nathan Carter hurried forward, placing the remaining drinks in her trunk with meticulous care. "This way they won't spill."

Lord Alex had left the hospital against medical advice. His private physician had been chasing him to the office daily for IV drips.

Yet he skipped meals and ignored medication schedules.

If Evelyn provoked him further...

Nathan valued his current position too much to risk losing it over avoidable conflicts.

"Thanks." Evelyn nodded at Nathan—not for handling her drinks, but for defusing the tension.

One fool like Ethan Miller around Alexander was enough.

"Miss Sinclair, you're always welcome at Kingsley Group. The 'Sinclair' in our name still represents your home." Nathan smiled warmly, a stark contrast to his aggressive negotiation tactics at Horizon Media.

Evelyn didn't respond, turning to enter her car.

Home?

How poetic.

After all these years, who in Kingsbury remembered the meaning behind that "Sinclair"? Who even knew Kingsley Group's full history?

Her home had vanished long ago.

Neither Kingsley Group nor the Kingsley family would ever welcome her back.

......

"Melissa! Melissa!" Someone called out as Melissa Lee passed Evelyn's workstation.

They pointed at her legs. "Your stockings..."

"Oh!" Melissa looked down. "My cat got playful again..."

She turned to Evelyn. "Drop whatever you're doing and buy me new stockings."

Evelyn lifted her gaze, silent.

Melissa smirked. "I know you're frugal. I'll deduct one article from your workload."

Since the bubble tea incident, colleagues had increased their demands on Evelyn.

They always offered to "reduce her assignments" in exchange.

Yet her daily proofreading pile had swollen beyond reason—a deceptive burden disguised as relief.

Between errands and late-night proofreading marathons, Evelyn worked herself ragged with nothing to show.

Her performance metrics reflected empty numbers.

"No. Ask someone else." Her tone remained flat.

"Come on," Melissa said with unusual patience. "Everyone else has more important tasks. It's just across the street."

She straightened, looking down at Evelyn. "Don't be difficult. No one here will indulge your whims."

Evelyn locked her computer and stood calmly. "Wait here."

Rank pulled weight, and Melissa outclassed her by two levels—not to mention being a shareholder's daughter.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn returned with stockings.

Melissa frowned. "This brand? I never wear this."

Evelyn: "Didn't see others. Make do."

Her casual tone drew stares.

Who in Finance didn't grovel for Melissa's favor? Only Evelyn bargained and delivered half-hearted results.

Clearly riding high on the Crown Prince's indulgence.

"Evelyn, Melissa asking you is an honor," a colleague interjected. "Any of us would gladly go."

Evelyn tossed the stockings onto their desk. "Then you do it."

Rarely angry, yet her calmest words carried the heaviest weight.

Though Finance scorned her, veteran journalists recognized her natural interviewing talent—stoic expressions, sharp rhetoric, masterful topic steering.

Such potential would normally attract mentorship.

But for Evelyn, whose beauty allegedly paved her way? No one wanted her to succeed.

"Evelyn, go again." Melissa's voice carried from her office. "I only wear one brand—others cause allergies. Finish what you start. If you can't handle stockings, how can we trust you with real work?"

So righteous.

Evelyn picked up the stockings. "Fine. These can't be returned. Since you didn't specify, transfer the money first."

Over a hundred bucks for stockings across the street.

She refused to foot the bill.

Melissa laughed. "Struggling financially, Evelyn?"

Then feigned realization. "Oh right—I almost forgot. You're parentless. An orphan."

Watching Evelyn's slight expression shift, Melissa faux-apologized. "Oops, slipped out. You're not mad, are you?"

She'd learned about Evelyn's orphan status from Imperial Media University professors.

Melissa could never comprehend how a nobody dared compete with her for Julian Ashford...

Until she saw Julian with Evelyn at Kingsbury University's food court.

Then she understood—Julian's favor was Evelyn's armor.

Since transferring Evelyn to Finance, Melissa had invented endless torments.

Yet Evelyn's unshakable composure only fueled Melissa's fury.

Today, she'd finally found the chink in Evelyn's armor.

Hitting insecurities always delivered the sharpest blows.

But before Melissa could savor her victory, Evelyn regained equilibrium:

"Not angry, Melissa." Her tone remained even. "How could you understand my pain? With both parents alive, you can laugh while exposing my wounds for public amusement."

"You—!" Melissa's face twisted.
###Chapter 62: Plagiarism Scandal – Vincent Sullivan Strikes Back

Melissa Lee's nails dug into her palms.

She never imagined Evelyn Sinclair could corner her like this.

"Evelyn, you—"

The words died on her lips.

A chilling realization struck her – she was making a fatal mistake.

Evelyn's words had sliced through her facade like a scalpel.

Mocking someone's family tragedy?

This was social suicide.

Melissa clenched her jaw.

She was Horizon Media's golden girl, the untouchable goddess in everyone's eyes.

How could she lose composure over Evelyn Sinclair?

"Suit yourself."

She clung to her crumbling pride and turned away.

Evelyn watched her retreating back, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"Don't forget to file your expense report."

The Financial Department proved more intriguing than expected.

Until—

She opened that investigative report about Autumn Detail.

......

The Sullivan residence.

Victoria Henn's forehead glistened with sweat.

"Mr. Sullivan, here's the interview outline..."

She presented the documents with both hands, her posture dripping with obsequiousness.

Vincent Sullivan didn't even glance up.

"Where's Reporter Sinclair?"

Victoria's pulse spiked.

"She's been transferred. I'm handling this now..."

"Hmph."

Vincent冷笑一声，随手将文件扔在桌上。

Beside him, a distinguished middle-aged man sipped tea with deliberate calm.

Victoria stole a nervous glance, recognizing the man instantly.

Minister Lightfoot from Kingsbury's propaganda department!

"Is this Reporter Sinclair's research framework?" Vincent demanded.

Victoria's spine turned to ice.

"Yes... but it's been reassigned to me..."

"Reassigned?"

Vincent slammed the table and stood.

"You'd steal a byline – what wouldn't you steal?"

Victoria's knees buckled.

"Vincent, please."

Minister Lightfoot set down his teacup, his mild tone laced with steel.

"I'll call Julian Ashford immediately."

Victoria's vision darkened.

......

The Financial Department erupted.

"Evelyn! Who gave you the right to edit my piece?"

Roxanne Luna stormed over and slammed documents onto Evelyn's desk.

The office fell silent.

"What's the issue?"

Evelyn looked up, her gaze unsettlingly calm.

"You deleted my infographic! And changed the timeline!"

Roxanne's shriek grated on everyone's nerves.

Penelope Pope hurried over.

"What's going on?"

"Penny, she butchered my article!"

Roxanne played the victim first.

Penelope frowned at Evelyn.

"Apologize."

Evelyn rose slowly.

"Autumn Detail existed for nineteen years, not six."

Her quiet statement silenced the room.

Roxanne's face twitched.

"That's a lie! I verified the data!"

"Anyone can edit Wikipedia."

Evelyn held her gaze.

"Did you check the business registry?"

Roxanne's bravado faltered.

"Who cares about a defunct company..."

Her voice dwindled to a mumble.

Evelyn smiled faintly.

"I do."
###Chapter 63: Beggars Can't Be Choosers

Evelyn Sinclair lowered her gaze in silence.

Roxanne Luna's words cut like a dull knife, slowly carving into her heart.

Who else would care about that long-defunct company anyway?

Even if she did care, what difference would it make?

It would only leave another scar.

"And why did you delete the photos I painstakingly sourced?" Roxanne demanded aggressively.

Evelyn looked up and suddenly smiled.

That smile sent chills down Roxanne's spine.

"What are you laughing at?"

"Nothing," Evelyn replied lightly. "It's just amusing. If no one cares about a bankrupt company, why fuss over the photos?"

She tilted her head. "Scavenging for clout off the dead? Even moldy bread tastes good to you?"

Roxanne flushed crimson. "What do you know? Do you even understand the connection between Autumn Detail and Sands Capital? Sands Capital is Kingsley Group—the ones suing you for defamation!"

"Oh?" Evelyn's voice was soft. "And?"

"That photo was given to me by Kingsley Group's upper management! How dare you delete it? Apologize now!"

"Which executive gave it to you?" Evelyn asked leisurely.

Just as Roxanne opened her mouth to answer, Melissa Lee stormed over. "Roxanne! Don't you have work to do?"

The finance department collectively exhaled in relief.

That was intense.

Evelyn had effortlessly tricked Roxanne into revealing her source.

Melissa trembled with rage. "Stop causing disruptions during work hours! Fix what needs fixing, penalize what deserves penalties!"

She turned to Evelyn—only to meet a pair of icy eyes.

That gaze made her heart skip a beat.

"Supervisor," Evelyn suddenly smiled. "Your stockings are torn again."

Melissa finally remembered her original task.

"Go buy new ones. Don't mess it up."

......

Evelyn stepped out of the building and pulled out her phone.

She sent the deleted photo to Patriarch Kingsley.

[Uncle Kingsley, this photo was allegedly leaked by Kingsley Group's upper management.]

She needed answers.

Roxanne's article not only got the dates wrong but also included her parents' photo, dripping with malice between the lines.

She'd deleted that photo on purpose.

Just waiting for Roxanne to walk into the trap.

......

Patriarch Kingsley stared at his phone, expression grim.

Beside him, Alexander Kingsley pretended to focus on his computer while stealing glances at the screen.

"You'll handle this?" the patriarch asked.

After a pause, Alexander nodded.

"Get to the bottom of it. Evelyn deserves an explanation," the patriarch said sternly. "Fire whoever's responsible immediately."

"Mm." Alexander's eyes remained glued to the phone.

The patriarch saw through him but said nothing.

His son had his pride—best to let him save face.

......

On her way to the mall, Evelyn received a call from Victoria Henn.

"Evelyn! Get to Vincent Sullivan's house now!"

"Can't," Evelyn replied earnestly. "I'm running errands for Melissa. Besides, what does the entertainment department have to do with finance?"

"Don't use Melissa to intimidate me!" Victoria snapped furiously. "If you don't come, we're all doomed!"

"Then doom it is," Evelyn sighed. "All I do these days is buy bubble tea and stockings. Getting fired means severance pay—sounds like a win."

She hung up.

If you're begging for help, at least have the decency to ask nicely.

Supervisor Henn still has a lot to learn.
###Chapter 64: Beg Me, and I Might Help

Victoria Henn stomped her feet in frustration.

Evelyn Sinclair had always been docile in the Entertainment Department, obediently completing every task without complaint.

When transferred to Finance, she'd signed the paperwork without even blinking.

After being thrown out by Vincent Sullivan, Victoria was certain one call would bring Evelyn running to fix the mess.

But the line only rang busy.

Panicked, she dialed Melissa Lee.

"Melissa, tell Evelyn to drop everything—this is an emergency!"

Melissa feigned calm. "Don't worry, I'll contact her."

Yet Evelyn's phone was either unreachable or cutting out mid-call.

Suspecting sabotage, Melissa ordered Victoria to try again.

This time, Evelyn answered.

"Why are you ignoring Melissa's calls?" Victoria demanded.

"Poor subway signal," Evelyn replied evenly.

"Get here now! Your supervisor approved it!"

"Sorry, the train's already heading the opposite direction."

"Stop lying! This is critical!" Victoria finally realized the game.

"Can't do it." Evelyn's refusal was crisp. "I've been transferred. Want my help? Transfer me back first."

"Come now—we'll discuss the transfer later!"

Evelyn chuckled. "After years leading teams, you have no backup plan? Sending someone alone to interview Vincent Sullivan?"

Victoria froze.

The words sounded eerily familiar.

Then it hit her—she'd said this exact phrase while reprimanding Martha Nash.

Gritting her teeth, Victoria tried reasoning. "This was always your assignment. It's only right you finish it."

"Didn't hear that during my transfer." Evelyn laughed outright. "Sorry—not—coming."

The line went dead.

Victoria stood stunned.

She begged Martha to intervene.

The reply came swiftly: No chance.

"Victoria, Evelyn must have unique access to Vincent. Replacing her was a mistake... Not that my opinion matters as editor."

Martha hid her satisfaction. Victoria's constant undermining had finally backfired.

Swallowing pride, Victoria called Evelyn again.

"Evelyn, I was wrong. I apologize. Please help Horizon—help me."

"Gladly." The sudden agreement startled Victoria.

"When can you come?"

"Not today. My desk's buried. Tomorrow depends—if Melissa's stockings don't run, if colleagues order correct milk tea, if skipping one article doesn't double my workload..."

"I already cleared it with Melissa!"

"Meaningless." Evelyn sighed. "Finance works me harder than Entertainment. Interviewing Vincent would triple my tasks."

"I swear it won't!"

Evelyn's laugh was light. "Melissa outranks you. Why would she listen? I'm entering a store—"

"Wait!" Victoria's voice turned pleading. "Where are you? I'll fetch you myself!"

The department head sounded utterly diminished.

"No need. I'll come when free."

"Evelyn, I'm begging you..." Victoria trembled. "I've never begged anyone... Evelyn? Are you listening?"

Store chatter interrupted as Evelyn ordered: "One pair in this shade... Victoria? Continue."

Humiliation burned. A department head, toyed with by a junior employee?

"Evelyn, please... My family depends on me..."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. Where was this concern when Victoria forced her transfer and stole her bylines?

"Fine. I'll come after submitting documents."

"Can't you come directly?"

"It's on my way."

As Victoria prepared to grovel further, her phone vibrated.

The screen flashed three damning words:

Crown Prince.
###Chapter 65: Stockings Scandal Ignites Office Warfare

Evelyn Sinclair sensed something amiss the moment she stepped into the Financial Department.

The usually noisy workspace had fallen eerily silent.

Even keyboard strokes were deliberately softened.

A suffocating tension hung thick in the air.

She walked straight to the manager's office and knocked lightly.

"Manager Lee, I found the stockings you wanted." She deliberately raised her voice. "It took five different stores to locate the exact same style and shade—"

The door swung open abruptly.

Julian Ashford's icy expression greeted her.

"Editor-in-chief?" Evelyn feigned surprise.

Over Julian's shoulder, she glimpsed Victoria Henn's livid face.

"Isn't Ms. Henn supposed to be with Mr. Sullivan?"

Victoria's eyes burned with venomous fury.

Visit Vincent Sullivan again?

And risk another public humiliation?

Julian's gaze dropped to Melissa Lee's legs hidden beneath the desk.

"Stockings?" His voice could freeze hell. "Is this why Horizon Media hired you? As a personal shopper?"

Evelyn smiled innocently. "Manager Lee has very specific requirements. Last time—"

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Melissa snapped.

Julian turned his glacial stare on Melissa.

"Can't function without stockings?"

Melissa flinched.

She'd never seen Julian this severe.

"Does your paycheck cover personal fetishes?" His words cut like knives. "Hire a maid if you need errands run. Don't disgrace yourself here."

Melissa turned ghostly pale.

"That's not—"

"Then what?" Julian sneered. "Abusing authority? Settling personal scores? Is this all a department head is capable of?"

Melissa collapsed into her chair.

The elegant man she admired was now shredding her dignity with cruel precision.

All for Evelyn Sinclair!

Julian's expression softened when he turned back to Evelyn.

"Mr. Sullivan requested you specifically for the interview. Will you go?"

The blatant favoritism made Melissa's tears spill over.

Evelyn answered calmly, "If the company needs me, I'll oblige."

"Hypocrite!" Melissa exploded. "Why didn't you answer your phone earlier? You did this on purpose!"

Evelyn remained unruffled. "I was busy finding Manager Lee's stockings. No stockings, no proofreading—as you know."

"You—" Melissa slammed her hands on the desk.

"Then I won't go." Evelyn surrendered smoothly.

Julian immediately backed her. "Her choice."

Panic flashed across Victoria's face.

Would all blame fall on her now?

She glared daggers at Melissa, the silent threat unmistakable.

Melissa suddenly grasped the gravity of her situation.

Swallowing her pride, she forced conciliation. "Evelyn, I was too harsh earlier—"

"You do need her," Julian mocked. "As your personal servant."

The department held its collective breath.

The Financial Department's reigning queen now groveled. "I abused my position..."

"Specifically?" Julian pressed.

Melissa's tears fell freely.

The realization struck her—this entire humiliation was Julian's revenge for Evelyn.

And she was the sacrificial lamb on this altar of public shaming.
###Chapter 66: The Taste of Begging on Her Knees

Melissa Lee had never humbled herself like this in her entire life.

Her head hung low, nails digging deep into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

Julian Ashford's voice was glacial. "Buying stockings? You call this an errand? Should I assign you to purchase lingerie for every female colleague daily?"

Melissa trembled violently.

She finally understood - Evelyn's seemingly docile behavior had all been an act.

That bitch had dug this trap long ago, just waiting for her to fall in.

"I'm sorry..." Melissa's voice choked with tears. "Evelyn, I mishandled things..."

"And?" Julian cut her off sharply, his gaze piercing.

Melissa bit through her lip.

The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth as she forced out the humiliating words: "I'll immediately request your transfer back to Entertainment."

The office fell deathly silent.

Everyone held their breath.

Julian turned to Evelyn, his tone softening abruptly. "Do you still want Vincent Sullivan's interview?"

Evelyn nodded obediently. "I'll follow your arrangements."

This meek demeanor was a far cry from her helpless victim act in Finance.

The realization hit Melissa - Evelyn had been playing the fool to catch the tiger!

"Good." Julian's lips curved slightly. "Finish the handover here first."

Evelyn hesitated. "Then...will I still be penalized for today's proofreading errors?"

The air froze instantly.

Julian's expression darkened. "What errors?"

"It's just..." Evelyn glanced meaningfully at Melissa.

"Speak!" Julian barked.

Penelope Pope rose shakily to explain, her voice trembling like a leaf.

When Julian heard "thirty to fifty articles," he slammed the table and stood.

"Melissa Lee!" His voice burned with suppressed fury. "Were you treating her like livestock?"

Melissa kept her head bowed, tears splattering the floor.

Roxanne Luna suddenly interjected, "If she hadn't deleted those photos—"

"Photos?" Julian sneered. "What photos are worth more than a human life? Making her work past midnight daily - have you no conscience?"

The entire Finance Department fell silent.

Everyone shrank back, afraid to be noticed.

Evelyn stood quietly aside, the faintest smile playing at her lips.

The play had finally reached the climax she desired.
###Chapter 67: The Arrogance of a Cuckoo in the Nest

"What happened to the photo?" Julian Ashford's voice was icy. "Was it deleted by mistake or on purpose?"

Evelyn Sinclair kept her gaze fixed on the floor.

"On purpose," she answered softly.

Roxanne Luna's lips curled in triumph.

See? She knew this rookie was up to no good!

A greenhorn who barely knew the ropes, daring to show off in front of her. Now she'd fallen flat on her face.

Let's see how the Crown Prince protects her this time!

Julian had built a reputation for impartiality since taking office—even Melissa Lee couldn't sway him.

If he made an exception for Evelyn today, his carefully crafted image would be ruined.

"Evelyn rarely makes mistakes," Penelope Pope interjected timidly. "The policy states minor errors within the acceptable rate don't warrant penalties..."

Was that the point?

The point was the deliberate deletion!

A malicious act!

The entire department held its breath, waiting to see Julian's decision.

"Explain." His tone was flat.

Evelyn nodded. "First, I admit overstepping—a first-round editor shouldn't assess photo risks. Second, I should've informed Roxanne and the editor-in-chief after deleting it. But I..."

"What risk?" Julian cut in sharply.

Evelyn lifted her head.

"It was..." Her throat tightened.

Why was this so hard to say aloud when she could face Melissa's barbs without flinching?

She took a deep breath, forcing a fragile smile.

"The founders of Autumn Detail. A portrait taken... one week before their deaths."

Julian's pupils contracted.

Her smile held fragments of a past he couldn't reclaim.

"Evelyn..." His voice was barely audible.

The finance team exchanged confused glances.

What was wrong with the Crown Prince?

Evelyn's smile froze. She ducked her head, blinking back tears.

"I couldn't alter the article, but removing the photo mitigated risks. I worried... the Kingsleys might take offense."

Her whisper faded into silence.

Roxanne scoffed. "That feud was ages ago. Would Kingsley Group really attack us over one photo? We've weathered Alexander's lawsuits before..."

She raised her voice deliberately, betting Melissa would reward her audacity.

She'd already crossed Julian—she needed new allies.

Julian's gaze turned razor-sharp.

"You wrote about Autumn Detail without knowing its history?"

Roxanne's back prickled with cold sweat.

"Do you know who founded this department?" Julian's voice cut like steel.

His fist smashed into the glass wall.

CRACK!

A spiderweb of fractures erupted. Blood seeped between his fingers.

Evelyn's heart lurched.

Those were the wounds from saving her...

Melissa looked bewildered.

Who... founded the finance department?

"Of course," Julian sneered. "Your father joined later. What connection does this department have with your Lee family?"

Cuckoos usurping nests, then flaunting their stolen perch.

"Editor-in-Chief," a lawyer rushed in, "Kingsley Group just issued a cease-and-desist. They're accusing our staff of conspiring to steal private photos and demanding disciplinary action."

Roxanne turned ashen.

Kingsley Group... actually came for a single photo!

"Handle it," Julian said coldly to Melissa. "Can you?"

Melissa gave a stiff nod.

A phone rang abruptly.

Julian glanced at the screen and strode out without a word.

Evelyn hesitated, then—under everyone's stunned gaze—chased after him.
###Chapter 68: The Return of the King

The phone screen lit up. The name "Alexander Kingsley" made Julian Ashford's pupils contract.

His finger hovered over the answer button. His Adam's apple bobbed.

"Impressive moves, Mr. Ashford." Alexander's voice was icy. "The Ashford family's tradition of ingratitude has found its perfect heir."

Julian clenched his fist, his knuckles turning white.

A soft knock sounded behind him.

Evelyn Sinclair stood there, her gaze falling on his bleeding palm. She handed him a tissue, her fingertips cool.

"Thanks for your concern," Julian said flatly into the phone. "Let's leave it at that."

The infirmary smelled of antiseptic.

"Not worth it." Evelyn pressed a cotton swab to his wound. "Few people in this world can truly empathize."

She'd learned this long ago.

When the Sinclair family fell, the entire Kingsbury financial world had trembled. But how much of that shock was genuine?

The Sinclairs had shielded her at all costs, burying the truth—wasn't that also to protect themselves, and the Kingsleys?

So-called debts of gratitude were just burdens passed down through generations.

"The Kingsleys do value loyalty," Julian said, watching the bandage wrap around his hand. "The Ashfords can't compare."

He turned suddenly. "Why didn't you tell me about the Financial Department?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "They made me proofread old drafts. It helped me learn the industry faster."

"Those documents had errors."

"Mistakes are information too." Her eyes were clear. "Others see my losses. I see growth."

Fetching bubble tea was nothing.

They wanted to see her break. She'd smile brighter instead.

......

The transfer order to the Entertainment Department arrived that afternoon.

Vincent Sullivan's interview was rescheduled for the next day.

The Financial Department's decision on Roxanne Luna came down simultaneously—immediate termination.

Even Melissa Lee and the editor-in-chief had bonuses docked.

The private group chat exploded.

[Same warning from Kingsley Group, such different outcomes!]

[Melissa got dragged into this over one photo!]

[Should've thought before deleting those pictures!]

......

Outcry for Roxanne rose in waves.

Until the Social Affairs Department editor suddenly spoke:

[Don't drag others into your mess. Know why Autumn Detail is off-limits?]

The group fell silent.

An anonymous message added: [Autumn Detail was co-founded by one of the Financial Department's original team. Media outlets signed NDAs.]

It was quickly deleted.

The Social Affairs editor continued: [The newbie saved you. Wait till Kingsley Group and Orange Media team up—you'll be blacklisted for life.]

Dead silence.

Social Affairs was Horizon Media's crown jewel.

Their reporters braved war zones and exposed corruption. To them, the Financial Department was just a bunch of sycophants.

"Finance has been controlled by the Lees for years," a veteran Social Affairs reporter spat, slamming his keyboard. "If only Autumn Detail's team were still here..."

"Shh—"

A collective sigh filled the office.

Everyone remembered that legendary team.

When would the king return?
###Chapter 69: The Kingsleys Never Wronged Her

Morning sunlight filtered through the clouds, casting dappled patterns across Evelyn Sinclair's skirt.

She had just stepped out of her apartment complex when she spotted the familiar black Bentley.

Nathan Carter stood beside the car, his professional smile in place. "Miss Sinclair, Kingsley Group wishes to address the photo incident with you."

The tinted windows revealed nothing.

But Evelyn knew Alexander Kingsley was inside.

She took a deep breath and walked straight to the car door.

If she couldn't avoid this confrontation, she might as well face it head-on.

The door opened, revealing Alexander's sharp profile.

Evelyn's fingers hesitated for a fraction of a second.

He'd lost weight.

His already angular jawline looked even more pronounced. Those phoenix eyes inherited from Eleanor Kingsley appeared sharper against his gaunt features.

Evelyn averted her gaze and slid into the seat without a word.

"Father assigned me to handle this," Alexander's voice came from beside her. "The person responsible for leaking the photos has been dealt with."

"Thank you." Her reply was curt and distant.

Silence filled the car.

Evelyn watched the scenery blur past the window, memories surfacing.

She used to chatter endlessly, terrified of awkward pauses. Now, she preferred the quiet.

"When do you get paid?"

Alexander's sudden question shattered the stillness.

Evelyn turned to see him holding out a black card.

"Transfer half your salary here."

She laughed softly. "Is Lord Alex short on cash?"

"Fine." She took the card. "If you dare accept it, I'll dare send it."

These were the exact words she'd tossed at him carelessly outside Vincent Sullivan's home. She hadn't expected him to remember.

As she moved to tuck the card into her purse, a strong hand shoved her against the seat.

Alexander loomed over her, fury burning in his eyes.

"Is this how you speak to people now?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "Answer me, Evelyn!"

Trapped beneath him, she had no choice but to meet his gaze.

Those eyes she'd once adored now blazed with anger.

"Who are you putting on this act for?" He ground out between clenched teeth. "Is this how the Kingsleys raised you?"

Evelyn turned her face away.

So he didn't like being ignored either.

"The Kingsleys never wronged me," she said quietly.

She would always remember the family's kindness. But Alexander's wounds ran just as deep.

"Those photos the executive had," she met his eyes squarely, "where did they come from?"

Sunlight streamed through the window, drawing a bright line between them.
###Chapter 70: Touch Me and I'll Kill Myself

Alexander Kingsley's pupils constricted violently.

Evelyn Sinclair's voice was feather-light. "When did he come to Kingsbury? What's his connection to Autumn Detail and Sands Capital?"

His silence made her lips curl into a bitter smile. "You just drove him away... What a satisfying explanation."

"He worked at Autumn Detail..." Alexander's tone weakened noticeably when mentioning her parents. "That's how he got those photos."

"He only stayed three months!" Evelyn's voice suddenly sharpened. "He resigned a year before my parents' accident. Where did those photos come from? You'd believe anything he says?"

Of course. It wasn't his loved ones who died. His family wasn't destroyed.

She should be grateful he even offered an explanation...

"So," Alexander spoke abruptly, "you suspect someone deliberately gave him those photos and sold them to Horizon? They knew you'd see them?"

His piercing gaze seemed to bore into her soul. "You know who it is?"

Evelyn knew Alexander was brilliant.

With just a few clues, he'd pieced everything together.

Yet he refused to follow the trail further.

When all it would take was his willingness...

Never mind.

Evelyn suddenly felt liberated. They were already broken up. What more could she expect?

"I don't know." She flashed a perfectly crafted fake smile.

Because she had no proof.

If Alexander wouldn't investigate, she couldn't touch the culprit.

But she never expected this dismissive smile would ignite the powder keg.

Alexander crushed his lips against hers.

Dominating. Unyielding. Leaving no room for refusal.

Evelyn froze in shock.

His kiss was urgent and savage, as if trying to consume her whole.

Only when his hand slid up her thigh did she snap back to reality...

"Ah—!" Alexander hissed in pain.

Evelyn had bitten down hard.

"Stop the car!" She shoved him away violently.

The driver ignored her. Evelyn turned to wrench the door open, heedless of their speed.

Alexander yanked her back, their struggle rocking the vehicle.

"Have you lost your mind?"

Instead of breaking free, Evelyn found herself trapped tighter in his arms.

"Nathan. Privacy screen." Alexander's voice was hoarse.

The silver-gray divider rose silently...

Danger thickened in the enclosed space.

"Alexander," Evelyn's eyes brimmed with tears, "touch me and I'll kill myself."

He froze.

Those obsidian eyes burned into her, as if trying to brand her into his bones.

......

The car halted outside Horizon Media's building. Finally, Alexander released her.

He watched Evelyn's fleeing figure with unreadable darkness in his gaze.

"Nathan," the divider lowered, "trace the origin of those photos from Wu Chun."

Nathan didn't dare ask questions. "Understood."

The rearview mirror reflected Lord Alex's thunderous expression...

Clearly suffering from unfulfilled desire.

Ethan Miller might be foolish, but his dullness was a blessing. At least he wouldn't get eliminated for knowing too much...

......

"Evelyn!"

Evelyn smoothed her expression before turning.

Simon York approached—her colleague since returning to the entertainment department.

For today's Vincent Sullivan interview, they'd assigned her an assistant. Simon had volunteered.

He'd always been decent to her. Evelyn had no reason to refuse...

"When are we heading to Mr. Sullivan's?" Simon asked as they waited for the elevator.

His gaze flickered toward the building's entrance.

That car was gone now...

Not the Crown Prince's vehicle.

Pity he'd been too focused on confirming Evelyn's identity to note the license plate.

"We'll leave after gathering our gear upstairs." Evelyn stared at the elevator doors, seemingly oblivious to his glance.

Returning to Vincent Sullivan's mansion, Evelyn received a warm welcome.

The elderly artist inquired after her wellbeing while ignoring Simon completely.

Simon's palms grew clammy with nerves.

This opportunity had him tossing all night, too anxious to eat breakfast properly.

Now his stomach rebelled.

He excused himself four times during the interview, emerging pale-faced afterward.

"Sorry for being dead weight." His apology seemed genuine.

Evelyn smiled gently. "Don't worry. I once fainted during an interview."

That was Victoria Henn's excuse for assigning her a minder—claiming no one could bear responsibility if another "accident" occurred.

Evelyn drafted the article with remarkable speed.

By next morning, she'd sent the first version to Vincent Sullivan.

After incorporating his feedback, the department rushed it through approvals.

Just in time for magazine layout, the editorial team adjusted and sent it to print immediately.

With this task completed, Victoria surprisingly granted Evelyn two days off.

But her much-needed nap was shattered by Martha Nash's call.

"Wake up! Emergency!" Martha's voice jolted her awake. "Check your messages. Delete after reading!"

Martha was prone to dramatics. Evelyn initially dismissed it.

Then she saw the attachment.

Her face drained of color.

She called back immediately. "Martha. Send me the printing plant's address."

A brief hesitation. "Sending now! But whether you succeed or fail, don't rat me out!"

"Succeed and you'll be promoted to editor!" Evelyn vowed.

She dressed hastily and dashed downstairs, spotting a taxi across the street.

Evelyn waved while sprinting across the road.

Screeching brakes tore through the air...
###Chapter 71: All-Night Vigil

Tires screeched through the night.

Evelyn's skirt brushed against the Maybach's hood as she stumbled onto it.

"Trying to get yourself killed?" Alexander flung the car door open and closed the distance in three strides.

His fingers were icy as he swept her into his arms without explanation. The driver paled, hands trembling on the wheel.

"Hospital. Now." Alexander's voice simmered with restrained fury.

"I'm not hurt!" Evelyn struggled free. "There's an emergency—"

"Address." He cut her off, his grip unrelenting on her wrist.

"Printing factory. 23 Longtian Road." The words tumbled out.

The Maybach tore through the darkness.

Machines roared when Evelyn burst into the workshop. Her eyes immediately locked onto the Heidelberg press churning out Vincent Sullivan's feature.

"Shut it down!" She lunged for the control panel.

Silence swallowed the workshop. The operator moved to stop her, but she'd already deleted the layout files.

"What's the meaning of this?" The factory manager rushed over.

Evelyn flashed her press pass. "Critical errors in the article. Immediate revisions required."

"Preposterous!" The manager pulled out his phone. "I'm calling your supervisor—"

"Dial Julian Ashford." She snatched the device. "Only he can verify this."

Alexander's voice cut through the argument from the doorway: "Do as she says."

Black-suited security personnel swiftly secured the area. Alexander's gaze swept the frozen crowd before landing on Evelyn. "Need instructions on how to proceed?"

Evelyn produced a flash drive. "Take me to the office."

"This is illegal—"

"Name your price." Alexander's glacial tone silenced the manager.

The electronic payment notification chimed moments later. The manager swallowed hard at the sum displayed, then wordlessly led the way.

Dawn approached when the final stack of corrected pages rolled off the line. Rubbing her throbbing temples, Evelyn staggered out of the factory.

Morning mist curled around the Maybach idling roadside.

She froze.

Once, she'd been the one keeping vigil through endless nights, waiting where he might appear. Back then, she'd wondered if he'd ever glance her way.

Now their roles had reversed, leaving only barren emptiness in her chest.

Evelyn opened the car door. "Thank you."

Alexander slowly opened bloodshot eyes. "How do you plan to repay me this time?"

His fingers tapped the armrest like a predator awaiting its prey's surrender.
###Chapter 72: Everyone Knew They Had No Intimacy

Evelyn Sinclair froze.

She tilted her head slightly, searching Alexander Kingsley's cold expression for his true intentions.

"How about..." she ventured carefully, "I give you next month's salary?"

It was the most practical compensation she could offer.

But Alexander's expression darkened further.

"Grandfather's birthday has been rescheduled," he said in a low voice. "The previous deadline still stands."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

She remembered that ten-day ultimatum all too well.

"Add me back on WeChat." Alexander tossed his phone in front of her. "And take my number off your blocklist."

Evelyn didn't move.

"I'll attend Grandfather's birthday banquet," she said softly. "But as for the rest... let's leave it at that."

From the moment she left Royal Gardens, she'd never considered turning back.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Alexander's voice simmered with suppressed anger. "Grandfather and Grandmother still don't know about this. Don't force me to—"

"Everyone knew?" Evelyn suddenly laughed. "Which 'everyone' do you mean?"

She counted on her fingers. "Royal Gardens, the Kingsley family, Kingsley Group's executive office... anyone else?"

In the past, he'd refused to even acknowledge their relationship.

Whenever they crossed paths at Kingsley Group, he'd only say coldly, "From a family friend."

A family friend's what?

Little sister? Friend? Or some insignificant passerby?

In any case, everyone knew there was nothing between them.

Alexander fell silent.

For the first time, he realized Evelyn had never been further from him.

Evelyn gave him one last look before turning to exit the car.

......

Vincent Sullivan's exclusive interview sent shockwaves through the industry.

Horizon Media had built tremendous anticipation with their marketing—calling it the reclusive master's first public commentary, a once-in-a-decade exclusive.

Evelyn's article was brilliantly crafted.

The magazine's first print run sold out instantly, with reorders backlogged for months.

The success drew envy from many.

But when Evelyn next visited the Financial Department, Victoria Henn's attitude had completely changed.

Anyone could see this girl wasn't to be trifled with.

Yet when the latest issue arrived at the office, Victoria exploded.

"Who altered the draft?!" She stormed into the printing department. "This isn't the content I submitted!"

The situation quickly escalated.

Under pressure, the printer owner named Evelyn.

Melissa Lee rushed to the scene.

"Evelyn Sinclair, you've got some nerve! Who authorized you to change the article?"

"The original had issues," Evelyn replied calmly. "It carried my byline but wasn't my writing."

"Lies!" Melissa sneered. "Since when do you care about rules?"

Evelyn met her gaze. "Why is the Financial Department so invested in Entertainment's affairs?"

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Victoria shouted. "Do you realize what exclusive scoop you've ruined?"

"Since when is slander considered news?" Evelyn stood her ground. "Have you considered the consequences?"

Julian Ashford arrived at the commotion.

"What's going on?"

"Editor-in-Chief, we secured an exclusive about Vincent Sullivan, but Evelyn changed the article without authorization!" Victoria said urgently. "This is a serious violation!"

"What exclusive?"

"About Madam Zade!" Victoria shot Evelyn a triumphant glance. "Do you know why Vincent never gives interviews? Because he keeps his mentally ill wife locked in their backyard!"

Evelyn clenched her fists.

She had seen the woman.

Deep in the garden.

"We have photographic evidence!" Victoria pressed her advantage. "Evelyn blackmailed Vincent with this to get the interview!"

"That's not true."

"We even obtained hospital records!" Victoria bore down aggressively. "Evelyn Sinclair, as a journalist, how dare you suppress the truth? What do you have to say for yourself?"
###Chapter 73: Evelyn, I'm Your Mother

"A hospital certificate?" Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Victoria, forging documents shouldn't be difficult for someone like you."

Victoria Henn narrowed her eyes. "Evelyn, are you threatening me?"

Evelyn calmly adjusted her cuffs. "I'm merely stating facts. Horizon Media has always upheld justice. We never wrong innocent employees."

A sudden commotion erupted outside the office.

"Who dares accuse her?" A commanding voice cut through the crowd.

People hastily stepped aside.

Melissa Lee and Victoria turned simultaneously, their faces draining of color.

Leading the group stood a composed man with scholarly elegance, his features bearing striking resemblance to Julian Ashford.

"Mr. Yearwood..." Melissa gasped.

William Yearwood, CEO of Horizon Media, had arrived.

He stepped aside respectfully, gesturing forward. "Mr. Sullivan, this way please."

The entire floor fell silent.

Vincent Sullivan entered arm-in-arm with his wife, followed by newly appointed Minister Lightfoot.

The real shock came from Madam Zade—the woman rumored to be imprisoned for years now stood radiant before everyone.

"Evelyn!" Madam Zade spotted Evelyn immediately, releasing her husband to rush forward.

Evelyn clasped her hands warmly. "Auntie."

Madam Zade studied her face intently. "I heard someone's bullying you? Tell me who, I'll handle it!"

"With you here, no one would dare." Evelyn smiled sweetly.

The stunned crowd watched their intimate mother-daughter dynamic. This poised, articulate woman bore no resemblance to the alleged mental patient.

Vincent's expression darkened dangerously.

"Explain this." He slammed a printed document onto the table.

Victoria turned deathly pale.

It was the fabricated article she'd substituted—the exposé about Vincent imprisoning his mentally ill wife.

"The byline says Duan Sheli..." Melissa forced out weakly.

"Lies!" Madam Zade interrupted fiercely. "Evelyn would never write such filth!"

Multiple sharp gazes pinned Melissa down. She immediately shrank back.

Victoria trembled violently, sweat soaking her blouse.

"Who wrote this?" William demanded.

Silence.

"IT," he ordered, "lock down all systems. Trace the original file."

Victoria knew the game was over.

"Mr. Yearwood..." Her voice shook uncontrollably.

She was finished.

Every ambition crumbled in this moment.

Regret flooded her. Why had she listened to Melissa? Why target Evelyn?

"Where did these photos come from?" William pressed.

"P...Photoshopped," Victoria stammered.

She'd paid for doctored images, though her informant swore they'd seen the imprisoned woman.

"Any other fabricated evidence?"

Victoria nodded hopelessly.

She knew Horizon would prioritize protecting the Sullivans' reputation.

Evelyn had won.

Had the article been published, Victoria would be standing triumphant now.

"Accomplices?" William's final question made Melissa tense.

Surprisingly, Victoria shook her head.

Not out of kindness—she kept Melissa's secrets for future leverage.

One hour later, Horizon issued a termination notice.

Victoria Henn was fired on the spot for fabricating news.

In the conference room, Minister Lightfoot smiled at Evelyn. "I've long admired your work, Ms. Sinclair. Let's collaborate sometime."

William gave a thoughtful glance.

Madam Zade never released Evelyn's hand. "Come visit soon, darling. It's time we made our relationship official."

Evelyn's cheeks pinked.

She remembered that fateful day in the Sullivan garden—

The dark room.

The chained woman with wild hair who wept upon seeing her:

"Evelyn, I'm your mother..."
###Chapter 74: Fate's Gift

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen.

Madam Zade's scalding tears fell onto the back of her hand.

"Evelyn..." The name carried emotions too complex to decipher.

Trembling fingers brushed her cheek. "Mom finally found you..."

Evelyn instinctively stepped back.

For a split second, she glimpsed clarity in Madam Zade's eyes before they clouded over again.

"What's going on?" Vincent Sullivan's furious voice echoed from the doorway.

He strode forward to pull Evelyn away, but Madam Zade clutched his sleeve desperately.

"Vincent!" Her voice turned shrill. "Look! Evelyn's home!"

Vincent's pupils constricted violently.

Evelyn watched the titan of industry's fingers tremble uncontrollably.

"You...remember me?" His voice cracked with emotion.

It was the first time in ten years Madam Zade had spoken his name.

Only then did Evelyn notice the room's peculiarities—every sharp corner padded, the chain just long enough for limited mobility.

Vincent's eyes reddened.

"Thirteen years ago..." He spoke with difficulty. "At Greenhill Sanatorium..."

During Madam Zade's relapse, she'd stayed there under an alias. She'd met a mute little girl who curled up in corners.

"She called you Evelyn." Vincent smiled bitterly. "Because you always stared at the hibiscus in the courtyard."

Madam Zade had insisted on adopting the child.

The miracle happened at dusk. The girl suddenly threw herself into Madam Zade's arms, crying "Mommy" in a crystal-clear voice.

"You vanished the next day." Vincent's voice shook. "She searched for you like a madwoman..."

Evelyn's fingertips turned icy.

She remembered hibiscus flowers. But her memories of the sanatorium remained blank.

"I checked every girl named Evelyn." Madam Zade suddenly seized her hand. "But none were you..."

Evelyn's heart clenched.

So those strangers lingering outside her school had been searching for her?

......

At 3 a.m., the town car appeared punctually at the alley.

Madam Zade clutched a thermos, peering eagerly through the window.

"Evelyn, I made pear soup." She hurriedly pulled her inside. "Your voice sounds hoarse."

Evelyn's phone showed 99+ unread messages:

Take your vitamins
Wear layers tomorrow
Made your favorite osmanthus cakes
More meticulous than Eleanor Kingsley. More doting than Isabella Winslow.

Her replies stayed deliberately casual:

Drinking bubble tea
Bought new lipstick
Only edited three articles today
Then the printing plant scandal broke.

Vincent issued one command: "Someone bullied Evelyn."

Madam Zade, who hadn't left home in a decade, had her hair styled, wore a cheongsam, even applied the lipstick Evelyn gifted her.

......

"Miss Sinclair shows remarkable courage." Vincent praised her unabashedly before William Yearwood. "If my wife's condition were exposed..."

William's smile looked strained.

He'd noticed Madam Zade's strangeness—the death grip on Evelyn's sleeve, the unnervingly fervent gaze.

But with two power players present, he forced a chuckle: "What reward would you like, Evelyn?"

"I recommend Martha Nash." Evelyn met his gaze squarely.

William raised an eyebrow. A department head position was a small price for the Sullivans' favor.

When the transfer order arrived, the entertainment division erupted.

"Director Nash!" someone shrieked.

Martha stood stunned.

Evelyn bounced over. "What did I tell you?"

"What?" Martha played dumb.

"Editor Sinclair!" another voice called.

Martha smacked her back. "Look at you now!"

Fingering her shiny new badge, Evelyn recalled Madam Zade's morning text:

Evelyn, Mom's so proud of you.
###Chapter 75: A Hazy Drunken Kiss
While some celebrated, others lamented.

Victoria Henn slunk away in disgrace, while Martha Nash and Evelyn Sinclair received unexpected promotions.

Their colleagues clamored for a celebration, keeping them out until late.

Exhausted, Evelyn dragged herself home to find Madam Zade's car idling at the gate.

"Get in," Madam Zade urged, handing her a thermos. "I made you hangover soup."

Evelyn took a tentative sip—

"Ladies shouldn't drink so much," Madam Zade fussed.

Evelyn nearly choked.

Vincent Sullivan glared jealously. "She spent three hours on that. You'd better keep it down."

He'd never received such treatment!

"I didn't drink..." Evelyn mumbled.

Martha had accidentally spilled an entire glass on her during a drinking game.

Madam Zade scoffed. "Listen to you—already slurring."

"I'm not drunk—"

"Drunk people always say that!" Madam Zade insisted. "Finish the soup or call me Mom."

Resigned, Evelyn gulped down three bowls.

By the time they dropped her off, she felt worse than ever.

Staggering toward her building, the harsh lobby lights triggered her nausea. She barely made it to the bushes before retching violently.

The world spun as she wiped her mouth.

A strong hand seized her arm.

She gasped as familiar arms caught her.

"Who let you drink?" Alexander Kingsley's voice rumbled above her.

Evelyn froze.

They'd broken up. She'd walked away without looking back. He hadn't stopped her.

Why was he here now?

"Let go..." She struggled weakly. "I didn't—"

"Really?" His laugh was cold.

Reeking of alcohol, swaying on her feet, vomiting—yet she claimed sobriety?

Before she could protest, Alexander swept her into his arms.

"Stay still." His grip tightened as he bent close, voice uncharacteristically soft. "Be good..."

Evelyn blinked in shock.

She'd never heard him speak so tenderly. The man who was usually as sharp as a blade now sounded like a spring breeze.

He carried her upstairs effortlessly, retrieved her keys, and headed straight for the bedroom.

Gently depositing her on the bed, he knelt beside it, gaze intense. "Eve..."

The childhood nickname made her heart stutter.

How many years since he'd called her that?

Alexander suddenly pressed his lips to her fingertips.

"Our breakup was just anger talking, right?"

"Nothing happened with Julian, right?"

"You'll come to Grandfather's birthday, right?"

Each question came with another kiss.

Evelyn's mind reeled. This had to be a dream.

The proud boy she remembered would never beg like this.

She yanked her hand back in panic.

Alexander's eyes darkened as he leaned closer.

"You're drunk," he murmured hoarsely. "Tomorrow you won't remember."

Evelyn clamped a hand over her mouth. "I will! Alexander, snap out of it!"

He pinned her wrists to the bed.

"After tonight," his voice held dangerous conviction, "we were never broken up."

"You said I disgusted you." Her voice shook. "Called me your plaything..."

She gritted her teeth. "Now you want me? Who's the real hypocrite here?"
###Chapter 76: No More Tolerance for His Arrogance

Alexander Kingsley froze mid-motion.

He straightened slowly, the light casting shadows across his sharp features. The obsession and fervor in his eyes receded like the tide, replaced by their usual piercing intensity.

"You're not drunk?" His voice regained its characteristic iciness, sharp as an unsheathed blade.

Evelyn Sinclair's mind cleared gradually. "I told you—I didn't drink."

His tone ignited her anger.

She had repeated the truth multiple times, yet he twisted it into something calculated. This arrogance—condemning her without listening—was all too familiar.

"Then why do you smell like alcohol?" Alexander's gaze darkened. "Playing drunk to seduce someone?"

Evelyn nearly laughed.

This was Alexander Kingsley in a nutshell. Always jumping to conclusions. Always self-righteous.

It suddenly struck her—how had she endured this for thirteen years? The thought now seemed absurd.

"Believe whatever you want," she replied flatly.

Her indifference only provoked him further. He seized her shoulders and shoved her against the headboard.

A sharp pain flared in her stomach.

"So you admit it?" He gripped her chin. "You left the Kingsleys to chase power and wealth? What did the Sullivans promise you?"

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

He knew about her dealings with the Sullivans? Had he been watching her?

"The Kingsleys treated you well. My mother considered you her own daughter." His jaw tightened. "Yet you'd call someone else 'Mom' for a few favors?"

Evelyn suddenly smiled.

"How do you know I never called Eleanor Kingsley 'Mom'?"

Alexander visibly stiffened.

She seized the moment to break free. "Alexander, do you remember how I overcame my mutism?"

The memory surfaced—

The day she regained her sight, he was the first person she saw. In her dazed state, she had blurted out, "Mom," leaving him stunned.

"Alex..." she murmured, echoing the childhood endearment.

His expression shifted abruptly. "You remember?"

Evelyn didn't understand his tension. Between them, there always seemed to be an unbridgeable gap.

She realized then—Alexander was decisive in business, yet with her, he was perpetually overbearing. As if she alone bore the brunt of his darkest emotions.

They say when you love someone, you feel their tenderness. When love fades, all that remains is their true nature.

She had endured Alexander's nature for thirteen years.

Now, she almost thanked him for ending it. Otherwise, this relationship would have consumed her completely.

"Speak!" Alexander grabbed her face again but released her instantly upon seeing her pallor.

Evelyn bit her lip, sweat beading at her temples. The stabbing pain in her stomach stole her voice.

"Where does it hurt?" he demanded coldly.

When she remained silent, he stormed to the kitchen.

Soon, a cacophony erupted—the clicking of the stove igniter, the shattering of porcelain, Alexander's frustrated curses.

"Ethan! Get up here!"

His assistant rushed in, followed by a chorus of exclamations from the kitchen.

"Lord Alex, that's not how you light it—"
"That's an electric kettle! Not for the stove!"
"Miss Sinclair doesn't even have a proper thermos?"

Curled on the bed, Evelyn sighed silently.

Of course she had a thermos—it was just stored in the cabinet.

As the crashing continued, she mourned her kitchen's fate.

This night would be endless.
###Chapter 77: Darling, I'll Stay With You

Ethan Miller rushed in frantically. "Lord Alex! That glass just came out of the freezer—"

Evelyn Sinclair curled up in pain on the bed, her head snapping up at his words.

Alexander Kingsley stood holding a steaming glass.

"It'll shatter!" Ethan stomped his foot in agitation.

Evelyn nearly laughed despite the pain.

The heir to the Kingsley Group, making such a rookie mistake?

She remembered Alexander had won gold in physics competitions.

Had Ethan's idiocy rubbed off on him?

Alexander wordlessly extended the glass. "Drink."

Evelyn eyed the boiling liquid and weakly shook her head. "This could scald a bull..."

"Take the medicine first." He opened his palm.

Her eyes widened. "Where did you get that?"

"Imported gastric pills." His tone was flat.

She almost fainted.

She just overate, and he gave her ulcer medication?

Was he trying to send her straight to the ER for stomach pumping?

"I'll just massage it..." She resigned herself and burrowed under the covers.

Alexander suddenly grabbed her wrist.

Only then did she notice the cluster of tiny cuts on his hand.

He injured himself boiling water?

What happened to the icy genius from the lab days?

His hand pressed against her stomach, the pressure making her gasp.

"Gentler..." Tears pricked her eyes from the pain.

Alexander paused.

His gaze dropped to her pale lips, darkening.

Ethan peeked in again. "Lord Alex, should I go buy some—"

"Out." A single glare sent him scurrying.

...

By dawn, Evelyn finally took proper medication and slept.

She woke alone.

Fumbling for her phone, she called Martha Nash to take sick leave.

The moment she hung up, Julian Ashford called.

"Senior, I'm fine..." Her voice was frail.

The phone vanished from her grip.

Alexander stood by the bed, sneering into the receiver. "No need for your concern."

Evelyn reached for it, but he held it high above her.

"You've been dumped," Julian's voice came through.

Alexander yanked Evelyn against his chest. "Darling, rest some more."

She froze.

Since when did he use such cheesy pet names?

Worse, his eyes remained arctic despite the sugary words.

"You held on so tight last night, I can barely grip a pen today." His performance continued.

Goosebumps rose on her skin.

Something had clearly possessed him!

After his act, he powered off the phone and tossed it back.

"Want to hear more?" He arched a brow.

Evelyn slammed the door shut and dove under the covers.

...

A knock startled her awake.

Bleary-eyed, she went to answer.

Before recognizing the visitor, unfamiliar arms yanked her into an embrace.
###Chapter 78: Ditching Mom After Losing Your Girl?

Evelyn's drowsiness evaporated instantly.

She shoved the person before her away, finally recognizing Julian Ashford.

The raw emotions swirling in his eyes caught her off guard, exposing feelings once carefully concealed.

"Julian..."

He recovered faster than she did.

Grabbing her wrist, he marched them both into the apartment.

"Where is he?"

His gaze swept the empty living room. Without waiting for an answer, he stormed toward the bedroom.

Only then did Evelyn notice the unnatural silence. "He's gone. I had stomach pain last night and slept heavily just now."

Julian's footsteps carried unmistakable fury. She hurried to explain, "Nothing happened between us, we really—"

Her words died mid-sentence.

The kitchen's disastrous state came into view.

Julian stood amidst the wreckage, his aura darkening by the second.

Crunch.

Glass shattered beneath his shoes.

"He trashed your place?" His voice dripped ice when he turned.

Evelyn shook her head. "No—"

"Stomachache from fighting with him?" he pressed.

That was partially true. But before she could clarify, Julian let out a bitter laugh.

"Alexander Kingsley."

Playing the devoted lover while tormenting her behind closed doors.

He'd make that bastard pay today.

Too bad he arrived too late...

"Julian, the kitchen was—"

"Evelyn!" Julian cut her off sharply. "Must you always defend him? After everything he's done, can't you stand your ground post-breakup?"

Evelyn froze.

This marked Julian's first outburst toward her.

Though his tone remained measured, the reproach cut like a blade.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

Julian instantly regretted his words, panic flashing across his face. "Evelyn, I didn't—"

She wordlessly moved to the sofa.

"My apologies..." Julian stood rooted, visibly flustered. He'd give anything to retract those sentences.

"It's fine." Evelyn surprised him by offering comfort. "You're just worried."

He rushed to her side, voice strained. "I overreacted. Seeing the kitchen like that, I—"

He couldn't admit the outburst stemmed from something else entirely.

That impulsive embrace—he never wanted to let go.

Yet she'd pushed him away. Firmly.

"Ethan made the mess," Evelyn explained. "He broke glasses while boiling water and didn't clean properly."

Julian smiled bitterly. "Which makes my tantrum even more inexcusable."

"Occasional anger makes you human." She managed a small smile.

Alexander's insults had left her unfazed, yet Julian's sharp words stung.

This dependency had to stop.

......

"Eleanor, I need to ask you something." Alexander dialed his mother.

Eleanor Kingsley sounded amused. "Oh? Remembering your mother after losing your girl?"

Since when did he call her 'Eleanor'?

"Did Evelyn... ever call you 'Mom'?"

She pondered. "Yes! She asked if she could, but I refused!"

Alexander halted mid-step. "She really did?"

"I treated her like my own. Of course she wanted to." Eleanor sighed. "But since she'd be my daughter-in-law eventually, I told her to wait..."

How she regretted that decision now.

"Why the sudden question?"

Alexander swallowed his next words. "Nothing. Heading into a meeting."

At the conference room entrance, Nathan Carter briefed a secretary.

Ethan Miller rushed over in panic. "Emergency! Julian went to see Evelyn!"

Nathan frowned. "When?"

"They left for Horizon Media together."

Nathan shoved files into Ethan's arms. "Don't bother Lord Alex with trivialities!"

He'd barely convinced him to attend this meeting.

......

Eleanor called Evelyn. "Darling, your invitation to Grandfather's birthday is sent. About you and Alexander..."

"I understand. I won't mention it to the elders."

"Don't worry. I'll keep him away from you that night."

......

"Isabella! We received the Kingsleys' invitation!" Mrs. Winslow gushed. "How are things with Alexander? Will you go public at the party?"
###Chapter 79: New Broom Sweeps Clean

"Mom—"

Isabella Winslow's tears spilled over at her mother's question.

Eleanor Kingsley's harsh treatment, Evelyn Sinclair's provocation, Alexander Kingsley's coldness—all her grievances came flooding back.

When Evelyn had broken up with Alexander right in front of her, Isabella had been certain of victory.

She'd even boasted to the Winslow family that the Kingsley patriarch's birthday banquet would be the day she and Alexander made their relationship public.

But now...

"That Eleanor is nothing!" Madam Winslow exploded after hearing her daughter's sobs. "How dare she think my precious girl isn't good enough for her son? As for that orphaned bitch Evelyn..."

Her teeth ground together. "Crush her. The Winslows stand behind you."

Winwell Ventures' recent failed investments made securing the Kingsley alliance crucial.

Evelyn Sinclair was an obstacle that needed removing.

Isabella toyed with the butterfly brooch she'd taken from Evelyn, a cold smile curling her lips as she dialed a number.

......

At Horizon Media's entertainment department, Simon York's eyes gleamed at the text on his phone.

[Destroy her reputation within a week. Cooperate.]

Just as he went to reply, a cool female voice spoke behind him. "Simon."

"E-Evelyn!" He fumbled to flip his phone face-down, sweat beading on his forehead.

His former junior colleague was now his boss.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the tense veins of his hand.

"Mr. Sullivan sent surveillance footage," she said, her voice crisp. "During the last interview, you claimed to use the restroom but went to the backyard instead. Correct?"

The office fell silent.

Martha Nash peered out from her office.

Simon's face paled, his carefully constructed "nice guy" facade cracking.

"Curious what I saw, Editor?" he sneered, gambling that Evelyn wouldn't dare mention the Sullivans' secrets publicly.

"You saw chains?" Evelyn smiled. "And Madam Zade?"

Simon's pupils contracted.

Was this woman insane? Bringing up the Sullivans' scandal herself?

"Pity you didn't look closely." Evelyn's smile vanished. "Those were sculpting tools."

Madam Zade had been working on a new art piece that day.

This fool had mistaken an artist's materials for restraints.

"What did Victoria Henn promise you? My position?" Evelyn advanced relentlessly.

Simon stammered, "She forced me! She's always been jealous of you—"

"Jealous of what?" Evelyn's laugh was icy. "The one who really wants me gone—"

Her eyes dropped to the overturned phone.

"—is your sugar mommy, isn't she?"

Gasps filled the office.

Simon stiffened. "What sugar—"

"Shall I say her name?" Evelyn crossed her arms. "Isabella. Winslow."

The three syllables landed like thunder.

"When I first arrived, you 'generously' assigned me all the Alexander-Isabella scoops. Even waived your byline..."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened to a blade's edge.

"Because you knew Alexander would sue, and I'd take the fall."

Back then, desperate for work, she'd had no choice but to walk into the trap.

Now it was time to return the favor.
###Chapter 80: The Trap of the White Wedding Gown

"During the Ryan Holt incident, at the department dinner, you deliberately asked me outside the restroom if I had any more information."

Evelyn Sinclair's voice was calm and measured.

"Once you confirmed I had nothing, you could counterattack without restraint. Simon, it was Orange Media who leaked that I seduced Ryan."

"I never colluded with Orange Media!" Simon York shot up from his chair, sending it crashing to the floor. "I don't even know anyone there!"

He had indeed been following Isabella Winslow's orders to probe Evelyn.

But he swore he had no ties to Orange Media.

Yet when he saw the faint smile playing on Evelyn's lips, a chill ran down his spine.

This usually gentle girl now terrified him.

"Then," Evelyn asked softly, "who did collude with Orange Media?"

Simon's face turned ashen as he shook his head violently.

Her smile was sweet, but he felt like someone had gripped his throat.

"Tell me what you know," Evelyn coaxed. "You're just a small-time reporter, not the mastermind. What's the worst that could happen?"

Cold sweat drenched Simon's back.

She was right, but he couldn't fall for it.

Even Victoria Henn hadn't betrayed Melissa Lee—he certainly wouldn't.

"I quit." Simon slumped back into his seat, utterly defeated.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she saw Martha Nash at the office doorway, giving her a thumbs-up.

"Evelyn!" Simon blocked her in the hallway, his face twisted with rage. "Don't think you'll always be this lucky!"

"Ryan almost succeeded. Madam Zade has mental issues. And Alexander Kingsley..."

"You've crossed Alexander and his girlfriend. Your downfall is coming."

Evelyn chuckled. "His girlfriend? Too scared to even say her name after resigning? How pathetic, Simon."

"Just wait!" Simon snarled through gritted teeth.

"Gladly," Evelyn replied coolly. "If anything happens to me, the police will come for you first."

Simon trembled with fury.

......

That evening, Evelyn found Ethan Miller waiting at her doorstep again.

Why wouldn't this man leave her alone?

Ethan beamed. "Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex specially prepared a gown for your birthday banquet."

Evelyn sidestepped him to unlock her door.

Ethan seized the chance to shove a suitcase inside before slamming the door and bolting.

Inside the suitcase lay a pure white gown, its neckline and hem adorned with lace—eerily reminiscent of a wedding dress.

Evelyn froze.

She'd seen this dress at Karl's Boutique in the capital and had glanced at it twice.

She never thought Alexander would remember.

White...

She hated white more than anything.

The matching pearl-encrusted heels and a jewelry box containing a full set of gems completed the ensemble.

Irritated, Evelyn shoved everything back inside.

Tomorrow was the first day of filming for The First Lady Judge, and she needed to prepare for her business trip.

Just as she lay down, Martha called.

"Bianca White's been replaced."

Evelyn's heart skipped. "By who?"

"Isabella Winslow."
###Chapter 81: She Dared to Glare at Alexander

The entertainment industry had been in a slump these past two years. Frequent celebrity scandals made production crews increasingly cautious.

Not signing formal contracts before filming had become an unspoken industry rule.

As a highly anticipated adaptation, The First Lady Judge attracted attention from its inception. With a top-tier production team, A-list actors lined up for roles.

After rigorous selection, Victoria Chase and Bianca White landed the lead roles.

But the night before filming began, Isabella Winslow suddenly joined the cast...

Evelyn Sinclair was packing when Martha Nash called.

"Isabella's targeting you," Martha said gravely. "With Alexander still suing you, she'll definitely make trouble."

Trouble?

This was outright sabotage.

"I'm going." Evelyn shoved the last shirt into her suitcase.

She'd promised to strike anyone who stole her Butterfly Brooch. If Isabella wanted her face rearranged, Evelyn would gladly oblige.

"Poor Bianca," Martha sighed. "Just returned from maternity leave for this role. She turned down so many projects."

"She didn't fight back?"

"How? Between Winwell Ventures and Kingsley Group, who'd dare cross them?" Martha scoffed. "Rumor says Isabella's releasing Bianca's 'scandal' tomorrow."

Evelyn smirked.

She knew these tactics all too well.

Hanging up, she turned off the lights.

Next morning, she wheeled her suitcase out with determined energy.

......

"Alex, please visit the set..." Isabella cooed over the phone. "I worked so hard for this role..."

Alexander Kingsley absently replied, "When did I agree?"

His gaze remained fixed on the apartment complex gates while extending a hand toward Nathan Carter for documents.

Nathan: "..."

No one multitasked like his boss—stalking an ex while humoring a fame-seeking actress and reviewing contracts simultaneously.

"You nodded last time!" Isabella persisted. "Just one hour—"

"Never happened." Alexander abruptly cut her off as a familiar figure emerged. "I'm hanging up."

"So you'll come—"

"No." His voice turned glacial. "Next call gets blocked."

Isabella immediately silenced.

"Don't bother me." His patience evaporated. Favors had limits.

His car screeched to halt before Evelyn.

She'd just hailed a cab when Alexander's vehicle blocked its path.

"Miss, step forward," the taxi driver urged. "A scratch would cost me a year's wages."

Evelyn shot Alexander a venomous glare before dragging her suitcase toward the cab.

Surprisingly, he didn't stop her.

Nathan peeked through the rearview mirror—his boss looked stunned.

Evelyn... had glared at him.

That fiery expression Alexander hadn't seen in years...

She wore a sprout green blouse tucked into jeans, the back fluttering like a summer breeze. That defiant look made her irresistibly vibrant.

Memories surfaced—their first meeting.

A little girl sat piecing together a puzzle in the corner, wiping tears between snaps.

"What's your name?" he'd asked.

She'd bristled like an angry sparrow. "I'm playing! No sharing!"

Alexander chuckled. "Does solving it get you candy?"

The child gaped. "You eat puzzles?" then muttered, "Weirdo..."

Even then, he'd thought—this spitfire needed taming.

After playing all afternoon, a boy's distant call—"Evelyn Sinclair!"—sent puzzle pieces flying.

"Julian!" She'd beamed, darting away without a backward glance.

Little ingrate from the start!

"Lord Alex..." Nathan cautiously extended documents as his boss's expression shifted.

"How many meetings today?" Alexander checked his watch. "Consolidate them—in-person and remote simultaneously."

Nathan: "?"

"Prioritize all pending paperwork."

Nathan: "Understood..."

Preparing for a trip?

"Trace Evelyn's destination. Book flights or arrange the jet."

Nathan: "!"

"Waiting?"

"On it." Nathan snapped to attention.

His boss frowned again.

Where was Evelyn going with that suitcase?

Field assignment?

She'd grown far too independent.

Without discipline, she'd revert to that runaway child...
###Chapter 82: You'll Beg Me on Your Knees, Isabella

Alexander Kingsley set down the file and tapped his fingers twice on the desk.

"Arrange the flight first."

Nathan Carter paused while organizing meeting materials, surprise flashing in his eyes.

"Understood. I'll handle it immediately."

He strode out of the office, inwardly stunned. Miss Sinclair's priority had just surpassed business arrangements for the first time...

At the airport terminal, Evelyn Sinclair pulled her luggage toward her colleagues.

"Evelyn!" Charlie Young waved with his camera. "Over here!"

Iris Cooper handed her a boarding pass. "All set. We land in two hours."

The plane touched down precisely in the city housing the film studios.

They headed straight to their hotel, freshened up briefly, then rushed to the set.

"Halt!" A crew member blocked the entrance. "Media? Which outlet?"

Iris frowned. "Horizon Media. We have a signed contract."

The crew member radioed for confirmation, then smirked. "Orange Media's already inside. Scram."

"What?" Charlie nearly jumped. "We have a binding agreement!"

Evelyn steadied her agitated colleague, voice calm. "Please contact the producer. We need verification."

She subtly shifted, giving Charlie a meaningful glance.

Seizing the cue, Charlie suddenly charged forward with his equipment.

"Stop them!" the crew member shouted.

Chaos erupted.

Evelyn slipped past into the filming area as enraged shouts followed her.

"Paparazzi vendors? Buy tickets next door!"

The insult ignited Iris's fury.

"Open your damn eyes!" She flashed her press badge. "Since when does Horizon stoop to paparazzi work?"

Evelyn shielded the camera, enunciating clearly: "Does The First Lady crew intend to breach contract? Horizon Legal stands ready."

The crew members exchanged glances before relenting. "Wait over there."

Under a nearby canopy, Isabella Winslow basked in her assistants' attention.

"Miss Sinclair," she drawled, "I only work with my regular team. Leave."

Evelyn met her gaze. "The production violated terms. Are you covering their penalties?"

"Gladly." Isabella smirked. "Name your price."

Martha Nash called immediately: "Get their signature and payment! Orange Media and Isabella will pay for this!"

The digital agreement was swiftly executed.

Isabella leaned close, whispering: "How does it feel being cast out by the Kingsleys? Soon Horizon will discard you too."

"Miss Winslow," Evelyn projected her voice, "you might soon beg me on your knees to return."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Isabella laughed shrilly. "Have you lost your mind, Evelyn Sinclair?"

An Orange reporter interjected: "Rumor says Mr. Kingsley sued you for eight million? When's the court date?"

"Correct." Evelyn acknowledged calmly. "I reported Mr. Kingsley and Miss Winslow's relationship. He insists he's single."

Isabella's face darkened. "That's a lie!"

"Didn't you confirm the relationship?" Evelyn countered. "What good is his denial?"

The crew exchanged knowing looks.

"Get out!" Isabella shrieked. "Security! Remove them!"

Iris sneered: "Don't come crawling back later!"

The trio departed with heads high as Isabella barked orders: "Transfer money to Evelyn immediately! Memo: 'Rights transfer'!"

She turned to the Orange reporter: "Announce Evelyn sold us the exclusive!"

An assistant came running. "Miss Winslow! Mr. Kingsley's at the studios! Heading this way!"

Isabella jumped up gleefully. "Quick! Touch up my makeup!"

Preening before a mirror, she smirked triumphantly.

Just wait, Evelyn. You'll see how Alexander dotes on me!
###Chapter 83: A Thousand Miles for Her

The entire film set held its breath.

Alexander Kingsley's arrival was like a silent storm, sweeping through every corner. The heir of Kingsley Group carried an aura that made everyone instinctively tread lighter.

"Lord Alex is here!" the assistant director whispered, hands trembling with excitement.

Isabella Winslow had secured this role over Bianca White through sheer financial backing. The weight of Kingsley Group far surpassed that of Winwell Ventures.

With Alexander's presence, the crew collectively exhaled in relief.

Earlier, when they'd expelled the Horizon Media reporter, they'd feared retaliation. Now, with this financial titan's support, even ten Horizon Media outlets couldn't touch them.

Alexander moved through the corridor flanked by security, his chiseled features unreadable. At 6'1", his aristocratic bearing made him impossible to miss.

Male actors silently thanked heaven this crown prince wasn't in their industry, while actresses envied Isabella's luck.

"Alex!" Isabella rushed forward, the perfect picture of demure delight, reaching for his arm.

He sidestepped her effortlessly.

"You're here?" His gaze barely grazed her.

The set went dead silent.

Isabella's smile froze. The crew exchanged uneasy glances.

"Of...of course I am." She recovered quickly, leaning closer with practiced intimacy. "How could I not greet you personally?"

The tension dissolved as everyone assumed—Lord Alex simply didn't want his fiancée inconvenienced. Such doting devotion was almost nauseating.

In the lounge, the producer presented tea with shaking hands. "Lord Alex, your presence honors us. May we know—"

"Just these people?" Alexander cut him off, scanning the room.

The producer blinked in confusion.

Nathan Carter cleared his throat. "Actually—"

He'd rather be drowning in paperwork at headquarters. His boss had clearly come for Evelyn Sinclair, yet refused to say it aloud.

For the first time, Nathan understood Ethan Miller's daily struggles. That tactless assistant would've already shouted Evelyn's name.

"The reporter?" Alexander suddenly demanded.

An Orange Media journalist stepped forward eagerly. "Are you calling me, Lord Alex?"

"You?" Alexander's gaze turned glacial. "Unworthy."

The room temperature seemed to plummet.

"Which outlet are you with?" Nathan's expression darkened as he scanned the room—no sign of Evelyn.

Three critical meetings canceled. A private jet mobilized. All for nothing.

Alexander's long fingers tapped the armrest. "Cancel this afternoon's launch ceremony."

He turned to Nathan. "What's this production company called?"

The producer's knees buckled.

The Kingsley Group could collapse national currencies without breaking stride. Alexander could crush them like ants.

But what had they possibly done to offend him?

Isabella's nails dug into her palms, drawing blood.

She refused to believe her suspicion—Alexander had come for Evelyn.

"Miss Winslow," the director pulled her aside, voice shaking, "what's happening? Did we make some mistake?"

Isabella tasted copper from biting her cheek.

She'd schemed relentlessly to steal this project from Bianca. Orange Media had already begun smearing Bianca's reputation. If this collapsed now...

She inhaled sharply, each word a blade to her heart. "Alex...might be here because of that Horizon reporter. You'd better...find her."
###Chapter 84: Lord Alex's Wrath

"What?!" The entire film crew erupted in chaos. The Orange Media reporter's eyes nearly popped out of her head.

Isabella Winslow forced a pained smile. "It's my fault... I told him Evelyn was coming to cover the shoot. He was furious and said he'd teach her a lesson..."

"Last time, Alexander demanded an apology from her. Not only did she refuse, but she insulted him too... You know how terrible his temper is."

Terrible? More like the devil incarnate!

"So Lord Alex came to settle scores with Evelyn, but took it out on us when she wasn't here?" The producer found the logic absurd.

What had they done to deserve this?

"Miss Winslow, you need to explain this to Lord Alex! Your team was the one who drove them away! This has nothing to do with us!"

Isabella looked troubled. "You've seen Alexander's temper... Even Eleanor couldn't calm him down..."

She turned to the Orange Media reporter. "Why don't you leave for now? Let's call Horizon's team back to handle this."

"Yes!" The group brightened.

"Let them take the hit!"

"Better them than us!"

"Hurry and call! They can't have gone far..."

The Horizon trio sat in a noodle shop near the studio.

"Evelyn, when are we heading back?" Charlie flipped through his phone.

"No rush." Evelyn Sinclair picked at her noodles leisurely. "Let's wait a bit longer."

"Wait for what?" Both colleagues asked in unison.

"Wait for Isabella to beg me." Her tone was as casual as discussing the weather.

Charlie and Iris exchanged glances.

"Do you have dirt on her?"

"Why before the opening ceremony?"

Evelyn smirked. "The thrill is in the timing. Imagine her kneeling to beg us back right before the auspicious moment..."

Her phone rang before she finished.

"Evelyn! We were wrong earlier! Please come back now!"

Evelyn paused.

That was faster than expected.

Two hours still remained before the ceremony.

She stirred her noodles calmly. "Sorry, we're already on our way to the airport."

The producer's voice trembled. "Name your terms! Just come back now!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

The crew must be in serious trouble.

"Let Isabella beg me in person."

"Dream on!" Isabella's shrill voice came through the phone.

Evelyn hung up.

The phone rang persistently.

"My noodles are getting soggy," she complained. "Thirty bucks a bowl..."

Charlie and Iris stared.

This woman had nerves of steel.

On the fourth call, Evelyn finally answered.

"What do you want?!" Isabella hissed through gritted teeth.

"With that attitude..." Evelyn pretended to hang up again.

"I'm begging you!" Isabella's voice shook. "Where are you?"

"Noodle shop, five hundred meters from the set." Evelyn was brisk. "You have five minutes. Bring pen and paper."

Five minutes later, two crew members came panting.

"Miss Winslow can't—"

Evelyn stood to leave.

The staff lunged to block her car.

Isabella had no choice but to appear.

"State your terms." Her face was ashen.

"First, Orange Media leaves." Evelyn's commanding presence stunned her colleagues.

"Second, Horizon gets exclusive promotional rights for The First Lady Judge. No refund on the penalty fee."

Gasps filled the air.

Isabella clenched her jaw. "Fine!"

"One more thing." Evelyn smiled. "Remember what I said? Kneel properly..."

Isabella went pale.

"Just kidding." Evelyn's tone shifted. "A simple apology will do."

"Sorry!" Isabella forced the word out.

"Sorry for what?" Evelyn prompted.

Isabella balled her fists. "For bringing my team to replace you."

Evelyn shook her head. "Wrong answer."

Isabella's pupils contracted.

"Need a hint?" Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "Wings. Needles..."

Isabella's face drained of color.

"Evelyn... It really wasn't me..." She suddenly burst into tears. "You can't force a confession..."

Evelyn studied her for a long moment before laughing lightly. "Then kneel."

The crowd erupted.

As Evelyn turned to leave, Isabella dropped to her knees. "I'm kneeling! Happy now?!"

Evelyn yanked her up. "Just testing you. Bring the contract."

Everyone stared.

What kind of grudge was this?

After signing, Evelyn gave Isabella a meaningful look.

Anyone who could humiliate themselves like this... was dangerous.

Back on set, Charlie and Iris gazed at her with admiration.

But the moment they entered the lounge, Evelyn wanted to flee.

The man radiating fury from the couch was none other than Alexander Kingsley.
###Chapter 85: Humble Longing - Just a Sip of Her Water

Alexander Kingsley's gaze was icy, locked onto Evelyn Sinclair like a dagger.

The reporter from Orange Media seized the opportunity to stir trouble. "If Horizon Media had arrived on time, we wouldn't have needed to step in as emergency replacements. We only did this out of respect for Miss Winslow..."

Though the words were directed at Nathan Carter, every syllable was meant for Alexander's ears.

"Is that so?" Evelyn's eyes brightened. "Then by all means, continue your heroic rescue. I'll take my leave."

She turned to walk away.

The room fell dead silent.

The audacity of this woman!

She'd taken the penalty fee without returning it, forced a contract renegotiation, and humiliated Isabella publicly. Now she thought she could casually dismiss everything with a flippant "I'll go"?

Did Evelyn have a heart of steel?

Such beauty, yet a soul more venomous than a serpent's!

"Stop." Alexander's voice cut through the air like frost.

His expression remained murderous, yet inexplicably, the tension in the room eased slightly.

"Come here," he commanded.

Evelyn stood rooted in place.

"Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex is speaking to you," Nathan forced a smile, suddenly finding Evelyn less objectionable than usual.

But before his grin fully formed, Alexander's dark glare silenced him. "What are you smiling at?"

Nathan's face stiffened instantly.

Why was Ethan Miller allowed to beam at Evelyn without consequence, while he got reprimanded for a mere hint of friendliness?

As if he'd ever dare entertain thoughts about Miss Sinclair!

Ahem— Evelyn cleared her throat, deliberately ignoring Alexander. "Producer, shall we begin the opening ceremony?"

The producer blinked in confusion. "Ah? Yes—wait, no..."

This wasn't the script he'd anticipated. Wasn't Alexander here to confront Evelyn? Why did the atmosphere feel... off?

"I said come here. Are you deaf?" Alexander's tone dropped another degree colder.

Every pair of eyes in the room screamed at Evelyn: Go to him!

That was Alexander Kingsley!

Did she have a death wish? Don't drag us down with you!

"Editor-in-chief..." Iris Cooper looked ready to cry.

This was the living legend of global finance—the prodigy who'd conquered Wall Street by twenty-seven!

She'd assumed he was just another spoiled heir, but seeing him in person revealed the chasm between their worlds. How could Evelyn remain so composed?

With a sigh, Evelyn finally walked over under the weight of everyone's stares. "What can I do for you, Mr. Kingsley?"

Wasn't that polite enough?

Alexander averted his eyes. "Pour me water."

Evelyn: "..."

Too tired to argue, she turned toward the water dispenser to find a cup.

The sound of rummaging pierced the quiet lounge.

"Where are the paper cups? Don't you have disposable ones?" she muttered under her breath.

The entire room watched her with bated breath.

Isabella finally snapped. "Alex never drinks from water dispensers. He only takes Prehistoric Spring or Vienn."

"Oh?" Evelyn shot Alexander a meaningful look. "How refined of Lord Alex. My apologies—we common folk aren't familiar with such luxuries. Since Miss Winslow knows so well, perhaps she should fetch it?"

She genuinely hadn't known.

At Royal Gardens, Alexander only drank water she poured—left at his bedside and desk, meticulously measured to the perfect temperature for his stomach.

Back then, a single sip from him could make her day.

Only now did she realize how worthless her efforts had been in his eyes.

Hundred-dollar bottled water was his norm—an intimate detail of his life with Isabella she'd never been privy to.

"Where's your water?" Alexander demanded impatiently.

He hated the look in Evelyn's eyes now.

How could she sever their past so cleanly, as if all her tenderness had been a lie?
###Chapter 86: Enjoy Your Drink, Mr. Kingsley

Evelyn Sinclair had just picked up a paper cup when Alexander Kingsley spoke coldly, "You actually believe Isabella Winslow's words?"

Her fingers froze mid-air.

Isabella's face turned deathly pale.

It was common knowledge that Alexander never drank from cups handed to him in public.

Yet now, he was asking Evelyn to pour him water?

Evelyn calmly filled the cup with cold water and handed it to him. "Here you go, Mr. Kingsley."

The room held its breath.

Alexander's slender fingers grasped the cup, but he paused before drinking. Instead, he poured the water into the trash.

"Too cold," he said flatly.

The tension in the room eased.

This was more like the Alexander they knew.

Nathan Carter, however, broke into a cold sweat.

The current Evelyn was no longer the meek lamb she once was.

He hurried to smooth things over. "Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex prefers lukewarm water."

Evelyn scoffed and refilled the same cup.

The paper cup had softened, its edges slightly warped.

This time, Alexander didn't even touch it. He crushed it and tossed it aside.

"No lemon."

He remembered clearly—every morning, there used to be a glass of lukewarm water with a lemon slice by his bedside.

That had been Evelyn's habit.

For him to mention it now was already a major concession.

Evelyn stared at him as if he were insane. "Where am I supposed to find lemons now?"

She checked her watch. "If you're done here, I need to attend the premiere ceremony."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "You think that's still happening?"

The temperature in the lounge seemed to drop instantly.

"What exactly do you want, Mr. Kingsley?" Evelyn snapped. "Does Kingsley Group's legal team need you personally to harass me?"

Nathan quickly intervened. "Miss Sinclair, there's a juice bar down the street—"

"Fine, I'll check." Evelyn suddenly relented. "But no promises."

As she turned to leave, she paused. "Who's paying for the lemons?"

Her pockets were practically empty these days.

Alexander toyed with his phone. "Deduct it from your debt."

"That eight million hasn't even gone to court yet!"

"Forgot about the printing press incident?" Alexander arched a brow. "One month's salary."

Evelyn fell silent.

Money was the last thing she wanted to discuss.

Nathan slipped her a credit card as they left. "Use this, Miss Sinclair."

Luck was on their side—a lemon delivery had just arrived at the juice bar.

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "I'll take the entire shipment!"

Nathan nearly bit his tongue.

Trembling, he texted Alexander: [Miss Sinclair bought a lot of lemons.]

Alexander replied: [Good.]

Nathan decided not to disclose the actual quantity of the mountain of lemons now piled before them.

Evelyn rented a juicer and began squeezing furiously.

An hour later, she and Nathan returned to the lounge carrying two massive buckets of lemon water.

With a thud, she set them before Alexander.

Evelyn grabbed a porcelain cup, filled it to the brim, and handed it to him with a sweet smile.

"Enjoy your drink, Mr. Kingsley." She beamed. "This is all specially prepared for you."

The two buckets of lemon water shimmered under the lights, their golden hue almost blinding.

Alexander's expression turned sourer than the lemons themselves.
###Chapter 87: A Sour Revenge

The glass refracted cold light under the lamps.

Alexander Kingsley's gaze lingered on the rim, where a single drop of water still glistened.

The crisp scent of lemon hung in the air.

He raised the glass, pressing the rim to his thin lips.

"Lord Alex—" Nathan Carter's protest died in his throat.

Alexander had already swallowed the first sip.

An eerie silence fell over the lounge.

The producer kept checking his watch. Fifteen minutes until the premiere ceremony.

Every eye was fixed on those slender, aristocratic fingers.

Evelyn Sinclair smiled faintly. "How does it taste?"

Alexander's Adam's apple bobbed.

Then he tilted his head back and drained the entire glass of pure lemon juice.

Nathan's eyes widened.

That was undiluted citrus—acidic enough to make grown men weep.

"Passable." Alexander set the glass down with a sharp clink.

The producer nearly dropped to his knees in relief.

"The ceremony—" he ventured cautiously.

Alexander pointed to two large containers in the corner. "One glass each. Then we go."

Staff scrambled to distribute paper cups.

The producer was first in line, taking a hearty gulp.

"Pfft—"

Sour liquid sprayed across the floor.

Alexander sidestepped the mess with a frown. "Not to your liking?"

"D-delicious..." The producer forced down the remainder with tears in his eyes.

Others exchanged uneasy glances before raising their cups.

"Gack—"

"Dear God..."

Gagging sounds echoed through the room.

Isabella Winslow pinched her nose, batting tearful lashes. "Alex, could I possibly—"

"Certainly." Alexander cut her off. "Then you needn't attend the ceremony either."

Her face went sheet-white. Gulping it down while holding her nose, she shot Evelyn a venomous glare—only to find the other woman standing composed, completely unaffected.

......

At the premiere venue, reporters murmured behind raised cameras.

"Why are all the leads massaging their jaws?"

"Their voices keep trembling..."

"Is that...lemon I smell?"

From the fan section came shrieks: "Even his frown is devastatingly handsome!"

......

Only two remained in the lounge.

Evelyn turned to leave when her wrist was seized in a vice grip.

The world spun as she was pinned against the wall.

Cold lips crashed onto hers.

Sour liquid flooded her mouth, making her choke.

Alexander cradled the back of her head, feeding her the lemon juice drop by torturous drop.

Evelyn's eyes watered from the acidity.

Suddenly she rose on tiptoe, twisting the tables as she tangled her tongue with his.

Alexander's pupils contracted sharply.

She stole back every last drop.

When they broke apart, Evelyn gasped for air, the corners of her eyes flushed pink.

"Are you insane?" Her voice shook.

Alexander stared at her glistening lips.

A single bead of juice still clung there.

He swiped it away with his thumb, grazing the soft curve of her mouth.

The beast inside him roared.

He wanted to devour her whole. Now.
###Chapter 88: He Only Wants to Reconcile

Alexander Kingsley's palm pressed firmly against Evelyn Sinclair's slender waist.

He released his grip on her arm.

His fingertips trailed upward slowly.

Finally settling on her full lips.

Evelyn's naturally rosy lips now glistened like honeyed crystal.

His thumb traced the curve of her mouth.

As if appraising a priceless treasure.

How strange...

The lemon water had been unbearably sour.

Yet his fingers carried the sweetness of her lips.

That lingering sweetness tempted him for more.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock, her pearly teeth barely visible.

Alexander's finger seized the chance to slip inside—

She snapped her teeth shut, nearly biting him.

Her fumbling hand found the doorknob. She shoved hard.

Then fled through the doorway.

The door slammed shut with a resounding bang.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Nathan Carter hurried forward.

Evelyn strode away without looking back.

Nathan hesitated, glancing at the closed lounge door.

Oddly, Alexander didn't give chase.

Summoning courage, Nathan pursued Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair!" He intercepted her at the corridor's turn. "You've misunderstood Lord Alex."

Evelyn halted, her voice icy. "Misunderstood what?"

"Lord Alex only wishes to reconcile with you."

Those words unlocked a floodgate of memories.

For seven years, she'd heard variations of this refrain.

[Alexander cares for you]
[He struggles with expressing himself]
[You should be more understanding]

The Kingsley household had fed her these sugar-coated lies.

Only to whisper behind her back later.

Calling her delusional.

Declaring Isabella Winslow as the true Kingsley bride.

Those sweet nothings were poison wrapped in velvet.

Now that she'd finally broken free—

Someone dared suggest she return?

"Assistant Carter," Evelyn scoffed, "do you know what he's done to me?"

That relationship had been wrong from the start.

His emotional neglect had plunged her into darkness.

He'd even allowed Isabella to steal her cherished butterfly brooch—

Her last tangible connection to the past.

"Ms. Sinclair, Lord Alex canceled three critical meetings today."

Nathan spoke urgently.

"He never drinks from strangers, yet he accepted your lemon water."

Evelyn's lips curled in derision.

Had he not forced that final sip down her throat—

She might have believed this performance.

"He has his pride. I have my boundaries."

She turned to leave.

"Ms. Sinclair! That water was truly sour—"

"Nathan." Alexander's frigid voice cut through the air.

Nathan immediately fell silent.

Evelyn seized the moment to quicken her exit.

"What did you tell her?" Alexander's eyes narrowed.

He'd only caught the tail end.

Nathan swallowed hard. "I mentioned the lemon water's sourness."

"You didn't drink it. How would you know?"

Alexander's gaze turned razor-sharp.

"I..."

"How many more secrets are you keeping?"

Nathan's back prickled with cold sweat.

But Alexander pressed no further.

"Let's go."

"Returning to the office, sir?"

Alexander shot him a withering look.

Nathan flushed with embarrassment.

"The premiere banquet is tonight."

With that, Alexander strode away.

Nathan stood frozen.

Since when did workaholic Alexander Kingsley prioritize social events?

"To the premiere venue."

The cool command floated back.

Nathan suppressed an eye roll.

They both knew this detour was about Evelyn.
###Chapter 89: A Jealous Heart, Evelyn Stuns the Crowd

Horizon Media, as the official partner of The First Lady Judge, had their three-person team working nonstop at the premiere ceremony.

Evelyn Sinclair was reviewing interview materials with Iris Cooper, their heads bent close in quiet discussion. Her slender fingers tapped lightly on the notebook, occasionally circling key points with focused gentleness.

When Alexander Kingsley entered the set, his gaze was instantly drawn to the scene.

He'd never seen Evelyn like this—professional, capable, radiating quiet confidence. The sprout green blouse made her skin glow like porcelain, her casually pinned-up hair catching the sunlight.

An unfamiliar emotion stirred in his chest.

He couldn't remember the last time he'd truly looked at her.

In his memory, Evelyn was always the unwanted burden the Kingsley family had to tolerate. He despised her innate pride, how effortlessly she commanded attention.

A sudden commotion broke out.

Several paparazzi vendors were discreetly aiming their lenses at Evelyn, whispering among themselves. Alexander's expression darkened. "Nathan," he ordered coldly, "identify those men. Make sure all photos are deleted before they leave."

She was still attracting trouble like always.

In high school, her desk drawer overflowed with love letters. At university, admirers lit candle displays beneath her dorm. He remembered picking her up at Imperial Media University once, overhearing boys say, "With a face like Evelyn Sinclair's, you could pass exams just by showing up."

Those looks, those tones—he knew them too well.

What infuriated him most were the rumors about Evelyn and Julian Ashford. If she was truly as demure as she appeared, why so much gossip?

Alexander narrowed his eyes.

Since she insisted on leaving the Kingsley household, he'd personally drag her back on track.

After the ceremony, Isabella Winslow raged alone in the dressing room.

"Now even nobodies dare overshadow me?" She swept cosmetics off the vanity, hissing at her manager, "Contact Orange Media immediately. Leak those fabricated scandals about Evelyn colluding with rivals!"

The whispers outside stabbed at her:

"Isabella's nothing special in person—all hype."
"That reporter outshone her completely."
"Mr. Kingsley was definitely here for the journalist..."

The petty comments from minor cast members ignited her fury.

The premiere banquet was held at a five-star hotel.

Evelyn changed into a yellow floral sundress, still barefaced yet eclipsing every meticulously styled actress present. Sitting with colleagues in the staff section, she drew constant curious glances.

Midway through the event, the producer personally came to toast.

"Ms. Sinclair, you saved us today." The seasoned producer smiled knowingly. He'd noticed Alexander's particular interest in this journalist. Isabella? Merely a publicity prop.

As Evelyn politely declined alcohol, the banquet hall abruptly quieted.

"Alex!" Isabella's saccharine voice pierced the silence.
###Chapter 90: His Eyes Were Only for Evelyn

Isabella Winslow rushed toward Alexander Kingsley in her high heels, arms outstretched.

Nathan Carter swiftly stepped between them.

"Miss Winslow," he said with a professional smile, "mind the setting."

Isabella's grin froze. She looked up at Alexander, only to find his gaze already fixed on Evelyn Sinclair across the room.

Evelyn raised her glass of juice, smiling politely at the producer. "I'm allergic to alcohol. This will do."

Beads of sweat formed on the producer's forehead. Alexander's piercing stare carried an unspoken warning.

"Alex," Isabella tugged at his sleeve, undeterred, "I saved you a seat—"

Alexander shook her off, his attention never leaving Evelyn.

Only after watching Evelyn finish her drink did he finally turn to Isabella. "What did you say?"

The restaurant fell silent. Isabella's face burned as if she'd been publicly slapped.

"Add a seat," Alexander ordered Nathan.

Isabella clenched her fists. The muffled giggles of the supporting actresses felt like needles in her ears.

Just then, Evelyn's phone rang.

"Evelyn! Emergency!" Martha Nash's voice crackled through the receiver. "Orange Media claims you took their money!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Legal reviewed my contract with them."

"They transferred funds to your sister's medical account!" Martha hissed. "The exact amount of the penalty fee!"

Evelyn's eyes turned icy. She checked that account nightly—except tonight.

"Martha," she said calmly, "Orange Media will issue a public apology tomorrow."

Hanging up, Evelyn turned to leave.

"Miss Sinclair," Isabella blocked her path, malice glinting in her eyes, "trouble at work?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "You'll find out soon enough, Miss Winslow."

Before Isabella could react, Alexander was already striding after Evelyn.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" His voice echoed down the hallway.
###Chapter 91: Lord Alex, You Really Need to Apologize This Time

Evelyn Sinclair paused mid-step and turned to face Alexander Kingsley.

The hotel corridor lights etched his sharp profile against the glittering cityscape beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"I'll find out who's behind this."

Alexander's voice sliced through the tension like a blade.

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

Did he think she was broke? That she'd beg Mrs. Kingsley for money or flirt with Julian Ashford?

Typical Alexander—always judging others through his privileged lens.

"Don't bother," she began.

"Don't you realize you don't belong in this world?" Alexander cut her off.

The faint warmth in Evelyn's chest turned to ice.

"What do you mean?"

"Look at all the trouble you've caused since leaving the Kingsleys." His gaze held the condescension of an adult scolding a child. "Is this really the life you wanted?"

Evelyn couldn't believe her ears.

In one month, she'd written viral exposés, interviewed notoriously difficult legends, earned promotions—

And he called these achievements "trouble"?

"You're absolutely right, Mr. Kingsley." Her laugh was bitter. "Someone like me isn't worth your concern. Please don't trouble yourself with my insignificant existence."

She turned sharply, her heels sinking into the plush carpet with muted thuds.

......

"What the hell is she so upset about?" Alexander stood before the panoramic windows, his voice arctic.

Nathan Carter wiped his damp forehead. Having witnessed the entire exchange, he'd wanted to vanish through the floor.

"Lord Alex... women sometimes need... gentle words..."

Alexander's glare could freeze lava.

Nathan swallowed hard. "Just... humble yourself a little? Say something nice?"

The murderous look confirmed: Not happening.

The doorbell rang like divine intervention.

Nathan practically sprinted to answer it.

A stranger stood outside—"Are you Mr. Carter? Ms. Sinclair sent me to fetch Lord Alex..."

Alexander was already at the door.

"Ms. Sinclair got suspended from Horizon Media. Bribery allegations. She's... crying in her room and asked for Lord Alex..."

"Where?" Alexander interrupted.

"Suite 2108..."

Nathan opened his mouth to ask details, but Alexander was already striding down the hall. "Stay."

Nathan wanted to cry. He never should've opened his big mouth.

......

The unfamiliar girl led Alexander to a suite.

The door opened—revealing not Evelyn, but Isabella Winslow in a silk negligee.

"Alex..."

......

"Julian, really, there's no need." Evelyn checked the room number while balancing her phone.

"I'll handle the company investigation."

Julian's worry vibrated through the line. "I know you can. But I..."

He needed to see her.

Since Evelyn's business trip, Julian had been distracted—his gaze constantly drifting to her empty chair during meetings.

He'd once believed he could quit this addiction.

Their reunion proved Evelyn Sinclair was his forever craving.

"Orange Media will issue a public apology by tomorrow," Evelyn said firmly. "Don't worry."

Hanging up, she knocked on the designated door.

"Ms. Winslow has been waiting." The agent's glare could curdle milk.

The suite was frigid.

Isabella sat wrapped in a coat, face twisted with fury.

"What do you want?" she hissed. "Me to give up Alexander?"

Evelyn actually chuckled.

"Is men all you ever think about, Ms. Winslow?"

"Stop pretending!" Isabella sprang up. "I know exactly what trash you are!"

"Then we're done here." Evelyn turned to leave.

"Wait!" Panic cracked Isabella's voice. "Name your terms!"

"Orange Media's front-page apology by morning."

"Fine! But delete that video!"

Evelyn simply stared.

Isabella deflated. "That money... consider it hush payment..."

As Evelyn exited, shattering objects and screams followed:

"That bitch! I was so close!"

Her grip tightened around her phone.

She'd held onto Ryan Holt's damning video of Isabella for precisely this moment.

......

"Evelyn! Wake up!"

Dawn barely tinted the sky when Iris Cooper shook her awake.

"Horizon sent investigators! They're here about the bribery allegations!"

The door burst open before Evelyn could rise. Iris gasped—

"You—"
###Chapter 92: A Man in Evelyn's Room

"What's wrong?" Evelyn Sinclair's voice carried sleepiness as she fumbled for the comb on her nightstand. Her long hair cascaded over her shoulders.

Iris Cooper stood frozen at the doorway, her face pale and lips trembling. The usually articulate reporter now resembled a wooden puppet.

"It's... it's..."

"Who is it?" Evelyn combed her hair while walking forward. What kind of monster had Horizon Media sent to terrify Iris like this?

Iris mechanically stepped aside.

The comb snagged in Evelyn's hair.

Alexander Kingsley strode in with measured steps.

His gaze swept between the two beds before locking onto Evelyn's.

She slept quietly.

The bedding remained nearly undisturbed, the blanket neatly folded.

Seeing Alexander scrutinize her bed, Evelyn swallowed hard.

Was he going to...?

Alexander suddenly settled into the armchair by the window.

"You have three minutes." His cold eyes lifted. "Horizon's people are arriving. Beg me, and I'll handle this."

Iris crept behind Evelyn, eyes wide.

What shocked her wasn't Alexander's appearance, but Evelyn's composure.

"Unnecessary." Evelyn's voice stayed calm. "Mr. Kingsley, if I recall correctly, we'll meet in court next month."

Alexander cut her off. "Forget the lawsuit. Without this job, how will you repay your debts?"

"Miss Sinclair," he deliberately maintained distance, "from half a month's salary to a full month's—how long will you keep dodging?"

"And if I owe you another favor, how would I repay it?" The words escaped before Evelyn could stop them.

Alexander's eyes darkened.

The unspoken answer hung between them.

She turned away, confusion swirling.

With Isabella Winslow in his life, why provoke her?

To humiliate? Or because she seemed an easy target?

"I appreciate your kindness, Mr. Kingsley. I'll repay every cent—even if I have to sell blood."

Alexander sneered. "Sell blood..."

Knocking interrupted them.

"Is Evelyn Sinclair here?"

A middle-aged man entered first, trailed by a group.

Melissa Lee stood among them.

"Why ignore messages after waking?" Melissa demanded.

Evelyn's phone remained on the nightstand—and work hours hadn't begun.

Melissa's team had clearly rushed overnight to avoid Julian Ashford.

This was an ambush.

"We planned to use the conference room, but since you're unresponsive, we'll settle this here." Melissa's tone turned aggressive. "What's your deal with Orange Media?"

"Orange Media fabricated bribery claims after losing the bid." Evelyn remained direct.

Melissa smirked. "Then why do we have their payment records? Timed right after the crew's compensation?"

"You're quite close with Orange Media." Evelyn's implication hung heavy.

Melissa's expression twisted. "Stop deflecting!"

"I know nothing about this." Evelyn shrugged. "If Orange Media's word is proof, should I transfer money to you tomorrow and accuse you too?"

"Evelyn!" the middle-aged man barked. "Answer the question!"

"I repeat—no bribes." Evelyn's voice turned steely. "Orange Media lied."

"Then prove it!" Melissa pressed. "We didn't travel all this way for excuses."

Evelyn suddenly smiled.

"The burden of proof..."

"...lies with the accuser." An icy male voice came from the window. "Horizon excels at internal warfare."

All eyes turned toward the silhouette backlit by sunlight.

Melissa's eyes gleamed. "Who are you? Why are you in our employee's room at dawn?"

Divine intervention!

This man must share an intimate connection with Evelyn.

With so many witnesses, let's see if Julian still wants her!

"This is Horizon business. Outsiders leave!" The middle-aged man puffed up.

Iris began trembling again.

Disaster. These fools dared shout at Alexander Kingsley...

Melissa stepped forward eagerly. "Leave immediately! Identify yourself!"

She'd expose this man to Julian.

Tear off Evelyn's mask!

"My identity?" Alexander chuckled.

Ants daring to bark at him?

"I fear the truth would crush you."
###Chapter 93: Alexander's Deterrence

Melissa Lee's fingers trembled.

Her pupils constricted sharply as she stared at the phone screen.

"This can't be..." she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Alexander Kingsley remained seated by the window, sunlight casting shadows across his chiseled profile.

"Director Lee," he drawled with faint amusement, "your intelligence seems inadequate."

The air in the room turned viscous.

Everyone held their breath.

Melissa's assistant crept closer, glanced at her phone, and turned ashen.

"Orange Media issued a statement..." the assistant murmured, "...admitting the allegations against Horizon reporter Evelyn Sinclair were malicious fabrications by internal personnel..."

Melissa's head snapped toward the bathroom.

The shower still ran.

Evelyn had known all along!

"Impossible!" Melissa shrieked, composure shattered. "Orange would never—"

"Why wouldn't they?" Alexander adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness. "You seemed so certain of Miss Sinclair's guilt."

Cold sweat trickled down Melissa's spine.

The trap snapped shut around her.

"Lord Alex," she forced calm into her voice, "this is our company's internal—"

"Is it?" Alexander rose, his towering frame radiating menace. "Then why did Orange approach me for testimony?"

The words struck like a sledgehammer.

Melissa's knees buckled.

"T-testimony?"

Alexander strode toward the bathroom, voice glacial. "Evelyn Sinclair was with me that night."

Dead silence engulfed the room.

The shower stopped.

The door cracked open, revealing Evelyn's damp face. "You're still here?"

Her gaze swept over the pallid faces before settling on Alexander.

"What did you tell them?"

His lips curved. "The truth."

Melissa's phone vibrated again.

Her father's caller ID flashed.

She answered with shaking fingers. "What have you done?" roared through the speaker. "Julian Ashford secured board authorization to investigate this frame-up!"

Melissa's lips lost all color.

"Dad, I—"

"Get back here now!" The line went dead.

Evelyn emerged, towel-drying her hair. "Still need my cooperation, Director Lee?"

Melissa's nails bit into her palms.

Her glare shifted between Evelyn and Alexander—sudden understanding dawning.

"You two—"

Alexander's icy glance silenced her.

"Let's go." She spun on her heel, her investigative team scrambling after her.

The door clicked shut.

Evelyn exhaled.

"Thank you," she said.

Alexander caged her against the wall, his body inches away.

"That's all?" His gaze burned into hers.

The faint scent of ambergris made her pulse spike.

"That night..." His voice dropped. "You truly don't remember?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered.

She remembered.

The rainy night Alexander rescued her from reporters. The private club. The alcohol...

"I remember vomiting on your suit," she deflected.

His eyes darkened.

"Evelyn." He gripped her chin. "You owe me far more than a ruined jacket."

Sunlight streamed through the window, tangling their shadows.

Meanwhile, Horizon Media's headquarters erupted in chaos.

Julian Ashford stood before floor-to-ceiling windows, staring at his phone's breaking news alert:

[Exclusive: Kingsley Group's Alexander Kingsley Breaks Silence on Relationship with Horizon Reporter]
###Chapter 94: Crushing Her for Evelyn's Sake

Melissa Lee's fingers trembled on her phone screen.

She couldn't believe the headline: [Orange Media Official Statement: Horizon Reporter Innocent, Our Journalist Misreported]

The top trending topic stung even more: [Orange Media Issues Public Apology to Horizon Reporter Evelyn Sinclair]

...

Evelyn pushed open the bathroom door, water droplets still clinging to her hair.

"Still here?" She tilted her head, twirling a damp lock around her finger. "Reached a verdict yet? How will you punish me?"

The room fell silent.

Melissa wished she could vanish.

In the time it took her to read the headlines, Evelyn had already freshened up and stood before them.

"Evelyn..." Iris timidly tugged her sleeve. "The news is out."

Evelyn's lips curved. "What does it say?"

Iris hesitated, then found courage in Evelyn's calm smile.

"Orange admitted to spreading lies! Said their reporter mistook settlement money for bribes. They fired the journalist and issued a public apology!"

Evelyn leisurely tied up her hair. "What about those bank transfer records?"

"Fake!" Iris chirped. "Anyone can Photoshop these days. Lies spread faster than truth!"

Evelyn turned to Melissa, her smile serene.

"Speaking of difficulty... perhaps our overnight investigation team could weigh in?"

Red-eye flights must be exhausting.

Melissa turned pale and spun toward the exit.

"Safe travels, superiors," Evelyn's voice floated after them. "Watch your step."

Melissa whirled around. "Evelyn Sinclair! Don't push your luck!"

"Supervisor Lee." Evelyn's smile vanished. "The guilty party is obvious. Why take it out on me?"

"What are you implying?"

"Orange decided to apologize last night." Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Yet no one told you? Some partnership."

Melissa's face contorted. "Slander! I have no ties to Orange!"

"My mistake." Evelyn inclined her head. "Let me rephrase—Miss Winslow knew about the apology last night. Yet she let you make this pointless trip. Some best friend."

Melissa's breathing turned ragged. "Lies!"

She stormed out, but Evelyn's voice followed: "If I'm wrong, I'll apologize properly."

The investigators exchanged knowing looks.

Melissa's back prickled with discomfort.

She suddenly stopped, a cold smile twisting her lips.

So Evelyn's ambitions extended beyond Julian Ashford—to Alexander Kingsley?

Challenging Isabella Winslow for a man?

Melissa nearly laughed aloud.

A nobody like Evelyn?

Her phone rang. A middle-aged colleague handed it over. "Supervisor Lee, Editor-in-Chief Ashford is calling."

Julian's voice cut like ice: "Melissa Lee, why did you rush to the film set overnight?"

"Trying to act first, report later?"

"Find anything?"

His final sentence shattered her: "Save yourself some dignity."

The phone clattered to the floor again.

Melissa trembled violently.

For Evelyn, Julian would go this far?

...

"Evelyn, you knew this would happen, didn't you?" Iris gazed at her in awe. "No wonder you slept so well last night—"

"Out." Alexander's voice sliced through the room.

Iris scurried away, carefully shutting the door behind her.

Alexander advanced on Evelyn. "Isabella did this?"

Evelyn grabbed her jacket, heading back toward the bathroom. "I didn't say that."

Alexander blocked the door. "What leverage made her apologize?"

"Show me." His tone brooked no argument.
###Chapter 95: Her Own Vengeance, Men Keep Out

Evelyn took a step back.

She needed this distance to see Alexander clearly.

His chiseled features remained as striking as ever, the cold arrogance in his brow unchanged.

Yet now, he felt like a stranger who chilled her to the bone.

"Where's the proof?" His demand came effortlessly, as if she owed him blind obedience.

Evelyn turned toward the mirror.

"There isn't any." Her tone was light. "I bluffed Melissa."

How many times had she brought evidence to him, only to be met with that icy dismissal—"Stop making trouble"?

In his eyes, Isabella would always be the untouchable first love.

While Evelyn remained the ridiculous clown throwing tantrums.

Now he wanted answers?

Too late.

......

"Then why would she believe you without proof?" Alexander pressed.

Evelyn picked up an eyebrow pencil, twirling it between her fingers.

"Some things in this world don't need proof." Just like his judgment of her all those years ago.

"Give me the evidence." His voice darkened.

The pencil clattered onto the vanity.

"Afraid I'll harm your precious Isabella?" Evelyn's laugh was sharp. "Relax. She's far smarter than you think."

She retrieved the pencil, carefully reshaping her brows into sharp, defiant arches.

"Evelyn." Alexander's tone softened unexpectedly. "You've misunderstood."

She continued lining her eyes, refusing to spare him a glance.

"I can't jump to conclusions without proof," he said, an uncharacteristic attempt at explanation. "But I know you're not that kind of person—"

"What kind?" Evelyn's eyeliner flicked upward. "Not the money-grubbing Sinclair girl? Not the cheap whore who'd sell out for scraps?"

Every word had once left his lips.

Alexander's expression twisted. "Must you always be so crude?"

"I told you—no evidence." She selected a lipstick. "Just suspicions. A bluff."

She remembered standing before him with surveillance footage, the ultimatum he'd given her.

Apologize, or leave.

That day, the light named Alexander Kingsley had died in her heart forever.

Her vengeance was hers alone.

Men?

They could rot.

Alexander's gaze deepened.

The Evelyn before him—sharp-eyed, crimson-lipped—bore no resemblance to the docile girl from his memories.

He seized her wrist.

"Let go." Her voice was glacial.

"Grandfather's birthday banquet—" She finally met his eyes, her gaze cutting like steel. "Want my cooperation? Release me."

Alexander shoved her away violently.

As if touching something contaminated.

"Remember your promise," he spat through clenched teeth.
###Chapter 96: Crimson Storm

"Remember your words!"

He flung the statement over his shoulder before striding out, slamming the door behind him with enough force to rattle the frame.

......

Alexander Kingsley returned to the presidential suite seething with barely contained fury.

There was a time when his grandfather's birthday banquet had been his leverage against her.

Now the tables had turned—she'd mastered his own tactics and wielded them against him.

She was the one who insisted on the breakup. She was the one who disregarded the old man's fragile health.

Yet here he was, practically begging her not to cause a scene at the celebration.

"Nathan!"

His bark made the assistant jump. "Y-yes, Lord Alex?"

The glacial glare Alexander leveled at him could've flash-frozen the Mediterranean. Nathan's knees nearly buckled.

"How does one appease a woman?"

Nathan blinked. "...Pardon?"

Had he hallucinated that question?

Alexander's expression darkened. "Must I repeat myself?"

"N-no! It's... actually quite simple..." Nathan suddenly missed Ethan Miller with painful intensity. He'd never mock the man's survival skills again.

"Women adore romance. Flowers, candlelit dinners, jewelry... but sweet words matter most." He racked his brain for dating advice from his nonexistent love life.

"Such as?"

Nathan swallowed. "Well..."

How was he supposed to articulate this?

"How many relationships have you had?"

"That's..."

"Zero?"

Nathan winced.

"Then where," Alexander enunciated each syllable like a death sentence, "did you acquire this expertise?"

The assistant nearly wept.

This was outright bullying! He'd answered honestly, only to get skewered for his lack of experience. Since when was being single a crime?

Not everyone was born with a diamond spoon in their mouth and a stunning childhood sweetheart. Honestly, if even Alexander with all his advantages had driven Evelyn Sinclair to despair...

Nathan shook his head internally.

With one-tenth of Alexander's resources, he could've had women swooning in droves. Yet this man had somehow managed to end up alone.

But who was he to judge the boss? Some people just won the genetic lottery.

"Order roses." Alexander's abrupt command snapped him back. "Every available stem in the city."

Nathan hesitated. "There are... numerous varieties, Lord Alex."

"Which mends broken trust?"

"C-crimson Roses!" Nathan wanted to scream from the nearest rooftop. He held an Ivy League degree, for heaven's sake! Since when did his job require expertise in floral symbolism?

......

Evelyn Sinclair was reviewing promo materials with her assistant on set.

"These documents stay under lock and key." She tapped the sealed folder. "No leaks whatsoever."

Horizon Media would handle the three-month publicity campaign for the First Lady production.

Iris Cooper nodded vigorously when a commotion erupted near the entrance.

"Miss Evelyn Sinclair?"

Every head swiveled toward the unfamiliar voice.

"That's me." Evelyn approached the flushed courier.

"Delivery for you—twenty truckloads of Crimson Roses requiring signature!"

The entire crew gasped.

Hollywood had seen extravagant gestures, but twenty eighteen-wheelers overflowing with blooms now gridlocked the studio's main thoroughfare.

A scarlet river cascaded from each truck bed, smothering the pavement in opulent excess. The sheer decadence left onlookers speechless.

The entire film lot buzzed with the spectacle.

"Who has that kind of money?"

"Rumor says someone bought out the nation's rose supply today!"

"Crimson Roses are cliché, but twenty trucks? That's next-level audacity."

"What woman warrants this? Which A-lister is it for?"

"Maybe that Kingsley heiress..."

Gossip spread faster than wildfire through every soundstage.

"There must be a mistake." Evelyn stared at the floral avalanche.

Who would send her roses?

Alexander?

Preposterous!

In all their years, he'd gifted everything except flowers. The closest thing being that lost sunflower hairpin from childhood.

She remembered Valentine's Day at thirteen, sidewalks crammed with couples clutching rose bouquets.

"Did you get me flowers, Alex?" she'd asked eagerly when he came to pick her up.

"Children don't need roses," he'd dismissed without hesitation.

Seeing her crushed expression, he'd relented slightly. "Ask again at eighteen."

So she'd waited.

And on her eighteenth birthday, when she'd mustered the courage—

[You think you deserve them?]
###Chapter 97: Joining Forces to Push Her into the Abyss

"Ms. Winslow, we've confirmed it..." The agent's voice trembled as she delivered the news. "Those flowers were sent by Mr. Alexander Kingsley."

Isabella Winslow dug her manicured nails into her palms, nearly snapping them in half.

"How shameless of him to do this after the breakup!" she spat through gritted teeth, venom dripping from her eyes.

The entire crew of The First Lady knew exactly who those extravagant roses were for. The producer's attitude had done a complete turnaround, and even the director began smiling at Evelyn Sinclair.

Shutting down entire logistics chains to transport roses at any cost wasn't something an ordinary person could pull off.

This wasn't courtship—it was a declaration of ownership.

Every single rose silently proclaimed: This woman belongs to me.

"Tell Melissa Lee," Isabella's red lips curled into a cold smile, "that the flowers were from Julian Ashford. And make sure the styling team seizes their opportunity."

Last time, she'd underestimated Evelyn, never expecting her to have evidence. If Melissa failed again this time, she'd be beyond stupid.

...

The crew was still buzzing about the roses, speculating about the juicy love triangle drama.

Then, an explosive news story broke across the internet.

All the lead character designs for The First Lady had been leaked prematurely!

A prominent entertainment influencer posted dozens of high-definition stills, including multiple meticulously designed outfits meant to be a surprise reveal upon the film's release. These top-secret materials, meant to stay under wraps, had been completely exposed.

For the production team, this was nothing short of catastrophic.

Every shooting schedule was thrown into chaos, and all marketing plans had to be scrapped. Worse, those exclusive designs, crafted at tremendous cost, could now be copied by competitors at any moment.

Fans of Victoria Chase, Isabella Winslow, and Bianca White erupted in outrage, turning social media into a battleground. Supporters of each star blamed the others for the leak, escalating the feud to unprecedented levels.

No one cared about the roses anymore.

Production ground to a halt as the crew scrambled to identify the mole.

Rumors spread like wildfire. Some claimed security on set was a joke, while others even fabricated stories about poisoning attempts before filming began. The absurd lies grew wilder, forcing the crew to issue public denials—only to face even fiercer backlash.

The furious producer called the police, threatening to sue the blogger who first broke the story.

The blogger quickly shifted blame, posting transaction records to prove innocence. In the chat screenshots, the seller's profile and username were faintly visible—

Horizon Media reporter, Duan Sheli.

Ten minutes later, Duan Sheli's real identity was doxxed.

[Horizon reporter Duan Sheli, come out and face justice!]
[So it's that paparazzo who slandered Isabella Winslow last time!]
[Real name Evelyn Sinclair? The one involved in the Ryan Holt scandal?]
[Ryan Holt was trash, but this woman is definitely no saint either!]

A tidal wave of vitriol came crashing down.

...

"Julian!" William Yearwood stopped his son. "We need to talk about Evelyn Sinclair."

Julian Ashford frowned and paused.

"I heard you reprimanded Melissa Lee over her?" William sighed. "Hiding her identity as a Sinclair was already more than she deserved. That family is nothing but bad luck. How much trouble has she caused since joining Horizon?"

"Father!" Julian's expression darkened instantly.
###Chapter 98: Leave or Be Removed

William Yearwood slammed his teacup onto the table. "Pay her off and get rid of her. The Kingsleys played the philanthropist back then, and now they want to dump their burden on the Yearwoods? Dream on!"

Julian Ashford's gaze turned glacial. "Fine. If she goes, I go too."

"Have you lost your mind?" William shot up from his seat. "Four years ago, Alexander Kingsley almost—"

"It was your incompetence!" Julian cut him off sharply. "If Evelyn hadn't pleaded for mercy back then, Horizon would've been finished. Look at Kingsley Group's scale now versus Horizon's pathetic state. Without Autumn Detail's support, would the Yearwoods even have today? Father, have some conscience."

"Conscience?" William trembled with rage. "You'd abandon your own family name for an outsider?"

Julian turned to leave. "The name means nothing. Being human does."

The sound of shattering porcelain followed him, along with William's roar: "Ungrateful wretch!"

Melissa Lee's caked foundation couldn't mask her ashen complexion. "Evelyn, you're off The First Lady project. The crew's unhappy, public opinion's unfavorable, and the company has decided—"

Martha Nash had already hinted that higher-ups planned to recall her to headquarters and sideline her.

Horizon wouldn't fire her outright but would bench her until they found a proper excuse to dismiss her.

"So this is Horizon's famed loyalty." Evelyn gave a soft laugh.

Melissa slammed her palm on the desk. "Horizon only protects those who know their place!"

Evelyn regarded her silently.

That gaze acted like a mirror, exposing the unease in Melissa's heart.

Those eyes were terrifying!

Jealousy burned through Melissa.

Why? She'd grown up in this industry, graduated from elite schools, yet still couldn't measure up to this orphan who supposedly slept her way up?

Worse, Julian had mobilized the entire East China region's Crimson Roses for her!

"Your replacement arrives tonight," Melissa spat through gritted teeth. "Leave willingly or be removed. Your choice."

"Chief, are you really going back?" Charlie Young and Iris Cooper paced anxiously.

"We swear we didn't leak the styling designs!" Iris looked ready to cry.

Evelyn shook her head. "I believe you."

"We've decided," Charlie suddenly straightened. "If you're leaving, we're going with you!"

"Horizon's executives are blind," Iris fumed. "Someone clearly framed you, and they're pretending not to see it. Chief, let's start our own thing!"

Go independent?

Evelyn had plans, but the timing wasn't right yet.

"Leaving like this means admitting defeat." She narrowed her eyes. "Want to play a big hand?"

Their eyes immediately lit up.

In the surveillance room, Iris wiped sweaty palms. "Chief, why are we copying this?"

"Instinct." Evelyn worked swiftly.

If she'd obtained Ryan Holt and Isabella Winslow's call records last time, she'd find the crack this time too.

Isabella had grown smarter, pulling strings from behind the scenes.

But foxes always left tails exposed.

"Done?" Iris checked her watch repeatedly. "Charlie can't stall much longer."

"Go!" Evelyn yanked out the flash drive.

In the hallway, Charlie waited anxiously. "Well?"
###Chapter 99: Daring to Take Liberties? Asking for Death

Evelyn Sinclair gave a slight nod, then abruptly fell silent.

"Miss Sinclair." Nathan Carter appeared nearby unexpectedly. "Lord Alex asked me to relay that Horizon Media's doors remain open should you wish to leave Horizon Media."

He deliberately raised his voice, ensuring Charlie Young and Iris Cooper heard every word.

This was precisely the effect Nathan wanted.

Even if Evelyn remained unmoved, the rumor mill would pressure her into considering it.

True to form, Charlie and Iris immediately buzzed with excitement.

"Evelyn, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"

"Those roses might've really been from Lord Alex."

"You'll regret passing this up."

Evelyn ignored them until they finished, then swiveled her laptop screen toward them.

"See for yourselves."

The surveillance footage she'd just pulled up glared back at them.

As the timestamp advanced, their expressions morphed from eager anticipation to shock, then deflation.

"Those chat logs are obvious fabrications," Evelyn stated calmly. "They claim I stole designs from Isabella Winslow last night, but the footage proves I never went there."

Horizon Media's obtained styling drafts were incomplete from the start.

The爆料博主 had insisted "Evelyn Sinclair" confessed to stealing them from Isabella.

Yet the surveillance showed no trace of Evelyn near Isabella's hotel room door.

Only one person's comings and goings stood out starkly.

A man.

For five full hours.

......

"Chief Editor, are we really publishing this?" Iris's voice trembled.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Naturally."

"Didn't Alexander Kingsley sue me for spreading rumors about him and Isabella?" Her fingers flew across the keyboard editing the video. "This evidence serves both as counterattack and vindication. Why wouldn't I use it?"

Iris hesitated.

The entire film crew had noticed Lord Alex's special attention toward Evelyn.

Those endless crimson roses seemed like a grand romantic gesture to anyone who saw them.

Yet this surveillance footage slapped them all across the face.

What stunned Iris most was Evelyn's composure.

Most women would be overjoyed to climb into Alexander Kingsley's orbit.

With his backing, who'd dare bully her?

Would Melissa Lee still scheme against her at every turn?

Why did she remain so indifferent?

For the first time, genuine respect welled up in Iris's heart.

......

Horizon Media's replacement team had arrived.

Leading them was Daniel Young, the Team Two chief editor who clashed constantly with Martha Nash.

"Management says the hotel's only booked until noon tomorrow," Daniel announced arrogantly. "Hand over all materials for transfer immediately."

This marked Team Two's second time stealing credit.

Evelyn smirked. "Who stays and who goes isn't decided yet, Chief Editor Daniel. Perhaps have HR extend the booking first?"

Daniel laughed uproariously. "Did Martha only teach you how to bluff?"

His team erupted in mocking laughter behind him.

Charlie and Iris shook with rage.

"Care to wager?" Evelyn crossed her arms. "Whoever gets fired by noon tomorrow calls the other 'Daddy.'"

"Such a beautiful daughter would be my gain." Daniel leered, reaching to tilt Evelyn's chin up. "I love hearing pretty girls call me Daddy—"

SMACK!

Evelyn slapped his grubby hand away.

"You bitch!" Daniel's face purpled with rage as he advanced, beer belly leading the charge.

A former paparazzo recruited by Victoria Henn through tabloid scoops, he'd always been insufferably arrogant.

To him, Evelyn was just a花瓶 who slept her way up.

Rumors said upper management already planned to axe her soon.

What harm in feeling up a soon-to-be powerless woman?

With this reasoning, he actually went for Evelyn's chest.

"AAARGH—"

A pig-like squeal echoed down the hallway.

Daniel's face drained of color, sweat pouring as he clutched his dislocated arm. "You're dead!"

"Workplace sexual harassment?" Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "You're the one committing career suicide."

That he dared assault her under surveillance cameras proved how brazen he usually was.

"Get me to a hospital!" Daniel whimpered in pain. "Once the medical report's out, I'll bury you!"

As his team helped him toward the elevators, Iris suddenly gasped. "Chief Editor! Your Weibo post is trending! Over 100k views already!"

Daniel gritted through the pain. "What post?"

A team member pulled out their phone and paled.

"Chief Editor! Evelyn posted surveillance footage of Alexander Kingsley entering and leaving Isabella's room to clear her name!"

"What?!"

Daniel snatched the phone, eyes bulging in disbelief.

The subordinate added, "The chat logs said Evelyn stole designs last night, but the footage only shows Alexander visiting Isabella's room...for five hours..."

Alexander Kingsley's secret five-hour midnight rendezvous with Isabella Winslow!

This wasn't just a defense—it was a nuclear bomb!

"You're finished!" Daniel crowed between pain and glee. "Alexander will destroy you! Get me to the hospital—I want to watch your downfall with my own eyes!"

Last time, one article had landed them in court.

Now she'd exposed an illicit meeting?

She'd signed her own death warrant!

......

"Lord Alex, this..." Nathan gaped at the trending topic. "How?"

Alexander had gone out briefly last night but returned quickly.

Nathan had wisely refrained from questioning.

Yet he never imagined Alexander had met Isabella.

"Shall I investigate?" Nathan recovered swiftly.

"Do it." Alexander's single syllable dripped ice.

Last night, Isabella had impersonated Evelyn to lure him over, then threw herself at him.

He'd rejected her outright and left immediately.

The entire encounter lasted five minutes.

Yet the footage showed five hours?

Who was behind this?

Alexander's knuckles whitened, his glass nearly shattering in his grip.

Evelyn Sinclair...you'd better pray I don't trace this back to you...
###Chapter 100: Forever the Sinner in Your Eyes

"How did she get the surveillance footage?" Isabella Winslow's face turned deathly pale, her fingers twisting the hem of her blouse. "How could she possibly uncover this?"

Last night's carefully orchestrated meeting had lasted barely five minutes.

She had worn a nearly transparent lace nightgown, drenched in suffocating perfume.

Alexander Kingsley hadn't even glanced at her.

"Isabella, don't ever try this again."

He walked out without another word, leaving her seething.

But her goal hadn't been seduction.

She had lured Alexander there for one purpose—to tamper with the security footage.

With Patriarch Kingsley's birthday banquet approaching, she planned to use the doctored video to blackmail Eleanor Kingsley. She would claim she and Alexander had been intimate—and threaten to play the footage publicly if the Kingsleys refused to acknowledge her.

To cover her tracks, she had the original recording erased overnight, altering Alexander's departure time from five minutes to five hours.

Yet Evelyn Sinclair had somehow obtained the unedited footage.

Not only obtained it—but dared to expose it in front of everyone!

"Find the previous surveillance records!" Isabella paced frantically, nails digging into her palms. "Evelyn came to threaten me last night—track that footage down! And get someone to take the blame—say Evelyn altered the tapes!"

——

The moment Evelyn released the footage, the internet exploded.

Then she dropped another bombshell—a police report receipt.

She wasn't afraid of an investigation.

But by the time authorities concluded their inquiries, public interest would have faded. So what if she was falsely accused and cyberbullied? Who would care?

This was a blitzkrieg.

Melissa Lee gave her no breathing room. Isabella pressed her at every turn.

Now it was their turn to feel cornered.

[Holy shit, this drama is wild!]
[I knew my king was framed!]
[Five hours? My OTP is real!]
[Bullshit! Our queen doesn't need a nepo baby!]
[LMAO, Alexander Kingsley needs to chase anyone? Check Kingsley Group's market cap first!]

The hate vanished instantly.

Replaced by awe for Evelyn.
[Duan Sheli is legendary! That was masterful!]
[An absolute pro—what a flawless counterattack!]
[Where are the trolls now?]
[Twenty truckloads of roses—I'm dead!]
[We need pics of this queen!]
[Forget it, not even a silhouette surfaced during the Ryan Holt scandal.]

——

"Chief Editor, you have fans!" Iris Cooper waved her phone excitedly. "They made a fanpage!"

Evelyn glanced at it.

A dozen active followers. Touching.

"If they saw your face," Iris gushed, "they'd petition for you to debut overnight!"

Evelyn: "..."

She preferred letting her work speak for itself.

Her looks only brought trouble—like making Alexander despise her yet refuse to let go.

A sharp knock interrupted them.

Iris bounded to the door—then froze.

Alexander stood there, his gaze glacial.

"You altered the footage?"

Iris stammered, "N-no! When we retrieved it, it was already—"

He ignored her.

His eyes locked onto Evelyn, sharp as blades.

"What if I did?" She met his stare unflinchingly. "What then?"

He seized her wrist.

Iris choked back a gasp.

"What then?" Fury darkened his voice. "With Grandfather's banquet days away? For your pathetic job, you'd stoop this low?"

She'd threatened him with the banquet that morning.

Now she released a fake video of him and Isabella?

After he'd told Nathan to assure her she needn't worry about work—that any position at Kingsley Group was hers for the asking!

"Evelyn," each word dripped venom, "how can you be this vile?"

Patriarch Kingsley treated her like family.

How could she sabotage his celebration?

"So," Evelyn's voice was eerily calm, unmoved by his rage, "your demand for evidence was just a joke."

Alexander stiffened.

"In your eyes, I'll always be guilty."

She was forever the villain—Isabella, forever the saint.

He hadn't even considered who truly benefited. His first instinct was to blame her.

When it came to Isabella, Alexander's famed intellect short-circuited.

—That was love.

Blind, irrational love.

Just like his hatred for her—where her very breath was a crime.

Alexander faltered.

Something in Evelyn's eyes pierced him.

In the silence, Nathan rushed in.

"Lord Alex, we've traced the footage tampering to—"
###Chapter 101: The Woman Worthy of Alexander Kingsley

The air froze the moment Alexander Kingsley released Evelyn Sinclair.

Nathan Carter stood at the doorway, instantly sensing the tension.

"Lord Alex," he ventured cautiously, "the hotel's surveillance logs have been restored."

Alexander turned, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Speak."

Nathan delivered his report swiftly. "After you left last night, only one person accessed the security system."

"Who?"

"A maintenance technician." Nathan hesitated. "He's currently missing. We're tracking—"

Iris Cooper suddenly raised her hand.

"I know where he is." She glanced at Evelyn. "He's in the next room."

The technician was being held next door, trembling when Alexander entered.

"Isabella Winslow's assistant paid me!" he blurted. "She gave me money!"

Nathan suppressed a sigh.

Clearly, the payoff hadn't been enough.

Alexander sat, fingers tapping the armrest.

"Details."

The technician spilled everything.

Isabella's assistant had ordered him to alter the footage and take a copy.

"Then why hide here?" Nathan pressed.

The man pointed at Charlie Young in the corner.

"He tricked me..."

Charlie had frightened him with real-life cases—claiming witnesses who knew too much ended up silenced.

Nathan checked the technician's phone.

"Lord Alex, he kept backups."

After reviewing the footage, Alexander studied Charlie.

"Why intervene?"

Charlie stood straighter. "To protect the witness. And Editor Sinclair."

Alexander's brow furrowed.

"Isabella could've framed Evelyn for tampering with evidence," Charlie met his gaze. "I couldn't let that happen."

A cold draft brushed Alexander's forehead.

It struck him then—Evelyn had earned her own loyal team.

A memory surfaced from his youth.

"Father, why outsource investigations to Autumn Detail?"

Mr. Kingsley had smiled. "Professionals handle professional matters."

Young Alexander hadn't understood why Autumn Detail warranted such trust.

Until he met Evelyn's parents.

That couple possessed a rare magnetism that inspired absolute loyalty.

Autumn Detail charged triple the market rate yet never lacked clients.

Because they never failed.

That conviction...

Ultimately killed them.

Alexander paused outside Evelyn's door.

Iris silently offered the keycard.

The door opened.

Nathan and Iris stayed behind, exchanging a look.

"His private affairs," Nathan murmured. "Don't pry."

Iris's eyes widened with realization.

Pride swelled in her for Evelyn.

That composed woman didn't just match Alexander Kingsley.

She held the power to choose him—or walk away.

Inside, Evelyn was organizing documents.

"Iris, some water please."

A masculine hand offered a glass.

Evelyn looked up into Alexander's dark eyes.

"Here to accuse me again, Mr. Kingsley?"

His throat moved.

"The technician confessed," he said quietly. "Why didn't you tell me the truth?"
###Chapter 102: You Mean Nothing to Me

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze, her eyes cold as frost.

Alexander Kingsley stood before her, his towering figure casting a long shadow.

"Why didn't you tell me?" His voice was low, simmering with restrained anger.

The corners of Evelyn's lips curved into a distant smile.

"Mr. Kingsley, what exactly is our relationship?"

Her words struck like a blade, piercing straight into Alexander's heart.

His brow furrowed, pain flashing in his eyes.

"This matter concerns Kingsley Group too," he tried to explain.

"Then go investigate your precious company. What does it have to do with me?" Evelyn countered.

The air turned icy.

Alexander stared at her for a long moment before speaking again. "Have we really reached the point where we can't even talk properly?"

Evelyn let out a soft laugh.

"Mr. Kingsley, this is how I treat people who mean nothing to me."

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

"What about Julian Ashford then?" Jealousy dripped from his voice.

"He's my senior and my friend," Evelyn replied calmly.

The temperature around Alexander seemed to drop, his gaze turning stormy.

Evelyn couldn't understand why he harbored such hostility toward Julian.

There had never been anything between them.

Was it because of that accident?

Her eyes unconsciously drifted to Alexander's leg—the one that had once been fractured. Now, no trace remained.

Noticing her gaze, Alexander's heart stirred.

She still remembered...

"I was too impulsive earlier," he said suddenly, his tone softening. "There's really nothing between Isabella Winslow and me."

"Your personal affairs don't require any explanation to me," Evelyn said coolly.

Alexander ignored her dismissal.

"I'll give you an answer for this," he declared firmly.

"I don't need it!" Evelyn's voice rose sharply.

"You will." His tone brooked no argument. "Quit your job at Horizon Media. Come to Kingsley Group."

Evelyn stared at him in disbelief.

"On what grounds?" She stood abruptly. "Alexander Kingsley, we broke up!"

"If we hadn't, you wouldn't be making these mistakes!" he snapped, raising his voice. "Do you even realize the path you're walking?"

He cut himself off abruptly.

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Evelyn said with a cold laugh. "All I know is that my life has been better without you!"

"Without me?" Alexander sneered. "Ryan Holt's scandal, Vincent Sullivan's interview, the trouble with the film crew—which of these didn't rely on me?"

"Go on!" Evelyn took a step forward. "Keep talking! Let's see how much worse you can make this!"

Silence engulfed the room.

Alexander froze.

The Evelyn before him burned with a fury he'd never seen before—flames that made her glow with vivid, breathtaking intensity.

Slowly, Evelyn regained her composure.

"Alexander Kingsley, let me make this clear," she enunciated each word. "For Ryan Holt, I planted a camera in the couch seam."

"Vincent Sullivan's interview? His wife and I go way back."

"As for Orange Media, I have leverage over them."

"Without you, I can handle everything just fine."

She met his gaze head-on.

"You mean nothing to me."

The words hit Alexander like a sledgehammer.

For the first time, he realized how accustomed he'd grown to seeing dependence in her eyes.

Now, all that remained was resolve.

Alexander stood rooted to the spot, utterly at a loss.

He had no idea how to respond.
###Chapter 103: No Future for Them

The words escaped Alexander Kingsley's lips before he realized what he was saying.

"I never meant to hurt you."

Evelyn Sinclair's mouth curved into a mocking smile.

Never meant to?

Then why did every memory of him after their breakup feel like retaliation?

As if she'd committed some unforgivable sin...

"Do you like the roses?" Alexander suddenly asked.

Evelyn froze.

The unfamiliarity and confusion in her eyes made his brow furrow.

She didn't like them?

"I don't know what game you're playing," Evelyn met his gaze, self-mockery outweighing bewilderment in her eyes. "Alexander, we're over. Isn't this pathetic?"

When she'd begged, he'd withheld.

Now that she wanted nothing, he forced it upon her.

No treasure could tempt her now...

Her lips, crimson as blood, formed words sharp as blades.

Alexander had never faced this version of Evelyn.

This Evelyn reminded him of the spoiled princess he'd first met - beloved by her parents, secure in her status, looking down her nose at him.

Back then, no amount of scheming could earn him her glance.

The loss of control agitated him.

He seized her shoulders.

"Take it back! I never agreed to break up!"

"Let go!" Evelyn winced at the pain. "I don't appreciate this joke!"

Alexander always resorted to force when emotions ran high.

At Royal Gardens, whether in good moods or bad, he'd left marks on her body.

She'd foolishly mistaken it for love.

Now she knew better - it was pure possessiveness.

He'd never treated her as human, just a disposable object.

"On what grounds?" Her laugh was icy. "You gave me the choice to break up. I chose. Now you regret it. Alexander, what am I to you?"

Might as well lay everything bare today.

So he couldn't accuse her of poor communication later.

"I gave you a choice?" Alexander laughed bitterly. "I only asked for an apology, and you threw a breakup at me!"

"Amnesia?" Evelyn held her ground. "You were the one who..."

The one who forced her to choose.

Now he twisted the narrative?

"Whatever." Sudden exhaustion washed over her.

She'd promised herself to move on.

To stop dwelling on the past.

Her lips twisted. "So in your eyes, I was being unreasonable. Thanks for clarifying."

His people had struck her.

Why should she apologize?

"That's not..." Alexander knew the truth.

He knew it was about the Butterfly Brooch.

"Answer me," Evelyn gritted through shoulder pain. "At the sanatorium, was it Madam Zade who helped recover my memories?"

Alexander's pupils constricted.

"Why did you never tell me about my past? Why hide even my parents' history?"

She'd grown close to Julian Ashford only to rediscover her roots.

However kind the Kingsleys were, her heart remained unsettled.

Yet Alexander had repeatedly blocked her search for truth.

She'd once deluded herself into thinking it was for her protection.

Now she understood - he might be concealing something...

"So this is why you chose Julian Ashford, why you betrayed the Kingsleys." Alexander released her.

"My oversight gave you the chance to leave."

After all he'd invested, she still walked away.

For ten years of memories.

Was the past so important?

Or was it... someone she couldn't forget?

Evelyn turned away, too weary to explain.

Let him think what he would.

Not worth it anymore...

"I'll attend Grandfather's birthday banquet and play my part."

"And then?" The question burst from Alexander.

Then?

Evelyn looked at him.

His gaze darkened. "You'd deceive Grandfather forever?"

Forever?

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

Even if she wanted to, would Isabella Winslow wait?

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."

There would be no bridge to cross...

......

Nathan Carter and Iris Cooper chatted outside the door.

Iris complained about the hardships of journalism.

Nathan sighed. "We're exhausted too. Handling so much money daily - no room for error."

Iris thought he was bragging.

"Apples and oranges! Your salaries versus ours? You're the elite - we're called paparazzi scum."

The door suddenly opened.

Alexander strode toward the elevator.

Nathan hastily excused himself to follow.

Iris bit her lip, gathered courage, and chased after them.

"Lord Alex!"

Alexander turned.

His gaze made her heart stutter.

But having started, she pressed on.

"Lord Alex, if Evelyn seems ungrateful... please don't blame her."

"Why?" Alexander asked.

Why did even her colleagues know her current attitude?

"Lord Alex, countless girls would kill to stand by your side - for money or the man. But Evelyn's different..."

"How?" Alexander fully faced her now.

The pressure intensified.

"When Evelyn first arrived, everyone called her a nepotism hire. But I knew the truth."

"That article she wrote about you? She was framed by a colleague..."
###Chapter 104: Cruelly Bullied by Evelyn

"Both interviews with Ryan Holt and Vincent Sullivan were traps set for her." Iris Cooper's voice trembled. "But no matter how difficult, she gritted her teeth and pushed through."

"Lord Alex, Evelyn worked so hard just to prove herself." She took a deep breath. "She rejected you not out of ingratitude, but because she wants to stand on her own."

Iris clenched the hem of her shirt.

"Some at Horizon Media envy Evelyn. Today a senior editor even tried to take advantage of her. He was thrilled to hear she'd offended you..."

Finally, she reached her point.

"Lord Alex, please don't punish her just because she refused you."

Alexander Kingsley studied Iris for a long moment.

"That editor's name?"

"Daniel Young."

Nathan Carter gave Iris a faint smile before leaving.

Only then did she realize her back was drenched in sweat.

......

"Can't find him?" Isabella Winslow smashed a glass. "Useless!"

She'd planned to frame Evelyn but couldn't locate the technician who altered the surveillance footage.

Her assistant rushed in. "Lord Alex is here!"

Isabella hastily smoothed her hair.

"I'm still investigating the surveillance issue..." She forced composure.

Nathan handed her a phone. "Miss Winslow, see for yourself."

The video clearly showed her assistant bribing the technician.

Isabella's legs gave way as she collapsed onto the sofa.

"This is..." Her voice shook. "What was Wendy doing?"

"Fabricating evidence." Nathan's tone remained calm.

Isabella suddenly shrieked. "Wendy! How dare you do this behind my back!"

The assistant turned deathly pale.

She knew Isabella would sacrifice her to save face.

"I acted on my own..." The assistant stammered her confession. "They said Lord Alex looked down on you..."

Nathan raised an eyebrow.

This assistant was clever.

"Get out!" Isabella wailed. "I don't need an assistant like you!"

After the assistant was removed, she turned to Alexander. "I'll make a public clarification..."

"Did you steal Evelyn's brooch?" Alexander asked abruptly.

Isabella froze.

"Why did you enter my bedroom on the 10th last month?"

Her heart pounded violently.

He'd checked the surveillance!

"I wanted to invite Evelyn shopping... She wasn't answering her phone..."

Alexander watched her performance with cold detachment.

"No need for your clarification." He turned away. "I'll handle this personally."

Isabella felt plunged into an icy abyss.

Her phone suddenly rang.

Seeing the caller ID, her expression instantly transformed.

"William~" Her voice dripped honey. "Evelyn bullied me so cruelly~"

A light chuckle came through the phone. "How can I help?"

"Come back to me~" She cooed. "I have a gift to show you."

"The brooch?"

Isabella brightened. "How did you know?"

"It suits you." The man's voice softened. "I'd like to see... how butterflies fly."
###Chapter 105: Alexander Kingsley Strikes Back

Daniel Young limped out of the hospital with his arm in a cast, cursing under his breath.

"Has that bastard Alexander dealt with Evelyn yet?"

"No updates so far."

"Notify me the second something happens! I want to see her groveling on her knees!"

Before he could finish, darkness swallowed his vision.

......

Daniel found himself stuffed into a burlap sack, gagged with filthy rags, and dragged like a dead dog into an abandoned warehouse.

The sack was ripped open violently, sending him tumbling across the concrete floor.

A cold voice cut through the shadows. "Which hand touched her?"

Daniel trembled. He'd bullied too many people to remember who he'd crossed.

"Never mind," the voice said indifferently. "Break them both."

CRACK—

His screams echoed through the warehouse as both arms were snapped like twigs.

......

"Iris, should we leave today or tomorrow?" Evelyn asked, though her assistant still looked uneasy despite their earlier discussion.

A sudden pounding shook the door—heavy, unnatural.

They exchanged glances before approaching the entrance.

The moment the door opened, a bandaged figure collapsed to his knees.

"Father! I was wrong!" Daniel kowtowed frantically. "Spare your worthless son!"

Iris recoiled in shock.

Evelyn merely arched a brow. "I don't recall having a son."

"Yes! I'm unworthy!" Snot and tears streamed down his face. "I'll be your dog! Woof! Woof!"

"Call security." Her voice remained calm.

Daniel scrambled away like a man fleeing the devil himself.

Iris held up her phone with shaking hands. "Evelyn, look..."

Alexander Kingsley's private Twitter had just updated:

【I, Alexander Kingsley, have never had any romantic relationship with Isabella Winslow. The alleged engagement is pure fabrication. Surveillance footage was maliciously altered by her assistant—actual interaction lasted under five minutes. Kingsley Group will pursue legal action.】

Attached evidence included unedited security tapes and transaction records.

The Kingsley corporate account instantly reposted. The hashtag exploded.

Winwell Ventures' stock plummeted to limit down within minutes.

Both entertainment and financial circles quaked.

Isabella's fans spiraled into meltdown. Die-hard "power couple" shippers raged—only to find themselves mass-muted before the backlash began.

Nathan Carter delivered a blunt warning to Isabella: "Control your fans. Or else..."

Meanwhile, The First Lady crew announced a casting change—ousted lead Bianca White reclaimed her role, backed by a mysterious new investor.
###Chapter 106: A Public Proposal to Evelyn

"Evelyn!" Iris burst into the office waving her phone. "The First Lady crew just announced they're replacing Isabella Winslow!"

Her cheeks flushed with excitement. "They're reshooting all promo materials and redesigning the costumes!"

Charlie followed close behind. "Bianca White's agent just called Martha. They're fully cooperating with us now."

"And here's the juiciest part," Iris lowered her voice. "Daniel Young resigned, citing health reasons."

Charlie added, "Kingsley Group increased their investment and specifically requested Bianca as the female lead."

Isabella's team claimed she withdrew due to health issues, but everyone in the industry knew the truth.

Her staged encounter with Alexander Kingsley had been exposed, along with leaking the crew's styling secrets.

The same way she'd stolen Bianca's role was how she now made her disgraceful exit.

Only far more humiliating.

The entire entertainment industry mocked her downfall.

Bianca's fans unleashed their fury:

[Who said she didn't care about the Kingsley heir? How's that working out now?]

[Getting fired despite investor casting? Lord Alex strikes again!]

Meanwhile, rumors spread through fandom circles—

Bianca only reclaimed her role because Horizon reporter Evelyn Sinclair exposed the surveillance footage.

This prompted Alexander's personal investigation and swift retaliation.

Isabella's fan forum exploded.

Her supporters flooded Evelyn's forum with vile insults.

[You homewrecker! How dare you steal our queen's man!]

[Faking evidence to frame our sister? We'll see you in court!]

Bianca's fans quickly mobilized in defense.

[Protect our journalist angel!]

[Your demon queen dug her own grave.]

[Heard Lord Alex sent twenty truckloads of roses. Someone's bitter?]

The battle raged.

Bianca's fans organized anti-bullying campaigns and established official fan clubs.

Their slogan was brutally simple: Stan real talent or get lost!

Evelyn somehow gained her own fanbase.

"Editor," Charlie said admiringly, "have you considered becoming a celebrity?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Can't sing, can't dance, terrible actress. Celebrity?"

"But you're gorgeous!" Iris chimed in.

Evelyn closed her folder. "Finished today's articles?"

Both reporters vanished instantly.

......

Kingsbury Airport.

Nathan Carter approached Alexander the moment he disembarked.

"Lord Alex, Julian Ashford came to pick up Miss Sinclair."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "Where are they?"

Nathan hesitated. "There's more... Patriarch Kingsley is here too."

Alexander froze mid-step.

In the VIP lounge, Patriarch Kingsley gripped his cane with a stern expression.

Eleanor Kingsley attempted mediation. "Evelyn personally called to explain. Why must you be so difficult?"

Alexander stiffened.

She contacted his grandfather?

"What exactly happened with that Winslow girl?" the old man demanded.

"Nothing." Alexander's reply was clipped.

The patriarch nodded. "Good. Evelyn is the only granddaughter-in-law I recognize."

His cane struck the floor sharply. "When's the wedding?"

Alexander met his gaze steadily. "I'll propose publicly during your birthday banquet."

Eleanor gasped, covering her mouth.

When had they reconciled?

This decision even surprised her.

Would Evelyn... actually say yes?
###Chapter 107: He Was Ready to Propose

Eleanor Kingsley stood frozen in place.

Patriarch Kingsley, however, beamed with delight.

"Good! Good! Good!" he exclaimed, nearly dropping his cane in excitement.

"That's my grandson!"

The gloom on his face vanished as he gave Alexander Kingsley an approving thumbs-up. "Hurry up and get married. I want to hold my great-grandchild next year!"

The old man was in such high spirits that he began humming a tune.

Eleanor looked stunned.

She pulled Alexander aside.

"You're really planning to propose?"

"Is that a problem?" Alexander countered, then frowned. "What did Evelyn say to Grandfather over the phone?"

Eleanor gave him a meaningful look. "Evelyn contacted me before releasing the surveillance footage. She asked me to keep it from him."

But the old man had found out anyway.

Just like at Royal Gardens, the Kingsley household had its share of loose-lipped staff.

"After learning the truth, Evelyn personally called to reassure him. But he was still worried and came here today to confront you!"

What surprised Eleanor most was Alexander's unexpected reaction.

Whenever the topic of marriage came up before, he would either remain silent or outright refuse.

"What if Evelyn rejects you?" Eleanor fretted.

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Why would she?"

Eleanor sighed. "...Have you even tried reconciling with her recently?"

Silence.

Eleanor immediately understood.

"She won't even consider getting back together, yet you expect her to agree to marriage?"

A stubborn glint flashed in Alexander's eyes. "She'll say yes."

"And if she doesn't?" Eleanor pressed.

"There is no 'if,'" Alexander stated firmly. Seeing his mother about to argue further, he coldly cut in, "Go keep Grandfather company. I have things to attend to."

With that, he turned and left.

But when he stepped outside, Nathan Carter delivered worse news.

"Miss Sinclair... has already left."

Julian Ashford had taken her away!

Alexander took a deep breath, forcing himself to stay calm.

It didn't matter. Soon enough.

At Grandfather's birthday banquet, he would propose to her publicly.

Marriage...

He remembered Evelyn's first birthday after arriving at the Kingsley household.

Eleanor had told her to make a wish.

With her eyes tightly shut, Evelyn had declared loudly, "When I grow up, I want to marry Alex!"

The family had either laughed or covered their smiles—except for Alexander, who had fled in embarrassment.

Evelyn had chased after him, tugging timidly at his sleeve. "Alex, don't you want to marry me?"

What had he said back then?

With a cold expression, he'd replied, "Don't you know wishes don't come true if you say them out loud?"

Evelyn's eyes had widened before she broke into a sweet smile. "Then I'll never say them aloud again."

She'd whispered, "I'll make my wishes secretly from now on."

......

"Nathan, contact the head designer at True Love," Alexander ordered. "I want an engagement ring she can't refuse—within two days."

Nathan hesitated.

Was Lord Alex about to make his grand move?

"Understood." He didn't dare say more, silently praying Miss Sinclair would change her mind.

......

"Are you going to the birthday banquet the day after tomorrow?" Julian asked Evelyn.

Before she could answer, he casually added, "The Kingsley household was your home for thirteen years... Would you like to visit?"

"Yes. Grandfather has always been kind to me," Evelyn nodded.

Julian's gaze lingered on her profile. "Be my date. I'm going alone—help me ward off unwanted attention?"

It was the best excuse he could come up with.

Ward off attention...

Given Evelyn's personality, she shouldn't refuse.

"I'm afraid not," she declined without hesitation.

"Grandfather doesn't know we've broken up. His heart isn't strong—it's better to keep it from him on such an important day."

Disappointment crashed over Julian like a wave.

He simply acknowledged her words and fell silent.

The diamond ring in his pocket suddenly felt heavy against his skin.

After speaking with William Yearwood, he'd made up his mind.

After all these years...

He didn't want to wait any longer.

Even if he waited until Evelyn regained her memories, would she still remember their past feelings?

Perhaps she'd already forgotten that innocence, remembering only his coldness.

Before, he'd respected her choice and promised to let go.

But now, Alexander was the one who didn't cherish her. Evelyn was the one who walked away.

Why should he keep his promise?

Besides, the reason he hadn't fought for her before was for Horizon Media's sake.

But how had Horizon treated Evelyn?

How had his father treated Evelyn?

The Sinclairs had helped the Kingsleys—but hadn't they done the same for the Ashfords?

Wasn't Horizon built on the foundation the Sinclairs laid?

Horizon wasn't worth it.

Not worth giving up the woman he loved.

"Alright," Julian finally spoke as they reached Evelyn's doorstep. "But after the banquet ends... will you leave with me?"

"Sure," Evelyn smiled. "Thank you, Julian."

With him escorting her home, she always felt safe.

The ring box in his pocket grew warm again.

Julian's mood lightened...

He'd confess after the banquet.

No matter the outcome, he wanted her to know how he felt.

As long as she didn't return to Alexander, he was confident he could win her heart...

......

Evelyn took out her keys, about to unlock her door.

A voice drifted from the end of the hallway.

"I heard Alexander Kingsley threw you away?"

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine, like a cold snake slithering up her back.

The voice was melodious yet sinister—like a flower at its peak just before decay, or the damp flicker of a serpent's tongue. Unforgettable.

"Tsk tsk..." The sound grew closer. "I told you he was unreliable, but you wouldn't listen... Evelyn, still so stubborn."

"Long time no see," Evelyn turned, her gaze icy as she faced the man now standing before her.

"...William West."
###Chapter 108: Undercurrents and Blades

William West.

That name first entered Evelyn Sinclair's world through Julian Ashford's warning.

"If you see this man, walk away immediately." The teenage Julian's gaze was razor-sharp. "The West family murdered your parents."

Evelyn's fingertips turned ice-cold.

"They killed my parents... and still won't stop?"

"Because," Julian's voice darkened, "your father took William West's father's life too."

It had been a mutual destruction.

William's mother fled with him, but fate caught up with them regardless.

"He'll come for revenge." Julian gripped her trembling shoulders. "Evelyn, either stay under the Kingsleys' protection forever, or become strong enough that no one can touch you."

Evelyn once tentatively mentioned the name to Alexander Kingsley.

"Who told you that? Has he contacted you?" Alexander's reaction was violently intense.

The next day, she found herself shadowed by round-the-clock bodyguards.

From that moment, Evelyn faced an impossible choice—remain the Kingsleys' caged songbird, or grow claws of her own...

Fate never gave her the chance to decide.

......

"Long time no see, Evie." William West looked down at her, lips curving in a dangerous smile. "Even more captivating than before."

His voice dripped poisoned honey. His delicate features bordered on ethereal, pale skin carrying a sickly pallor like some creature bred in darkness.

At their first meeting, he'd called her "Evie"—a deceptively sweet nickname laced with venom.

This was a true serpent, his dazzling beauty the deadliest warning.

"I hear you've been thriving lately." His smile never wavered.

William always smiled.

That careless amusement dancing in his eyes almost looked genuine.

But Evelyn knew—he smiled most beautifully when killing.

"I always said the Kingsleys would waste your talents. With your skills, restoring the Sinclairs' former glory would be child's play."

"I always said."

Those four words turned Evelyn's stomach.

The pretentious affectation reeked of nauseating arrogance.

Only his striking looks saved the act from being laughable.

"Business?" Evelyn's key remained motionless in the lock.

"Extending an olive branch." William cut to the chase. "Heard you're back in the game... Come to Orange Media. The editor-in-chief position is yours."

Just as expected.

Julian's intel was never wrong—Orange Media did belong to William.

"Pass." Wasting words on him was intolerable.

She turned the key, entered, and slammed the door in one fluid motion.

William's sigh carried through the wood: "What a... pity."

......

Alexander returned to Royal Gardens.

Since Evelyn left, the mansion had become a mausoleum.

His rare visit today was to plan renovations.

The engagement required wedding preparations, during which Evelyn would surely stay with the Kingsleys—close to the elders and convenient for meetings...

Though the Kingsleys owned numerous properties in Kingsbury, Alexander favored Royal Gardens above all.

Every detail here pleased him.

More importantly, Evelyn had once confessed she loved this place.

He remembered accidentally overhearing her discuss nursery designs with the staff.

Since they'd be living here long-term after marriage, Alexander decided on a full remodel.

Six months would suffice—enough time for the wedding, pregnancy, and ensuring the new rooms were formaldehyde-free.

He intended to ask the housekeeper about Evelyn's preferred nursery location and other layout preferences.

Having spent years at Royal Gardens, the staff knew her habits better than he did.

Approaching the servants' quarters, raucous laughter assaulted his ears.

"Mrs. Wilson, Evelyn's definitely not coming back, right?"

"Of course not! If she were, she'd have returned by now. Lord Alex has clearly washed his hands of her."

"Thank goodness! I was afraid she'd retaliate against us."

"For what? She was just some charity case Lord Alex tolerated out of pity. Did she actually think she was mistress here?"

"But Madam Kingsley adores her... What if she punishes us for those things we said—"

"Punish us? That orphan should be grateful Lord Alex let her sleep in his bed! No handouts? Then scram like a good girl!"

"Ugh, her delusions were the worst! Everyone saw how little Lord Alex cared. Still dreaming of marriage—pathetic!"

"Oh! Remember when she asked which room would make a good nursery? I gave some random answer, and the idiot actually measured it with a tape! Mortifying!"

"Brainless twit! We humored her with pretty lies, and she ate it up."

"That's why taunting her during the breakup was so satisfying!"

"Finally showed her her place!"

"Best part? When I followed her upstairs to insult her, Lord Alex suddenly appeared. Guess who he took her side against?" Mrs. Wilson's tone oozed smugness.

"What'd you say to her?"

"Just warned her everything at Royal Gardens belongs to the Kingsleys. Told her not to steal anything on her way out—"

"Serves her right!"

The other servants crowed in agreement.

"Eating the Kingsleys' food, living in their house—actually thought she was family!"

"Should've made her leave naked!"

"Lord Alex would obviously side with Mrs. Wilson. She's been with the family for decades. What's that nobody compared to—"

"I'd pay to see her kicked-puppy face if we told her again!"

Their jeering continued unchecked—until an arctic voice shattered the noise:

"Repeat every word. Exactly as you said them."

All laughter.

Died instantly.

The servants froze, blood turning to ice in their veins.
###Chapter 109: The Truth Comes Out

The living room of Royal Gardens was thick with Alexander Kingsley's suffocating aura.

Ethan Miller stood before him, trembling.

"Lord Alex, we've confirmed everything. On the eleventh of last month..." He swallowed hard. "When they heard Miss Sinclair had been abandoned by you, they ambushed her on her usual path and hurled vile insults at her..."

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

"Who spread the rumors?"

How had internal company affairs reached Royal Gardens so quickly?

"Mrs. Wilson." Ethan handed over enhanced surveillance footage. "They didn't avoid the cameras, but their voices were too faint..."

Alexander stared at the screen.

The maids' malicious voices were amplified:

"How dare she come crawling back after being dumped?"

"Pathetic leech..."

"Let's see how long she lasts..."

Evelyn Sinclair climbed the stairs with leaden steps, her face ghostly pale. Her eyes were hollow, like a walking corpse.

A sharp pain lanced through Alexander's chest.

He never imagined this was how she had returned that day.

What had he given her in her darkest hour?

A brutal possession. A cold bank card. And his blind defense of the housekeeper.

Now he understood why she had been so resolute.

Madam Kingsley's words—"Royal Gardens leaks like a sieve"—rang bitterly true.

Mrs. Wilson was dragged before Alexander.

She trembled violently but refused to name her accomplice.

"I lost my senses... Please spare me for the old madam's sake..."

Alexander sneered. "You dare invoke her?"

He turned to Ethan. "Audit her embezzlement over the years. Ensure she rots in prison."

Mrs. Wilson collapsed.

With The First Lady crew's cooperation, Evelyn's workload lightened considerably.

As she left Horizon Media's building, she spotted William West lurking outside like a viper.

Before she could evade him, a Maybach pulled up.

Ethan beamed. "Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex wishes to speak with you."

To his surprise, Evelyn didn't refuse.

When she entered the car, Alexander's tension eased slightly.

He offered an elegant box. "You've worked hard."

Evelyn recognized the patisserie he frequented.

"Your favorite flavor," he said.

She met his gaze. "You're mistaken. I don't like it."

Alexander froze.

"But you always—"

"Those were for you." Her voice was calm. "When you broke your leg years ago, this was the only cake you could stomach."

The memory surfaced—he'd mentioned the shop while feverish.

All this time, she'd been accommodating his preferences.

Evelyn pushed the box back. "No need anymore."

The air in the car turned glacial.

After a long silence, Alexander spoke quietly. "I know... about that day."
###Chapter 110: No More Wrongs

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze, studying Alexander Kingsley's sharply defined profile.

She waited for him to continue.

She truly couldn't recall which incident he referred to.

Alexander didn't keep her waiting.

"On the eleventh last month," his voice was low, "I learned what the housekeeper and staff said to you. I was wrong to blame you without verifying the facts."

The eleventh last month?

Evelyn frowned slightly, searching her memory before it came back to her.

A distant look crossed her eyes.

Nearly two months had passed since their breakup.

Every moment at Royal Gardens used to feel agonizingly slow.

Yet time flew after leaving Alexander.

How ironic that idleness made time crawl.

A faint smile touched her lips. "It's in the past. I've moved on."

Those words had stung before the breakup.

Now they were just wisps of smoke.

"You're right," Alexander said solemnly. "I always blamed you first. I apologize."

An uneasy flutter rose in his chest.

She genuinely didn't care anymore.

The pale, devastated woman from that day now dismissed it with effortless grace.

She'd... let go.

The only comfort was the clear surprise in Evelyn's eyes.

"You..." Evelyn was indeed stunned. An apology from Alexander Kingsley?

"Thank you," she paused. "Though it doesn't matter now, I appreciate you saying it."

Alexander heard the unspoken rejection.

He seized her wrist abruptly. "Royal Gardens is cleared out. You can return anytime. Or name any place you'd prefer."

Evelyn withdrew her hand.

"What do you mean?"

"The breakup was just servants' gossip," Alexander's gaze burned. "I'll verify facts before judging from now on. No more wrongs."

Evelyn fell silent.

Then she laughed softly.

"Alexander, not everything is black and white."

"I know verifying facts first is prudent in business. But love isn't an investment."

Alexander tried to speak.

Evelyn continued, "I shared your bed once. Yet you trusted outsiders over me..."

"This apology only came because you uncovered the truth. What if you hadn't?"

"That hypothetical doesn't exist. I did uncover it," Alexander countered.

Evelyn smiled again.

Empty justification.

She regarded him calmly, like a passing stranger.

"Without evidence, your first instinct was my guilt. I don't know why, but 'Evelyn is guilty' is engraved in your bones."

Before he could protest, she added, "I won't accept such love or share such a bed. I can't gamble whether you'd condemn me again next time."

The rest of the ride passed in heavy silence.

Alexander didn't speak again.

His expression darkened, gaze deliberately avoiding Evelyn.

Only when she exited the car did his eyes follow her retreating figure.

Engraved belief in her guilt...

Had he really been that transparent?

......

At the candlelit restaurant, Isabella Winslow arrived in full glamour.

A dazzling diamond butterfly brooch adorned her collar.

William West traced the wings with his fingers.

He closed his eyes, memorizing each facet.

"Thank you, Isabella," he murmured, smiling. "For keeping this. It reminds me who stood by me at my lowest."

Isabella ducked her head demurely.

She'd risked stealing the brooch only upon learning of William's return.

Now it proved worthwhile.

Evelyn and Alexander had broken up.

William remained her willing pawn.

"Are you certain they split?" William asked mildly. "I saw her in his car today."

Isabella's face fell.

"Check your sources," William suggested helpfully. "I need current intel to assist you."

Isabella urgently contacted her mole in the Kingsley household.

When she hung up, her expression turned ashen.

"Disaster! Alexander purged all my people from Royal Gardens! Rumor says he'll propose to Evelyn at the Patriarch's birthday banquet!"

She trembled with rage. "They were supposed to be over!"

"How unfortunate," William remarked calmly. "The banquet is tomorrow."

"What do I do?" Isabella's eyes welled up. "William, you know I've always loved Alexander..."

"List all your Kingsley connections," William said confidently. "Don't worry. You'll get your happy ending..."

......

The grand eightieth birthday banquet for Patriarch Kingsley filled the Swan Palace with elite guests.

"Alexander," the Patriarch beckoned his grandson mid-conversation. "Where's Evelyn?"

"Sophie needed final tests. Evelyn stayed with her," Alexander explained.

"Why didn't you handle it personally?" the Patriarch chided. "You should've arranged everything and escorted them both. Your parents can manage the guests."

Alexander stayed silent.

Hosting duties were just an excuse...

Evelyn now barred him from her daily life.

Her attendance tonight was purely for the Patriarch's sake.

But after tonight, she'd return to him...

"Alexander!" Eleanor Kingsley hurried over. "Evelyn's here! Go greet her!"
###Chapter 111: A Stunning Entrance

"Your father and I have everything under control. Go attend to your guests." Eleanor Kingsley was more anxious than her son, her eyes darting toward the entrance.

"Hurry along!" Patriarch Kingsley waved him off impatiently.

Alexander Kingsley strode down the corridor toward the banquet hall.

Guests had already begun arriving. Crystal chandeliers cast a golden glow over the sea of elegant gowns and clinking champagne flutes.

His gaze swept the crowd—then froze on a flash of white silk.

The same designer gown he'd chosen for Evelyn Sinclair at Karl's Boutique in the capital.

Alexander's pulse quickened, his lips curving unconsciously.

But after two steps, he halted.

That silhouette... wasn't hers.

The woman in white stood beside Madam Winslow. When she turned, the warmth in Alexander's eyes iced over.

"Alex?" Isabella Winslow called out eagerly, stepping forward.

He'd already turned away without a word.

That dress on her was a desecration of its pristine beauty.

"How dare he snub us like this?" Madam Winslow trembled with rage.

Before Isabella could respond, a ripple of excitement spread through the ballroom.

Every head turned toward the entrance—

Where a figure in crimson fire cut through the crowd.

Alexander found himself moving toward that blaze of color before conscious thought.

Evelyn Sinclair glided forward in a crimson mermaid gown, a rose in full bloom. Raven hair cascaded over alabaster skin as she led little Sophie by the hand, each step resonating through the hushed room.

"Who is she?"
"I've never seen her before..."
"Absolutely breathtaking..."

Whispers trailed in their wake.

At past events, Evelyn had always worn white, blending into the background like another decorative vase. The Kingsleys never acknowledged their ward publicly, keeping the Sinclair sisters' existence quiet.

Tonight marked her debut as Evelyn Sinclair—holding Sophie's hand proudly before high society.

The younger girl wore a red tulle dress with a ribbon headband. Her cheeks glowed with rare color after long hospital stays, bright eyes mirroring her sister's—a miniature Evelyn.

Alexander stared at the radiant pair, momentarily transfixed.

His approach toward Evelyn drew more curious glances.

"You made it," he murmured, his voice softening as he looked down at Sophie. "Feeling alright tonight, princess?"

"I'm great!" Sophie beamed up at him. "Thank you, Lord Alex."

The polite response tugged at something in his chest. Perhaps he'd been too harsh on the child before.

"Grandfather's waiting for you both." He straightened, gesturing for them to follow.

Evelyn gave a slight nod, guiding Sophie forward.

Alexander's hand twitched—an aborted motion to offer his arm. He wasn't sure she'd welcome the gesture, nor was public affection his custom.

In the birthday reception room, the Yearwoods were presenting their gifts. William Yearwood and Alexander's father chatted like old friends, the corporate warfare of four years past forgotten.

"Evelyn's here!" Patriarch Kingsley spotted them immediately, his face lighting up. "And my little Sophie! Come let Grandfather see you!"

Sophie approached with her carefully wrapped gift, murmuring birthday wishes. The old man swept her onto his lap, chuckling with delight.

"Don't squeeze the poor child to death, you old fool," Madeline Kingsley scolded affectionately before turning to Evelyn. "That color suits you beautifully, dear. You should wear bold hues more often."

Evelyn smiled faintly, missing the subtext.

Patriarch Kingsley leaned in with Sophie. "My future granddaughter-in-law could wear a potato sack and outshine everyone!"

The words dropped like a stone into still water, sending visible shockwaves through the room...
###Chapter 112: The Unexpected Proposal

Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley gazed at Evelyn Sinclair with tender affection, nodding approvingly at Patriarch Kingsley's words.

William Yearwood and his wife exchanged startled glances.

The Kingsleys still valued Evelyn this much?

Julian Ashford's frown deepened, his expression darkening like a brewing storm.

Alexander Kingsley's eyes briefly flickered toward Evelyn's profile...

Evelyn kept her lashes lowered, neither confirming nor denying, as if detached from the situation.

"Old man, that's not how it's done," Madeline Kingsley suddenly interjected. "Since when do you propose on someone else's behalf? Have you even asked Evelyn if she's willing?"

"Always meddling!" Patriarch Kingsley huffed before turning directly to Evelyn. "Well, Evelyn? Will you?"

Madeline cut in sharply, "This should be Alexander's question to ask! Stop stealing his moment."

"Oh!" The patriarch slapped his forehead with a hearty laugh. "Silly me. Alexander, come here. It's your turn now."

He remembered perfectly—Alexander had promised to propose during the birthday banquet.

The spectacle didn't matter. Bringing her home as his bride did.

"Grandfather..." Evelyn finally murmured, "Everyone's watching..."

"See how you've embarrassed the poor girl," Madeline chided, nudging her husband. "Not everyone has your thick skin."

"Fine, fine," the patriarch conceded cheerfully. "I'm just overjoyed. Once Evelyn gives us a chubby great-grandson, you'll be even more impatient than me!"

Madeline scoffed, "If we get a great-grandchild, of course I'll be thrilled. But your mouth today—utterly shameless."

She took Evelyn's hand gently. "Evelyn, to me, you've always been a granddaughter. No one wishes for your happiness more than I do."

Evelyn nodded obediently. "I understand your kindness, Grandmother."

She missed the fleeting complexity in Madeline's eyes.

The banquet proceeded smoothly.

Amidst the crowd, Patriarch Kingsley delivered his heartfelt speech.

Beyond scheduled performances, the emcee organized a raffle and charity auction, with proceeds funding rare disease treatments for children in remote areas.

Just as guests prepared to mingle, the banquet hall plunged into darkness.

Gasps rippled through the blackout.

A power outage at the Kingsley banquet? Either a disaster—or something extraordinary...

Evelyn tightened her grip on Sophie's hand.

She'd stayed with Sophie all evening while Alexander entertained guests. Any approaching men had been politely declined.

Please, no mishaps now...

"Look, Sister!" Sophie suddenly exclaimed.

A blue glow flickered in one corner.

Like a luminous fish, it trailed a shimmering tail as it descended from the ceiling.

Every gaze followed.

Upon closer look—it was a butterfly. A butterfly with phoenix-like resplendent wings.

Its fluttering wings scattered flecks of light like falling stars.

The specks swirled midair, transforming into rose petals that drifted downward.

Reaching hands found the petals passing through palms, landing soundlessly.

An intricately designed hologram.

Where petals touched the ground, blue ripples spread, rising to ankles, waists, overhead...

The entire hall seemed submerged underwater.

The butterfly circled once before alighting on Alexander's hair.

In a flash, it became an arrow, cleaving through the "sea" to pave a pearlescent path.

By the time Evelyn realized, it was too late to retreat.

The arrow dissolved back into a butterfly before her eyes.

Now all could see—the butterfly carried a ring.

Alexander stepped toward Evelyn.

He raised his hand. The butterfly settled on his fingertip, its wings bursting into radiant light that coalesced into a velvet jewelry box.

Silence held the room.

Evelyn's breath caught.

She'd never imagined...

Dared not guess what lay inside.

Dared not anticipate what came next.

She'd once envisioned countless proposal scenes—always in solitude, him quietly sliding a ring onto her finger.

Later, she stopped dreaming, content just to remain by his side.

In her lowest moments, she'd only begged him not to cast her aside...

Alexander cradled the box in his left palm, his right hand lifting slowly.

Evelyn recognized the motion.

He stepped forward.

Next would come the kneel, the opened box—

"Madeline Kingsley! Call an ambulance!"

A scream shattered the silence.

Eleanor Kingsley's frantic voice followed: "Stay calm! Fetch the doctor first!"

Simultaneously, Sophie collapsed heavily against Evelyn's arm...
###Chapter 113: The Hidden Truth - Her Past Betrayal

"Sophie!" Evelyn Sinclair caught her collapsing sister.

The lively young girl who had been bouncing around moments ago now lay limp in her arms like a broken marionette.

Alexander Kingsley strode forward, gathering Sophie securely in his strong arms. "Call the doctor."

"But your grandmother—"

News of Madeline Kingsley's sudden illness had just arrived. As the heir, Alexander should rush to her side immediately.

"Grandmother has enough attendants." Alexander carried Sophie swiftly toward the elevator. "She needs medical attention first. Call an ambulance if necessary."

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before following.

Sophie's eyes fluttered open before the doctor arrived.

She blinked in confusion like a lost fawn. "Sister? What happened?"

Alexander settled her on the lounge sofa. Evelyn checked her forehead—no fever.

"Probably exhaustion." After years of hospitalization, the bustling banquet had drained Sophie's energy.

The arriving doctor confirmed this. All vitals indicated a brief fainting spell with no serious concerns.

"Go check on your grandmother. I'll stay with Sophie." Evelyn couldn't leave, but she wouldn't keep Alexander either.

His dark eyes held hers for several silent seconds before nodding. "Call me immediately if anything changes."

The unopened ring box still weighed heavily in his suit pocket.

"Sister...did I cause trouble?" Sophie asked timidly after Alexander left.

"Of course not." Evelyn smoothed her hair.

Sophie had unwittingly done her a favor. Had Alexander actually proposed, how would she have responded?

Yet Madeline Kingsley's "sudden illness" proved equally timely. That exaggerated shriek had unmistakably belonged to Isabella Winslow.

Naturally, she wouldn't sit idle while Alexander proposed.

Or was it even a proposal?

Evelyn leaned back beside Sophie, closing her eyes. An unopened box could contain anything—perhaps her missing butterfly brooch?

Had he found it? Was this his way of returning it? Why else use a holographic butterfly as delivery?

"The butterflies tonight were beautiful," Sophie murmured. "Lord Alex treats you so well."

Evelyn chuckled. "This counts as 'treating me well'?"

Children saw the world simply. Alexander's past neglect was easily erased by one grand gesture. How cheaply men could atone.

Her phone buzzed—Eleanor Kingsley calling.

"Evelyn, I heard about Sophie? Is she alright?"

"She's fine now. How's Grandmother?"

"Grandmother..." Eleanor hesitated strangely. "Could you come to the banquet hall?"

"Now?"

"Yes. If inconvenient, take Sophie to the hospital first—" Her tone turned odd.

"Should I bring Sophie along?"

"No!" Eleanor blurted. "Her health comes first. Get her to the hospital."

Understanding dawned. Eleanor's summons was actually a warning to leave.

"I should check on Grandmother. It would be improper not to." Evelyn politely declined the veiled advice.

Madeline had treated her like a granddaughter all these years. Avoiding her now would invite criticism.

As for potential schemes...

She feared nothing anymore.

"Sophie, I'm going to see Madeline Kingsley. Will you be alright alone?" Evelyn instructed firmly, "Don't open the door for anyone but me. Call immediately if needed—just redial the first number."

"Got it." Sophie nodded obediently. "Not even for Lord Alex."

Hardship had forged wisdom in this innocent child.

After settling her sister, Evelyn headed to the banquet hall.

Oppressive tension greeted her upon entry.

Madeline reclined on a chaise, complexion normal but expression conflicted. Patriarch Kingsley gripped her hand, eyes wary and confused. The Kingsley parents flanked them while Alexander stood behind, face icy.

Unexpectedly, both the Ashford and Winslow families were present.

Julian Ashford gave her a subtle nod, his parents appearing bewildered. The Winslows barely concealed their smugness, shooting her venomous looks.

At the room's center stood a trembling figure—Mrs. Wilson.

The former Royal Gardens housekeeper Alexander had dismissed now appeared at the birthday gala.

"Now that everyone's here," Madeline said heavily, "speak."

"Wait." Alexander's voice cut like frost. "Family matters require privacy."

"No!" The usually meek Mrs. Wilson defied him. "Young Master Ashford is involved."

Madeline overruled, "No outsiders remain. Proceed."

Earlier, during Madeline's fainting spell, Isabella and her mother had caused a scene, disrupting Alexander's near-proposal.

Mrs. Wilson had been secretly admitted earlier by Madeline herself. Weeping over her unjust dismissal, she'd claimed knowledge affecting the Kingsley legacy—and implicating the Ashfords.

"Madame, I served the Kingsleys faithfully for eight years..." Mrs. Wilson sobbed dramatically.

"By stealing from us?" Alexander scoffed.

The Royal Gardens theft case had been resolved. Her presence here reeked of conspiracy.

"Lord Alex, I admit to greed, but that's separate from Miss Sinclair's misdeeds!" Mrs. Wilson suddenly straightened. "Who in this household lacks selfish motives? You punished me only because I exposed her secret—"

"What secret?" Madeline demanded.

Mrs. Wilson turned to Evelyn, vindictive triumph flashing in her eyes.

"Miss Sinclair's illicit affair with Young Master Ashford led to..."
###Chapter 114: She's Unworthy - Barren Woman

"Silence!"

Two sharp reprimands exploded simultaneously in the banquet hall.

Alexander Kingsley and Julian Ashford had both snapped at Mrs. Wilson in unison.

The housekeeper trembled under their glare.

Alexander's expression darkened dangerously while Julian's eyes burned with fury.

The entire room froze under the suffocating tension.

Mrs. Wilson shrank back like a frightened mouse.

Madam Winslow chuckled lightly. "Why stop now? Cliffhangers are so cruel..."

Mrs. Wilson glanced pleadingly at Madeline Kingsley.

The elderly matriarch closed her eyes briefly in silent permission.

Emboldened, Mrs. Wilson straightened under the twin daggers of their stares. "I despise Miss Sinclair because she's barren!"

She pointed accusingly at Evelyn. "She betrayed Lord Alex with Julian, got pregnant, then aborted the baby and ruined her womb!"

......

Deafening silence engulfed the hall.

Only the Winslows remained unfazed.

Evelyn stood motionless, as if detached from the scandal.

Everyone else gaped in shock.

Julian looked utterly bewildered.

William Yearwood and his wife nearly popped their eyes out.

Mr. Kingsley's jaw dropped while Eleanor gasped audibly. Patriarch Kingsley clutched his chest, trembling.

Tears trickled down Madeline's wrinkled face.

She'd known this painful truth long ago - the very reason she'd turned against the girl she'd raised.

The Kingsley bloodline must continue...

"Lies!" Julian roared. "Evelyn and I have never—"

Mrs. Ashford jumped in. "My son has never even dated!"

William nodded vigorously. "Julian's schedules are meticulously documented!"

Patriarch Kingsley exhaled in relief before slamming the coffee table. "Call the police! Arrest this slanderer!"

Mrs. Wilson hastily produced a brown envelope. "I have proof!"

Photos and documents scattered across the floor.

Patriarch Kingsley grabbed several sheets before flinging them aside. "Fakes!"

Eleanor nearly fainted upon seeing the images - sixteen-year-old Evelyn intimately posing with Julian abroad, hotel receipts bearing Julian's name.

"Where..." Eleanor whispered shakily, "did these come from?"

Mrs. Wilson cowered. "F-from Lord Alex's study..."

All eyes swiveled to Alexander.

His glacial voice cut through the air. "You're lying."

But Mrs. Wilson suddenly became animated. "There's another set in Lord Alex's safe! He's known about her betrayal for years - that's why he's neglected her!"

She turned to Evelyn with undisguised contempt. "How dare this shameless harlot enter the Kingsley household?"
###Chapter 115: To Get Rid of Her Unborn Child

"Shut up!" Alexander Kingsley's voice seemed to emerge from the depths of hell.

His bloodshot eyes locked onto Mrs. Wilson, his knuckles turning white from the force of his grip.

Eleanor Kingsley was the first to rush forward and grab his arm. "Alex! Calm down!"

Alexander violently shook off his mother.

Eleanor stumbled back several steps, nearly falling.

"Have you lost your mind?" Mr. Kingsley steadied his wife and glared at his son.

"Stop him!" Eleanor pushed her husband away and shouted.

Alexander had already charged at Mrs. Wilson, yanking the lace trimming from the sofa.

"Hold him back!"

"Alex—"

Both Patriarch Kingsley and Madeline Kingsley cried out in alarm.

Mr. Kingsley lunged to pull his son away but was shoved back by Alexander's elbow.

The lace strip was already tightening around Mrs. Wilson's neck...

Julian Ashford and William Yearwood immediately leaped in to intervene.

Mr. Winslow joined the fray but took a punch to the nose from Alexander, tears streaming from the pain.

"Alex!" Madeline sobbed, supporting the patriarch who had just taken his heart medication. "Today is your grandfather's birthday!"

Isabella Winslow covered her mouth, unable to believe what she was witnessing.

Was Alexander really about to kill someone—for Evelyn Sinclair?

Mrs. Wilson collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, her eyes filled with terror.

The money... Remembering the enormous sum Isabella had promised her, she found her courage again.

"Alexander Kingsley!" Julian seized the moment to grab his collar. "Evelyn and I are completely innocent! If you don't believe me, at least believe her!"

He snatched the photos from the coffee table.

"Seven years ago, we did go abroad, but not for the reasons they claim! If there had been anything between us, you would never have had a chance!"

Alexander's gaze turned deadly.

"Say that again," he growled, his hand closing around Julian's throat.

Julian broke free and pulled out his phone.

"You want proof?" He flipped to a photo. "This shows the separate room Evelyn booked under her alias! You can verify it yourself!"

The room fell silent.

Julian's forthrightness eased the tension for everyone—except Mrs. Winslow, who muttered snidely, "Who knows if it's just a cover-up..."

"I trust Evelyn," Eleanor cut her off firmly.

"So do I," Patriarch Kingsley declared. "Alex despises deceit. If Evelyn had lied, he would have known long ago."

Mr. Kingsley quickly added, "The real issue is who's behind this servant!"

"I'm not lying!" Mrs. Wilson rasped, pulling a document from her pocket. "Evelyn went abroad to terminate her pregnancy!"
###Chapter 116: Alexander's Bitter Laughter at His Own Relentless Hope

"What nonsense are you spouting!" Julian Ashford's voice trembled with fury. "An abortion? How could Evelyn possibly have been pregnant?"

Moments ago, he'd thought Alexander had gone too far striking a servant.

Now he wished he could strangle this venomous liar himself.

Mrs. Wilson waved the medical documents tauntingly.

"These are hospital records. Educated people like you should understand what 'D&C surgery' means." She shook the papers triumphantly. "And ruptured fallopian tubes... The doctor said she'll never bear children!"

Nearly illiterate, she'd memorized every damning phrase fed to her.

Julian lunged for the documents.

Alexander seized them first.

His eyes scoured the page, each medical term carving deeper into him. When he finally looked at Evelyn, devastation fractured his gaze.

D&C surgery.

Infertility.

If this record was authentic...

Then the bloodstained sheets from their first night had been an elaborate deception.

Seven years ago, Alexander had obtained proof of Julian and Evelyn traveling abroad together.

He'd suppressed his rage then—they weren't officially together.

Until that fateful night.

He'd doubted her, but at least believed she'd given him her virginity.

Now this document claimed sixteen-year-old Evelyn had aborted Julian's child overseas.

What did that make their relationship?

He'd rather have never met her than face this betrayal.

"Let me see!" Eleanor Kingsley's shaking hands snatched the papers, her eyes scanning unfamiliar medical jargon. "What does this actually say?"

Madam Winslow smirked. "Sterility. Even a fool could understand that."

"Out!" Eleanor slapped the papers across Madam Winslow's face. "This is none of your concern!"

The pages grazed Madam Winslow's cheek, igniting her temper.

"Are the Kingsleys blind? Treasuring this damaged goods!"

Mr. Kingsley shoved her aside. "Mind your tongue!"

Mr. Winslow tried restraining his wife, only to receive a stinging slap.

"Dad! Mom!" Isabella stamped her foot in frustration.

Chaos erupted in the room.

Only Evelyn remained still.

Not once had she defended herself.

Alexander's gaze locked onto her.

A chilling realization struck him—the calmest person in this storm was its eye.

Neither the accusations nor the "evidence" had ruffled her composure.

This silence cut deeper than any denial.

"Explain." Alexander's voice emerged from some abyss.

Evelyn traced the edge of her phone absently.

"Nothing to explain."

The words shattered Alexander's last restraint.

He remembered tonight's meticulously planned proposal.

The ring designs revised countless times.

What a fool he'd been.

With trembling hands, he thrust the document before her.

"One last chance. Is this true?"

Evelyn studied the paper.

Those clinical terms had once brought unbearable pain.

She remembered the snowy night.

The metal pipe striking her abdomen.

The biting cold.

What she'd fought so desperately to protect.

Waking up thinking the nightmare was over...

Only to learn it had just begun.

"What's written here..." Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile, her eyes glimmering with something fragile, "...is all..."

"D&C isn't just for abortions!"

Julian's interruption came like a lifeline.

He could've stayed silent. This was his chance to reclaim her.

But he couldn't watch the light fade from her eyes.

Couldn't bear her smiling through the agony.
###Chapter 117: Cracks in Trust

Crimson flooded Julian Ashford's vision.

He finally understood—despair wasn't gray. It was blinding scarlet.

Like fireworks at life's final moment.

"The D&C surgery wasn't just for miscarriage." The doctor's words stabbed his heart. "Internal bleeding from abdominal trauma required uterine evacuation."

Julian's breath turned ragged.

That winter's truth surfaced—their "romantic getaway" had been a fight for survival.

Only the freezing temperatures had saved Evelyn Sinclair, slowing blood loss during those two endless hours.

"Injured?" Isabella Winslow feigned shock. "How does one get hurt on vacation?"

Her theatrics mirrored her mother's. Julian's knuckles whitened.

"Want the truth?" He advanced, eyes dark. "Why we left the country? What really happened?"

Isabella retreated, smile stiffening. "Not my concern."

"While Evelyn was risking her life for the Kingsleys, you and Alexander were—"

"Julian!"

Evelyn's voice halted him. A faint smile touched her lips. "Truth needs no defense."

"I believe you." Alexander Kingsley's gaze locked onto her. "But tell me—what happened seven years ago? Was that scar from then?"

He remembered the pale mark on her abdomen, faded when he'd seen it.

Two years too late.

"Answer me." His voice cracked.

Seven years.

Those photos had haunted his safe.

Alexander never dared ask, fearing the answer.

Evelyn met his stare. "The scar is from then. Julian and I were innocent. No pregnancy. No abortion."

Her lashes lowered. "But I can't conceive."

Alexander seized her arms. "What were you doing?"

"You said you believed me." Her voice trembled. "Why demand explanations?"

"Alex!" Eleanor Kingsley pulled at him tearfully. "You're hurting her!"

"Just the truth." His grip tightened. "Is that so hard?"

He finally released her.

"Silence now," he hissed, "means silence forever."

Evelyn said nothing.

Her phone screen dimmed beside her skirt—a final image of Sophie held hostage by William West in a locked room.

A blatant threat.

William had come for vengeance.

When Julian nearly revealed everything, she'd almost broken.

Seven years of anguish begged to be spoken.

But she couldn't.

Sophie was all she had left.

"Then... forever it is." She swallowed tears.

"Evelyn!" Alexander roared.

Eleanor clung to him as Julian suddenly pulled Evelyn close.

Before everyone, he clasped her hand.

"Alexander, seven years is enough!" Julian's voice shook. "You never deserved her."

"You want proof of our guilt? Here."

A diamond ring slid onto Evelyn's finger.

"My fiancée now. The Kingsleys mean nothing to her."

Alexander lunged.

Chaos erupted.

Until Madeline Kingsley's shriek pierced the noise: "Charles! What's wrong? Wake up—!"
###Chapter 118: The First Time He Called Her "Miss Sinclair"

The birthday banquet for Patriarch Kingsley took an unexpected turn.

The joyous celebration of his eightieth birthday was shattered by the wail of ambulance sirens.

After emergency treatment from the doctors, the elderly man was rushed to the hospital.

Guests exchanged uneasy glances, whispering as they made their exit.

No one had anticipated the party would end so abruptly—just as Alexander Kingsley was about to propose...

The news spread like wildfire.

By dawn, high society buzzed with gossip: The Kingsley heir had fallen for an unworthy woman, and his failed proposal had given the patriarch a heart attack.

The rumors grew increasingly outrageous.

Evelyn Sinclair's identity morphed from ordinary girl to every conceivable villainous role...

She didn't even get to accompany the patriarch to the hospital.

The moment the doctors arrived, she turned and ran toward Sophie's room.

The door was locked.

After persistent knocking, Sophie finally cracked it open timidly.

"Sister!" The trembling girl flung herself into Evelyn's arms.

The room stood empty.

"That brother opened the door himself," Sophie's voice quivered. "I tried to call for help, but he took my phone..."

Evelyn held her tight.

On the nightstand lay a single note:

[Did you like my gift?]

The handwriting cut like a blade.

William West.

After seven years, his schemes had grown more refined.

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile.

She knew William wouldn't harm Sophie—her only vulnerability. He'd only "protect" her too well.

"Let's get you back to the hospital."

On the way, Evelyn smirked bitterly.

So she wasn't the only one dreading Alexander's proposal.

Isabella Winslow, William West, Mrs. Wilson... even Madeline Kingsley.

They'd all been more desperate than her to stop the engagement.

At least it saved her some trouble.

"Sister," Sophie suddenly tugged her sleeve as they parted, "is this the ring from Brother Alex?"

Only then did Evelyn notice Julian Ashford's ring still on her finger. The chaos had made her forget entirely.

"No," she removed it, watching Sophie's hopeful expression dim. "Just borrowed."

...

Outside Patriarch Kingsley's hospital room.

Evelyn reached for the door just as it swung open violently.

Alexander stood before her.

He seized her wrist with bruising force, nearly pulling her off balance.

"What are you doing here?" His voice could freeze hell, his gaze utterly foreign.

Evelyn opened her mouth.

"Miss Sinclair," he cut her off, "Kingsley affairs are none of your concern."

Miss Sinclair.

The title sliced through thirteen years of ties to the Kingsley family like a guillotine.

The realization struck her—she'd always been an outsider.

"I'm sorry." She turned to leave.

Alexander's grip tightened.

"Grandfather asked for you the moment he woke," he forced her to meet his eyes. "Now you just walk away?"

Evelyn looked up at him.

"What do you want from me?" Her voice remained steady. "I can't stay, I can't leave."

Seven years of suppressed grievances surged forth.

So he'd believed her unfaithful all along.

William's carefully forged evidence had made him tolerate her for years.

"If you truly love Julian Ashford," Alexander ground out, "why come back to deceive me?"

"Alex!" Eleanor Kingsley appeared, yanking him away. "Have you lost your mind?"

She shielded Evelyn behind her.

"Take your tantrums to the gym!" The matriarch glared at her son, pulling Evelyn inside. "You stay out!"

The door slammed in Alexander's face.

On the bed, the weakened patriarch reached out.

"Evelyn..." He struggled with his oxygen mask.

Tears finally spilled down Evelyn's cheeks.

"Grandfather, I'm so sorry..."
###Chapter 119: Truth in the Haze

"Evelyn, I understand everything." Patriarch Kingsley's clouded eyes held rare clarity. "You and Julian are innocent in this. That worthless Alexander doesn't deserve you..."

The entire Kingsley family had witnessed Evelyn Sinclair's devotion to Alexander Kingsley.

Her gaze toward Julian Ashford remained as pure as freshly fallen snow, devoid of any improper affection.

Only Alexander remained willfully blind.

"Grandfather..." Evelyn bit her lower lip hard.

Her eyes burned, but she forced back the tears.

"Most of Mrs. Wilson's accusations tonight were baseless." She drew a shaky breath. "But it's true... I can't conceive."

The words sliced through the silence like a blade.

"This secret has weighed on me for years." Her voice trembled. "I couldn't face it..."

Alexander chose to ignore the evidence.

Hadn't she also been running from this truth?

She'd clung to those fleeting moments of warmth, deluding herself: He'll never marry me anyway.

Let me steal just a little more time...

Until the Butterfly Brooch incident became the final straw.

"Grandfather, I'm sorry." Evelyn lifted tear-filled eyes. "Alexander and I are over."

She'd intended to play her role until the birthday banquet ended.

But fate demanded the truth tonight.

"Evelyn, modern medicine—" Madeline Kingsley interjected urgently.

"Enough!" The patriarch cut her off sharply. "Whether she can bear children or not, Alexander will marry Evelyn! The Kingsleys don't betray those who've shown us kindness!"

Evelyn smiled.

The dam broke at last.

"Grandfather, this isn't about gratitude." Her voice softened. "The warmth your family gave me will stay with me forever."

When the old man tried to protest, she gently stopped him.

"You should rest now." She tucked his blanket securely. "I'll keep watch tonight."

At 2 a.m., Eleanor Kingsley forcibly sent her to a hotel.

In the car, Evelyn texted Julian:
[Returning your ring tomorrow.]

No reply came.

As she stood before her hotel room door, her phone suddenly rang.

"Evelyn, where are you?" Julian's voice held uncharacteristic urgency.

"The hospital." The lie came easily as she swiped her keycard.

"I'm coming now."

"It's too late—" The door resisted when she pushed.

"This can't wait until tomorrow!" Julian insisted with rare firmness.

Exhaustion crashed over her. "Tomorrow..."

The words died as she realized someone held the door shut.

She turned—and met a pair of stormy eyes.

Alexander braced the door with one hand, snatching her phone with the other before smashing it against the wall.

The stench of alcohol assaulted her senses.

"Let go!" Evelyn struggled violently. "Have you lost your mind?"

The scene mirrored their confrontation five years ago.

This time, he slammed her against the wall, her spine protesting painfully.

"You knew I'd go mad, yet you schemed with him behind my back?" His voice rasped with drunken fury.

She'd never seen him intoxicated before.

"You should've told me sooner." His fingers dug into her chin. "That you love Julian. That you want to be with him!"

Evelyn closed her eyes.

"Did you only remember me when Julian rejected you?" A bitter laugh escaped him. "Now that he wants you back, you're leaving me?"

Each word carried the sour tang of liquor against her face.

"Evelyn, are you really this cheap?"

Silence.

Then his voice dropped to a whisper: "Why... am I the cheap one?"

Her eyes flew open.

A flash of vulnerability vanished from his gaze.

"Perhaps..." She spoke softly. "We're truly incompatible."

Rage darkened Alexander's expression.

"Too late for that." He dragged her toward the bed. "Far too late."
###Chapter 120: The Truth of Last Night

Alexander Kingsley had shown Evelyn Sinclair with his actions that some boundaries, once crossed, could never be undone.

So what if it was wrong?

She was his now. There would be no escape for her.

......

At dawn, Evelyn slipped out of the hotel, her body aching.

She glanced back at Alexander, still asleep, his brow furrowed even in slumber.

Bending down, she gathered the torn remnants of her evening gown from the floor and changed into the casual clothes Eleanor Kingsley had given her the night before.

The click of the door handle echoed sharply in the silent room.

"Evelyn..."

Alexander's sleep-muffled voice froze her in place.

They were over.

Last night had been a mistake.

Whether he remembered or not, she would pretend it never happened.

Thankfully, he merely turned over and drifted back into sleep.

Evelyn fled into the elevator as if demons chased her.

......

Isabella Winslow stood trembling before the hotel room door, keycard clutched in her fingers.

She had rushed to the bar after William West's midnight message, only to find it empty.

Tracking Alexander down had led her here—to where Evelyn had been.

"After years of patience, don't ruin everything now," William's words replayed in her mind. "Follow my plan. There's still a chance."

The lock beeped as the card activated it.

The room was icy. Isabella shivered.

In the dim morning light, she saw the sharp profile of the man in bed.

Her pulse hammered wildly.

Fingers shaking, she began unbuttoning her blouse—then hesitated.

"What are you doing?"

His voice turned her blood to ice.

Alexander was awake.

Isabella stood paralyzed, nails digging into her palms.

Why was she always one step too late?

"You...you were exhausted last night," she forced a coy smile, cheeks flushing. "I didn't have the heart to wake you..."

Alexander's frown deepened.

He remembered Evelyn.

Fragmented memories filled with her.

"Who sent you?" His tone could cut steel.

"It was Evelyn..." Isabella fumbled for the keycard. "She said you were drunk—asked me to check on you..."

His expression darkened dangerously.

"Get out."

Isabella bit her lip. "Alexander, we've already—"

"Mrs. Wilson works for you, doesn't she?" His冷笑 was glacial. "Shall I pull the Royal Gardens surveillance footage?"

She paled.

"I—"

"Three seconds. Disappear."

......

In the hallway, Isabella blocked Alexander's path.

"You can't do this to me!" Her voice rose hysterically. "Last night you—"

"Proof?" His gaze was contemptuous. "I recall nothing."

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

"Seven years ago, without me, Kingsley Group would've collapsed!" She screamed. "I saved your life!"

Alexander stopped. His stare grew arctic.

"Did I ask you to?"

The words stabbed like knives.

"Then why her?" Isabella shrilled. "Why does Evelyn get everything?"

Suddenly, Alexander smiled. It never reached his eyes.

"Because I love her." Each syllable was a blade. "What does owing you have to do with it? I thought you despised trading favors, Miss Winslow."

Isabella staggered back as Alexander strode away.

So he knew.

Every cruel word she'd thrown at Evelyn. Every servant she'd bribed.

......

Alexander went straight to the hospital.

The moment he opened the ward door, his gaze locked onto the slender figure curled on the cot.

Those hazy memories sharpened.

He was certain now—it had been her last night.

But as he took his first step toward her...
###Chapter 121: Heartfelt Confession

Alexander Kingsley took a step forward.

Patriarch Kingsley suddenly sat up in his hospital bed.

"Shh—" He raised a finger to his lips, whispering urgently. "Get out. Evelyn stayed with me all night. Let her sleep."

Alexander froze.

All night?

His gaze shifted to Evelyn Sinclair curled up on the cot. Only half her face peeked out from the blanket, long lashes casting shadows under her eyes.

His heart clenched like an invisible fist had seized it.

That woman last night... couldn't have been her?

"Alexander?" Madeline Kingsley approached him in the hallway. "Perfect timing. Your grandmother needs to speak with you."

She pulled him to the far end of the corridor.

"It's time to end things with Evelyn." The old woman cut straight to the point.

Alexander's expression remained impassive.

"I've always adored Evelyn. Wanted her as my granddaughter-in-law since she was little." Madeline sighed. "But you're the Kingsley heir now. The family line—"

"If you truly care for her," Alexander interrupted coldly, "why did you allow Mrs. Wilson to humiliate her in public?"

"I—"

"Would you tolerate that treatment if she were your blood granddaughter?"

Madeline paled.

"I know you still have feelings for her." Her eyes reddened. "But this relationship is impossible... Over my dead body will you two be together!"

"Fine." Alexander turned on his heel and left.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan Miller nearly had a heart attack finding him on the rooftop.

"Lord Alex! Don't do anything reckless!" He lunged forward in panic.

Alexander sat beyond the railing, silhouette bleak against the skyline.

"Schedule a procedure," he said abruptly.

"What procedure?"

"A vasectomy."

——

After catching up on sleep, Evelyn arranged to meet Julian Ashford at a nearby café.

She pushed open the door—only to find Mrs. Ashford waiting instead.

"Evelyn, dear." The woman grasped her hand with false sweetness. "About what happened years ago... I owe you an apology."

Evelyn silently withdrew her hand.

"Name your price for compensation." Contempt flickered in Mrs. Ashford's eyes.

"Mother!" Julian appeared suddenly.

He pulled Evelyn away. "We're leaving."

"Stop right there!" Mrs. Ashford snapped. "How dare you associate with this shameless—"

"Shameless what?" Julian's laugh was icy. "Not good enough for the Ashford fortune?"

He marched out with Evelyn, never looking back.

Around the corner, Evelyn produced the diamond ring.

"Thanks for last night."

Julian didn't take it.

He gazed at her, voice trembling.

"It wasn't an act."

"Evelyn... I'm truly in love with you."

Sunlight filtered through the trees, fracturing into starlight in his eyes.
###Chapter 122: You Have No Idea of Evelyn's True Capabilities

Evelyn looked up, meeting Julian's deep gaze.

His eyes were crystal clear, like untouched mountain springs.

She suddenly realized she'd never truly studied them before.

In past encounters, he'd always been the first to look away—as if deliberately avoiding something.

Now she noticed his sharp features, the noble bearing in his brow that rivaled Alexander's.

"Don't feel obligated, Julian." Evelyn broke the silence first. "Last night was my oversight. I didn't mean to trouble you."

She extended the ring toward him. "If you hadn't saved me that year, I would've frozen to death. How could I repay that debt by burdening you further?"

Julian didn't take it.

His voice was low but firm. "I love you, Evelyn."

The words dropped like a stone into her calm heart.

"When Mrs. Wilson framed you, part of me wished it were true." He stepped closer. "If you'd been carrying my child, I'd never have let you return to Alexander."

Evelyn froze.

She'd never imagined his kindness stemmed from such feelings.

"I'm sorry, Julian. I truly didn't know—" Her voice trembled.

"Then what did you think it was?" His smile was bitter.

"I thought... just friendship." She answered honestly.

Julian grasped her hand, pressing the ring into her palm.

Evelyn recoiled as if burned.

The ring hit the floor with a crystalline chime.

"I'm not ready for a new relationship." She met his gaze squarely. "I appreciate your feelings, but—"

"It's fine." Julian bent to retrieve the ring. "I can wait."

The diamond glittered coldly under the lights.

He'd prepared this ring for five years.

"Don't wait." Evelyn's tone was calm. "I can't have children. I'm not marriage material."

"We have Sophie." He'd anticipated this. "If you want more, we can adopt."

The words did stir something in her.

But clarity returned swiftly.

If she could raise Sophie alone, a man wasn't a necessity.

———

At the hospital, Evelyn encountered Madeline Kingsley.

"Do you resent me, dear?" The old woman's eyes were uneasy.

"No." Evelyn smiled. "I was never worthy of Alexander."

Madeline exhaled. "I'll find you a good match."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

To elite families, a barren woman was damaged goods.

But arguing was pointless.

———

Alexander never appeared that night.

Near dawn, Eleanor arrived looking strained.

[Alex is hospitalized] she texted.

Evelyn's chest tightened. [What happened?]

[Stomach issues] Eleanor replied, brow furrowed.

She omitted the morning rumors—Alexander spotted leaving a hotel with Isabella.

That must never reach Evelyn.

Evelyn kept vigil over Patriarch Kingsley all night.

At dawn, she resolved to return to Horizon Media.

"Go ahead." The old man patted her hand. "If the Yearwoods trouble you, I'll buy Horizon for you to play with."

"Then you'll be honorary chairman." She winked.

Yet upon arrival, a transfer order awaited.

From Entertainment to Financial Department—a lateral move.

"Direct order from Mr. Yearwood." Martha frowned. "Melissa Lee's determined to break you."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Perfect timing. I was heading there eventually."

That was the empire her parents had built for Horizon.

———

"Father, you know Melissa's targeting Evelyn!" Julian stormed into the CEO's office.

William Yearwood didn't look up. "To marry into our family, she must prove her worth."

"Worth?" Julian scoffed. "Without the Sinclairs, Horizon would be nothing!"

"Enough!" William slammed his desk. "They withdrew their shares! Today's Horizon is my creation!"

Julian stared at his father's contorted face, struck by its unfamiliarity.

"Don't interfere with her work." He turned to leave. "Unless you want to lose spectacularly."

William erupted in fury.

But Julian was already gone.

None of them realized—Evelyn's displayed skills were merely the tip of the iceberg.

———

Financial Department assigned Evelyn a special position—paired with four-months-pregnant Penelope Pope.

"Penelope's maternity leave starts soon." Melissa smiled thinly. "Choose one of these assignments."

Evelyn scanned the files.

The second task read: Exclusive Interview—Alexander Kingsley.
###Chapter 123: A Double-Edged Trap

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers tapped lightly on the desk as her gaze shifted between the two documents Melissa Lee had handed her.

Both options were clearly carefully laid traps.

"I'm still new to the department and unfamiliar with the work. I'll defer to your and Penelope's arrangements," she said smoothly, pushing the decision back to them.

Melissa's lips curved slightly. "Then interview Nigel Norton. As for Alexander Kingsley..." She paused. "I heard he's suing you for defamation? I worry he might use this opportunity to make things difficult."

Melissa had already thoroughly investigated Evelyn's relationship with Alexander.

She had checked the surveillance footage from the hotel that day—there had been a third person in the room.

And the lawsuit Alexander filed against Evelyn? That was irrefutable proof.

As for those twenty truckloads of roses?

Please. If Evelyn had really climbed the Kingsley family tree, why would she still be putting up with this treatment at Horizon Media?

"Penelope," Melissa said, keeping the other woman back. "Taking maternity leave a month early? By the time you return, the editor-in-chief position might be..."

Penelope's face paled.

"Melissa, I—"

"There are ways," Melissa said meaningfully. "If you're bold enough."

Tonggowan Manufacturing was located in Kingsbury's industrial district.

Evelyn stood alone in front of the corporate building, her fingers absently tracing the edges of her recorder.

The photographer and assistant she should have been assigned had been reassigned by Penelope under the pretense of covering Alexander's interview.

The moment Nigel Norton's office door opened, his greasy gaze latched onto her.

"Reporter Sinclair, what an honor!" His beer belly led the way as he approached, his thick hand already reaching for her shoulder.

Evelyn sidestepped, slamming her recorder onto the table.

"Mr. Norton, let's begin."

Halfway through the interview, her phone buzzed.

Penelope's tearful voice came through. "Evelyn, I fell... The Alexander Kingsley interview—"

"I'm with Mr. Norton right now."

"Alexander Kingsley rarely grants exclusives!" Penelope's voice suddenly sharpened. "Nigel Norton can be rescheduled anytime!"

Evelyn glanced up.

Nigel was leering at her, his eyes lingering on her collar.

"Mr. Norton, my apologies—"

"Leaving already?" His expression darkened as he suddenly grabbed her wrist. "I canceled three meetings for this!"

Evelyn yanked her hand free.

The moment she rushed out of the office, the sharp click of heels echoed from the end of the hallway.

"That's her!"

A well-dressed woman at the front gestured, and four bodyguards immediately surrounded Evelyn.

The woman gripped Evelyn's chin, smirking. "His taste has improved this time."

A document was shoved against Evelyn's chest.

"Sign this. Admit your relationship with Nigel Norton, or else..." Her nails dug into Evelyn's skin. "I'll make sure this face of yours never sees daylight again."
###Chapter 124: Tainted Goods

The glass door of the finance department swung open. Penelope Pope entered with a coffee cup, stopping at Melissa Lee's desk.

"Manager, do you really think Evelyn Sinclair can land Alexander Kingsley's exclusive interview?"

Melissa continued painting her nails, smirking. "What do you think?"

She blew lightly on her freshly polished nails. "But that's irrelevant."

She'd set an elaborate trap from the start.

Nigel Norton, CEO of Tonggowan Manufacturing, was notorious for harassing female subordinates.

With Evelyn's looks, sending her there was like throwing a lamb to wolves.

The cherry on top? Nigel's famously jealous wife specialized in humiliating mistresses.

Melissa had already tipped off Mrs. Norton anonymously.

Even if Evelyn escaped Nigel's advances, she wouldn't avoid his wife's wrath.

As for Alexander Kingsley...

Horizon Media's finance department never secured interview rights to begin with.

The longstanding feud between Kingsley Group and Horizon ensured Alexander would never grant them an audience.

Penelope's "stomachache" delaying the interview? A complete fabrication.

By the time Evelyn escaped Tonggowan, Kingsley Group's doors would be firmly shut.

The failed interview would be her failure alone.

Melissa wasn't worried about being exposed.

With the Yearwood family backing her, even if Evelyn complained to William Yearwood himself, the cover story would hold.

Someone at Evelyn's level could never verify facts with Kingsley Group's executives.

"But...what if the Crown Prince helps her again?" Penelope still shuddered remembering the last incident.

"Even better." Melissa's eyes flashed with jealousy. "You'll get credit for the interview. Your byline."

"After what happened with Vincent Sullivan—"

"Victoria Henn was an idiot." Melissa cut her off. "This time, we'll make Evelyn agree herself."

She rotated her wrist, the nail polish glinting coldly under the lights.

Madam Yearwood's instructions were clear—transferring Evelyn here was meant to break her.

Ideally, she'd accumulate enough failures to resign in shame.

The Yearwoods wouldn't resort to crude methods.

They wanted Evelyn to admit defeat voluntarily.

Melissa was certain Evelyn would fail both interviews.

Just handling the Nortons would be nightmare enough.

Yet the next morning, Evelyn's completed assignment appeared in Melissa's inbox:

[Manager, Alexander Kingsley's exclusive interview is attached.]

Melissa nearly crushed her mouse.

Julian Ashford had intervened again!

She summoned Evelyn, face thunderous. "This was Penelope's interview. Forward it to her directly."

Let her complain if she dared.

See if Alexander Kingsley would defend her.

Evelyn simply nodded meekly. "Understood, Manager."

That submissive demeanor triggered unpleasant memories, souring Melissa's entire day.

Penelope became the department celebrity for "exclusively interviewing" Alexander Kingsley.

"Penelope, you're amazing! Even getting his daily routine!"

"He discussed management philosophy with you? He must admire you!"

"Let me touch your belly for good luck!"

The praise grew so lavish even Penelope started believing it.

When colleagues asked for details, she recited fabricated answers effortlessly.

"Perhaps it's my observational skills—I noticed his office's signature scent immediately..."

The article did mention Alexander's preferred aromatherapy brand.

This convincing detail made both Melissa and Penelope certain the interview was real.

While Penelope basked in glory, Evelyn faced mounting harassment.

Nigel Norton's calls came incessantly:

"Miss Sinclair, interviewing me tomorrow?"

"I'm at the XX Hotel. Come directly?"

"Your place works too!"

After repeated rejections, Nigel called Melissa directly: "Is Horizon playing games? I'll sue!"

Melissa feigned concern. "We'll dispatch a reporter immediately."

"I only want Evelyn Sinclair! Lawyer's letter coming tomorrow if she's a no-show!"

Hanging up, Melissa summoned Evelyn. "This is your assignment. Neglecting duties so soon looks bad."

Clearly, Nigel hadn't succeeded last time.

Now she'd see Evelyn wriggle out of this.

Once compromised with an interview subject, Evelyn would be tainted goods.

Then let's see if the Crown Prince still wanted her.

......

Nathan Carter hurried into Alexander Kingsley's office.

"Lord Alex, you need to see this."

Alexander looked up from overdue paperwork delayed by his hospitalization.

"Horizon just published your 'exclusive interview.'" Nathan handed over a tablet. "I don't recall granting one."

Alexander's gaze went straight to the byline...
###Chapter 125: The Butterfly Brooch Dispute

Alexander Kingsley's gaze turned icy as he stared at the computer screen.

"What's this?" His voice was dangerously low.

The byline showed an unfamiliar journalist named Pope instead of Evelyn Sinclair or Duan Sheli.

What shocked him more was the accompanying photo—a private shot of him working at his desk, caught mid-glance with a startled expression.

No outsider could have obtained such an intimate picture.

Nathan Carter spoke cautiously, "The writing style... resembles Miss Sinclair's work."

Only someone intimately familiar with Alexander could have captured those precise details.

Yet the byline bore no connection to Evelyn.

"Afraid I'll sue her?" Alexander's lips curled into a cold smirk.

She'd grown clever, finding herself a shield.

"There's more," Nathan continued. "Mr. Vincent Sullivan reports new leads on the Butterfly Brooch."

Alexander immediately cleared his schedule.

Since parting with Evelyn, he'd learned time was like a sponge—there was always room for matters concerning her.

The Sullivans received him personally.

Vincent came straight to the point. "You mentioned this brooch belonged to a friend's deceased family member?"

Alexander nodded.

Madam Zade pressed, "Could you share your friend's identity?"

"My apologies. I gave my word to keep it confidential."

"Male or female?" she persisted.

Alexander hesitated. "Male."

Madam Zade paled and abruptly excused herself.

Vincent explained, "My wife was safeguarding this brooch for a friend. It was auctioned without her consent, which weighs heavily on her conscience."

Alexander seized the opening. "Who is this friend?"

Vincent merely smiled.

Silence stretched between them until Vincent shifted topics. "That Horizon Media interview you gave—the writing style reminded me of Reporter Sinclair."

Alexander's brow arched.

Vincent added, "Horizon has an unfortunate tradition of suppressing newcomers. Last time, five people took credit for Evelyn's article—except her."

Alexander's chest constricted.

He pulled up the article and scrutinized every word.

So she still remembered so many details about him...

The photo's memory surfaced—that day she'd pretended to sleep in his office while secretly photographing him. He'd deleted them all except one, kept only after her pleading.

"Investigate Evelyn's current situation at Horizon," Alexander ordered abruptly.

Nathan was prepared. "Miss Sinclair was transferred to Finance Department as editor. She's scheduled to interview Nigel Norton of Tonggowan Manufacturing tomorrow."

"Nigel Norton?" Alexander's eyes darkened.

Nathan added, "Nigel boasted at yesterday's dinner about intending to—"

The air around Alexander turned glacial.

"When's the interview?"

"Tomorrow."

......

Evelyn stepped into Tonggowan's headquarters again.

Melissa Lee's threat echoed in her ears: "If you can't handle even this interview, how dare you call yourself Imperial Media's top graduate?"

Nigel's eyes gleamed with hunger when he saw her. "Reporter Sinclair! At last!"

He lunged forward.

Evelyn sidestepped with practiced ease.

Nigel's expression suddenly twisted. "You—?!"
###Chapter 126: Leaving with Nothing

"Surprised to see me?" Scarlet Archer strode into the office in her high heels. Her gaze swept over the ostentatious bouquet of crimson roses on the desk, lips curling in mockery. "My, Nigel. Since when did you learn romance?"

She settled onto the sofa, crossing her legs. "Miss Sinclair, shall we begin the interview? Where's your equipment? Bring it all out."

"What are you doing here?" Nigel Norton slammed his hands on the desk and stood. "Scarlet, tomorrow is the last day of our cooling-off period. If you want this divorce finalized, don't cause trouble now!"

Their marriage had long been dead in all but name. Scarlet couldn't wait to end it.

But Nigel had begun having second thoughts.

Tonggowan Manufacturing was the empire they'd built together from nothing. By law, Scarlet was entitled to half their assets. After months of negotiations, she'd already compromised—settling for just one-third.

Yet even that concession left Nigel seething with resentment after signing.

Tomorrow marked the end of the mandatory waiting period, requiring both parties to appear at the civil affairs bureau. But Nigel had already decided to renege.

He wouldn't give a single penny to this "haggard old woman."

Scarlet had seen through him. She'd been gathering evidence of Nigel's marital misconduct to file for contested divorce.

That day she'd intercepted Evelyn outside the office building...

"Get out!" Nigel roared, face purpling with rage. "You're not welcome here! We're divorced—this is my office now!"

Scarlet smirked. "Even divorced, I own half this company. Or have you forgotten who secured the loans to start this business? Thinking of burning bridges now? Dream on."

The words struck a nerve. Nigel hated when Scarlet brought up the past.

He grabbed her by the hair, dragging her toward the door.

"Ah!" Scarlet cried out in pain. "Nigel, let go!"

"Bitch!" Nigel backhanded her across the face. "Shut your mouth!"

Scarlet collapsed to the floor. Still enraged, Nigel kicked her prone form.

"I'll beat you to death, whore! Want money? I'll burn it for your funeral!"

He snatched a marble paperweight from the desk, raising it overhead.

"Stop!" Evelyn lunged forward, intercepting the weapon. "Are you trying to kill her?"

Nigel moved with practiced brutality. Evelyn had tried several times to intervene unsuccessfully.

"Don't worry, Miss Sinclair," Nigel's expression shifted unnaturally to a smile. "Just disciplining my wife. Domestic matter."

Scarlet lay curled on the floor, motionless.

Evelyn retreated two steps, dialing emergency services. "I'm reporting a domestic violence case at Tonggowan Manufacturing—"

"What are you doing?" Nigel roared, charging at her.

Scarlet suddenly wrapped both arms around his leg, anchoring him.

"I'm now under threat too!" Evelyn shouted into the phone.

"Who dares touch me in Kingsbury?" Nigel kicked viciously at Scarlet. "Tonggowan is a top taxpayer! Little reporter, you'd better cancel that call now!"

Hanging up, Evelyn seized her chance—a precise knife-hand strike to Nigel's throat.

He crumpled, gagging and clutching his neck.

Evelyn helped Scarlet up and hurried toward the exit. Her years with the Kingsleys had included self-defense training. A throat strike was lethal force—she'd shown restraint.

At the door, Evelyn suddenly turned back, retrieving a hidden camera from the filing cabinet.

"Stop them!" Nigel rasped.

Tonggowan security blocked them at the main entrance. As tensions mounted, police sirens approached.

Evelyn handed the camera to the officers. "Evidence is here. We need medical examination now."

Nigel actually tried snatching the camera, stopped by police.

"Officer, this is a family matter," he forced a smile. "Marital spats happen. But her—" He pointed at Evelyn. "She assaulted me! The footage proves it! I'll sue for battery!"

This insignificant reporter had refused his generous offer. As a publicly traded company's CEO, he'd done her a favor by even considering her. Since she wanted to play hardball, he'd show no mercy.
###Chapter 127: Outfoxed

"Be careful," Scarlet Archer whispered from her hospital bed, fingers clutching the sheets. "Nigel Norton is ruthless with connections in both legal and illegal circles. Just accusing him of domestic violence won't hurt him. But now that you've struck him, I fear retaliation..."

She knew that man too well.

Every time she'd called the police before, Nigel would play the model husband in front of officers. Then he'd return home and torment her twice as badly while spreading rumors that she was a shrew.

"I was so naive in my youth, always thinking I wasn't good enough." Scarlet gave a bitter smile. "I worked tirelessly to help with his business, studied management, learned foreign languages—all to be useful so he might treat me better."

And the result?

"He said those were my duties since I co-owned the company." Her voice trembled. "Now when I try to claim my rightful share, he refuses to let go."

Classic emotional abuse.

Evelyn Sinclair listened quietly, fingertips gliding across her phone screen.

"I've known for years he had a mistress and even fathered a son." Scarlet suddenly grasped Evelyn's hand. "I'm so sorry for suspecting you before..."

"It's alright." Evelyn squeezed her icy fingers. "Right now, evidence is what matters most."

"But even with proof, it might not hold up in court." Scarlet's eyes dimmed. "My lawyer says the real battle will be over asset division..."

"Scarlet," Evelyn met her gaze directly, "do you trust me?"

Scarlet froze.

This seemingly delicate young woman had a steadiness in her eyes that inexplicably inspired confidence.

"I trust you!" The words burst from her lips.

Evelyn nodded, raising her phone. "I've already posted the office footage online. Your face is blurred."

"What?" Scarlet's eyes widened. "Didn't you give it to the police?"

"The police have their methods. I have mine." A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Occupational hazard for journalists."

She'd anticipated Nigel's moves. The hidden camera in her bag, the photos on her phone—enough to make that arrogant man choke on his pride.

"Evelyn..." Scarlet's voice cracked. "Winwell Ventures will have your share too."

"Helping you helps myself." Evelyn's expression remained calm. "Just trust me and follow my lead."

Scarlet hesitated. "But will Horizon Media allow this? Nigel is one of their major sponsors..."

"Not through Horizon." Evelyn's lips curved. "My personal account."

That account with barely a dozen followers.

Duan Sheli: [Today witnessed a manufacturing tycoon assaulting his wife of twenty years—the woman who helped build his empire. Abusers need no reason. Police report filed. Received threats. If anything happens to me, this post stands as evidence.]

The attached video clearly showed Nigel Norton's snarling face.

Though her follower count was small, those dozen "casual fans" were anything but ordinary—they were Bianca White's devotees who'd followed Evelyn after the film studio incident.

The moment the post went live, Bianca's fan groups exploded.

Their beloved journalist sister threatened? Unacceptable!

Within an hour, hashtags like #TonggowanCEOAbuse trended. Nigel's dirty laundry got aired publicly, and his company's stock hit the limit-down.

"That bitch!" Nigel hurled his phone across the room. "Damage control tomorrow! Contact Horizon Media—what the hell is their reporter playing at?"

Outfoxed at his own game, he clutched his liver in fury.
###Chapter 128: The Capital Game Behind Domestic Violence

"Can we really win?"

Scarlet Archer's fingers flew across her tablet screen, the glow illuminating her pale face.

The hotel suite was dim, curtains drawn tight with only a few wall lamps casting amber light.

The PR storm ignited by Bianca White's fans had long surpassed entertainment industry gossip.

Capital, marriage, violence, betrayal—these keywords spread like wildfire across the internet.

["Modern-day Benedict Arnold! His wife built his empire, now he kicks her to the curb?"]

["That slap in the video made my blood run cold. This is a so-called successful man?"]

["Ladies remember—a man's first priority after getting rich is trading in his wife."]

["A CEO of a publicly traded company with this temperament? SEC should investigate!"]

["Stay safe, reporter girl. We're all watching."]

Scarlet's fingertip paused on one comment:

["If we don't speak for others today, no one will speak for us tomorrow."]

Her eyes burned suddenly.

"Public opinion still favors us." She looked up at the figure by the window.

Evelyn Sinclair stood before the floor-to-ceiling glass, city lights twinkling behind her.

A long-cold coffee cup rested in her hands as she gazed at the financial district skyline.

"Nigel Norton is counterattacking."

Scarlet switched screens to reveal vicious comments:

["Heard this woman caused scenes at his office. She deserved it."]

["Trying to take half his fortune? I'd hit her too."]

["Modern women want money, power, and men groveling at their feet."]

The cruelest one read:

["Spare the rod, spoil the wife. Disobedient women need discipline."]

Scarlet's hands trembled with rage. "How dare they—"

"Expected." Evelyn set her coffee down with a sharp clink.

She pulled up financial charts. "Nigel's spent three million suppressing hashtags and hired two hundred thousand trolls."

Scarlet gasped. "But we—"

"Our funds have better uses." Evelyn cut in. "What's your analysis on their financials?"

"That crisis two Mays ago..." Scarlet flipped through notes. "Suppliers demanded payments, but Nigel actually embezzled..."

3:17 AM.

Scarlet woke on the sofa to find Evelyn still typing, blue light washing over her focused profile.

"You're still up?"

"Almost done." Evelyn didn't turn. "Thirty more minutes."

As dawn's first light seeped through the curtains, Evelyn finally closed her laptop.

"Scarlet, review this."

Scarlet's eyes widened with each scroll. "This...this is our company?"

Every "standard industry practice" she'd once accepted now exposed as lethal vulnerabilities in Evelyn's analysis.

"Any issues?"

"No..." Scarlet swallowed hard. "But this is..."

"Then release it." Evelyn checked her watch. "Market opens in forty minutes."

9:30 AM.

The financial world erupted.

A hundred-slide presentation went viral—"Tonggowan Manufacturing's Accounting Fraud Exposed."

Meticulous data, airtight arguments, even minor discrepancies highlighted in bold red.

10:00 AM.

Tonggowan's stock plummeted, sell orders piling up at the limit-down threshold.

Shattering glass echoed from Nigel Norton's office.

"That bitch! How dare she!"

A trembling assistant handed him a phone. "Sir, Horizon Media is—"

"Get Melissa Lee on the line!" Nigel snarled. "I want Evelyn Sinclair gone—now!"

Meanwhile, Horizon Media's executive suite.

Melissa Lee sneered into her phone. "Evelyn, you're suspended. Return immediately to hand over your work."

On the other end, Evelyn watched traffic flow through the financial district from her hotel vantage point.

"Melissa," her voice unnervingly calm, "are you certain you want to stand with Nigel Norton?"

A sharp intake of breath.

"What do you mean?"

"Nothing." Evelyn hung up and turned to Scarlet with a smile. "The real show's just beginning."
###Chapter 129: Who Said She Only Causes Trouble

"I'm afraid I can't comply with that request." Evelyn Sinclair's voice remained gentle yet firm. "My three-day field assignment was personally approved by you, Supervisor. The investigative piece isn't finished—how can I abandon it midway?"

Melissa Lee let out a derisive laugh. "Investigation? You dare mention your so-called investigation? Tonggowan Manufacturing is threatening to sue us for breach of contract! Even a paid job turns into a disaster with you—what a talent!"

She could barely contain her amusement.

This idiot Evelyn.

Melissa had assumed the worst outcome would be Nigel Norton assaulting her. Instead, the fool had resisted and created this massive mess.

Breaching the agreement. Exposing client confidentiality. Inciting online harassment. Unauthorized absence. Defying recall orders...

Any one of these violations could sink her career.

And yet, she still dreamed of completing the assignment?

Her job hung by a thread, yet she fantasized about continuing interviews with Nigel?

"Let her flail," Melissa told Penelope Pope cheerfully. "The harder she struggles, the faster she'll drown."

Madam Ashford had promised—once Evelyn left Horizon Media, Julian would finally agree to their engagement.

"Hopefully Nigel teaches her a brutal lesson," Penelope agreed.

The entire Financial Department buzzed with gossip.

"Everyone warned her financial journalism differs from entertainment reporting. She insisted on using tabloid tactics—this disaster was inevitable."

"Tonggowan's stock hit two straight limit-downs. Nigel must despise her now."

"Will Horizon protect her? Our creed claims to defend journalists who risk everything for the truth."

"Only for legitimate cases! Should we shield reckless troublemakers?"

"Even the Crown Prince hasn't intervened this time. Probably lost patience with her."

"Tonggowan's shares are rebounding. What impact did her gossip piece really have?"

"Her hashtag's fading too... Evelyn's finished."

Fewer than five people in Horizon Media believed Evelyn could turn this around.

So when Julian Ashford got added to a group chat titled [Blizzard Support], he assumed Martha Nash had misclicked.

Martha: [Everyone here still believes in Evelyn, right?]

Julian: [?]

Iris: [Team Evelyn all the way!]

Charlie: [Evelyn will prevail!]

Julian: [What exactly are you planning?]

Martha: [Moral support.]

Julian: [??]

Martha: [The odds always seem against Evelyn, but we know she'll defy them!]

Iris: [Exactly! Evelyn's unstoppable!]

Charlie: [I'd bet a year's salary she wins!]

Martha: [Stop gambling. Remember the guy who lost bathroom-cleaning duty last time?]

Charlie: [This is different! I'm betting on Evelyn!]

Julian: [...]

Martha grew suspicious: [You don't believe in her, Crown Prince?]

Julian: [Just think you're being... unnecessarily dramatic.]

[You have been removed from the group]

Julian: ?!

They actually kicked him out?

Four nobodies dared eject him?

After all their fawning "Crown Prince" flattery?

He requested to rejoin.

[Enter passcode]

Julian tried: [Evelyn will prevail?]

[Incorrect passcode]

He tried again: [I know how she'll win.]

Instant approval.

Martha/Iris/Charlie: [SPILL!]

Julian typed deliberately: [She's going to... short Tonggowan.]

——

Short selling.

This term had once been synonymous with Autumn Detail.

"Why does everyone credit Autumn Detail for the short attacks?" Julian once asked William Yearwood, back when his father still admired the firm.

"Without their reports, how could those financiers strike so precisely? Autumn Detail possesses industry clairvoyance."

If Autumn Detail flagged a company, its flaws became undeniable.

Later, when Autumn Detail collapsed, William changed his tune: "They destroyed too many firms—karma struck back!"

Julian disagreed.

Autumn Detail only exposed existing corruption. Their reports purified the financial sector.

Horizon Media's rise owed everything to the Sinclair and Kingsley families.

It was an Autumn Detail analysis that convinced the Kingsleys to invest.

The Yearwoods' subsequent betrayal truly embodied the phrase "biting the hand that feeds."

——

"The hashtag's fading. The stock's rebounding," Scarlet Archer observed. "How do you predict today's closing?"

Evelyn's tone stayed calm. "The hashtag decline is expected—the real battle has shifted venues. Stock fluctuations are inevitable. We'll see a minor uptick at closing, but tomorrow's opening..." Her lips curved. "...I'll send it plunging again."

Did they truly believe a few social media posts could topple a publicly traded corporation?

How naive.
###Chapter 130: This Divorce Is Happening!

Evelyn's fingertip hovered over the mouse.

Nigel Norton's domestic violence video exploded across the internet instantly.

This was just the appetizer.

Scarlet Archer studied the young woman before her with undisguised awe.

"Evelyn, are you sure you've never worked in finance before?"

"Never." Evelyn shook her head. "I just grew up hearing about it."

At the Kingsley family dinners, Patriarch Kingsley loved discussing business battles. Madam Kingsley hung on every word, and Evelyn absorbed it all by osmosis.

Scarlet inhaled sharply.

This wasn't osmosis. This was raw, undeniable talent.

"Another trading halt!" Scarlet gasped. "Kingsley Group made their move!"

Evelyn's head snapped up.

The announcement flashed across the screen—Kingsley Group had officially endorsed her investigative report.

"Now!" Evelyn commanded. "Leverage every cent we have!"

Kingsley's intervention changed everything. That hundred-page professional report was designed to bury Tonggowan Manufacturing.

Scarlet's hands trembled. "We're... going to make a killing."

The next day, Evelyn dropped another bombshell.

Evidence of Nigel's asset transfers. Proof of his mistress. Every damning detail went viral.

Tonggowan's stock plummeted.

On the final day of the mandatory cooling-off period, Nigel knelt outside the marriage registry office.

"Scarlet, please..." His face was haggard. "Make Kingsley stop..."

Scarlet's laugh was ice-cold.

A dozen bodyguards stood behind her now. The abusive husband she once feared could no longer touch her.

"Sign." She slammed the divorce papers onto the table.

Nigel's mistress had already fled with his money, now wanted by police. With his world collapsing, he had no fight left.

Twitter erupted.

[That reporter girl is LEGENDARY!]
[From wife-beater to bankrupt—this is the drama I live for!]
[Team Evelyn assemble! Justice served!]

Evelyn exhaled slowly as she watched the screen.

This battle had been won—decisively.
###Chapter 131: Lord Alex Arrives to Back Her Up

Evelyn Sinclair's fan forum suddenly buzzed with activity.

Bianca White's fans, who had followed Evelyn after the film studio incident, initially came just for the drama. But this time, many were genuinely impressed by her performance.

["This reporter is absolutely badass!"]

["From today onward, I'm her die-hard fan!"]

["Not stanning anyone, but her professionalism won me over."]

The Finance Department had expected to witness her downfall. Instead, they saw a stunning comeback.

Evelyn dialed Melissa Lee's number. "Manager, I need you to approve my extended field assignment request."

The reply came through gritted teeth. "How much longer do you plan to linger there?"

"Until I complete the interview," Evelyn replied calmly. "Horizon Media does have a contract with Tonggowan Manufacturing, correct? By the way, Manager, are you aware Scarlet Archer is now in charge there?"

Of course Melissa knew.

When Tonggowan's stock hit rock bottom, Scarlet had swooped in. She acquired massive shares at bargain prices, becoming the largest shareholder overnight.

More surprisingly, Kingsley Group suddenly halted its attacks, allowing Tonggowan's stock to rebound.

During an interview, Scarlet revealed, "Despite this year's challenges, Kingsley Group has promised to invest in us."

No one understood why Kingsley first shorted the stock only to invest later. Only Nathan Carter knew Lord Alex's personal motives were behind this move.

As the interview wrapped up, Evelyn casually asked, "Scarlet, do you have any regrets now?"

A distant look crossed Scarlet's face. "My greatest regret? Probably never having children."

She gave Evelyn a bitter smile. "Youth makes us take things for granted. By the time we realize, it's too late to hold on."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

"I understand," she murmured.

Scarlet grasped her hand. "You're brilliant. If you meet the right person, don't wait too long to start a family."

"Thank you for the advice." Evelyn's smile remained flawless.

In her published article, Evelyn included a simplified finance explainer:

[Short selling means betting a stock will fall.]

[Borrow shares to sell now, repurchase later at lower prices.]

[Extremely high risk—not recommended for amateurs.]

This accessible yet insightful piece sparked another wave of discussions:

["Please do a live breakdown!"]

["You made corporate warfare read like a thriller!"]

["Who knew finance could be this exciting?"]

Melissa Lee spent the entire night fuming.

Her only consolation? Alexander Kingsley's exclusive interview still carried no byline.

But the moment this thought crossed her mind—

Alexander Kingsley himself walked into Horizon Media's headquarters.
###Chapter 132: The Instinct to Protect Her Belly

The Kingsley Group and Horizon Media had been entangled in a bitter feud for two decades.

The Kingsleys and the Yearwoods were once close family friends.

Years ago, the Kingsleys had helped Horizon Media soar to success, only to withdraw their investment and distance themselves for undisclosed reasons.

Later, Alexander Kingsley struck a devastating blow against Horizon, nearly toppling the century-old company.

Now, Horizon's feelings toward the Kingsley Group were indescribably complex.

There was gratitude—old favors best left unmentioned.

And there was hatred—blood debts impossible to repay.

Alexander's sudden visit put Horizon on high alert.

No one knew his true intentions.

Was this a casual inspection, or had he come to claim his prize?

Horizon Media had long been the juicy cut of meat he eyed for his plate.

Alexander arrived with only Nathan Carter and Ethan Miller in tow—an unusually small entourage for him.

His security team followed at a discreet distance.

William Yearwood personally greeted him, making sure Julian Ashford was kept away.

Their last violent confrontation at the birthday banquet had sent the old patriarch to the hospital.

Who knew if this demon had come to pick another fight today?

William even ordered Melissa Lee to let Evelyn Sinclair leave early.

That girl was nothing but bad luck.

The only survivor of the wiped-out Sinclair family.

Her cursed existence had killed her own parents.

To William, she was a walking omen of doom.

Her time with the Kingsleys had thrown them into chaos.

Her arrival at Horizon nearly destroyed the company.

If not for lingering fear of the Sinclairs' influence, he would have...

...

But Julian defied his father's orders.

While the entire company trembled, the crown prince strutted boldly into Alexander's presence.

Fortunately, Alexander ignored him completely—the young master wasn't his target today.

Nathan produced a newspaper clipping. "Lord Alex has reviewed Horizon's exclusive interview with him."

William's stomach tightened as he forced a smile. "What does Lord Alex think? Any feedback?"

The article had been published days ago. Alexander's delayed reaction was ominous.

Alexander remained silent.

Nathan spoke for him. "Could we meet the journalist who wrote this? Lord Alex has some questions."

The byline belonged to Penelope Pope.

When summoned, she panicked.

"I—I never interviewed Alexander Kingsley! Send Evelyn instead!" she begged Melissa.

"No! He knows her. Your name's on it—you go," Melissa shoved her forward. "You're pregnant. He won't dare harm you."

Clutching her barely visible baby bump for courage, Penelope entered the meeting room.

William was exchanging pleasantries with Nathan.

"Truly remarkable reporting," Nathan praised. "Lord Alex rarely grants interviews, and even rarer finds articles worthy of his attention..."

Penelope exhaled in relief.

She smiled as she approached. "Mr. Yearwood."

William made introductions. "This is journalist Penelope Pope, the article's author. Lord Alex, you should—"

Penelope's heart pounded.

This was her first close encounter with the legendary Kingsley heir.

Perhaps this meeting could revive her stagnant career.

Maybe she wouldn't be sidelined after maternity leave.

Alexander looked up.

His glacial gaze scraped across her face like a blade.

"Who are you?"

The air froze.

Penelope stood dumbstruck before stammering, "I—I'm Penelope Pope..."

"You wrote this?" Alexander flung the article at her.

Penelope's soul nearly left her body.

That look plunged her into an icy abyss—prey caught in a predator's sights.

"It—it has my byline..."

"A byline means you wrote it?" His voice turned arctic.

Being personally questioned by the Kingsley heir should have been an honor.

Now she only wished to vanish.

William's sharp eyes narrowed at Penelope, sensing trouble.

Nathan confirmed his suspicion. "Lord Alex hasn't granted any interviews recently. Yet this article contains startlingly accurate details."

He smiled coldly. "Because every word is true."

Writing factual insider information without an interview?

William's back prickled with cold sweat.

This was a hundred times worse than Evelyn's gossip piece!

It was handing the executioner his blade!

"Lord Alex has been occupied until now. The article reveals numerous private matters, especially that photograph—he has no memory of it."

Nathan's gaze turned piercing. "Ms. Pope, where did you obtain this information? The Kingsley Group will trace the leak and pursue legal action."

Penelope turned ghostly pale.

Her four-month pregnancy showed slightly.

Instinctively, she cradled her belly.

William was trapped.

Pressing further might endanger the fetus.

But who could withstand Alexander's wrath?

He cursed Melissa inwardly.

How dare she take such liberties with an Alexander Kingsley interview!

He'd told her to deal with Evelyn, not provoke this demon!
###Chapter 133: Pathetic Boss Begging for More?

The conference room air turned to ice.

Nathan Carter adjusted his glasses, his razor-sharp gaze piercing through the lenses. "Ms. Pope, as an industry leader, Horizon Media owes us an explanation."

William Yearwood wiped his sweaty forehead before turning to Penelope Pope. "What exactly happened?"

Penelope dug her nails into her palms.

Tell the truth? That would mean admitting plagiarism.

Lie? Evelyn Sinclair could expose her at any moment.

"The article...was assigned by the team," she stammered. "The byline was arranged by the supervisor."

A cold chuckle came from the corner.

Julian Ashford twirled a pen between his fingers, mockery dancing in his eyes.

Alexander Kingsley spoke suddenly. "Bring in the actual writer."

His words detonated like a bomb in the room.

Evelyn was applying a face mask at home when Melissa Lee's call came through like a death summons.

"Get back to the office now! Within thirty minutes!"

"My shift ended." Evelyn's voice remained leisurely.

"Please! I'm begging you this time!" Melissa's voice trembled.

Evelyn's lips curved. "A supervisor groveling? How unbecoming."

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Melissa nearly ground her teeth to dust. "I'm pleading with you—"

After hanging up, cold light flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

The moment she stepped into Horizon Media's building, Melissa's demeanor flipped instantly.

"Your fake article angered Alexander Kingsley. Go explain yourself!"

News spread like wildfire.

"Penelope's viral piece was actually written by Evelyn?"

"Even crazier—she never interviewed Alexander Kingsley!"

"How dare she?"

The breakroom buzzed with gossip.

Martha Nash smashed her cup. [That bitch Melissa!]

Charlie Young paced anxiously. [Evelyn's done for this time!]

Iris Cooper remained calm. [Don't panic. There might be a twist.]

Julian checked his phone, a faint smile playing on his lips.

The conference room door swung open.

Alexander's gaze flickered when Evelyn entered.

Her casual outfit made her porcelain skin glow.

"I didn't write that article."

Her first sentence sent shockwaves through the room.

Penelope turned ghostly pale.

Alexander tapped the table lightly. "Oh?"
###Chapter 134: The Truth Revealed

"This article has nothing to do with me."

Evelyn Sinclair's voice was clear and firm.

The air in the conference room instantly froze.

William Yearwood's eyes widened in disbelief—how dare Evelyn lie to his face?

Penelope Pope's face flushed red, her fingers clutching the hem of her blouse.

Nathan Carter and the others exchanged glances, shaking their heads discreetly.

Ethan Miller was the first to speak up. "Ms. Sinclair, Lord Alex just wants to clarify the facts."

Penelope trembled with rage.

No consequences?

What was that murderous look in Alexander Kingsley's eyes just now?

Ethan shrugged.

Of course Lord Alex wouldn't hold Evelyn accountable. As for everyone else... good luck.

"I didn't write it," Evelyn said calmly. "Wasn't Penelope proud of this article before? Why push the blame onto me now that there's trouble?"

She chuckled. "Since when did Horizon Media adopt a blame-shifting culture?"

"I—" Beads of sweat formed on Penelope's forehead. "I wasn't feeling well that day, so I asked Evelyn to cover the interview for me. The article was based on her notes, so of course it had my byline."

Nathan raised an eyebrow. "Just now you claimed Evelyn wrote it. Changed your story already?"

Ethan slammed the table. "Is this how Horizon treats people? You take credit for the good work and dump the scandals on Evelyn?"

Penelope turned deathly pale, her lips trembling.

"Enough," Alexander cut in coldly. "Ethan, you're talking too much."

Ethan shut his mouth, aggrieved.

Why was it fine when Nathan defended Evelyn, but he got scolded?

"Ms. Sinclair," Alexander's gaze sharpened. "You claim you didn't write it. Do you have proof?"

Evelyn nearly laughed. "Do I need to prove I never interviewed you, Mr. Kingsley?"

She tilted her head. "The burden of proof lies with the accuser. If you say I wrote it, show me the evidence."

A flicker of amusement flashed in Alexander's eyes.

Julian Ashford couldn't suppress a quiet chuckle.

Penelope jumped in desperately. "I have proof! I called Evelyn to assign the interview—the call log is still there!"

Evelyn feigned surprise. "Penelope, Horizon never secured the interview rights. You sent me anyway?"

"I—"

"You did call me, but perhaps you should recall what was actually said?" Evelyn prompted kindly.

Penelope looked as if she'd been struck by lightning.

What had she just blurted out in panic?

Sending Evelyn without authorization—wasn't that an obvious setup?

Cold sweat drenched her back.

"Oh," Evelyn added casually, "Penelope mentioned going to the hospital that day. Do you have the medical receipt?"

Penelope's legs nearly gave out.

What receipt? Her stomachache had been an excuse!

Evelyn shook her head and fell silent.

The truth was already crystal clear.

Now Penelope genuinely felt sick to her stomach.

She'd thought pinning this on Evelyn would save her, never expecting the other woman to be prepared.

Melissa Lee's carefully laid trap had crumbled effortlessly before Evelyn.

"So," Evelyn concluded, "Penelope never sent me to the interview, and I never wrote the article. As for its origin—"

"It was you who gave it to me!" Penelope blurted.

"Proof?" Evelyn countered.

"Melissa can confirm! You emailed it to her first!"

Evelyn nodded agreeably. "Then let's check the inbox."

Penelope's heart sank.

Evelyn was far too composed.

William grimaced and called Melissa on speakerphone.

"What really happened with that article?"

Melissa's hesitant voice crackled through. "At the time... to leave no trail... I had her recall the email... and emptied the drafts..."

Dead silence filled the room.
###Chapter 135: Alexander, Let's Start Over

The air in the conference room froze.

William Yearwood's hand trembled slightly as he gripped his phone.

Melissa Lee's voice continued relentlessly through the speaker. "Evelyn must have destroyed all the evidence. If push comes to shove, we'll pin it on Penelope. She's pregnant—what can Alexander possibly do to her?"

Before she could finish—

Alexander Kingsley suddenly laughed.

The sound carried clearly through the phone.

Melissa's voice cut off mid-sentence.

Dead silence spread from the device.

She finally realized the magnitude of her mistake.

The call disconnected in panic.

"Your company's corporate culture is truly eye-opening," Alexander said leisurely. "Especially Director Lee's problem-solving methods—absolutely unparalleled."

He was genuinely amused.

Watching Evelyn Sinclair calmly navigate this farce gave him an odd sense of pleasure.

When she firmly denied writing the article, her bright eyes sparkled with mischief.

Perhaps she had orchestrated this entire trap from the beginning...

Penelope Pope covered her face, sobbing.

More heartbreaking than Alexander's fury was being discarded like trash by Melissa.

"This farce ends now." Alexander stood. "My legal team will handle the rest."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn for a fleeting moment.

To others, it looked indifferent. Only Nathan Carter and Ethan Miller recognized the tenderness beneath.

"Miss Sinclair," Nathan deliberately announced to the room, "Lord Alex expects to see you unharmed in court."

The words were impeccably crafted—

Preserving Alexander's dignity while conveying concern for Evelyn.

Most importantly, it served as a warning to everyone present.

Ethan watched Nathan with admiration.

He could never phrase things so flawlessly. His words always backfired.

......

Alexander arrived like a storm but left in eerie calm.

His反常 behavior left Horizon Media baffled.

Yet details from the meeting spread like wildfire.

Everyone knew Evelyn wrote the article.

But no one could prove it.

If she denied it, then it wasn't hers.

An unsolvable paradox.

Even more perplexing was her information source.

And Alexander's stance remained ambiguous.

Had he come to condemn—or to protect?

No one could tell.

But everyone waited with bated breath for the other shoe to drop.

Penelope was forced on leave.

Her pregnancy saved her job—for now. But team leadership had already transferred to Evelyn.

The very新人 she'd schemed to suppress.

The irony cut deep. Her worst fear had materialized in the cruelest way possible.

......

In William's office, Melissa sat pale-faced.

"Do you know why you lost?"

"Underestimation."

"With this performance, how can you handle greater responsibilities? If Alexander pursues this, even I can't protect you!"

After the scolding, William softened his tone. "Melissa, you've had it too easy. To outshine Evelyn, clever tricks aren't enough."

Evelyn was indeed capable.

But the real issue was Melissa's lack of experience.

William hoped this lesson would force her to grow...

......

At dusk, Evelyn spotted Alexander's car outside Horizon Media.

Ethan bounded over eagerly.

"Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex came personally to take you to dinner."

His blinking eyes screamed "You should be grateful."

Evelyn: "...Thanks."

Ethan: "Lord Alex reserved Red Splendor. Please, this way—"

Evelyn: "...Alright."

Alexander arrived first in a separate car.

When Evelyn took her seat, he handed her the menu. "Not sure if your tastes changed. Order for yourself."

After the dessert rejection, he'd learned caution.

Had she changed—or had he never truly known her?

"Anything's fine." Evelyn randomly pointed to a dish.

Only then did she realize—it was Alexander's favorite.

Thirteen years of habits were etched into her bones.

Dinner passed in silence.

Neither mentioned the day's events.

Until Evelyn set down her fork.

She took out her phone and met Alexander's gaze directly:

"Let's reconnect on WeChat."
###Chapter 136: He Stopped Caring About Her and Julian

Alexander Kingsley's finger hovered over his phone screen.

A transfer notification sat silently in the chat window, the amount precise down to the last cent.

The faint smile on his lips froze instantly.

"What's this?" His dark eyes lifted.

"Repayment." Evelyn Sinclair tucked her phone back into her bag. "As agreed."

Her soft voice cut like a dull blade, slowly severing the last thread between them.

Alexander flipped his phone facedown on the table.

"You handled the Tonggowan case well," he said abruptly.

Evelyn blinked. "Thanks to Kingsley Group's intervention."

"You would've succeeded without us." His gaze lingered on her face. "That report was professional."

She almost doubted her ears.

Was Alexander complimenting her?

This was more shocking than Tonggowan's stock crash.

"Consider joining Kingsley Group." His tone softened. "The analyst position suits you."

In the past, those words would've thrilled her.

Now, they only tasted bitter.

"I love my current job." She met his eyes squarely. "Finance isn't my calling."

Alexander tapped the table with his knuckles.

"I could mentor you."

"No need." Evelyn smiled faintly. "One lesson at Royal Gardens was enough."

The words "Big Brother Alex" slipped unexpectedly from her lips.

His pupils contracted sharply.

"If I could do it over—" His Adam's apple bobbed. "It wouldn't happen again."

She shook her head. "I can't afford to gamble anymore."

Her clear eyes held no trace of their former tenderness.

As she turned to leave, Alexander suddenly spoke: "I'll overlook the Julian situation."

Evelyn whirled around.

"What did you say?"

"Come back." He stood. "Let's start fresh."

She nearly laughed aloud.

"What about Isabella Winslow?"

The air turned glacial.

"Leave the past behind." His voice roughened. "Quit Horizon Media. I'll fund your own company."

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

"So..." She forced the words out. "You admit it?"

"Drop the lawsuit. Come home." He stepped closer. "Last chance."

Evelyn suddenly laughed.

"Alexander Kingsley." She enunciated each syllable. "You disgust me."

"Evelyn!" He seized her wrist. "You're choosing Julian?"

"I choose freedom." She wrenched away. "Let go!"

"Prove it." His knuckles whitened. "Leave Horizon."

She lifted her chin.

"Who do you think you are?"
###Chapter 137: Courtroom Confrontation - Alexander Takes the Stand

"Alexander Kingsley, we're over!" Evelyn Sinclair wrenched her wrist free, the skin already reddening from his grip. "You have no right to control me."

His eyes darkened instantly. "After all these years living off the Kingsleys—"

"Living off you?" Her bitter laugh cut through his words. "That was paid for with my parents' lives."

The accusation hung between them like a blade.

The air turned to ice.

Evelyn spun away, tears betraying her despite furious swipes at her cheeks. She ducked into an empty alcove, muffled sobs escaping through her fingers.

How had it come to this?

Even basic decency was too much to ask for now.

"My lord..." Ethan Miller ventured cautiously, "Miss Sinclair seems—"

Alexander remained motionless in the shadows, gaze locked on that trembling silhouette. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Not another word."

Evelyn walked thirteen kilometers.

From dusk till midnight, she finally collapsed onto a garden bench outside her apartment complex. The autumn wind carried away her anger, leaving only exhaustion.

"Lord Alex, she'll catch cold." Ethan rubbed his aching legs, voice hushed.

Alexander said nothing, his overcoat crumpled in white-knuckled fists.

Under the streetlamp, Evelyn hugged herself, the solitary figure dwarfed by the empty plaza.

Then a tall silhouette approached.

"Julian?" She looked up, startled.

Julian Ashford draped his jacket over her shoulders. "I've been searching all night."

The tenderness in his voice made Alexander's hands clench.

"About next week's hearing—I've retained a lawyer for you." Julian settled beside her. "Meet this weekend?"

Evelyn stared at her phone. "Thank you."

No firm in Kingsbury would touch her case. The Kingsley Group's influence reached even the court-appointed attorneys—all fresh graduates.

Julian brushed a stray lock from her forehead. "Let me walk you up."

Their retreating figures burned in Alexander's vision.

"Identify that lawyer." His words could frost glass. "Every firm in this city will know—defying Kingsley means professional suicide."

The courthouse swarmed with reporters on trial day.

"Alexander Kingsley actually showed up!"

"Look—that car!"

A black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop. Bodyguards raised umbrellas, creating an impenetrable shield.

Through the gaps, cameras caught only the gleam of Alexander's Oxfords as he stepped onto the pavement...
###Chapter 138: Crushing Defeat

A black Maybach screeched to a halt outside the courthouse.

The door swung open as Alexander Kingsley stepped out, his long legs unfolding gracefully. A bodyguard immediately opened a black umbrella, shielding him completely.

Reporters swarmed forward but only captured blurred silhouettes.

"Missed him again!" someone groaned, stomping in frustration.

"Does it matter? Everyone knows what Lord Alex looks like," a colleague consoled. "Wait for Evelyn Sinclair—she's today's main event."

Thirty minutes later, a silver van pulled up.

A fully masked man jumped out first, then carefully helped a young woman in sunglasses and a face mask descend.

"It's Evelyn!" The press erupted into chaos.

Martha Nash followed, arms outstretched like a shield. "Give us some space, folks! Professional courtesy!"

Though restrained by courthouse decorum, the trio still struggled to move forward.

Once inside the lounge, the young woman yanked off her mask. "I was suffocating!"

It was Iris Cooper.

She froze mid-complaint.

Across the room, Alexander stood watching her with glacial intensity, flanked by his lawyer and assistant. The air turned arctic.

"Where is Evelyn?" His voice could freeze hell.

Meanwhile, the real Evelyn Sinclair stepped off a city bus.

Dressed in a plain tee and jeans with a canvas bag slung over her shoulder, she strolled casually toward the courthouse. Reporters milling about didn't even glance her way.

Not until she reached the entrance did a Horizon Media journalist gasp. "Is that—Evelyn Sinclair?"

Cameras snapped up too late, capturing only her retreating silhouette.

"Damn it! Wasted the whole morning!"

In the lounge, Martha's group sat like chastened schoolchildren under Alexander's interrogator's glare.

The door opened.

Eyes locked.

Alexander glanced at his watch first. "Ten minutes to reconsider."

"Unnecessary." Evelyn took her seat calmly.

The closed-door hearing began with two surprises:

The legendary Kingsley Group legal team was absent—Alexander had brought only one attorney.

More shocking? Evelyn had none.

No lawyer in Kingsbury would take her case. Even Julian Ashford's contacts had declined.

"This is unwinnable," one attorney told Julian flatly.

Julian understood Alexander's game—forcing Evelyn out of Horizon Media. Even if the court didn't award the full eight million, the damages would exile her from Kingsbury.

Leave the city? Alexander would never allow it.

Julian's lips curled. If only he'd shown this ruthlessness earlier.

——

"My client's rebuttal evidence."

Alexander's lawyer exuded confidence.

"This alleged 'coat-sharing' photo actually shows Isabella Winslow snatching my client's jacket, with the image capturing the moment he retrieved it."

Surveillance footage played clearly: Isabella grabbing the coat, Alexander reclaiming it.

"The jacket was donated immediately after her use. Here's the receipt."

The judge turned to Evelyn. "Does the defendant dispute this?"

She met the lawyer's gaze. "Late-night meetings at private clubs require more than this to prove innocence."

"That evening, Mr. Kingsley conducted business without encountering Ms. Winslow. Club records and witnesses confirm this." The attorney remained unflappable. "Their paths crossed only upon departure when she seized the coat from his assistant."

Alexander spoke suddenly, eyes burning. "You never investigated properly."

"Any further response?" the judge pressed.

Evelyn shook her head.

So now he knew how false accusations felt.

But had he checked whether she'd waited outside that club that night? Did he know about the despair in that freezing wind? Or how his subordinate's "Get lost!" had shattered her when Sophie was critically ill?

——

"This 'ring-shopping' video actually shows Isabella purchasing jewelry alone. My client bought only this brooch that day."

The lawyer displayed an exquisite dragonfly pin.

Piece by piece, every "smoking gun" in the articles disintegrated.

"Does the defendant refute this evidence?" the judge asked.

Alexander cut in first. "Evelyn, I told you—there was never anything between Isabella and me."

Yet she hadn't believed him. Insisted on breaking up. Even after he disciplined the staff, she refused to return. Now with proof before her, if she'd just yield, he'd settle this instantly.

But if she remained stubborn...

Alexander's eyes darkened. He'd backed himself into a corner. Had he known she wrote those articles, he'd never have sued.

Because regardless of the verdict—

He'd already lost.
###Chapter 139: Love in a Cage

Evelyn Sinclair and Alexander Kingsley stood at the edge of a precipice.

If Alexander won this lawsuit, what would he gain?

Only public vindication—while losing her forever.

He didn’t care about reputation or apologies. He only wanted Evelyn back.

Back at Royal Gardens, she had been like a delicate ornament, quiet and unobtrusive.

Now that she was gone, every second without her was agony.

From the moment he brought her home thirteen years ago, he never imagined losing her.

But losing the case…

That was worse than winning.

It would mean admitting there had been something between him and Isabella Winslow.

The thought was unbearable.

"Does the defense have further evidence to submit?" The judge’s voice snapped Alexander back to reality.

Evelyn slowly raised a USB drive.

"I have video evidence of Alexander Kingsley and Isabella Winslow."

Alexander’s brow furrowed.

What else did she have?

His legal team exchanged glances. They had vetted every possible piece of evidence.

The judge motioned to play the video.

The moment the footage appeared, Alexander’s face darkened.

Isabella stepped out of a hotel room, pacing the hallway.

Five minutes later, Alexander arrived.

They exchanged words before Isabella followed him out of the camera’s view.

"Where did you get this?" Alexander shot to his feet.

He had tried to retrieve this footage before, only to find the hotel’s data wiped.

"Do you have the full recording?" He moved toward Evelyn, urgency in his voice.

The judge immediately intervened.

Alexander gripped the railing, veins bulging.

"Evelyn, hand over the complete video!"

She met his gaze calmly.

"Alexander, you were with Isabella that night, weren’t you?"

Her words stabbed into his heart.

"Can you honestly say nothing happened?" she pressed.

This wasn’t the Evelyn he knew.

Cold. Calculating.

She wasn’t jealous or heartbroken—just determined to win.

"Is victory all you care about?" His voice was raw. "Or do you no longer care who I’m with?"

She didn’t love him anymore.

The realization froze him to the core.

"Plaintiff, answer the defendant’s question," the judge reminded.

"Eve," Alexander suddenly used her childhood nickname, "I endured seven years. Now you can’t tolerate a single grain of sand?"

"So you admit it?" Evelyn pushed.

Before she could finish, Alexander vaulted over the railing.

The judge slammed the gavel in alarm.

Evelyn tried to retreat, but the defendant’s box trapped her.

Alexander seized her wrist, his other hand cradling the back of her neck.

In front of the entire courtroom, he crushed his lips against hers.

"Plaintiff! Cease immediately!" the judge roared.

Evelyn fought wildly, but his grip was unbreakable.

Only when the judge nearly stood did Alexander release her.

"Your Honor, we request an in-court settlement." He pulled Evelyn close. "She’s my fiancée."

The judge’s mustache quivered with outrage.

Evelyn wrenched free. "We have no relationship! The video proves he was with Isabella. Does he dare deny it?"

Tears shimmered in her reddened eyes.

Alexander watched her, heart turning to ice.

She was within reach, yet impossibly distant.

"I can’t," he admitted hoarsely.

This was the one piece of evidence he couldn’t refute.

His legal team had prepared for everything—except this.

He had lost.

......

Half an hour later, the verdict was announced.

Alexander Kingsley had lost the case!

The news exploded across the internet.

"Alexander Kingsley actually lost?"

"After all his denials… Typical man!"

Reporters buzzed with speculation.

"What kind of irrefutable proof did Evelyn have?"

"Rumor is she didn’t even hire a lawyer—fought Kingsley Group’s legal dream team alone!"

......

Evelyn’s fans celebrated.

[Did Lord Alex lose for love?]

[This is true devotion! I believe in romance again!]

Isabella’s supporters fired back.

[The verdict is out. Stop deluding yourselves!]

[Isabella is the real fiancée!]

The fan wars raged across trending topics.

......

At the barbecue restaurant, Martha Nash poured Evelyn a glass of juice.

"Evelyn, how did you win?" Iris Cooper leaned in eagerly.

"I had evidence he couldn’t dispute." Evelyn shrugged.

"What evidence? Even we didn’t have it." Iris pressed.

Evelyn smiled without answering.

The proof had arrived anonymously in her inbox.

She knew exactly who sent it—Isabella.

Alexander’s defeat benefited only two people: herself and Isabella.

After dinner, Evelyn returned to her apartment complex to find Julian Ashford waiting.

"Congratulations." He produced a bouquet of crimson roses from behind his back.

"I said I’d pursue you." His smile was warm. "Take them. I’ve been standing here three hours."

Evelyn accepted the flowers, then pretended to toss them toward a trash bin.

"Wait!" Julian lunged to stop her. "At least wait until I’m gone."

They shared a laugh.

As Julian began to lean in, several security guards suddenly grabbed him.

Alexander yanked Evelyn away.

"Come with me." His voice was glacial.

Evelyn struggled violently. "Let me go!"

Alexander shoved her into a car, pinning her down.

"I’ve given you too many chances." His eyes were dark. "Evelyn, this is the last one."

"Are you insane? Release me!" Horror dawned as she realized he meant to imprison her.

They wrestled fiercely in the car.

Then, abruptly, Evelyn’s body went limp.

She had fainted.
###Chapter 140: Hidden Expectations

The ambulance siren pierced through the night.

Alexander Kingsley carried the unconscious Evelyn Sinclair into the emergency room, his face ghostly pale under the fluorescent lights.

"Alex!"

Eleanor Kingsley rushed forward in her heels, the hem of her dress fluttering.

Without a word, she raised her hand—a sharp slap echoed down the hallway.

"What did you do to Evelyn?"

Medical staff arrived with a gurney but froze at the tense standoff.

"Stop gawking!" Eleanor snapped. "Get her on there now!"

Alexander's arms tightened. He had intended to carry her all the way to the examination room.

"Let go!" Eleanor stepped forward to wrench Evelyn away. "Are you trying to kill her?"

As Evelyn was placed on the gurney, her eyelashes fluttered faintly.

Her eyes opened, dazed and unfocused.

"Evelyn?" Eleanor grasped her hand urgently. "Do you recognize me?"

The sting of antiseptic triggered Evelyn's memory—Alexander forcing her into the car, the argument, then darkness...

"Aunt Eleanor..."

She suddenly threw herself into Eleanor's arms, her slender frame trembling violently.

"Save me..."

The plea stabbed Eleanor's heart. This was the first time Evelyn had ever shown vulnerability in front of her.

"Don't be afraid." Eleanor held her tightly. "No one can hurt you while I'm here."

Her sharp gaze cut toward Alexander.

The man had already schooled his expression into icy detachment, but his clenched fists betrayed him.

"We need to run some tests—"

"No!" Evelyn jerked back. "I want to go home... Don't let him follow..."

Her fearful cowering ignited Eleanor's fury.

"Get out!" Eleanor pointed to the exit. "Can't you see how terrified she is of you?"

Alexander turned sharply, the tails of his suit jacket slicing through the air.

"He said he'd imprison me..." Evelyn sobbed the accusation.

"He wouldn't dare!" Eleanor slammed her hand down. "Not unless he steps over my dead body!"

Suddenly, she clasped Evelyn's cold fingers.

"Evelyn... become my daughter."

The late-night pharmacy glared under harsh lighting.

Evelyn adjusted her baseball cap, filling her basket with vitamins and supplements.

"Cash, please."

She watched as the cashier discreetly placed the pregnancy test into a black bag.

In the bathroom, the water washed away the remnants of pills.

Only the test remained hidden in her pajama pocket.

Eleanor's offer replayed in her mind—becoming a Kingsley would sever all ties with Alexander.

Unless...

Evelyn pressed a hand to her flat stomach.

The irregularly delayed period made her pulse race.

Scarlet Archer's words surfaced unexpectedly:

[Having your own child would make life complete.]

At dawn, she stared at the two red lines on the test strip, fingers shaking.

The midday sun burned harshly.

"Aunt Eleanor," Evelyn gripped her phone tightly, "I've made my decision..."
###Chapter 141: Undercurrents and Office Traps

"Aunt Eleanor, I've made my decision..." Evelyn Sinclair's voice trembled slightly. "May I become your daughter?"

A sharp intake of breath came through the phone as Eleanor Kingsley gasped in delight.

"Alexander's father and grandparents are overjoyed!" Eleanor spoke rapidly in her excitement. "Wait, let them talk to you."

Madeline Kingsley snatched the receiver first.

"My dear Evelyn, I've already prepared my jewelry box for you. The moment you officially join our family, I'll amend my will immediately."

Ahem. Patriarch Kingsley cleared his throat. "That foolish grandson of mine doesn't deserve you. From now on, you'll be the jewel of the Kingsley family. All my assets will go to you."

Though Alexander's father wasn't present, everyone knew his opinion held no weight.

"We can complete the paperwork today," Eleanor said eagerly. "When would you like to come home?"

"We must consult the almanac for an auspicious date," Madeline insisted.

"Absolutely. This calls for proper preparation," the patriarch agreed. "The adoption banquet for a Kingsley daughter must be magnificent."

All three unanimously decided to keep Alexander in the dark for now.

Evelyn ended the call and tossed an unopened pregnancy test into the trash.

The faint brown stain she'd discovered on her clothes this morning had made testing unnecessary.

Perhaps her irregular cycle resulted from recent stress.

......

The monthly meeting notice from Horizon Media's Financial Department arrived unexpectedly.

Penelope Pope had deliberately neglected to brief Evelyn before her leave, and no one in the team had reminded her.

"These materials need preparing for tomorrow," Evelyn assigned tasks in the group chat.

Team members immediately erupted.

[I can't finish my article today]
[Penelope never gave us this much work]
[Didn't Editor Sinclair coordinate with Penelope?]
[My husband threatened divorce if I work late again]

Evelyn read through the messages calmly.

"Send me Penelope's previous task distribution chart."

Someone promptly shared an altered version that minimized each member's workload.

Evelyn redistributed assignments accordingly.

The team froze in shock.

She'd taken on 90% of the workload herself.

"Let me help, sis." Intern Evan Wells approached with a bright smile.

The popular nineteen-year-old stood at an impressive 185cm.

"Can you handle PowerPoint?" Evelyn didn't look up.

"Of course!" Evan thumped his chest confidently.

They worked late into the night.

"I'll polish the formatting at home," Evan said with a wink before leaving.

He arrived late the next morning, just before the meeting.

"Overslept." He handed Evelyn a USB drive with an apologetic look.

She sent him to fetch coffee instead.

The Financial Department meeting hall was packed.

Melissa Lee sat at the head table, her gaze repeatedly darting toward Evelyn.

When Finance Team 5's turn came, Evelyn inserted the USB drive.

The screen displayed cartoon pigs shaking their bottoms.

"Want to see the next page?" a child's voice chirped. "Find the right piggy butt~"

Laughter erupted through the room.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Melissa slammed the table.

Evelyn calmly removed the drive.

"Evan Wells, your USB."

"What?" Evan feigned ignorance. "Isn't that your presentation?"

Evelyn placed the drive on the table.

"It has your name on it."

Evan's face paled.

Slowly, Evelyn retrieved another USB from her bag.

The room fell silent.
###Chapter 142: Spreading Rumors About Her Harassing the Intern

Evelyn Sinclair tapped her fingers lightly on the desk before leisurely pulling a silver flash drive from her bag.

The metallic glint under the lights matched the one Evan Wells had handed her earlier.

"Next time you pull a prank, put in some effort." Her tone was as casual as discussing the weather. "This amateurish stunt would embarrass all of Horizon Media."

Melissa Lee's face darkened instantly.

Though Evelyn was scolding Evan, every word felt like a slap to Melissa.

"Come get it." Evelyn beckoned the stunned intern. "Don't waste everyone's time."

Evan shuffled forward, face burning red. His hands trembled as he took the flash drive.

The label bore his exact signature—down to the last pen stroke.

Only then did Evelyn plug in her own drive.

The projector lit up, displaying a flawlessly structured report...

After the meeting, Evelyn intercepted Melissa. "What's the disciplinary action for the intern?"

"Your call." Melissa's voice was icy.

"A written apology should suffice." Evelyn's tone was dismissive.

Melissa stormed off, her stilettos pounding the floor.

When Evan submitted his apology letter, he was summoned to the training room.

"Evelyn, I'm so sorry..." His eyes welled up like a frightened fawn. "Can I still come to you for guidance?"

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial.

"Figure out whether your mistake was about attitude, judgment...or loyalty."

She leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Were you working for yourself—or someone else?"

Evan fled without even wiping his tears.

[She's terrifying!] He typed frantically in the private group chat. [Did she see right through me?]

Silence.

The answer was obvious.

[Did you leave your flash drive unattended yesterday?] Someone asked.

[Yeah! Just for a few minutes!]

[Mystery solved. She ordered an identical one online with express delivery.]

[This morning when you arrived late, she sent you for coffee and labeled it.]

[Would've been fine if you'd just submitted the real report...]

Evan's spine chilled. [But the signature was my handwriting!]

[Maybe she can forge signatures too.]

The chat suddenly flooded with reassurances.

[Don't worry, we've got your back!]

[She can't touch you—there's strength in numbers!]

Evan stared at his screen, then impulsively typed: [Actually...she hinted something in the training room...]

[Hinted what?]

[She said...she admires me...and touched my face...] He instantly regretted it.

The group exploded.

[That's workplace harassment!]

[Report her!]

[No cameras—what if she countersues?]

[Imagine if the Crown Prince finds out!]

[With her looks...] Someone trailed off.

The group fell silent. True...her beauty was undeniable.

Yet all seven members of Finance Team 5 now believed—Evelyn Sinclair was trying to seduce their baby-faced intern!

"You're interviewing two listed companies next month?" Melissa blocked Evelyn's path.

"Yes. The list is being finalized."

"Don't bother." Melissa smiled meaningfully. "Legal just reached an agreement with Kingsley Group—"

"You'll be interviewing Alexander Kingsley."

She watched with satisfaction as Evelyn's back stiffened.

How would the defeated Alexander treat his "ex-girlfriend"? Melissa couldn't wait to find out.
###Chapter 143: His Confession

Evelyn Sinclair received a call from Kingsley Group's liaison, who introduced herself as Alexander Kingsley's new secretary.

But when the call connected, she recognized Nathan Carter's familiar voice.

"Miss Sinclair, we've arranged a full-day itinerary for you. In addition to Lord Alex's exclusive interview, we've prepared a corporate tour. If you're interested, we could also arrange a special feature on Kingsley Group."

The offer was tempting.

A corporate feature required teamwork—detailed interview outlines needed preparation and Kingsley Group's approval.

This time, no one in her team hesitated.

Evelyn selected three colleagues to assist with preparations.

Before departure, Evan Wells approached her with flushed cheeks. "Sis, can I join? I want to make up for my last mistake."

"Fine." Evelyn agreed without hesitation. An extra pair of hands wouldn't hurt.

Once preparations were complete, Evan made another request. "Sis, can I go with you to Kingsley Group? I'm from a small town and have never seen a big corporation before."

It was true—Evan wasn't a Kingsbury local.

Evelyn studied him for a silent second.

Her piercing gaze made Evan's heart skip a beat.

"Alright." She finally nodded.

The interview team consisted of five members. Evelyn brought the photographer and Evan to Kingsley Group, leaving two others on standby at Horizon Media.

By protocol, Evan shouldn't have qualified for the trip.

But Evelyn's exception was met with no objections.

Privately, colleagues sympathized with Evan.

The kid was right—Evelyn clearly had feelings for him!

Why else would she agree to take him to Kingsley Group so easily?

Poor guy, sacrificing so much for work... He was only a junior in college!

......

Kingsley Group rolled out the red carpet for Evelyn's visit.

Nathan personally guided the tour, detailing the corporate structure.

At noon, he arranged lunch at the employee cafeteria.

Just as they sat down, Nathan received a call.

After listening with a grim expression, he turned to Evelyn. "Miss Sinclair, the afternoon interview may need rescheduling. Lord Alex has an urgent meeting."

"So no interview today?" Evelyn asked.

Last-minute changes were typical for Alexander.

Nathan hesitated. "Actually... he's available now, but it would interrupt your lunch."

Evelyn: "......"

If not for the hopeful looks from her photographer and Evan, she would've refused outright.

"Can I bring my photographer?" she asked.

Nathan smiled apologetically. "No."

Alexander's condition for a solo interview had been clear from the start.

"What about—"

"Don't worry, we'll arrange a dedicated host for them." Nathan had everything prepared.

Evelyn entered Alexander's office.

This long-unseen space.

The expansive room remained unchanged, save for one addition—a dining table by the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Fresh roses and silverware adorned its surface.

Nathan withdrew, leaving Evelyn alone.

She stood silently for a full minute before the lounge door finally opened.

Alexander appeared in the doorway, watching her quietly.

Memories of that night still unsettled Evelyn.

Before she could speak, Alexander approached. "Sorry to keep you waiting."

He pulled out a chair but remained standing.

"Sit," he said.

Only then did Evelyn realize—he'd done it for her.

A first in thirteen years.

The gesture only made her uncomfortable.

The moment she sat, Alexander signaled for the meal to be served.

The server pushing the cart was unfamiliar.

"Royal Gardens has new staff. All backgrounds vetted," Alexander explained.

His gaze lingered on her, words left unspoken.

She could return anytime...

No one would disrespect her again.

Evelyn froze at the sight of the dishes.

None matched their usual fare.

Alexander served her himself, avoiding eye contact. "New chef. Try it."

"Thank you," Evelyn said mechanically.

During department gatherings these past two months, she'd sampled many new dishes.

Now, nearly every plate contained something she'd recently ordered...

Truthfully, some were just experimental tastes she didn't particularly enjoy.

At Royal Gardens, her preferences had always mirrored Alexander's.

She'd never dared have her own opinions.

The first bite surprised her—the same dishes tasted remarkably better here.

Alexander had been studying her reaction.

Seeing no displeasure, he relaxed slightly.

"Well?" he asked.

"The chef's skilled," Evelyn admitted honestly.

To her astonishment, Alexander smiled.

"I thought so too." His entire demeanor softened. "If you like it, I can have lunch delivered to you daily."

"No need." Evelyn declined instantly.

Alexander's expression darkened, but he didn't insist.

"When does the interview start?" Evelyn steered the conversation back on track. "I heard your afternoon is packed."

"Quite busy." Alexander accepted his own excuse. "But we have ample time. I just... haven't had lunch with you in ages."

Evelyn paused, searching her memories.

"Right, our last lunch was the New Year's family banquet."

Alexander stiffened.

New Year's...

Had they really not shared a single lunch in six months?

Thinking back, it was true.

He usually worked through lunch, occasionally attending business meals.

Their only shared meals had been mandatory Kingsley family gatherings.

And he'd either returned late or not at all.

Without Evelyn mentioning it, he'd never realized how little he'd valued...

Valued the Evelyn who waited for him at Royal Gardens.

He remembered returning late to find her always in the living room.

Or rushing downstairs at the sound of his car.

That Evelyn had starlight in her eyes.

She'd ask if he was hungry, list what the kitchen had prepared.

On rare nights when he nodded, she'd happily prepare everything.

That version of Evelyn now felt like someone from another lifetime.

Yet only two months had passed.

"Mr. Kingsley, do you need to rest?" Evelyn interrupted his thoughts.

"No, I rested earlier." He'd taken his nap early just to spend more time with her.

"So you do remember," he said suddenly.

His habits. Their past. She remembered everything.

Then why had she left so decisively?

Evelyn pretended not to hear.

She emptied her bag onto the coffee table—

Pen, notebook, phone, lipstick, tissues, mirror, recorder, camera, cardholder.

"Need to inspect these?"

"Unnecessary." Alexander's voice lowered. "What haven't you seen of mine?"

After five years sharing a bed, they had no secrets.

Today's interview was merely an excuse to see her.

Eleanor Kingsley had warned him to stay away from Evelyn.

But if Evelyn came to him, that was different.

"No formal write-up today. Let's just talk," Evelyn said, knowing this was just procedure.

She flipped through her notes for a topic. "What's keeping you busy this afternoon?"

"Bulk futures trading in South America."

"Agriculture?" Evelyn's interest piqued.

To her surprise, Alexander actually explained: "This year we're partnering with their largest trading firm. We'll control ninety percent of the global—"

Enough to manipulate market prices.

"You're telling me your position?" Evelyn tensed. "No! I can't hear this!"

Such trade secrets were dangerous knowledge.

Alexander didn't need to prove his trust this way.

Somehow, they'd drifted close enough for him to embrace her.

"You can know everything." His gaze deepened. "Including my truest thoughts."

Evelyn tried to retreat, but his arm encircled her waist.

"Alexander!"

She pushed him away forcefully. "Aunt Eleanor forbade this!"

"If you consent, she has no grounds to object." Alexander held firm. "After all I've done, don't you understand? In my heart... in my—"

The words stuck in his throat, but delaying further was impossible.

"My heart has always held you."

Locking eyes with her, he finally confessed.

Evelyn stared at him—surprised, stunned, but unmoved.

Others had told her this before, letting her delude herself with false hope.

This was the first time Alexander had said it himself.

"Evelyn," now that he'd started, the rest came easier, "you've always been in my heart. Can't you feel it?"

......
###Chapter 144: Sudden Morning Sickness

"Let go!"

Evelyn Sinclair wrenched free from Alexander Kingsley's grip, recoiling to the far end of the sofa as if escaping contagion.

Her lips curled into a sardonic smile. "What's this act about, Mr. Kingsley? Some grand romantic gesture?"

Alexander's expression darkened.

"Seven years," Evelyn whispered, her fingers trembling. "What was I to you? A plaything you could summon and dismiss at will? Or just a target for your paranoia?"

"Evelyn—"

"Don't!" Her voice cracked like shattered glass. "What's the point now? Should I grovel with gratitude for your scraps of attention?"

His gaze turned stormy.

In two strides, he caged her against the sofa's armrest. "You know exactly how I—"

"Urgh—"

Evelyn clapped a hand over her mouth, her face draining of color.

She shoved Alexander away and stumbled toward the bathroom.

He stood frozen.

The sound of violent retching echoed through the suite.

When Alexander finally followed, he found Evelyn slumped on the marble floor, her bangs plastered to her forehead with cold sweat.

"What's wrong?" He knelt beside her, rubbing circles on her back.

She shook her head weakly.

"Hospital. Now." He scooped her up effortlessly.

"No need..." She struggled feebly. "Just...food poisoning..."

Alexander stilled.

His eyes narrowed at her pallid face. "The medicine you bought last week—for food poisoning?"

Evelyn's pulse jumped.

"Mm." She turned away. "Work stress..."

He deposited her on the lounge bed, fingertips grazing her clammy cheek.

"You were saying something earlier," he said abruptly.

Her lashes fluttered.

"Nothing important." She shut her eyes. "I should leave."

Alexander pinned her shoulders. "Finish your sentence."

The air turned glacial.

Evelyn opened her eyes to meet his unyielding stare.

"I—"

Another wave of nausea hit.

She curled into herself, her blouse soaking through.

Alexander brought her water, supporting her as she sipped.

"I'm calling the doctor." He reached for his phone.

"No!" Her fingers closed around his wrist. "Just...need rest..."

His gaze dropped to her slender hand—once so quick to embrace him, now only pushing him away.

"I'll take you home," he conceded.

Horizon Media Headquarters.

Melissa Lee watched Evelyn's hurried exit on the security feed, crimson lips twisting.

"The fish took the bait," she purred into her phone. "Time to reel it in."

A chuckle crackled through the receiver. "How did Kingsley react?"

"Explosive." Melissa twirled a fountain pen. "Even better than we hoped."

"Excellent." A pause. "Clean up your tracks."

"Obviously." She ended the call, eyes glinting. "This time, that bitch stays down for good."

Dawn light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn's phone screamed to life.

"Disaster!" Martha Nash's voice shook. "Kingsley Group's under international short attack—massive losses!"

Evelyn bolted upright.

"The whole industry's buzzing..." Martha lowered her voice. "They're saying you leaked Kingsley's trading positions."

The phone clattered to the floor.

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

The nightmare from seven years ago was repeating.
###Chapter 145: Forced Resignation

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she pushed open Julian's office door.

"Was it William?" Her voice was tight. "The Kingsley Group incident."

Julian set down his documents, his gaze lingering on her pale face.

"Surface evidence points to a South American trading firm." He handed her a file. "But the methods resemble what happened seven years ago."

Papers rustled as Evelyn flipped through the documents.

"Too coincidental." She murmured. "Alexander just told me about the positions yesterday."

Julian's eyes darkened.

"Did you check the exchange records?"

"Yes." Evelyn shook her head. "No unusual login activity."

Silence filled the office.

Evelyn knew what Julian was thinking. Everyone suspected her of leaking the positions.

Including Alexander.

"Kingsley Group took too much risk this time." Julian said suddenly.

"Shorting coffee futures during a bumper harvest is standard practice." Evelyn instinctively defended.

Julian smiled bitterly. She always protected Kingsley Group like this.

...

The Winslow mansion blazed with light.

"Perfect!" Mrs. Winslow slapped the armrest. "Let's see Alexander recover from this!"

Mr. Winslow swirled his wine glass, unable to hide his smirk. "Ten billion in losses will cripple Kingsley Group."

"Serves them right!" Mrs. Winslow turned to her daughter. "Isabella, this was all thanks to you."

Isabella smiled faintly, discreetly dialing William's number.

"William, stop now." She whispered. "Kingsley Group has lost enough."

A soft chuckle came through the phone. "Stop now? Isabella, the show's just beginning."

"But..." Isabella bit her lip. "I want to help Alexander one more time."

"Oh?" William's tone turned knowing. "The same method as seven years ago?"

"Yes." Isabella's voice turned sugary. "Exactly like before."

"Fine." William paused. "But I want that Butterfly Brooch."

Isabella tightened her grip on the phone. "Deal."

...

Melissa's office door flew open.

"Evelyn Sinclair, how dare you show your face here?" She screeched. "Resign immediately!"

Evelyn stood calmly in the doorway.

"On what grounds?"

"For leaking trade secrets!" Melissa slammed her desk. "Horizon Media won't take the fall for you!"

Evelyn stepped forward slowly.

"Proof?"

Melissa sneered. "The entire finance world knows it was you!"

"So," Evelyn met her gaze, "you want me to confess falsely?"

"Quit while you're ahead." Melissa lowered her voice. "Or else..."

"Or else what?" Evelyn suddenly smiled. "Show me your best move, Director Lee?"

Melissa's face twisted.

She hadn't expected Evelyn to fight back at this stage.

"Fine. Very well." Melissa ground out. "We'll see who has the last laugh."

Evelyn turned to leave, her spine straight.

She knew the real storm was only beginning.
###Chapter 146: Evelyn's Life is Ruined

"What if I refuse to resign?"

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze, her eyes calm.

Melissa Lee scoffed. "What? Waiting for Horizon to sue you?"

She took a step forward, looking down at Evelyn with disdain. "Leaving now saves you the embarrassment. If the company fires you, it'll be humiliating."

Evelyn shook her head slightly.

"Supervisor, I'm curious. Why does the company always condemn me without investigation whenever something happens?"

She paused, a faint smile touching her lips. "Didn't you learn your lesson last time?"

Melissa's face darkened instantly.

The incident at the film studio remained her greatest shame.

"That was just luck!" she hissed through gritted teeth. "What about this time? Can you magically produce coffee beans or repay billions?"

"You're not even worth that much!"

Evelyn regarded her quietly.

"Supervisor, if you can't even handle me, where do you find the courage to go against Alexander Kingsley and the Kingsley Group?"

Her tone was sincere. "If you've invested in coffee bean futures, it's not too late to sell now."

Melissa laughed as if she'd heard the most ridiculous joke.

"Evelyn, have you lost your mind?"

She slammed her hand on the desk. "Submit your resignation by tomorrow, or expect a cease and desist letter!"

Evelyn turned and walked away.

Behind her, Melissa's triumphant laughter echoed.

......

The Financial Department was eerily silent.

Everyone watched Evelyn with complicated expressions.

The drama they'd anticipated had finally arrived, yet they inexplicably felt a pang of sympathy.

A loss of billions.

This girl's life was over.

Team 5 was especially quiet.

Even Evan Wells kept his head down without a word.

When Evelyn assigned tasks, no one complained as they usually did.

"No overtime today," she said softly. "Leave the unfinished work to me."

No one spoke.

One by one, they silently set down their files and left.

Evan was the last to go.

He stood before Evelyn, his eyes red.

"Evelyn, I'm sorry."

She looked up.

"I shouldn't have... treated you that way..."

The young man suddenly bowed deeply before turning and rushing out.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure and smiled faintly.

She finished all the work and left the office early.

Night had fallen.

She stood before the Autumn Detail building, gazing up at the once-glorious structure.

Thirteen years had layered it with dust.

She climbed the stairs step by step.

Each footfall seemed to sink into memories.

The wind was strong on the rooftop.

"Who's there?"

A familiar voice suddenly rang out.

Under the moonlight, Alexander Kingsley's figure came into clear view.

He clearly hadn't expected to see her here either.

"Evelyn?"

She remained where she stood.

A photograph from seven years ago flashed through her mind.

In court, he had explained every piece of evidence.

Except for that photo of him embracing Isabella Winslow.

Not a single word.
###Chapter 147: Did Evelyn Mimic Mrs. Kingsley's Suicide?

Alexander's icy voice cut through the air behind her. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn's fingers twisted the hem of her blouse unconsciously.

"I..." Her lips parted, but no explanation came.

Alexander's gaze swept over her face. "I heard someone accused you of leaking our positions?"

Before Evelyn could respond, hurried footsteps echoed from the stairwell.

"Alex! Are you up there?" Isabella's tearful voice trembled.

Evelyn ducked into the shadows.

Isabella stumbled onto the rooftop, arms outstretched. "Don't do anything rash—"

Alexander sidestepped her embrace, brows furrowed. "Why are you here?"

"I heard about Kingsley Group's crisis and worried you might..." Isabella's eyes glistened. "We need solutions. I know a coffee bean supplier—"

Alexander's expression shifted. "Oh?"

"He has the quantity you need at negotiable prices." She thrust forward a business card. "You must secure inventory before market open."

Alexander photographed the card. "Nathan will handle it."

Isabella exhaled. Then she lowered her voice: "Alex... During the trial, I'm glad you didn't deny our relationship."

Alexander stiffened, his gaze darting toward Evelyn's hiding spot.

"That night you clearly—" Isabella's voice cracked. "I know you're reserved. I'll wait—"

"Global coffee inventories were below 10% last year." Alexander interrupted, staring at his phone. "Where did this stock materialize from?"

"Secondary market reserves," Isabella stammered.

"Thanks." His laugh held no warmth. "You've just confirmed my settlement strategy."

Isabella blinked in confusion as Alexander strode toward the shadows.

The empty alcove made his pulse spike.

"Evelyn!" He lunged for the stairs, heart hammering.

Isabella grabbed his arm. He shook her off violently, leaving her sprawled on the concrete as he vanished downstairs.

Her phone rang.

"Mother?" Isabella answered to panicked shrieks. "Ask Alexander what Kingsley Group's announcement means!"

The Ashford mansion blazed with light.

Melissa clung to Mrs. Ashford's side, stealing glances at Julian brooding in the corner.

"Where are you going?" Mrs. Ashford called as her son stood.

"Air." Julian didn't turn.

Mrs. Ashford nudged Melissa. "Go with him."

Julian kept walking. Melissa trotted after him. "Wait for me!"

"Did you leak Kingsley's positions?" Julian whirled abruptly.

Melissa paled. "How dare—"

"You had motive." His stare turned glacial. "And framed Evelyn."

"You think you know her?" Melissa's laugh shrilled. "That gold-digger would sell her soul!"

A slap cracked through the garden.

"Now you know I hit vicious women." Julian smirked. "Still want to marry me?"

"Evelyn seduced Evan Wells!" Melissa screeched. "You'll regret this!"

"Melissa!" Mr. Lee rushed over. "Are you certain those positions were accurate? Kingsley just completed settlement!"

Melissa froze.

Kingsley... settled?
###Chapter 148: Alexander's Midnight Search at Horizon

The sudden upheaval in the coffee futures market exploded through financial circles like a detonation.

Isabella Winslow's knuckles whitened around her phone. Her voice trembled with disbelief as she called William West. "How could Kingsley Group have inventory? They were supposed to—"

"We've been played." William's tone was glacial. "Alexander transferred the goods long ago."

Meanwhile, Melissa Lee clutched Julian Ashford's sleeve, her scream bordering on hysteria. "She knew all along, didn't she? That bitch Evelyn Sinclair knew Kingsley's positions!"

Julian impassively withdrew his arm. "I'm aware."

Melissa erupted into manic laughter. "You protect her, yet she watched you lose money without warning!"

"I didn't invest." Julian's reply was calm, but his brow furrowed. He hadn't anticipated William Yearwood's involvement.

Horizon Media's headquarters blazed with light.

Evelyn had just reached the building's entrance when Isabella intercepted her with a phalanx of bodyguards.

"See this?" Isabella flashed her right hand, the diamond engagement ring glittering under the lights. "Alexander proposed to me."

Evelyn's gaze barely flickered across it. "Congratulations."

Isabella's smirk froze. "Aren't you heartbroken?"

"Why would I be?" Evelyn countered, her eyes as unreadable as still waters.

The Financial Department's half-empty workstations sent a jolt through Evelyn.

"Where is everyone?" she asked the remaining team members.

"No one's answering their phones," they murmured, exchanging uneasy glances.

Evelyn immediately turned to the acting Social Affairs Department head. "I need emergency leave."

The supervisor looked up from his monitor. "What's happened?"

"My entire team has gone missing." Evelyn's quiet tone carried steel. "I'm finding them."

After a measured pause, the supervisor warned, "Going alone is too dangerous."

Evelyn secured a tracker to her collar. "I'll be careful."

Minutes after her departure, the Financial Department's doors burst open.

Alexander Kingsley strode in, his suit jacket flaring from the night wind. His sweeping gaze locked onto the Social Affairs supervisor.

"Where's Evelyn?" Urgency vibrated beneath his controlled voice.

"She left the premises."

Alexander advanced, eyes darkening. "Her location. Now."

The supervisor remained guarded. "Lord Alex, Evelyn didn't leak Kingsley's positions."

"I know!" Alexander's shout echoed off the walls. "I just need to know if she's safe!"

His phone screen displayed a newly received anonymous text:
[Five million or Evelyn Sinclair dies.]
###Chapter 149: Evelyn Sinclair's Lone Stand

The Social Affairs Department head tapped her fingers lightly on the desk.

She lifted her gaze to Alexander Kingsley, her expression chillingly composed.

"I truly don't know."

Alexander's eyes turned glacial, plunging the office into an arctic silence.

"Say that again."

The director glanced around, her tone measured. "Everyone heard me ask her whereabouts. She refused to answer."

Alexander suddenly leaned forward, palms braced on the desk.

"Then why did she leave?"

After a weighted pause, the director relented. "Her team member went missing. She went to find them."

Alexander's pupils constricted.

He straightened and turned on his heel.

That direction—

Led straight to Triad Hyde's territory.

......

The name Triad Hyde resonated through Kingsbury like thunder.

His real name had long been forgotten.

Alexander was no stranger to the man.

Two years ago, Hyde had arrived at Kingsley Group with suitcases of cash.

He wanted legitimacy.

Kingsley refused.

The grudge took root.

Hyde never missed a chance to curse Kingsley's arrogance.

Alexander couldn't care less.

Kingsley didn't associate with such men.

Yet today—

He would seek an audience himself.

......

"Lord Alex, the Third Master says—"

Before the underling could finish, Alexander cut in. "Ask him how much he lost on National Exchange's coffee futures."

The man scurried away, returning pale-faced.

"The Third Master says... the tide always turns..."

Alexander smirked. "Has a Horizon Media female reporter come through?"

"Never!" The reply came sharp as a blade.

The gates slammed shut in Alexander's face.

......

"Eight fingers. Divide them amongst yourselves."

Triad Hyde twirled his pipe, grinning through wreaths of smoke.

Evan Wells and three others were pinned to the floor, faces bloodied.

"Third Master, the wiretap was real—"

"Silence!" Hyde kicked the speaker. "You think Alexander Kingsley wouldn't detect surveillance?"

He crouched, pressing the hot pipe to Evan's cheek.

"Lesson time."

Steel flashed.

A blade hovered over Evan's fingers.

"Ring and pinky fingers. Consider it tuition."

Evan trembled, tears mingling with blood.

"I'm just an intern... please..."

Hyde threw back his head laughing—

When a cool female voice cut through the darkness.

"I'll compensate you for all ten."

Heads swiveled toward the shadows.

Evelyn Sinclair removed her hat, stepping into the light.

"I'm their editor-in-chief."
###Chapter 150: More Than Just a Pretty Face

Triad Hyde narrowed his eyes, scanning Evelyn Sinclair from head to toe.

She was breathtakingly beautiful.

Her skin glowed like porcelain, her eyes cold as winter stars. The tailored suit accentuated her slender figure, yet radiated an unapproachable aura.

"Horizon Media?" He scoffed. "A mere reporter dares to cause trouble here?"

Evelyn calmly extended her business card. "Evelyn Sinclair. Editor-in-chief, Finance Team Five."

As Hyde reached for it, she withdrew her hand.

"Playing games?" His face darkened.

"A misunderstanding." She opened her palm. "I merely wondered if these hands are worth your... excessive measures."

Hyde paused, then burst into laughter. "Interesting!"

In the corner, Evan Wells and his team cowered, tear stains on their faces.

"For these nobodies?" Hyde raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm here to save you."

"Save me?" Hyde laughed harder.

"Northern Gorge Wind Farm Project." Seven words silenced his laughter.

She handed him a file. "Winwell Ventures needs a scapegoat. You're their chosen easy mark."

Hyde snatched the documents. His expression soured with each page.

"Bullshit!" He slammed the table. "Winwell invested heavily too!"

Evelyn produced another dossier. "They've been quietly withdrawing since March. Only an empty shell remains for you to fill."

A vein throbbed on Hyde's forehead. "Someone! Verify this now!"

He turned to Evelyn, his gaze now wary. "What do you want?"

"Them." She pointed to the corner.

"That's all?" Hyde sneered. "Worth crossing Winwell?"

"Because I can make you richer." Her eyes burned with conviction. "Ninety percent success rate. Satisfactory?"

"And the remaining ten?"

"For your... romantic indulgences." A faint smile touched her lips.

Hyde studied her. "Why should I trust you?"

"Tonggowan Manufacturing." Her trump card. "Scarlet Archer holds their latest technology. I can arrange an introduction."

Hyde's breath hitched.

Tonggowan! The golden goose that even Kingsley Group failed to acquire.

"What's your angle?" He demanded.

Evelyn glanced at her trembling team. "Even the weakest team... is still mine."

Hyde threw back his head and laughed. "Deal! Consider me your friend, Evelyn Sinclair!"
###Chapter 151: From Now On, I'll Protect You

"I value your connections in Kingsbury." Evelyn Sinclair met Triad Hyde's gaze squarely. "In finance, networks and information are everything. You've built your influence here for years, with ties to both sides of the law. Your help would save me considerable trouble."

She paused, pointing at the four trembling figures in the corner. "And I want them too."

Triad Hyde narrowed his eyes. "What use could those worthless fools possibly be?"

He preferred straightforward deals. Evelyn's blunt admission of wanting his resources actually eased his suspicions. But her equating herself with those idiots irritated him.

"They're mine." Evelyn's voice remained steady. "My people, my responsibility. Those who harm them will answer to me. If fingers need cutting, I'll wield the blade myself."

Triad Hyde stiffened.

He hadn't expected such steel beneath this delicate woman's refined exterior.

Noticing his reaction, Evelyn extended both hands. "I give you my word. Should I ever betray you, these hands and wrists are yours to claim."

"Good!" Triad Hyde slammed the table and stood. "I like your spirit! From today onward, anyone who touches a hair on your head in Kingsbury answers to me!"

He waved a hand. "Release them to Miss Sinclair! Give her the knife too!"

Only now did he truly see the woman before him. To walk alone into his territory took extraordinary courage. Her worth had long surpassed mere gender or beauty.

Evelyn emerged from Triad Hyde's domain with four battered young men in tow.

Evan Wells sobbed uncontrollably. "S-sis..."

"Quiet." Evelyn tossed him a tissue pack and hailed a cab. "We're working late tonight. If anyone gets docked pay for unexcused absence, it's coming from you four."

The other three froze mid-tear-wipe.

This woman saved their lives but wouldn't even grant them a proper emotional moment!

"Penelope Pope orchestrated everything," Evan blurted in the taxi. "From the initial PPT trap to planting bugs at Kingsley Group—all her schemes!"

"She made us frame you! Worst part? She only used Snapchat-style messages to cover her tracks!"

"Sis, let me stay at Horizon to help you take her down!"

Evelyn gave him a sidelong glance. "Go back to school."

This naive stupidity was precisely why Penelope had chosen them—perfect disposable pawns.

Yet such single-minded loyalty was exactly what Evelyn valued most.

Originally, all eight members of Finance Team 5 had been against her. Now four had switched sides. Combined with Triad Hyde's new alliance, tonight's gamble had paid off.

Men like Hyde respected loyalty above all...

The dilapidated Autumn Detail building flashed through Evelyn's mind.

Someday, she'd restore its former glory...

Evelyn marched her four "punching bags" back into the office.

"Bar fight over barbecue." She deadpanned to their supervisor. "Started it, lost badly, too embarrassed to call cops. Came back to work instead."

Anyone could see through the lie, but the quartet maintained perfect silence.

Evelyn's warning during the ride had been clear: anyone revealing tonight's events would answer to Triad Hyde's blades.

Evan was first to pledge allegiance: "Sis, my life's yours from now on!"

The others quickly echoed.

The Social Affairs Department supervisor was midway through warning Evelyn about Alexander Kingsley's earlier visit when a tall silhouette appeared at Finance's entrance.

Evelyn barely settled at her desk when shadows eclipsed her monitor's glow.

She looked up into Alexander's glacial stare.

"Outside." Fury simmered beneath his controlled tone.

Her peripheral vision caught the belated warning flashing onscreen:
[Social Affairs]: Heads up! Alexander Kingsley came looking for you earlier!

Evelyn: "..." Perfect timing.
###Chapter 152: His Humble Plea for Her Return

Evelyn Sinclair rose slowly from her desk, stepping away under the collective gaze of her colleagues.

Alexander Kingsley's piercing stare traced every movement of her retreating figure.

She had barely taken her first step when he strode past her, his broad shoulders cutting through the air like a blade.

His footsteps echoed with restrained fury, his expression stormy.

The finance department exchanged uneasy glances. No one understood why the CEO had sought out Evelyn, but they all sensed impending disaster.

Evelyn felt it too.

They reached a deserted corridor.

She stopped.

The office was nearly empty at this hour.

Faint lighting cast elongated shadows across vacant workstations. Glass doors reflected the gloom like gaping voids.

"Was there something—"

Alexander yanked her into an unyielding embrace before she could finish.

His arms locked around her like steel bands.

"Just let me hold you." His voice scraped raw.

Evelyn stood frozen.

After an eternity, she stirred.

"Don't." He tightened his grip. "A little longer."

She waited in silence.

Minutes bled together.

"Enough," she whispered.

"Never enough." Alexander released her only to grip her shoulders. "Evelyn, what must I do?"

She met his gaze.

Flames danced in those depths, threatening to consume her.

"I need nothing from you. Just... stay away."

"Don't say that!" His voice cracked. "Do you know how terrified I was? Your sudden disappearance—"

Even after confirming her safety, he'd needed to see her, touch her, to believe it.

Alexander had surrendered.

Begging was his only recourse now.

The mere thought of her in danger—

Agony lanced through him.

"Alexander," Evelyn lowered her lashes, "I thought you understood. I'm not coming back..."

Her clear eyes lifted to his.

"Thirteen years was enough. There's nothing left for you."

"You need do nothing. Let me be the one—" His grip tightened desperately. "Name your terms, just stay."

"Like before?" A humorless laugh escaped her. "Impossible. My world gained color after leaving you. I won't return to that grayscale existence."

"Then tell me how!" Alexander refused to release her. "Must you push me to extremes?"

He was trapped.

"If danger found you while I—" His voice broke. "Have you no care for my torment?"

"Alexander," Evelyn interrupted, "I met with Triad Hyde tonight."

Silence swallowed the corridor.

"I know." His jaw tightened. "I was there too."

He'd anticipated her rescuing the colleague.

"The bugged conference room, the leaked position—all my doing."

Every move calculated.

"My colleague is safe." Evelyn held his gaze. "I don't need your protection anymore."

The unspoken truth hung between them—

She didn't need him.

Because she no longer loved him.

Pain flashed across Alexander's features.

"I know you hate me." His voice roughened. "I failed you before."

"Can't you... grant me one chance? I swear—"

Evelyn's prolonged silence surprised even herself.

She'd never imagined Alexander Kingsley capable of such humility.

How ironic—only her absence could awaken his regard.

"Pathetic." Her eyes glistened. "Thirteen years to learn this lesson."

All those sacrifices now seemed laughable.

"You'll never know what I endured for you, Alexander..."

Something shattered between them irreparably.

When he reached for her, she recoiled.

"Don't! We're done."

"Evelyn, what did you do?" Sudden dread gripped him.

What had he missed?

The secrets he'd overlooked now yawned like an uncrossable chasm.

He'd lost even the right to beg.
###Chapter 153: No One Waits Forever

"You don't deserve to know." Evelyn's voice was glacial, yet scalding tears traced down her cheeks. "Alexander Kingsley, every time I see you, it's a reminder of my own stupidity. Everything I sacrificed for you was a joke."

She turned to leave, but Alexander seized her wrist.

"Evelyn!"

She wrenched free. "Don't touch me!" Backing away, her gaze turned lethal. "If you push me again, I'll jump from here. I swear it."

Alexander froze.

He'd never seen this version of Evelyn. Those eyes that once adored him now held only arctic contempt.

"I mean it." She retreated further into the shadows. "Test me."

He didn't follow.

Rooted in place, he watched her vanish down the corridor. An invisible fist clenched around his heart, stealing his breath with its vicious grip.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn slid down the cold metal wall, knees drawn to her chest. She buried her face in her arms.

So this was the power of threatening Alexander Kingsley.

The taste of his helplessness was unexpectedly sweet.

The doors opened to Julian Ashford's shocked face. His expression darkened as he took in her swollen eyes.

"Alexander came for you again?"

She wiped her cheeks. "It's nothing, Julian."

"Nothing?" His laugh was razor-sharp. "That's what you said while covering his short position too."

Her head snapped up.

"You knew the truth yet lied to my face." Julian's voice dropped to subzero. "Am I just another person to manipulate?"

"That's not—"

"Then why?" He cut her off. "Afraid I'd leak it? Or that I'd sabotage Kingsley Group?"

Her lips parted soundlessly.

This wasn't the gentle mentor she knew. The disappointment in his eyes cut deeper than any blade.

"I'm sorry..."

"Don't." He turned away. "You'll just do it again."

She caught his sleeve. "I wanted to tell you, but William was right outside. I couldn't—"

He shook her off. "Yet you warned Melissa Lee without hesitation."

"Because she—"

"Because what?" Julian spun back, gaze piercing. "Because she's gullible? Or because I'm too forgiving?"

Her hands fell limp.

So this was the agony of lost trust.

The realization struck like lightning—no love survives endless betrayal. Even the deepest bonds erode beneath relentless disappointment.

"Julian," she said quietly, "if you can't forgive me, I'll respect that."

For a long moment, he studied her. Then his hand cradled her nape as he crushed his lips to hers.
###Chapter 154: Pregnancy Test Storm

Evelyn's pupils constricted violently.

Julian's face suddenly loomed close enough for her to see the faint tremble of his lashes. His scorching breath carried an overwhelming masculine scent.

Her instincts screamed to retreat, yet her body remained frozen.

The world spun abruptly.

"Evelyn!" Julian's hand clamped onto her shoulder.

She collapsed like a marionette with severed strings. Her gaze turned vacant, lips drained of color.

Julian dropped to one knee, barely catching her limp form.

"Wake up!" His palm patted her cheek gently.

The girl in his arms was deathly pale, her lips nearly translucent.

Scooping her up bridal-style, he sprinted toward the elevator.

"Put me down..." Evelyn pushed weakly against his chest.

Staggering to her feet, she braced against the wall, retching violently. Her stomach churned, but nothing came up.

Julian offered a handkerchief. "Hospital. Now."

"Not necessary..." She wiped cold sweat from her temples. "I just need rest."

"You said that last time." His fingers encircled her wrist like steel bands. "This time, you're getting checked."

Under the sterile garage lighting, his expression turned flinty.

"Julian!" She wrenched free.

"Sophie's still hospitalized." His voice dropped dangerously low. "Want to follow her footsteps?"

The words stabbed like ice picks.

Evelyn's fingertips turned to ice. The family's genetic curse hung over her like the sword of Damocles.

"Tomorrow," she conceded.

At dawn, Julian's call came precisely on schedule.

"I'm at the office." Evelyn studied her ashen reflection. "Penelope's returning today—"

"Three p.m. Horizon's physician will expect you."

When the needle pierced her vein, Evelyn turned her face away.

"Notify me immediately with results." She gave the doctor a strained smile.

The moment the door closed, Julian murmured, "Add progesterone and hCG panels."

Three hours later, Evelyn accepted the medication box.

"Take these on schedule." Julian tapped the pill bottle. "Next collapse lands you in inpatient care."

Scanning the iron supplements, her tension eased slightly.

"Field assignments are suspended." He hesitated. "Or... a department transfer?"

"I'm fine." She hugged the medicine bag and turned.

As the office door clicked shut, Julian yanked open his desk drawer.

The pregnancy test report glared up at him—hCG levels skyrocketing beyond normal range.
###Chapter 155: Trapped Beast

The shredder whirred loudly, reducing the medical report to confetti.

Julian Ashford stared blankly at the machine, fingers absently tapping the desk.

For the first time, he couldn't tell who was truly burying their head in the sand—himself or Evelyn.

Evelyn Sinclair swallowed the pill, feeling immediate relief from her persistent fatigue.

Lately, she'd been exhausted. Her appetite vanished. Dizziness struck without warning.

Julian's medication worked surprisingly well, restoring her energy almost instantly.

She ignored his warnings and resumed her fieldwork as usual.

Finance Team 5 had fractured into two factions since Penelope Pope's return.

Evelyn's side clearly dominated.

Evan Wells became her sharpest blade, striking Penelope's weakest spots.

"Slow productivity?" Evan smirked when Penelope criticized him. "Maybe you should've triplets next time."

Penelope's face turned livid.

His intern status granted Evan reckless freedom—he scoffed at workplace decorum.

When Melissa Lee returned from medical leave, Penelope rushed to complain.

"Evelyn's got Evan wrapped around her finger," she whispered. "Remember when he accused her of harassment?"

Melissa's eyes gleamed. "He said that?"

"Swore she made physical advances..."

Their gazes locked, scheming silently.

"PetStar?" Evelyn frowned at the assignment sheet.

Melissa smiled cryptically. "Evan's free. Take him along."

The boy bounced like a kid on a field trip. "Road trip, sis!"

Evelyn ignored him.

Horizon Media disgusted her now.

Once an industry pioneer, now just a den of corporate puppets.

Her parents had foresight leaving this sinking ship.

PetStar's headquarters looked half the size promised in documents.

"We leased out floors," the CEO explained, presenting property deeds.

Evelyn sipped coffee, her brow twitching imperceptibly.

"Not your taste?" Evan jumped up. "I'll get another."

He vanished for forty minutes.

The cup holder returned with a hidden message.

The factory tour proceeded as scheduled.

White buildings stood in neat rows like toy blocks.

"Wait here. The manager's coming," their driver said, leading them into an empty workshop before leaving.

Evan wiped dust off idle machines. "Spotless. No smells at all."

"Spotless?" Evelyn scoffed. "Look at the floor."

His fingers came away black with grime.

"Where is everyone?" He finally noticed the emptiness.

Evelyn was already striding toward the exit. "Because this isn't a real factory."

No cell signals.

Electrified fences hummed.

Only their breaths echoed in the vast compound.

"We're trapped," Evelyn said calmly, scanning surveillance cameras.

This wasn't an interview.

It was an elaborate cage.
###Chapter 156: Evelyn's Disappearance

Melissa Lee's carefully designed assignment was indeed a trap in disguise.

"Let's get to work." Evelyn Sinclair clapped her hands calmly, as if she had anticipated this outcome.

"What work?" Evan Wells looked utterly confused.

"First, we dismantle the surveillance cameras."

Evan's eyes widened. "?"

This abandoned factory actually had cameras installed?

......

"What an unexpected visit, Lord Alex." Triad Hyde puffed on his pipe, deliberately tapping ashes everywhere.

Alexander Kingsley's piercing gaze locked onto him.

"I'm here for Evelyn Sinclair."

Triad Hyde made a show of cleaning his ear. "Who?"

His feigned ignorance was masterful.

"I know she's working for you." Alexander waited for the ashes to settle before leaning forward slightly.

"No idea what you're talking about." Triad Hyde snorted.

Alexander's intel network was impressive.

He'd already discovered the new asset by his side?

These capitalists just couldn't stand others succeeding.

"Where is she now?" Alexander pressed.

Triad Hyde ignored him, continuing to blow smoke rings.

"She vanished after interviewing PetStar two days ago. Rumor at Horizon Media claims she eloped with an intern." Alexander's voice turned icy.

This was his oversight.

After their last conversation, he'd deliberately kept his distance, testing whether he could quit his obsession with her.

When he finally gave in to checking on her again, she'd disappeared without a trace.

Even more absurd—the internal gossip painted Evelyn as seducing a junior intern, the two allegedly running away together.

The rumors grew wilder, claiming she'd gotten pregnant to force the intern to choose between her and his education.

Ethan Miller had gaped in disbelief while reporting this.

If even Ethan found it ridiculous, Julian Ashford's reaction was telling.

The normally composed Julian personally met with the intern's family to vouch for Evelyn while secretly searching for her.

Julian's uncharacteristic behavior alerted Alexander to the severity of the situation.

He was certain Triad Hyde knew something.

But the crime boss was clearly determined to oppose him.

Alexander slid a check across the table. "Kingsley Group will compensate your coffee bean losses."

Triad Hyde glanced at it.

Damn!

A cool hundred million, just like that.

He'd lost eighty million, and Alexander was throwing in an extra twenty.

Was Evelyn really that valuable?

Pocketing the check, Triad Hyde grinned. "Appreciate your generosity, Lord Alex. But... I truly don't know this person you speak of!"

Not a word would leave his lips.

Alexander left empty-handed.

The moment he was gone, Triad Hyde ordered his men: "Retrieve Evelyn Sinclair exactly at the agreed time. Remember—not a single hair harmed!"

Meanwhile, Horizon Media had mobilized their own search party.

PetStar's factory was located in a remote mountainous area, four hours from Kingsbury.

Its marketing had emphasized pristine natural environments, a concept that initially set it apart.

......

The two groups collided at the factory gates.

Horizon's contingent was led by Evan's mother and grandmother, backed by PR, legal, and compliance staff.

The women blocked the entrance aggressively. "The moment that door opens, grab that vixen! How dare she seduce our Evan? I'll tear her face off!"

Triad Hyde's tattooed enforcers cracked their knuckles. "Who let these harpies in? Back off! Anyone touches Miss Sinclair answers to us!"

As tensions peaked, a weak voice called from inside: "Mom... Grandma... What are you doing?"
###Chapter 157: Offering Kindness Too Late

"Evan!"

"Evan! Are you alright? Who locked you in here?"

"Was it that woman?"

"Where is she? Make her show herself!"

Evan Wells' mother and grandmother rushed forward in agitation.

Triad Hyde's men grew impatient, shoving the Wells family aside as one grabbed Evan's collar. "Where's Ms. Sinclair? Why are you alone?"

"What did you do to her?"

"Start talking!"

"How dare you?" The grandmother shrieked, lunging at them. "Are you that woman's lackeys sent to harm my grandson?"

Before anyone could react, the elderly woman collapsed dramatically onto the floor.

"Assaulting the elderly! Murder! That woman wants to destroy our entire family—"

Triad's men immediately backed away. "We never touched her. Everyone saw that."

Seizing the opportunity, the grandmother scrambled up and grabbed the factory door. "Don't be afraid, Evan! Grandma's here to save you!"

She flopped back down wailing whenever anyone approached.

Evan... silently observed his grandmother's performance.

Once the commotion outside settled, he leisurely produced a key and unlocked the factory door.

The crowd stared in stunned silence.

"Evan!" The grandmother embraced him, inspecting every inch for injuries.

Horizon Media and Triad's men stormed inside but soon returned empty-handed. "Where's Evelyn Sinclair?"

Evan blinked in confusion. "Editor Sinclair? Why are you looking for her?"

"Wasn't she the one who kidnapped you?" The grandmother stamped her foot. "We'll sue her for abducting a minor!"

Evan hastily covered her mouth. "Grandma, I'm an adult!"

"You'll always be our child!" she declared stubbornly. "You haven't even graduated yet!"

"Don't be afraid," his mother chimed in. "We'll protect you. Tell us what that woman did to you."

Evan was utterly baffled. "What are you talking about? What happened to Editor Sinclair?"

"Didn't she—" The grandmother lowered her voice. "Didn't she try to take advantage of you, luring you here to have her way?"

Evan's jaw dropped.

He'd expected slander against Evelyn, but not this direction.

"That's impossible! Editor Sinclair and I have a purely professional relationship! Who fed you these lies?"

"Wasn't it you?" His mother showed a screenshot. "You said she harassed you, even touched your face?"

Evan went pale.

Damn it!

If he'd known this would happen, he'd have bitten his tongue off back then!

His silence was mistaken for admission.

The grandmother wailed, slapping her thighs. "Did she claim to be pregnant to trap you? Foolish boy! It's barely been days—how could she be pregnant? She's trying to extort you!"

Evan flushed crimson.

"Stop this nonsense!" Everyone at Horizon knew Evelyn was the Ashford family's treasure.

If anyone was marrying into wealth, it'd be the Ashfords. What did the Wells family have to do with it?

"Bring her out! We'll confront her directly! How dare a woman in her twenties prey on our nineteen-year-old son!"

Triad's men grew agitated. "Ms. Sinclair clearly said she'd be here. Tell us the truth!"

The two sides began arguing again.

"Enough!" Evan shouted. "I was undercover! This company is shady—I was getting an exclusive story! You're ruining my scoop! This has nothing to do with Evelyn Sinclair!"

He turned to his family. "Do you want me to share my career-making exclusive with her?"

The Wells family fell silent.

Then Triad's phone rang.

"Stand down. She's already safe," Triad Hyde sighed. "She's more capable than we thought."

He'd hoped to earn her favor, but she'd escaped on her own.

......

"Stop here," Evelyn said, gazing out the window.

She hadn't expected Alexander Kingsley to come, let alone get information from Triad Hyde.

Alexander admitted he'd planted listening devices in Triad's sofa.

"Triad's dangerous. Be careful," he told her.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I will."

The only person she'd ever let her guard down for was him.

The price had been devastating enough to last a lifetime.

Watching Evelyn enter Horizon Media's building, Alexander instructed Nathan Carter:

"PetStar's about to collapse. Prepare accordingly."

Nathan hesitated. "Short or long position?"

"Neither." Alexander's voice was calm. "Whatever Evelyn does, we amplify it from behind."

Nathan froze.

This was the first time Alexander had acted without financial motive.

"Keep it quiet. Kingsley Group stays out of it," Alexander added.

Nathan frowned.

If Evelyn wouldn't know, what was the point?

Alexander smiled bitterly. "If she knew... she'd refuse..."

Once she'd craved his kindness, and he'd withheld it.

Now he wanted to give it, but she no longer wanted it...

......

"How did she return alone?" Penelope Pope gasped.

Melissa Lee got the update immediately. "Only Evan Wells was found there."

She made a snap decision. "Contact the Wells family. Tell them Evelyn's spreading rumors about being pregnant with Evan's child!"

No one understood rumor-mongering better than them.

Even without evidence, they'd manufacture a scandal.

Who knew? They might uncover something real...
###Chapter 158: Hospital Turmoil

Julian Ashford's office door was flung open violently.

Evelyn Sinclair had barely settled in her seat for ten minutes when summoned. The man's face was stormy, his long fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the desk.

"Are my words just wind in your ears?" His voice could freeze hell.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered, recalling his previous warning.

"I took all my medication on time," she murmured in defense.

"Field assignments?" Julian's gaze sharpened like blades. "I said one more fainting episode and you're transferred."

"But I didn't faint this time..." She fiddled with her sleeve hem.

"Speak up." His voice cracked like a whip.

Evelyn fell silent, adopting a penitent posture that softened Julian's heart momentarily - a glimpse of the mischievous girl he once knew.

His expression hardened again. "What were you doing with Evan Wells?"

"Eloping." She batted her lashes, voice dripping honey.

Julian grabbed his mouse before slamming it down, temple vein throbbing. "Proper answer!"

"Investigating a company." Evelyn suddenly turned serious. "Julian, if Financial Department breaches contract by exposing clients, do we face penalties?"

His eyebrow arched. "What did you find?"

"Want it?" Her eyes gleamed fox-like. "Otherwise I'll sell elsewhere."

Julian massaged his temples. "Out with it!"

...

Horizon Tower erupted in chaos.

The Wells family barged into Financial Department dragging Evan. The matriarch's voice boomed: "Where's Evelyn Sinclair?"

Penelope Pope shrilled: "Evelyn! Visitors!"

Evelyn barely looked up when a palm came flying.

Smack!

A leather notebook intercepted the blow. The old woman hopped in pain.

"You harlot!" Mrs. Wells jabbed a finger at Evelyn's face. "Seduced my son!"

Evan struggled against restraining relatives. "Those rumors were scripted! Sister Evelyn and I are innocent!"

"Lies!" The matriarch spat.

Evelyn deflected with her notebook - straight into the old woman's face.

"She struck me!" The matriarch lunged, aiming a kick at Evelyn's abdomen.

Evelyn sidestepped, but the woman grabbed her collar and shoved.

"Careful!" Martha caught her.

"Bastard child!" the matriarch screeched. "Who knows what bastard you're carrying!"

Evelyn's eyes frosted over. So the rumors had spiraled this far.

When the woman charged again, Evelyn seized her wrist and pushed—

"Oof!" The matriarch toppled into Mrs. Wells.

"To the hospital!" The Wells clan surged forward.

"Don't touch her!" Evan broke free, shielding Evelyn. "This is assault!"

"We're saving you!" relatives clamored.

"That slut isn't fit to bear Wells blood!"

"Terminate it today!"

Security arrived late, spectating. Only Finance Team 5 stood with Evelyn.

Penelope fanned flames from the sidelines: "Just get examined and settle this." She relished Evelyn's public humiliation.

The Wells mob cornered Evelyn, hands raised—

"Freeze!"

Black-suited men swarmed in, controlling the scene instantly.

Alexander Kingsley entered, voice glacial: "Lay one finger on her. I dare you."
###Chapter 159: Mrs. Kingsley's Public Declaration

"Who dares lay a finger on Evelyn Sinclair?"

Martha Nash stormed into the Financial Department with most of the Entertainment Division staff, forming a protective wall around Evelyn. She shoved the Wei family aside, shielding Evelyn like a mother bear protecting her cub.

Iris Cooper clung to Evelyn's arm, eyes brimming with tears. "How dare you bully her like this?"

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

How long had it been...

Since her parents' deaths, no one had defended her so fiercely.

"Manager Nash," Melissa Lee emerged from the shadows with a saccharine smile, "this is a Financial Department matter. The Entertainment Division needn't interfere. Evelyn disappeared for two days without explanation. The family's emotional reaction is understandable."

Her contemptuous gaze swept over the Entertainment staff.

Were they insane? Risking her wrath for some nobody like Evelyn?

"Evelyn started in our division," Martha stood her ground. "We won't tolerate anyone mistreating her!"

Melissa sneered. "The intern's family just wants to know if Evelyn is carrying their heir." She deliberately drawled, "After all... statutory rape is illegal."

Slap!

The sharp crack of a palm meeting flesh echoed through the room.

Melissa staggered back, clutching her cheek, gaping at the elegant noblewoman before her.

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

Mrs. Kingsley?!

"I don't need an excuse to slap trash," Mrs. Kingsley adjusted her sleeves with deliberate grace.

"Who—who are you?" Melissa struggled to contain her rage. The woman's aristocratic bearing marked her as someone important.

Mrs. Kingsley elegantly linked arms with Evelyn. "Her mother."

"Mother?" Melissa's shrill laugh grated. "Evelyn's parents are dead. Did you crawl out of their graves?"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial.

"Did the Lee family ancestors bless you with such eloquence?" Her soft chuckle carried venom. "No wonder your words reek of sewage."

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Melissa's face twisted. "You're dead!"

"The instigator bears the blame." Evelyn held her ground. "Focus on your work, Manager Lee. Soon you won't even qualify to count monopoly money."

As Melissa prepared to retaliate, Martha suddenly gasped, holding up her phone. "Impressive work, Financial Department! Exposing PetStar's scandal!"

"My investigation!" Evan Wells jumped forward. "Editor Sinclair and I worked on it separately!"

Melissa and Penelope Pope turned ashen.

Chaos erupted as the entire Financial Department scrambled to read the explosive report going viral.

"I never approved this!" Melissa shrieked.

Penelope grabbed Evan's arm. "When did you submit this?"

"During the two days you had us detained." Evan shook her off. "Emailed to the editor-in-chief. Problem?"

Melissa swayed, vision darkening.

"I'll sue you!" she screamed hysterically. "You've caused Horizon irreparable damage—"

Evan suddenly waved toward the entrance. "Cousin! She's threatening to sue me!"
###Chapter 160: The Mastermind

"Cousin!" Evan Wells suddenly pointed at Melissa Lee, his voice trembling with indignation. "She threatened to sue me!"

Cousin?

The term made everyone freeze.

All eyes followed Evan's accusing finger to the tall figure standing at the doorway.

Julian Ashford.

How was he Evan's cousin?

......

Julian strode in with measured calm, his steady breathing betraying no trace of his earlier frantic dash.

Thirty minutes ago, he'd received word of his mother's sudden illness, summoned urgently to a suburban hospital.

But instinct told him something was off.

Midway there, his suspicions were confirmed—a deliberate distraction.

He'd turned the car around immediately while contacting Eleanor Kingsley.

Now, seeing Evelyn Sinclair unharmed, the knot in his chest loosened slightly.

"Julian, you must stand up for your aunt!" Evan's mother rushed forward. "That woman claims to be carrying Evan's child. Our family can't accept some questionable—"

"Proof?" Julian's icy interruption silenced her.

She faltered.

"You'll believe any rumor?" His sharp gaze cut through her. "Have you considered Evan's future with this spectacle?"

The Wells matriarch elbowed forward with a simpering smile. "What does it matter for a man? It's not like he's at a disadvantage—"

"If it's truly no consequence," Julian countered coldly, "then why stage this farce?"

He knew exactly who'd orchestrated this charade.

Were it not for family dignity, he'd expose his mother's scheme on the spot.

Mrs. Wells stammered, "Everyone says she's pregnant..."

"'Everyone'?" Julian's mocking eyebrow lift was lethal. "Are you a fool or a willing pawn? Remember—Horizon Media answers to me."

His words landed like a guillotine.

The Wells clan shriveled into silence.

Their boldness had stemmed from perceived backing.

Now facing true authority, their defiance evaporated.

"Julian..." Melissa's face drained of color.

She couldn't believe he'd personally authorized PetStar's exposé.

Nor that Evan was his cousin.

He'd never shared these connections, watching her humiliation unfold...

Julian's glacial stare swept over her.

He knew precisely who'd spread the rumors.

PetStar's corruption ran deeper than he'd imagined.

The so-called premium pet food company was a shell operation—its factory crammed with scrap metal, products outsourced from unlicensed manufacturers.

They'd scammed consumers with marketing gimmicks, then faked reports for IPO profiteering.

And Melissa had been foolish enough to imprison Evelyn there.

A self-inflicted disaster.

The irony? Evelyn had been ten steps ahead.

She'd not only uncovered PetStar's fraud but initiated a short sell strategy.

Now Evan took credit for it all.

"The editor-in-chief and I noticed red flags immediately at headquarters," Evan narrated smoothly. "I scouted the layout during a coffee run, relaying intel through coded messages..."

Every word came from Evelyn's coaching.

But secrecy was paramount.

Recognizing the cup's hidden symbols, Evelyn had contacted Triad Hyde to short the stock.

Now Hyde reaped millions while Melissa and Penelope faced ruin.

Isabella Winslow had rewarded their anti-Evelyn efforts with discounted PetStar shares.

Melissa's gamble for redemption became worthless paper overnight.

Penelope fared worse—savings obliterated, drowning in debt.

Their plan? Lock Evelyn and Evan without food or water for two days.

Ideally capturing compromising footage.

Instead, surveillance cameras were dismantled within hours.

Evelyn arrived prepared with ample supplies, investigating and drafting exposés while Hyde gathered evidence externally.

Now Melissa understood Evelyn's "go count your funeral money" taunt.

Empty threats met with devastating financial retaliation.

......

With Julian and Eleanor present, the Wells family performed instant reversals.

"A misunderstanding," Mrs. Wells backpedaled with strained cheer. "We were misled—"

Eleanor's laugh was arctic. "How convenient—words change with the wind."

The matriarch resorted to theatrics: "What more do you want? She's unharmed!"

Her bony finger jabbed toward the entertainment department staff. "Ganging up on elders now, are we?"
###Chapter 161: He Would Never Let Go

The Wells family's hypocrisy was nauseating.

They had started the conflict, yet now blamed the victim for not being forgiving enough.

Evelyn Sinclair watched the farce unfold with cold detachment.

Evan Wells suddenly rushed to the window, threatening to jump.

"I can't live with this shame!" he screamed hoarsely. "Editor Sinclair saved my life, and this is how you treat her?"

The room erupted in gasps.

Panicked, the Wells family scrambled to restrain him.

"It was Penelope Pope who made me frame Editor Sinclair!" Evan shouted, eyes bloodshot. "She ordered me to sabotage the Monthly Summit, then sent me to spy on Kingsley Group's trade secrets!"

Penelope turned deathly pale, her back drenched in cold sweat.

The ugly truth lay exposed before everyone.

Her Finance Department colleagues regarded her with open contempt.

"Such despicable tactics..."
"Disgracing Horizon Media's reputation..."

The whispered condemnations cut into Penelope like knives.

Evan continued his damning testimony. "If not for Editor Sinclair's mercy, I'd have lost my fingers to loan sharks!"

Only then did the Wells family grasp the gravity of the situation.

Old Mrs. Wells dropped to her knees before Evelyn. "Our benefactor, we were blind..."

Eleanor Kingsley stepped between them in disgust. "Save your theatrics!"

Chaos ensued.

Eventually, the Wells family slunk away in humiliation.

But Penelope's nightmare had just begun.

HR's transfer order arrived swiftly—relegated to the Printing Department.

From core finance to menial labor, her career lay in ruins.

"Manager Lee, please help me..." she begged Melissa Lee.

Melissa sneered. "Your incompetence isn't my problem."

She had her own crisis—PetStar's massive losses were spiraling out of control.

Isabella Winslow offered hollow promises of loan assistance while shifting blame.

Both women's resentment festered toward Evelyn.

"Unless we eliminate Evelyn Sinclair..." Melissa said darkly.

Meanwhile, Eleanor personally escorted Evelyn home.

"Tomorrow's the adoption ceremony." Eleanor's eyes shone with anticipation. "You'll officially become a Kingsley."

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

In the elevator, they encountered Julian Ashford.

Eleanor extended an invitation. "We'd be honored by your presence, Mr. Ashford."

Julian's intense gaze lingered on Evelyn, lips curving. "Wouldn't miss it."

Something in his expression made Evelyn's pulse quicken.

For the first time, she sensed her senior's possessive undercurrent.

In the Ashford study, William Yearwood slammed the desk. "Have you lost your mind? Antagonizing the Lees for a woman?"

Julian tossed down a financial report.

"Will this compensate our losses?"

William fell silent.

"The Kingsleys are adopting her?" He paled at the invitation.

Julian smirked. "Now, who's unworthy of whom?"

Late that night, Evelyn awoke to scuffling outside her door.

Alexander Kingsley had forced his way past Eleanor's security detail.

"Evelyn!" His voice shattered the stillness. "Come out!"

Only now did the Kingsley heir discover the cruel twist—the woman he loved would soon become his sister.
###Chapter 162: Pregnant - Why Didn't She Tell Him?

Evelyn Sinclair slowly pushed herself up from the bed, fingers combing through her disheveled hair.

She lifted the water glass, but the warm liquid sliding down her throat couldn't dissolve the knot in her chest.

Alexander Kingsley had come for her after all.

Yesterday at PetStar factory, he'd been unexpectedly restrained when taking her away, even politely returning her to Horizon Media.

That detached demeanor almost made her believe he'd truly accepted the news about the Kingsleys adopting her...

Bang!

The bedroom door shuddered from a heavy impact.

Evelyn pulled it open to reveal the tense standoff in her small living room.

Alexander stood at the entryway, flanked by security teams locked in confrontation.

These men from the same protection agency now faced off like enemies.

"Everyone out," Evelyn said softly.

The bodyguards hesitated before finally withdrawing.

The air turned glacial.

Alexander's gaze, sharp as ice, pinned her in place.

She moved to the water dispenser, pouring a glass and setting it on the coffee table. "Have a seat."

He didn't budge.

"Was this what you wanted to tell me last time?" Alexander's voice could freeze hell.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "Yes."

"When was it decided?" He advanced like a predator.

"After my last hospitalization." She met his question squarely.

Alexander gave a mirthless laugh. "Who else in the Kingsley family doesn't know?"

The question hung between them like a blade.

Evelyn lifted her eyes. "Just you."

Those three words made his jaw clench.

"And outside the family?"

"You found out the same time they did."

He nodded, frost gathering in his eyes.

Perfect.

He'd been the last to know.

After thirteen years under the Kingsley roof, they'd kept her at arm's length because of her childhood vow to "marry Alexander."

Now she'd changed her mind, and they'd invented a new way to keep her.

In this happy family reunion, only he stood excluded.

"Evelyn," he suddenly closed the distance, "you shared my bed for five years. Since when do siblings do that?"

"So," she held his gaze, "it won't happen again."

Alexander's pupils contracted.

"All to escape me?" His voice roughened. "You hate me that much?"

He seized her collar, yanking her close.

"You think becoming a Kingsley will stop me? Who could prevent what I want?"

Evelyn didn't flinch. "Unless you no longer care about the family's reputation."

"You know what I care about." His words came through gritted teeth. "Losing you makes everything else meaningless."

He bent suddenly, teeth sinking into her neck.

Evelyn gasped at the pain, familiar dizziness washing over her.

"Let go—" Her breath fragmented.

Alexander released her abruptly.

Straightening, he watched coldly as she collapsed onto the sofa, face drained of color.

"There's only one way into the Kingsley family." He turned to leave. "You know it."

......
At Kingsbury Manor at dawn, the Patriarch walked arm-in-arm with Madeline Kingsley.

They'd barely exited their rooms when the figure in the hallway startled them.

Alexander leaned against the wall, eyes bloodshot.

"Cancel the banquet." No preamble.

The Patriarch erupted. "Invitations are already sent!"

"Alex," Madeline caught his arm anxiously, "with the Kingsley name, Evelyn will have better marriage prospects."

Alexander sneered. "Even you can't accept her infertility, yet expect others to cherish her?"

"Outrageous!" The Patriarch thundered. "The problem is Evelyn doesn't want you!"

"Have you considered, Grandfather," Alexander countered, "she might be refusing for the family's sake?"

The old man faltered.

"Stop poisoning your father's mind!" Eleanor Kingsley ascended the stairs. "We all know why Evelyn left you."

Her husband followed. "Who pushed her to this?"

Eleanor's icy gaze swept over her son. "Anyone who stops me from claiming my daughter today is no son of mine."

......
Evelyn never expected Mrs. Ashford's visit.

The phone call claiming she waited downstairs seemed a joke.

Until she lifted the curtain to see the parasol-holding figure in the garden.

Courtesy compelled her downstairs.

"Evelyn dear," Mrs. Ashford seized her hands warmly, "why keep such wonderful news secret?"

Evelyn frowned.

What concern was the Kingsley adoption to the Ashfords?

"Some announcements require proper timing." She politely withdrew her hands.

"But I know everything," Mrs. Ashford recaptured her grasp, stroking her abdomen. "You must take care in your condition. Julian's been frantic with worry."

Evelyn froze.

Condition?

Her disbelieving gaze dropped to her stomach.
###Chapter 163: Too Late, Little One

Mrs. Ashford's words struck Evelyn like a thunderbolt, leaving her dizzy and disoriented.

"The Ashfords aren't unreasonable people." Mrs. Ashford smiled warmly. "You lost Julian's child before. Now that you're pregnant again, we won't deny responsibility."

Evelyn's throat tightened.

She recalled her recent symptoms—unexplained fatigue, nausea, mood swings...

Her fingers drifted unconsciously to her abdomen.

"How did you know?" Her voice was feather-light.

Mrs. Ashford's smile faltered. "A mother always keeps tabs on her future daughter-in-law."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

Julian had ordered blood tests during her last checkup but never shared the results.

He'd known all along...

"So," Evelyn stood abruptly, "you sent the Wells family to harass me, hoping I'd miscarry?"

No wonder old Mrs. Wells kept lunging at her stomach.

Mrs. Ashford's face darkened. "How dare you! That's my grandchild!"

"Your grandchild?" Evelyn laughed coldly. "Melissa Lee is your ideal daughter-in-law. You're only here because I'm about to become a Kingsley."

Caught in her lie, Mrs. Ashford's expression twisted.

"Julian and I are over. This child won't be an Ashford." Evelyn turned on her heel.

At home, she immediately called Evan Wells.

"Little brother, I need a favor."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn retrieved a pregnancy test from her mailbox.

In the bathroom, two stark red lines burned her vision.

It must have happened at the Patriarch's birthday banquet...

She caressed her stomach with a bitter smile. "You picked quite the timing, little one."

Three months earlier, she might have stayed with Alexander for the baby's sake.

But now...

Curling up in bed, Evelyn cradled her abdomen.

"Mommy will protect you."

No one would harm her child.

At the Kingsley gala, whispers rippled through the crowd.

"Did you hear? They're adopting some orphan girl."

"Lucky thing..."

Eleanor Kingsley anxiously instructed security: "Keep Alexander away. Don't let him cause a scene."

In the shadows, William West watched everything with icy detachment.

Isabella's voice echoed in his mind: "I won't let her have this moment..."

His fingers brushed the U盘 in his pocket as a smirk curled his lips.

Suddenly, murmurs erupted across the ballroom.

Alexander Kingsley strode in with two unexpected guests.

Eleanor's face drained of color.
###Chapter 164: Evelyn, Will You Marry Me?

"Mr. Sullivan?" Eleanor Kingsley's eyes flickered, her lips curving into a practiced smile.

She discreetly studied the uninvited couple before her.

Madam Zade clung to her husband's arm, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"Mrs. Kingsley," Madam Zade's soft voice carried unexpected weight, "we're here to stop the Kingsleys from adopting Evelyn."

The banquet hall fell silent.

William West straightened from the shadows, amusement glinting in his eyes.

"This..." Eleanor's smile froze, "Evelyn and you..."

"She already calls me mother." Madam Zade's eyes reddened. "If Alexander hadn't forcibly taken her thirteen years ago, she would have been our daughter."

Eleanor whirled toward Alexander Kingsley.

"I did it." Alexander stepped forward, his voice terrifyingly calm. "I hid her in the trunk when I brought her back."

Eleanor gasped.

"Have you lost your mind?" she hissed. "Why bring this up now?"

Alexander's gaze turned glacial. "You must choose between her and me."

Mr. Kingsley's face darkened with rage. "Do you realize what you're saying?"

"Mr. Kingsley." Vincent Sullivan finally spoke. "Evelyn did acknowledge my wife as her mother. She even entrusted us with her birth mother's keepsake."

He produced a gilded booklet from his coat.

"This is the proof—"

"Auntie Zhou!"

Evelyn Sinclair's voice rang out from behind them.

Madam Zade turned eagerly, accidentally knocking the booklet to the floor.

William West narrowed his eyes and retreated into the shadows.

"Evelyn!" Madam Zade seized Evelyn's hands. "You promised to be my daughter!"

Evelyn gently returned the clasp. "Auntie Zhou, I remember everything now."

She turned to Eleanor with apologetic eyes. "Mrs. Kingsley, I'm sorry..."

Eleanor paled. "Evelyn, we can still discuss—"

"Enough." Alexander cut in. "Forced affection bears no sweetness."

Eleanor staggered back before fleeing the hall.

Mr. Kingsley shot his son a venomous glare and hurried after his wife.

...

Isabella Winslow nearly danced with joy upon hearing the news.

"William, this is all thanks to you!" She clung to William West's arm.

William mused, "Do you know what keepsake Evelyn's mother left behind?"

Isabella's fingers stiffened. "N-no idea..."

She forced a smile and changed the subject. "After the Sinclairs fell, the Kingsleys took everything valuable."

William nodded thoughtfully.

...

Moonlight bathed the Sullivan garden.

"That butterfly brooch..." Vincent studied Alexander's sudden pallor. "The one you asked me about years ago?"

Alexander's blood turned to ice.

He remembered Evelyn's swollen eyes, how she'd cradled the brooch with such care.

Not a tantrum—but grief.

The night breeze carried floral whispers.

When Evelyn stepped outside, she found Alexander waiting in the moonlight.

He approached and knelt before her.

A diamond ring glittered like captured starlight.

"Evelyn." His voice roughened. "Will you marry me?"
###Chapter 165: Evelyn, I Can't Live Without You

Alexander Kingsley dropped to one knee. Evelyn Sinclair's fingers trembled slightly.

Thirteen years of memories flashed through her mind like a kaleidoscope.

The cold profile of the boy she first met. His slender fingers guiding hers as he taught her calligraphy. His retreating back when he turned away from her.

The image froze on two red lines of a pregnancy test.

"A baby needs a father..."

She crushed the thought before it could take root.

The diamond ring in Alexander's hand gleamed cold under the moonlight. She recognized the design instantly—identical to the engagement ring Isabella Winslow had flaunted last birthday.

"Alexander," her voice was shards of ice, "I will never marry."

Headlights pierced the darkness—the Sullivan family car approaching.

"What if I find the Butterfly Brooch?" Alexander called after her.

Evelyn paused mid-step.

"Don't you understand?" Tears glistened as she turned. "The brooch was never the problem."

The night wind lifted the hem of her coat.

"Can you swear you won't revert to your old ways after marriage? With legal bonds and a child, I'd have no escape."

Alexander seized her wrist.

"I'll transfer all my Kingsley Group shares to you."

"I don't want your money!" She wrenched free. "I want respect! Did my feelings ever cross your mind?"

Their elongated shadows stretched across the pavement.

Alexander's throat moved. "I'll change."

"How?" She pointed at the ring. "By recycling your ex-fiancée's engagement ring design?"

His face darkened. "This isn't—"

"Enough." Evelyn cut him off. "You always presume to know best."

As she turned, Alexander suddenly embraced her from behind.

"Don't go..."

Evelyn went rigid.

"Alexander," her voice shook, "this only makes me despise you more."

"Then despise me." His arms tightened. "I'd rather you hate me than lose you."

A distant car horn blared.

Evelyn pried his fingers open one by one. "I'm going home."

At 3 AM, the doorbell shattered the silence.

Julian Ashford knelt on her doorstep, reeking of alcohol.

"Marry me..." His forehead pressed against her knees. "Let me take you away from here..."

The acrid scent of liquor mixed with night dew assaulted her senses.

Evelyn stared at the senior who'd protected her since childhood, seeing a stranger for the first time.
###Chapter 166: Like Newlyweds

"Julian?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she knelt beside Julian Ashford. His entire body shook violently, as if all strength had been drained from him.

She had never seen him like this.

"Evelyn..." His voice was raw with emotion. "I'm sorry..."

Those always steady hands now gripped her shoulders with bruising force, knuckles turning white. She could feel the violent rise and fall of his chest against hers.

"Julian, let's get you up first." She tried to help him stand, but was suddenly yanked into a scorching embrace.

The heavy scent of alcohol clung to him.

"Just once..." His broken plea sent shivers down her spine. "Let me hold you just this once..."

Evelyn froze.

The embrace was crushing, as if he wanted to fuse her into his very bones. She felt his frantic heartbeat against her chest—and something wet and hot dripping onto her neck.

"Julian..." She pushed weakly against him.

He suddenly cupped her face. Those usually gentle eyes were now bloodshot, burning with unfamiliar intensity.

"We'll leave tonight." His breath scorched her skin. "Abroad... I'll marry you."

Evelyn's pupils contracted sharply. She clapped a hand over his mouth.

After swiftly closing the door, she turned to find Julian slumped against the wall. His dazed yet stubborn gaze followed her movements.

"You're drunk, Julian."

"I know exactly what I'm saying." His laugh was uglier than a sob. "She went to see you, didn't she? Told you about the pregnancy rumor..."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"Such a fool..." He dragged a hand down his face. "To think she'd ever change..."

Last night's argument replayed vividly. Mrs. Ashford's hysterical shrieks still echoed—

"That girl isn't worthy of our family! Either abort it or hand the baby over!"

Julian suddenly punched the wall. Blood bloomed across his knuckles.

"Julian!" Evelyn grabbed his injured hand. "This isn't your fault."

"Isn't it?" His grip turned punishing. "I could have protected you..."

His voice dropped to a whisper: "Evelyn... if the baby needs a father..."

She yanked her hand away.

The air turned glacial.

"I see." Julian's smile was bitter. "You still..."

"I don't want to think about this now." She turned her face away. "With anyone."

......

Dawn light filtered through the curtains as Julian sat up, massaging his temples.

A soft clatter came from the living room.

"Awake?" Evelyn was slipping on her shoes. "There's congee on the table. I need to—"

Julian cornered her against the door in three strides.

"I meant every word last night." His morning voice was still rough. "We're running out of time before the pregnancy shows."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "Julian..."

"Marry me." He stepped closer. "Let's start fresh overseas."

The proximity was overwhelming. She could smell the lingering alcohol mingled with mint toothpaste.

"I..."

"Taxi's here!" She ducked under his arm like a reprieved prisoner.

Julian chased after her, grabbing her wrist at the gate. "Watch where you're going."

A scooter nearly grazed Evelyn as it sped past.

"How can I not worry?" He shielded her with his body, exasperation lacing his tone.

Evelyn smoothed wind-tossed hair. "You're being unusually protective. It's strange."

"I know how to make it feel natural." Julian suddenly leaned down, his whisper curling around her ear. "Become Mrs. Ashford."

"You—!" Scarlet bloomed across her ears as she raised a hand to hit him.

Julian easily caught her wrist, bundling her into the cab. "You'll be late, Miss Sinclair."

"Whose fault is that?"

"Shall I approve your wedding leave then?"

"Julian Ashford!"

......

Inside the black Maybach, the air had turned arctic.

Ethan Miller didn't dare breathe too loudly, stealing glances at the rearview mirror.

Alexander Kingsley stared impassively at the bickering pair in the distance. They looked so perfectly matched, like...

"Lord Alex, shall we follow?"

The only response was the sound of cracking knuckles.
###Chapter 167: The Doppelgänger Scandal

Alexander's fingers tapped rhythmically against the car window frame.

"Pull over." His voice was rough like sandpaper.

Ethan signaled the driver immediately. "Lord Alex?"

"Stop following them."

He couldn't bear seeing Evelyn standing beside Julian again.

That ridiculous suspicion haunted him—that Evelyn rejected him because she loved Julian.

Alexander's fingers clenched involuntarily.

If only Julian would disappear...

He crushed the thought instantly.

Even without Julian, she wouldn't return.

"Back to the office." He closed his eyes, temples throbbing.

Ethan glanced worriedly at the rearview mirror. "Lord Alex, you look pale—"

"Silence."

When the car stopped at Kingsley Tower, Alexander nearly collapsed.

Ethan rushed to steady him. "You're burning up! Should I—"

"Get me fever reducers." Alexander shook him off. "No more comments."

He detested anyone implying he was playing the victim.

......

The Horizon Media receptionist's eyes widened.

Evelyn entered alongside Julian, who even held the elevator door for her.

"Rumor says they're living together..."

"No wonder Director Yearwood's been so grim lately."

A shattering cup echoed from William Yearwood's office.

"Have you lost your mind?" He jabbed a finger at Julian. "Do you hear what people are saying?"

Julian adjusted his cufflinks indifferently. "She's pregnant. With my child."

"You—!" William trembled with rage. "Your mother cried until dawn!"

"Then you should understand," Julian's icy gaze lifted, "what I'll do if you touch her again."

He left his fuming father behind.

Julian knew Evelyn was hiding something.

Since she chose silence, this child would be his.

No matter what, he'd protect her.

......

[Cousin-in-law!] Evan's DM popped up.

Evelyn frowned: [Don't call me that.]

[My cousin admitted it!] Evan quickly retracted the message, replacing it with a smirk emoji.

Evelyn didn't respond.

Her hand rested on her still-flat stomach, thoughts drifting.

"Evelyn," Penelope approached, "I've sent you the work documents."

Evelyn opened the file, immediately pointing out errors.

Penelope leaned closer, then suddenly covered her nose. "Did you change perfumes?"

"No?" Evelyn looked puzzled.

"It's so fragrant..." Evan inhaled deeply. "Like gardenias."

Evelyn's chest tightened abruptly.

This scent... something was wrong.

......

Mr. Kingsley pushed open the CEO's office door.

"Dinner at home tonight." He noted his son's pallor. "Your mother's eyes are swollen from crying."

Alexander didn't look up. "Working late."

"If you ruin your health, how will you win Evelyn back?"

The pen scratched across documents.

Alexander sneered. "What's that to her?"

"Fine," Mr. Kingsley surrendered, "at least visit your grandmother."

That evening, the Kingsley mansion blazed with lights.

Alexander froze upon entry.

A strange girl sat on the sofa, her demure smile eerily familiar.

"This is the Young heiress," Madeline introduced brightly. "You met as children."

The girl peeked up shyly. "Brother Alex..."

Alexander's expression turned glacial.

Had they really found a doppelgänger resembling Evelyn?

"Grandmother." He gritted his teeth, pulling Madeline aside. "Explain this."

"Just meeting potential matches..." she prattled.

"Impossible." Alexander cut her off. "I—"

He suddenly whispered something inaudible.

"What?!" Madeline shrieked. "Say that again!"

In the dining room, Miss Young dropped her soup spoon in terror.
###Chapter 168: Alexander, I'm Carrying Your Child

The Kingsley mansion descended into chaos.

"Stop right there!" The Dowager's shrill scream pierced the night. "Ungrateful boy! If you step through that door, I'll kill myself!"

Dishes clattered in the dining room as everyone scrambled to their feet.

Alexander Kingsley strode down the corridor, brushing past frantic family members.

In the parlor, the Dowager collapsed beside the leather sofa, her hair disheveled and cheeks streaked with tears.

"Mother!" Eleanor Kingsley rushed to support her.

"Let me die..." The old woman beat her chest. "What sin did I commit to raise such a monster..."

When Eleanor turned, she only saw her son's retreating back disappearing through the foyer.

The Song heiress sat rigidly through the spectacle.

As the Kingsleys summoned cars for departing guests, a doctor hurried in with his medical bag.

The Dowager was helped to bed for oxygen while the family fussed around her.

Her sobs eventually subsided, but she pressed her lips shut despite Patriarch Kingsley's anxious pacing.

Finally, she dismissed everyone except Eleanor.

"Eleanor," the Dowager rasped, "I know you dote on Evelyn. Our family wronged her. But what she's done to Alexander—I'll never forgive, even in death!"

Eleanor recoiled as if struck.

Further questions yielded only stubborn silence...

......

"The Kingsleys are shopping for a new daughter-in-law." Mrs. Winslow adjusted her tea set. "The third Song girl dined with them last night."

Isabella Winslow's fingers jerked, nearly dropping her cup.

"That trash?" Her laugh was icy.

Mrs. Winslow shrugged. "Honestly, I think—"

The butler burst in breathlessly. "Madam! Mr. Kingsley is here!"

Mother and daughter stood simultaneously, eyes lighting up.

"The police are with him." The butler's next words froze them in place.

Alexander arrived with law enforcement.

Presenting surveillance footage and brooch photographs as evidence, Isabella was detained for questioning.

Her incoherent statements in the interrogation room deepened police suspicions.

A search warrant was swiftly approved.

Alexander waited confidently for results.

But the police report made his expression darken.

"Nothing?" His voice could frost glass.

Officers displayed the seized butterfly accessories.

Alexander's gaze locked onto a diamond ring.

"This..." He produced an identical ring from his pocket.

The twin engagement rings glittered under the lights.

"Found in Miss Winslow's jewelry box," an officer explained.

Alexander's knuckles whitened.

This custom-designed ring was supposed to be one-of-a-kind.

He remembered Evelyn's hesitation when refusing it...

Rage ignited instantly.

Though the brooch remained missing, Isabella's guilt was undeniable.

Recalling her schemes against Evelyn, his eyes turned glacial.

......

Eleanor's call interrupted his thoughts.

"Your grandmother's blood pressure is through the roof!" she scolded. "Come now!"

Alexander recognized his mother's probing.

But he had to go.

"I won't pressure Evelyn anymore," Eleanor sighed. "But thinking of her calling someone else 'Mother'..."

Alexander realized where his stubbornness came from.

After all her wavering, his mother had returned to his side.

In the garden, mahjong tiles clattered as society matrons perked up at his arrival.

"Alexander, are you seeing anyone?"

"My niece just returned from Paris..."

He sat expressionlessly—until his pupils contracted.

Every woman at the table wore that familiar diamond ring.

"Mrs. Chen started the trend—we all had to have one," Eleanor boasted, twisting her wrist. "Lovely, no?"

These women cared nothing for carats.

Only about outshining their peers.

Alexander slammed the door on his way out.

Nathan Carter's call came at the perfect moment.

"Isabella still denies everything. Police lack concrete evidence..."

"The designer's assistant leaked the specs, but no ties to Miss Winslow..."

"Drop it." Alexander's voice was arctic. "I'll handle this."

......

On the Autumn Detail building's rooftop, Isabella's screams scattered in the wind.

"Alexander...please..."

She never imagined this outcome when accepting his invitation.

Rusted railings groaned as she dangled upside down seven stories above ground.

"Where's the brooch?" Alexander asked nothing else.

"I truly don't know..."

Isabella clenched her teeth.

That brooch had gone to William West—her final bargaining chip.

"Before dawn." Alexander stood. "Choose wisely."

Isabella suddenly shrieked: "I'm pregnant! With your child! After that night, I..."

The wind swallowed her cries.
###Chapter 169: He Wanted to Terminate Her Pregnancy

"Say that again." Alexander Kingsley lunged forward, yanking Isabella Winslow back from the rooftop's edge.

A blade flashed, severing the ropes binding her legs.

Isabella barely hit the ground before searing pain tore through her scalp.

Alexander fisted her long hair, dragging her like a sack before tossing her to his security detail.

"Take her to the hospital."

His voice dripped with ice.

Isabella instantly understood his intent.

"Alex!" She shrieked, scrambling toward him. "This is your child! How can you be so cruel?"

She'd hoped the pregnancy would buy mercy.

Instead, it hastened her doom.

Alexander kicked her away, gripping her chin to force eye contact.

"Who gave you permission to touch me? Who dared you carry this bastard?"

The murderous glint in his eyes made her tremble.

This man wanted both her and the baby dead.

In the hospital's midnight halls, muffled screams echoed as Isabella was hauled into surgery.

Alexander reclined in his car, eyes closed.

Her suffering meant nothing—only eliminating this problem mattered.

That night's truth remained elusive.

Now, he'd get answers.

If Isabella claimed this was his child, the aborted fetus would provide DNA proof.

He was 90% certain it wasn't his.

One test would let him tell Evelyn Sinclair with absolute certainty—

Nothing had ever happened between him and Isabella.

"My lord." A bodyguard rushed over. "Complications."

Alexander frowned. "Explain."

"Madeline Kingsley is here."

Chaos erupted outside the operating room.

The matriarch shielded Isabella like a lioness defending her cub.

"Touch her, and you declare war on the Kingsleys!"

Isabella sobbed into the elder's embrace. "Grandmother, save me... This is Alex's baby..."

Madeline patted her back before glaring at the guards.

Then footsteps approached.

The crowd parted as Alexander strode forward.

"Monster!" Madeline jabbed a finger at him. "Destroy yourself if you must, but not our bloodline!"

Alexander remained impassive. "Step aside."

"Never!" Madeline's voice rose sharply. "Must I expose your filth? I nearly died birthing your father! Is this your gratitude?"

Alexander narrowed his eyes. "Who alerted you?"

He'd confiscated all of Isabella's devices.

"Divine intervention!" Madeline beat her chest. "Harm her today, and I'll take my own life!"

Alexander gestured. Guards moved to intervene.

Amid the chaos, Madeline suddenly looked past him. "Evelyn! Control him!"

Alexander whirled around.

Evelyn stood yards away—with Julian Ashford beside her.

His blood turned to cement.

Of all places to cross paths—Sophie was still hospitalized here.

A miscalculation.

"Evelyn," Madeline wept, "he'll end the Kingsley line..."

Alexander advanced. "Evelyn, I can prove—"

"If it's not yours," Evelyn cut in coldly, "why not let it live? Your cruelty toward women remains unmatched."

A chilling thought struck her—

Had she not left, would she be the one on that operating table?

"Evelyn!" Isabella suddenly lunged at her. "Please save my baby..."

Evelyn looked down with detached indifference.

"Why should I care?"

She took Julian's hand. "Let's go, Julian."

"Evelyn!" Alexander seized her wrist. "Once I prove it's not mine—"

Julian shoved him back. "Alexander! Keep your mess away from Evelyn!"
###Chapter 170: The Grandmother's Plea

Alexander Kingsley shoved Julian Ashford aside.

He seized Evelyn Sinclair's wrist, pulling her close.

"Evelyn, Isabella and I are innocent," he said darkly. "But she dared threaten me with this child. Tonight, I'll expose her lies."

"What if it's yours?" Madeline Kingsley's voice trembled. "Would you kill your own flesh and blood? And if it's not, what right do you have to interfere?"

"Then why is she carrying someone else's child?" Alexander sneered. "If it's mine, I decide its fate. If not, I'll uncover her scheme."

Madeline's eyes burned with desperation. "Can't we wait until the baby is born?"

"Wait?" His gaze turned glacial. "That would be true cruelty."

Cruelty to Evelyn.

Why should she endure Isabella's manipulations?

"You caused this!" Madeline accused. "Now Isabella bears the consequences alone?"

"Then I'll end this mistake," Alexander stated coldly.

Isabella cowered behind Madeline, sobbing. "Alex, I know you hate me... I'll disappear with the baby. I won't disturb you and Evelyn—"

"No!" Madeline clutched her arm. "A Kingsley heir must be recognized!"

Alexander smirked. "Then let's settle this now."

At his signal, security separated them, silencing Isabella.

Suddenly, Madeline turned and dropped to her knees before Evelyn.

"Evelyn, spare our family!"

Shocked, Evelyn reached for her. "Grandmother—"

Madeline gripped her painfully. "The Kingsleys need this child... Alex's only bloodline..."

"Please stand." Evelyn winced as nails dug into her skin.

Alexander hauled Madeline up from behind.

Julian swiftly shielded Evelyn, guiding her away.

Madeline wailed, "Evelyn, I'll approve your marriage! Just let the baby live... Let it call you Mother!"

"I refuse this child!" Alexander roared. "This isn't Evelyn's doing!"

He forcibly restrained Madeline.

She clawed at his collar. "You're doing this for her, aren't you?"

Julian escorted Evelyn to safety.

He'd brought her for a prenatal checkup, never expecting this chaos.

Commotion erupted down the hall.

"Isabella!"

"Release my daughter!"

The Winslows had arrived.

"Mom! Dad! Help me—" Isabella shrieked.

She silently thanked William West for his advice.

Chaos engulfed the corridor.

Julian seized the moment to spirit Evelyn away.

That night, he stood vigil at her apartment.

Alexander came pounding at the door, then attempted to pick the lock.

Learning Julian was inside, his rage exploded.

The altercation drew police intervention.

Evelyn had no choice but to open up.

The Kingsleys arrived en masse.

Eleanor Kingsley shielded her. "Let's discuss this calmly."

Alexander stormed in, scanning the rooms. His tension eased slightly—no signs of male occupation.

"Evelyn, speak with me privately," Madeline begged.

"No!" Alexander cut in. "Grandmother, stop wasting effort."

Madeline glared. "Must I say it publicly?"

"Go ahead." He smirked. "Let's see who truly harms the Kingsleys."

"You—" Madeline shook with fury.

Evelyn inhaled deeply. "Grandmother, come inside."

Alexander blocked her path. "We need to talk first."

"Fine." Eleanor warned him with a look. "Don't intimidate her."

The door remained open.

Under Julian's watchful gaze, Evelyn led Alexander into the bedroom.

She struck first. "Alexander, do you truly believe you control everything in love?"
###Chapter 171: Mad with Longing

Alexander Kingsley's slender fingers brushed past the nightstand, effortlessly picking up the bottle of white pills.

The label for Vitamin B9 gleamed coldly under the light.

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched.

Those were the supplements Julian Ashford had specially prepared for her.

Thankfully, Alexander merely glanced at the bottle before setting it back down.

As he turned, dark emotions swirled in his eyes. "This marriage—I'll let you call the shots."

"Marriage?" Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile.

Alexander's gaze darkened. "I won't marry anyone else."

"But sleeping around is fine?" The words tumbled out before she could stop them.

The air turned to ice.

Alexander's throat moved. "Evelyn, let's not do this..."

"That ring was my original design. I never expected the blueprint to leak."

"I will get the brooch back."

Suddenly, his hands clamped onto her shoulders, his voice rough. "Hate me. Punish me. But you have to come back to me."

Evelyn met his unusually vulnerable gaze.

"What does Madeline want to say?" She abruptly changed the subject. "The Kingsleys need an heir. Who will you choose to mother your child?"

Isabella Winslow's name hung between them.

"I'll handle it," Alexander said firmly.

"Some things can't be undone." Evelyn took a step back. "All I want is for you to stay out of my life."

She had to protect the child growing inside her.

Yet Alexander kept dragging her into his battles.

"I need to rest." She glanced pointedly at the clock.

Alexander yanked a chair over and sat. "Then sleep."

"How can I with you here?"

"I'll make them leave."

"Alexander!" Her voice trembled. "Please, just let me go."

"So Julian can stay?" His eyes turned dangerous.

Exhausted, Evelyn turned away.

The world spun as Alexander hauled her against his chest from behind.

She froze, terrified of harming her abdomen.

"Don't..." Her voice cracked.

But Alexander only crushed her tighter, as if trying to fuse their bodies together.

"Evelyn..." His scorching breath grazed her ear.

Her fingers closed around the fruit knife hidden under her pillow, pressing the blade to her throat.

"Touch me again and I'll slit my throat right here."

Hot tears splashed onto Alexander's hands, making him recoil.

Five minutes later, he finally relented and left.

Evelyn locked the door and collapsed to the floor.

The folic acid bottle glowed faintly on the nightstand.

She had to escape—soon.

That night, phantom touches disturbed her restless sleep.

At dawn, she opened her bedroom door to find Eleanor Kingsley and Alexander waiting in the living room.

"Sign it." Alexander slid a document across the table.
###Chapter 172: Redemption of Two Men

Evelyn hesitated as she took the document.

Alexander's voice was low and resolute. "A one-year marriage contract. You can terminate it anytime if you're dissatisfied with me. When that happens, you may choose any asset from Kingsley Group or the Kingsley family to take with you."

She froze in place.

"You absolute fool!" Eleanor sprang from the couch, snatching the papers and tearing them to shreds. "Since when is marriage a game? How dare you measure feelings with a contract! What on earth is wrong with you?"

Alexander ignored her, his intense gaze fixed on Evelyn. "The law will guarantee your rights."

"The law?" A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips.

To the powerful, the law was merely shackles for the weak. This contract might very well become her prison.

"Don't listen to him, Evelyn." Eleanor swayed unsteadily as she stood.

Evelyn quickly steadied her, guilt flooding her heart. The refined Eleanor had stayed up all night on the couch just to keep her company.

"I'll drive you to work." Alexander picked up his coat.

His car waited downstairs, the driver nowhere in sight.

"You haven't slept all night. I'll drive." Eleanor snatched the keys.

Evelyn found herself forced to sit beside Alexander in the backseat.

"Consider the contract," he said abruptly as they neared Horizon Media. "I'll handle Grandmother. As for everything else... I promise you answers."

His eyes burned with determination. One year would be enough to win her back.

Evelyn exited the car in silence, walking into the building without a backward glance.

......

The sickening perfume scent drifted over again.

Evelyn pressed her fingers to her temples as nausea rose. She stood to get some air.

"Ah—!" Penelope suddenly let out a piercing scream. "My stomach... Help me!"

The office erupted into chaos.

"Penelope!"

"Call an ambulance!"

"Oh God, she's bleeding!"

Penelope curled on the floor, a pool of crimson spreading beneath her.
###Chapter 173: Evelyn's Secret Escape

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

Alexander's figure appeared at the police station entrance, and her breath hitched.

How had he found her?

...

Not only had Alexander come, but he'd brought damning evidence.

"Horizon Media employee Penelope Pope was diagnosed with fetal abnormalities last week," he stated coldly, tossing a file onto the table. "The incense in her bedroom contained the same toxins as the sponge—just in higher concentrations."

As the officer took the documents, Alexander's gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Julian stood protectively behind her.

Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously.

"She scheduled then canceled an abortion. Here's proof she purchased termination pills." His voice was ice. "Release her. Now."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Thank you."

Penelope's scheme had crumbled instantly.

But her pulse raced—Alexander's timing was too perfect.

The police had just promised to keep her pregnancy confidential.

"Move." Alexander gripped her wrist and pulled her past stunned onlookers.

Julian remained motionless until they disappeared, then turned to the precinct chief. "Remember our agreement. Absolute discretion."

...

Horizon Media Headquarters

Julian guided Evelyn into an empty conference room.

"This won't stay hidden long." His voice strained. "Have you decided?"

Evelyn kept her eyes downcast.

"More incidents like today will happen." Julian suddenly grasped her shoulders. "Let me protect you both."

He crouched to eye level. "A child needs its father. Give me this chance."

Silence thickened between them.

"I'll arrange overseas relocation immediately." His whisper feathered across her skin. "Just the three of us, away from this chaos."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms.

She was preparing to leave—but not with Julian.

"I want to raise the child alone." Her voice barely carried. "You deserve better, Julian."

"Better than you?" Red tinged his eyes. "How will you manage alone? I'm coming with you."

His hands shook. "Every second abroad, I thought of you."

"Evelyn." His plea burned into her soul. "Answer me."

Finally, she gave a slight nod. "Give me three days."

Julian's eyes glistened.

He embraced her gently, as if cradling glass.

His breath stirred her hair.

"I'll wait."

...

Horizon Media erupted.

With Penelope's scheme exposed, Evelyn's inbox flooded with support from colleagues.

This place that once broke her now offered warmth—just as she prepared to leave.

But Julian's expectant face haunted her.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

In three days, she'd be gone.

Triad Hyde's escape plan was flawless.

Scarlet's promised funds would cover the baby's needs and Sophie's treatments.

Only her plan to rebuild Autumn Detail would have to wait.

...

After watering her office plant one last time, Evelyn surveyed her workspace.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Madam Ashford's piercing stare.

"A word?" The aristocrat tilted her chin toward a waiting car.

Evelyn entered calmly.

A black card slid across the leather seat. "Five million for your silence."

As Evelyn reached for the door handle, Madam Ashford sneered. "More than enough for that bastard in your womb."

"Never!" Evelyn yanked at the door.

"You have no choice!" Madam Ashford barked. "Drive!"

The car lurched forward.

"You think a brat can steal my son?" Her nails gouged the upholstery. "Dream on!"
###Chapter 174: Tonight's Escape

"Auntie, you've misunderstood." Evelyn Sinclair's fingers tightened around her bag strap, knuckles turning white.

Mrs. Ashford scoffed and snatched the bag from her, tossing it to the bodyguard in the front seat.

"Get rid of the child."

"This is my baby!" Evelyn's voice trembled. "You have no right to decide his fate."

"You think you can secretly carry an Ashford heir?" Mrs. Ashford's eyes darkened with malice.

The car sped faster, the scenery outside blurring. Evelyn shielded her abdomen, nails digging into her palms.

"Auntie, I'll leave Kingsbury tomorrow. I'll never bother the Ashfords again."

"Lies!" Mrs. Ashford snapped. "Someone heard you plotting to elope with Julian!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Melissa Lee.

"It's not Julian's child," she whispered. "What you're doing is illegal."

"Illegal?" Mrs. Ashford sneered. "We'll see how brave you are when we arrive."

As the car headed toward the outskirts, Evelyn stared out the window, her heart pounding.

"Auntie, please spare my baby." Her voice softened suddenly. "He's all I have left."

"You should've thought of that sooner." Mrs. Ashford lifted her chin triumphantly. "If you'd waited until after Julian's marriage, I might've let you live."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, shadows hiding the ice in her gaze.

"Please..."

"Too late!" Mrs. Ashford raised her hand—

A cold blade pressed against her throat.

"Tell the driver to turn around." Evelyn's voice was glacial.

The bodyguard turned, meeting her sharp stare, and instinctively stepped back.

Mrs. Ashford's phone rang.

"Answer it. Put it on speaker." The blade pressed closer.

"Julian! Help—" Mrs. Ashford's cry was cut off by a calm reply: "Stop the car. I'm behind you."

When the door opened, Julian Ashford saw—

Evelyn gripping his mother, a combat knife steady at her throat. Her gaze was razor-sharp, radiating lethal intent.

"Step back three meters," she ordered.

Julian immediately retreated, his voice gentle. "Evelyn, it's over."

She maneuvered Mrs. Ashford out of the car. Just as the bodyguard reached for his phone, Julian lunged forward—

He yanked his mother away, then shoved her toward the bodyguard, grabbing Evelyn's hand and sprinting.

"Traitor!" Mrs. Ashford's scream faded behind them.

The Maybach roared down the road, Evelyn's grip on the steering wheel bone-white.

"Evelyn, stop!" Julian called for the third time before seizing the wheel.

Tires screeched. Evelyn collapsed against the steering wheel, shaking.

Julian pulled her into his arms, feeling her tears soak through his shirt.

"We're leaving now," he murmured into her hair. "Far away from all of this."

Evelyn lifted tear-filled eyes. "Our passports are in the nightstand... Sophie's too..."

Julian's expression brightened. "Wait for me at the airport. I'll get Sophie."

Three hours later, Kingsbury International Airport.

Evelyn barely ended a call when a group of men in black suits advanced toward her...

[To Be Continued]
###Chapter 175: Miscarriage or Marry Me – Choose One

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

She stared at the bustling crowd at customs, clutching her plane ticket tightly.

Suddenly, commotion erupted behind her.

"There she is! Stop her!"

Madam Ashford's shrill voice pierced through the airport noise.

Evelyn whirled around to see Madam Ashford charging toward her with over a dozen bodyguards.

She turned and sprinted for the customs checkpoint.

"Don't let her escape!"

"Grab that woman!"

Evelyn's heart pounded so hard it threatened to burst from her chest.

Protecting her abdomen, she desperately ran toward the police station.

"Block her path!"

"Pull her hair!"

A large hand yanked her collar violently.

Evelyn stumbled as she was dragged into a corner.

"Beat her to death!" Madam Ashford snarled. "Focus on her stomach!"

A bodyguard raised his fist.

Evelyn closed her eyes in despair.

The expected pain never came.

A dull thud sounded beside her.

She opened her eyes to see the bodyguard collapsed on the floor.

Alexander Kingsley descended like an avenging angel.

He pulled her into his arms in one swift motion.

"Looking to die?" His icy glare locked onto Madam Ashford.

The woman paled instantly.

Alexander's men subdued everyone within seconds.

"Dislocate her jaw." His voice was arctic.

A sickening crack followed.

Madam Ashford's agonized scream filled the air.

Alexander carried Evelyn away without another glance.

She shivered uncontrollably in his arms.

Three plane tickets slipped from her fingers.

Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

"Drive," he commanded. "To the registry office."

Evelyn struggled violently.

"Let me go!"

Alexander seized her wrist.

"Running away with Julian Ashford?" His voice was raw.

Evelyn turned her face away.

"Look at me!" He gripped her chin. "Are you carrying his child?"

His knuckles whitened from the force.

The car window reflected his bloodshot eyes.

"Sign." He slammed the marriage contract onto the table.

Evelyn shook her head.

Alexander smirked coldly. "Choose – marriage or abortion."

His blood dripped onto the document.

"Please..." Evelyn's voice shook. "Spare my baby..."

"Your baby?" Alexander's gaze darkened. "Julian's?"

He smashed his fist through the window.

The shattering glass made Evelyn flinch.

"Sign!" he roared.

Tears finally spilled down Evelyn's cheeks.

"I'll stay..." she sobbed. "Just... spare Sophie..."

Alexander's expression grew stormier.

He shoved a pen into her hand.

"You have no choice."
###Chapter 176: I Won't Touch You, But You Can Touch Me

Alexander Kingsley's hand suddenly gripped the back of Evelyn Sinclair's neck.

His knuckles turned white, dark emotions swirling in his eyes.

"Why always him?" His voice was hoarse. "First time, second time—always Julian Ashford?"

Evelyn's lashes trembled slightly.

She could feel the scorching heat of his palm, burning against her skin.

"I didn't—" she began to explain.

"Then why," Alexander cut her off, each word gritted between his teeth, "is it always his child?"

The air froze.

Evelyn looked up, meeting his bloodshot eyes.

They were filled with pain, fury, and... a jealousy that unsettled her.

Memories surfaced.

Of her hiding in the corners of Royal Gardens, watching Isabella Winslow cling to Alexander's arm, laughing brightly.

Back then, she hadn't even dared to admit her envy.

"This child is actually—" she blurted out.

"Enough!" Alexander abruptly released her. "I don't want to hear it."

He snatched the documents from the table and shoved them into her hands.

"Sign," he commanded. "Now."

Evelyn stared at the crumpled papers, then let out a soft laugh.

"Do you want to get rid of him?" she whispered. "Like you did with Isabella?"

Alexander's breath hitched.

"Sign it," he said, locking eyes with her, "and he'll be my child."

Tears splattered onto the paper, blurring the ink.

"The agreement this morning—" Her voice shook.

Alexander immediately slapped another document in front of her.

"Sign this," he said tightly. "I keep my word."

"Will you protect us?" She lifted her tear-streaked face. "Like you did today..."

She had to keep this child.

It was her only obsession.

The doctor's words from years ago still echoed in her ears when she woke up in that foreign hospital.

"You'll never be able to—"

In that moment, she had felt completely hollow.

"Be mine," Alexander said slowly, "and I'll keep you safe."

Evelyn wiped her tears away.

"I want a secret marriage," she stated calmly. "No physical contact for a year. Break the rule, and you let us go."

Nathan Carter inhaled sharply from the corner.

These terms were—

"Fine," Alexander's reply stunned him. "But you cut all ties with Julian Ashford."

Evelyn smiled bitterly.

There had never been anything between them.

"If I hold my end after a year," Alexander stepped closer, "we go public. You fulfill your duties as my wife."

"And," he added, "you move in with me tonight."

After a long silence, Evelyn finally nodded.

......

Outside the registry office, Alexander refused to let go of her hand.

"The contract never said no holding hands," he said shamelessly, pulling her into his embrace.

When his lips descended, she caught the faint scent of cedar.

From the car door to the elevator, then to the foyer of their new home—

His kisses grew deeper, his hands lingering at her waist.

"Stop..." She finally struggled free.

Alexander stilled, his thumb brushing her swollen lips.

"Come see your new home," he said, leading her forward.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the city lights of Kingsbury glittered like spilled stars.

But when she saw the single king-sized bed in the bedroom, her fingers trembled slightly.

In the darkness, his whisper grazed her ear:

"I won't touch you."

"But you can touch me."

His breath scorched her skin, turning the tips of her ears crimson.
###Chapter 177: The Unexpected Wedding Night

Alexander Kingsley never imagined his wedding night would unfold like this.

Evelyn Sinclair lay curled on the far side of the bed, her back turned to him. Moonlight seeped through the curtains, casting dappled shadows across her smooth skin.

He reached out, twirling a strand of her hair around his finger.

"Alexander..."

"Call me husband." His voice was low.

Evelyn sighed. "Sophie—"

"She's back at the hospital." Alexander cut her off. "And I arranged your marital leave."

She turned abruptly, alarm flashing in her eyes. "We agreed to keep this secret."

"People will only know you're married." His gaze darkened, knuckles whitening. "They don't need to know to whom."

Julian Ashford would find out.

That was enough.

After a pause, Evelyn gave a slight nod.

The submissive gesture made Alexander's throat tighten. He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "Or you could call me Alex... like before."

She closed her eyes, lashes trembling.

Exhaustion weighed on her.

Too exhausted to indulge his demands.

Alexander interlaced their fingers. "Evelyn, tonight is our wedding night."

She understood the unspoken message.

Once would never be enough.

Her escape from Kingsbury had failed. Now she needed his protection.

And the price was herself.

......

"Why aren't you happy?"

After the third time, Alexander finally noticed her detachment. Since their breakup, he hadn't seen a genuine smile from her.

Evelyn murmured two flat words. "My hand hurts."

He brought her fingers to his lips. "Let it rest tomorrow." His gaze trailed lower, implying alternatives.

She withdrew her hand. "Alexander, I need sleep. Even if I don't, the baby does."

The air froze.

Her cold dismissal was perfectly timed.

Yet the next day, Kingsley Group employees noticed something unusual.

For months, the company had been shrouded in tension.

Lord Alex had become a workaholic, dragging everyone into endless overtime. Worse was his volatile temper—one wrong move could spell disaster.

But today...

Alexander radiated energy.

The gloom between his brows had vanished, replaced by unmistakable triumph.

Even the office air felt lighter.

"Made up with Evelyn?" Mr. Kingsley stopped him after the meeting.

Alexander arched a brow. "That obvious?"

"Go look in a mirror." Mr. Kingsley smiled knowingly.

"And," he added as Alexander turned, "control your expressions. You smiled during the meeting and terrified the marketing director."

Alexander: "...I'll try."

Had he smiled?

"Coming home for dinner?" Mr. Kingsley asked.

"Why?"

The reminder restored Alexander's usual frostiness.

Mr. Kingsley blinked. "Shouldn't we celebrate your reconciliation?"

"Unnecessary." Alexander dismissed. "It's just a phase. Keep it quiet until the official announcement."

Mr. Kingsley admired his son's controlled demeanor.

"Good. You know what you're doing."

Seeing Alexander back to normal was a relief. This was the strategic mastermind he knew.

But that evening, when Mr. Kingsley sought his son for celebratory overtime...

Alexander left on time!

According to Nathan Carter, Lord Alex had walked out the moment the clock struck six.

Leaving mountains of unfinished work.

"His mind hasn't been on work for days," Nathan grumbled. "I thought today would change that..."

Mr. Kingsley patted his shoulder. "Cut him some slack. He just won his wife back."

Nathan suddenly produced a stack of files. "Oh, Mr. Kingsley, these require your personal attention—per Lord Alex's orders."

As Mr. Kingsley gaped, Nathan grinned. "No such thing as a free celebration."

Mr. Kingsley: ...

Was it too late to return this rebellious son?

......

Evelyn didn't expect Alexander home so early.

She'd spent her rare day off studying pregnancy guides and baby products.

Alexander placed a small pill bottle before her.

"Your vitamins."

The same ones from her old apartment.

Without flinching, Evelyn swallowed a pill.

"Not afraid I swapped them?" His eyes glinted dangerously. These were from Julian.

"No." She pointed out the window. "Lose the baby, and that's where I'll end up."

Her casual tone belied the knife-twist in every word.

Alexander's ardor dampened.

He sat, peeling a mangosteen. "Since we're free, where should we honeymoon?"

"Nowhere." She only wanted the safety of these walls.

"Think about it." He saw through her fear. "With me, you're always safe."

Madam Ashford's actions had traumatized her.

The realization pained him.

His plans against the Ashfords were temporarily shelved.

He offered her the peeled fruit.

Evelyn turned away. "Not hungry."

Alexander withdrew his hand—then suddenly pulled her into a kiss.

Sweet mangosteen flooded her mouth as he forced both the fruit and the kiss upon her.

......

After just three days of marital leave, Evelyn couldn't wait to return to Horizon Media.

The reason was simple.

Alexander was insatiable.

She was reaching her limit.
###Chapter 178: The Child Within

"What's so special about Horizon Media?"

Alexander Kingsley's voice turned icy, his wedding band glinting coldly under the light.

Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her collar with deliberate slowness. "It's my job." She paused. "At least there, I find my worth."

Horizon had witnessed her rebirth.

The day she fled Royal Gardens, she'd stood before the Horizon skyscraper, squinting against the sunlight reflected off its glass facade.

That was when she realized—only what she held in her hands would never betray her.

"Name any position at Kingsley Group." Alexander gripped her wrist. "Nathan's served me for ten years. It's time for a change."

A shadow flickered in his eyes.

If she wanted, he'd even partition half his CEO office for her.

"I'm not qualified." Evelyn pulled her hand free. "Your work pace requires even someone like Nathan to take regular IV drips."

And besides...

Her fingers instinctively brushed her abdomen.

Alexander's gaze darkened at the movement.

"The Ashfords..." His voice carried a dangerous edge.

"Isn't being Mrs. Kingsley enough?" Evelyn laughed lightly. "Surely Madam Ashford isn't foolish enough to offend both the Kingsleys and her own son."

Alexander suddenly seized her chin.

The heat of his fingertips made her lashes flutter.

"So certain," he murmured, thumb tracing her lips, "this child is Julian's?"

Her breath hitched.

Alexander pressed his thumb against her mouth. "Perhaps..." He leaned close, his whisper scalding her ear, "it's mine."

The words exploded like water hitting boiling oil.

Evelyn shoved him away, only to be pinned into the sofa.

"You—" Her protest dissolved into a searing kiss.

Alexander's palm settled over her abdomen, the heat seeping through fabric to brand her skin.

Lately, he always did this.

No matter how fierce their passion, he'd always end with this gentle touch.

As if confirming something.

Or... anticipating.

"Next year," his lips brushed her earlobe, "give me one."

Evelyn's traitorous tongue replied: "Maybe this one is..."

Instantly, she regretted it.

Alexander chuckled darkly, his canine scraping her sensitive ear.

"If you're lying..." He sucked the lobe between his teeth. "I'll choose to believe it."

That night, Alexander was relentless.

He chanted her name like making up for lost time.

Drowning in pleasure, Evelyn's thoughts drifted—

What if...

What if this child truly was his...

Her phone vibrated on the nightstand.

Seven days of unread messages flooded in.

The latest was from Julian Ashford:

[Evelyn, we need to talk. It's urgent.]
###Chapter 179: The Engagement Trap

The phone rang three times before Evelyn Sinclair finally answered.

"Julian..."

"Evelyn!" Julian Ashford's voice carried urgency. "Where are you? I'll come get you right now."

Her grip tightened around the phone.

"Last time was my fault for not planning properly," he rushed on. "I've arranged everything this time. My mother won't interfere again. I promise—"

"Julian." She cut him off. "I'm married."

Dead silence filled the line.

The call disconnected abruptly seconds later.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. This was better—a clean break rather than lingering attachments.

Her phone vibrated again.

The caller ID gave her pause—Madeline Kingsley.

"Evelyn dear, are you free for afternoon tea tomorrow?" The elderly woman's voice remained warm as ever.

Evelyn's eyes flickered. The memory of Madeline's hesitant expression last time surfaced.

That secret only Alexander Kingsley and his grandmother knew...

At noon the next day, Evelyn pushed open the private dining room door to find Madeline already waiting.

"Try this butter crab." Madeline eagerly placed a golden piece on Evelyn's plate. "It's quite rare."

Evelyn stared at the rich crab roe, fingertips turning cold.

"I...should have some carbs first."

A server presented a glistening fried rice topped generously with crab meat and roe.

"Grandmother, my doctor recently..." She forced the words out. "Advised against cold-natured foods."

Madeline's smile faltered momentarily.

During tea time, a plate of longan fruits appeared before Evelyn.

"Good for blood circulation. Eat more." Madeline peeled one herself.

Evelyn pretended to chew before discreetly spitting it out.

"Now try this saffron tea." Madeline pushed forward a cup of crimson liquid. "Excellent for regulating the body."

Evelyn's fingers trembled. Every offering today contained ingredients forbidden during pregnancy.

"Water is fine." She finally spoke plainly.

Madeline's expression darkened. "You refuse everything. How will you care for your in-laws?"

The unspoken words hung heavy—no wonder she'd ruined her fertility.

Tension thickened the air.

"There's a banquet the day after tomorrow." Madeline abruptly changed topics. "Accompany me."

After a pause, Evelyn nodded.

Later, Madeline went straight to Kingsley Group headquarters.

"Alexander, I've reconsidered." She beamed while entering his office. "I've arranged your engagement party for the day after tomorrow."
###Chapter 180: Her "Difficult" Behavior Was Due to Pregnancy

"Your doing?" Alexander Kingsley's brow furrowed slightly, surprise flashing in his eyes. "Just you alone?"

"Of course not," Madeline Kingsley smiled warmly. "Your grandfather was involved too. Your mother knows as well. Now we're just waiting for your approval."

Alexander had no reason to refuse.

His secret marriage to Evelyn Sinclair had been kept from the family—not just at her request, but also due to his grandmother's opposition.

Even if he didn't care, Evelyn would inevitably be affected.

He didn't want to embarrass her...

"Does Evelyn know?" he pressed.

"A little," the old woman winked mysteriously. "I invited her for tea today and only mentioned a banquet I'd like her to accompany me to the day after tomorrow. It's a surprise. Don't spoil it."

Madeline spoke earnestly.

Alexander called his mother to confirm. Eleanor Kingsley couldn't hide her excitement. "Yes, they planned it without telling us. The invitations are already sent. Make sure you put that ring on Evelyn's finger when the time comes."

Alexander swallowed his words.

Fine.

They wanted to surprise Evelyn.

And he... wanted to surprise them too.

Dinner was served at the penthouse.

The newly hired chef specialized in prenatal and postnatal meals.

Alexander had never been picky about food, but he noticed Evelyn's tastes seemed to have changed.

He quietly had the chef prepare dishes she used to dislike.

Yet Evelyn ate everything without complaint.

"I thought you didn't like this type of fish," Alexander remarked casually.

Evelyn paused her chopsticks.

Did she?

"Pregnancy changes tastes," she replied softly.

In truth, she'd never had any real preferences before—only pretended to share Alexander's tastes.

How ridiculous that seemed now.

In the end, who had ever cared about her feelings?

"About the day after tomorrow..." Alexander changed the subject.

"Your grandmother's invitation?" Evelyn caught on quickly. "Is there a problem?"

"Nothing," he lowered his head to sip soup, avoiding her gaze. "I heard you had tea today. How did it go?"

"Your grandmother was very kind to me."

Evelyn didn't want to speak ill of the old woman.

She could sense Madeline's dissatisfaction, but those were unintentional slights.

She understood.

They wouldn't be living together anyway—just occasional visits during holidays.

The next afternoon.

Evelyn arrived at the hotel as promised.

"Evelyn, dear!" Madeline greeted her warmly, taking her hand. "Come see the gown and jewelry I prepared for you."

She presented a velvet jewelry box.

Evelyn recognized it instantly—Madeline's most treasured collection.

"Grandmother, this is too precious. I couldn't—"

"Nonsense," Madeline interrupted. "I've wanted to give these to you for ages. You'll break my heart if you refuse."

She insisted Evelyn accept, then urged her to try on the prepared dress.

Evelyn's baby bump wasn't noticeable yet, but she'd already switched to loose clothing. The gown Madeline chose, however, had a fitted waist.

Paired with stiletto heels.

"Grandmother..." Evelyn neatly folded the dress and shoes. "What I'm wearing now is perfectly suitable..."

She glanced at the stylist waiting behind them with multiple bags.

Clearly, Madeline intended a full makeover.

Evelyn had even switched to pregnancy-safe skincare—let alone makeup.

She could only decline the well-meant gesture.

Madeline's expression darkened instantly.

"Evelyn," her tone turned reproachful. "Why must you be so difficult..."

"Grandmother..." Evelyn knew she seemed unreasonable, hesitating whether to reveal her pregnancy...

The secret marriage couldn't hide a growing belly forever.

Better to explain now before misunderstandings deepened.

"Grandmother, I'm not being ungrateful. The truth is I..."
###Chapter 181: The Shocking Twist at the Engagement Banquet

"Enough!" Madeline Kingsley raised her hand abruptly, the ruby on her fingernail flashing sharply under the lights.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips parted slightly before closing again.

"Nothing satisfies you," the elder Kingsley sneered. "One might think you're carrying the Kingsley heir."

Evelyn's fingers tightened on her skirt.

"When I was pregnant with Alexander's father, I vomited bile daily," Madeline continued. "Eleanor couldn't even keep water down while carrying Alexander. She endured it."

The room echoed with the matriarch's cutting voice.

Evelyn lifted her gaze slowly. "Grandmother, I won't attend tonight's banquet."

Her tone was eerily calm.

Madeline suddenly faltered. "Evelyn, this old woman misspoke..." She grasped Evelyn's hand urgently. "I've prepared a surprise for you. Humor an old woman?"

"What surprise?" Evelyn met the elder's evasive eyes.

"A brilliant young man." Madeline forced a smile. "Far superior to Alexander..."

Evelyn withdrew her hand gently. "We're already married."

Madeline's face drained of color.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" She shot to her feet. "After all the Kingsleys have done for you, you'd ruin Alexander like this?"

"Ruin him?" A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn.

How ironic fate could be.

Once, the entire Kingsley household adored her—except Alexander. Now that he'd changed, his grandmother became the obstacle.

"Alexander refuses to let go." Evelyn stood. "Ask him why."

She turned to leave but found her path blocked by security.

"Miss Sinclair." A black-suited guard barred the exit.

Madeline regained composure. "You'll stay until the banquet concludes."

Confined to the suite, Evelyn texted Alexander: [Your grandmother locked me in the hotel.]

His reply came instantly: [Location.]

She sent the room number.

If he insisted on this marriage, let him handle the fallout.

But after that message, silence.

Three hours later, the door opened abruptly. "You may leave, Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn frowned.

The hallway stood empty—no sign of Alexander.

Passing the banquet hall, the emcee's booming voice carried: "Now presenting the bride-to-be!"

Evelyn froze.

Through the open doors, she saw Alexander in black formalwear on the dais.

A veiled woman in white approached him.

Even obscured, Evelyn recognized Isabella Winslow.

Alexander extended his hand.

A needle of pain pierced Evelyn's heart.

So this was Madeline's "surprise."

The Kingsleys filled the seats—Patriarch Kingsley, Madeline, Eleanor...

The family she'd lived with for over a decade now witnessed another woman's triumph.

Evelyn turned away.

The moment her back disappeared, Alexander suddenly looked toward the entrance.

"Mr. Kingsley?" The emcee prompted softly.

All eyes followed his gaze.

Alexander turned back to the veiled woman and demanded sharply, "Who are you?"

The hall fell silent.

The woman in white stepped back nervously.

Alexander yanked off her veil—

Revealing a stranger.
###Chapter 182: One More Punch and I'll Jump

Alexander Kingsley tore off the bridal veil.

The entire venue fell silent.

Isabella Winslow's meticulously made-up face was exposed under the spotlight.

His pupils constricted violently as he whipped his head toward the Kingsley family seats.

Madeline Kingsley's expression flickered with unease.

"Brilliant," Alexander sneered, dragging Isabella off the stage.

"Alexander!" Madeline slammed her palm on the table. "Isabella is carrying your child!"

Gasps erupted through the crowd.

Alexander froze mid-step, his eyes glinting with icy fury. "Grandmother, must you go this far?"

"You left me no choice!" Madeline's voice trembled.

Isabella stumbled as he yanked her along, losing a high heel in the process.

The Winslow family tried to intervene but found themselves surrounded by Kingsley security.

"Do you know where Evelyn is?" Madeline suddenly asked.

Alexander went rigid.

The text message flashed through his mind.

He shoved Isabella aside and sprinted toward the elevators.

......

The taxi stopped outside a dilapidated apartment complex.

Evelyn Sinclair pushed open her front door to the overwhelming stench of alcohol.

Julian Ashford lay curled on the couch, lifting his head with difficulty at the sound.

"Julian?" She rushed forward.

Her fingertips brushed his scorching forehead. She inhaled sharply.

Julian suddenly seized her wrist.

"I've got nowhere else to go..." His voice was ragged. "My mother, she..."

Evelyn tried to pull away to grab her phone, but he yanked her into his arms.

"Does your offer still stand?" His feverish breath scorched her ear.

"Let's get you to a hospital first." She struggled to free herself.

Julian tightened his grip. "When I recover... you'll take me away?"

The front door exploded inward before he could finish.

Alexander stormed in like an enraged lion, wrenching Evelyn behind him.

The sickening crunch of his fist connecting with Julian's face made Evelyn wince.

"Alexander!" She lunged to stop him, only to be thrown onto the couch.

Blood trickled from Julian's split lip as he weakly shook his head at her.

"I'm calling the police!" She grabbed her phone.

Alexander ignored her, slamming Julian's head against the floor.

Evelyn bolted to the window and flung it open.

Icy wind howled through as she climbed onto the ledge.

"Hit him one more time," she whispered, the calm terrifying. "And I'll jump."

Alexander's fist hovered mid-air.

He turned to see Evelyn leaning precariously over the twenty-third-story drop.

The winter gale whipped her hair into a dark frenzy.
###Chapter 183: The Baby in Your Belly is Also Mine

"Alexander Kingsley, stop." Evelyn Sinclair's voice was icy.

Alexander's hand froze mid-air, his face turning deathly pale.

He abruptly released Julian Ashford, staggering back two steps. "Evelyn..."

"Don't move!" Evelyn snapped.

Alexander immediately rooted to the spot, his voice trembling. "Alright, I won't come closer... Just stay where you are, don't move..."

Julian slowly picked himself up from the floor.

"Evelyn, this isn't funny," he said, panic lacing his words. "Get down from there."

"Leave," Evelyn didn't even glance at him. "I need to speak with Alexander alone."

Julian hesitated only a second before turning to exit the room.

But he didn't go far—just outside the door.

"I want a divorce." Those were the first words he heard.

"Never!" Alexander took an aggressive step forward, pointing at the windowsill. "If you jump, I'll jump right after you."

Evelyn knew him too well.

This wasn't a threat—it was a promise.

She bit her lower lip. "What's going on between you and Isabella Winslow?"

Alexander's heart twisted as if stabbed.

He knew Evelyn's nature—she tolerated no betrayal.

Even if he was innocent, there was no way to prove it now.

All of Kingsbury knew Isabella was carrying his child.

"It was Grandmother's scheme," he forced out the explanation. "I had no idea—"

"Grandmother?" Evelyn laughed coldly. "Alexander, that's the lamest excuse."

"I swear!" Never had he imagined he'd resort to desperate oaths. "If I'm lying, may lightning strike me dead!"

Evelyn turned to look out the window.

Alexander tensed, ready to lunge forward at any second.

"You stood by and did nothing when it involved our engagement," she said, turning back. "Is this how you run Kingsley Group too?"

Alexander had no retort.

He had deliberately remained passive.

Their marriage contract stipulated secrecy.

But if Madeline Kingsley forced an "engagement," the agreement would automatically void.

He never expected his grandmother to go this far.

"Evelyn, we're already married," he softened his tone. "I'll issue a statement to clarify everything."

"How?" Evelyn's smile was mocking. "By announcing we're married? Exposing my identity? Alexander, don't play your games with our marriage."

Alexander fell silent.

So she knew everything.

She'd always seen through him.

"The divorce can wait," Evelyn said. "But I'm moving back in and returning to work. I won't be your caged bird!"

"You don't get to explain. You always decide everything unilaterally. Now that Grandmother set you up, you're the victim? What about all the times I suffered before she interfered?"

"We've been married less than a month, and you're already breaking our secrecy agreement. What next? Tearing up all our contracts? Will I even be allowed to leave after a year? You promised to treat my child well—can you?"

"Of course!" Alexander finally found his voice. "I keep my word."

"But I don't trust you." Evelyn laughed, sunlight dancing in her hair. "What now?"

She'd stopped trusting him long ago.

Alexander thought marriage was a fresh start.

Only now did he realize old wounds never healed.

After an endless silence, he spoke: "You can return to Horizon Media and live here, but I'm assigning security."

"Now, will you come down?" He extended his hand.

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before slowly reaching out.

Alexander surged forward, sweeping her off the windowsill into his arms.

He held her tightly, his legs so weak he could barely stand.

"Let me hold you..." His voice shook.

Evelyn didn't push him away.

Because she realized—Alexander was trembling.

Suddenly he released her, cupping her face and kissing her fiercely.

Evelyn gasped for breath as the kiss deepened.

Alexander's grip grew increasingly desperate until she nearly melted against him.

"Remember," he growled against her ear, "you're my wife. The baby in your belly..."

He gritted his teeth. "Is also mine!"

Julian wouldn't get near her ever again.

......

That same day, Alexander ordered Ethan Miller to purchase the property next to Evelyn's.

He summoned Nathan Carter to launch an investigation.

Ethan soon reported: "Lord Alex, the property... can't be bought."

Alexander's face darkened. "Offer ten times the price."

"Not even a hundred times would work," Ethan said helplessly. "Because..."
###Chapter 184: Can't Sleep Without My Wife

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn Sinclair rubbed her eyes and stretched. She hadn't slept well last night—something felt missing.

After freshening up, she grabbed her bag to leave for work.

The moment her door unlocked, the opposite apartment opened simultaneously.

"Morning, Evelyn." Julian Ashford stood there in a crisp suit, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Freshly brewed. Want some?"

She blinked. "Julian, you're..."

"I moved in." He handed her the coffee. "Someone should look after you since you live alone."

The elevator doors slid shut.

Evelyn took small sips as the rich aroma filled her senses. Before she could speak, the elevator stopped at the next floor.

The doors opened to reveal Alexander Kingsley's handsome face.

"Wife!" He dashed in and pulled her into an embrace, burying his face in her hair. "I missed you so much."

Coffee nearly spilled from her cup.

"What—why are you here?" She struggled, but he tightened his grip.

Alexander nuzzled her hair pitifully. "I couldn't sleep without holding you all night."

The elevator air turned icy.

Julian's fingers whitened around his coffee cup.

Outside the building, two identical Bentleys sat parked side by side. Evelyn's lips twitched—what fresh hell was this?

"Get in." Alexander bundled her into the passenger seat before flashing Julian a triumphant smirk.

As the car started, Evelyn couldn't resist asking, "Did you buy the entire building?"

Alexander kept his eyes on the road, but his lips curved slightly.

He didn't mention that he'd also replaced the property management with Kingsley Group staff. Now even a fly entering Evelyn's neighborhood needed prior approval.

Horizon Media lobby.

Evelyn barely stepped inside when Julian rose from a sofa.

"That fast?" Her eyes widened.

Julian smiled wordlessly and took her bag. "Let me walk you up."

At the Financial Department entrance, several colleagues witnessed the scene.

"Get some rest." He gently adjusted her collar. "You're not alone anymore."

That sentence detonated like a bomb across Horizon Media.

[Breaking News! Crown Prince and Evelyn are expecting!]

[No wonder they took sudden marriage leave!]

[They arrived together today in matching Bentleys!]

[Rumor says the Ashfords objected but the deed was done!]

Melissa Lee trembled as she read the flooding messages, nails digging into her palms.

With shaking hands, she dialed a long-unused number.

"Isabella Winslow, let's work together."

Meanwhile, Alexander had just returned to Kingsley Group headquarters when he found the entire Kingsley family waiting outside his office.

Madeline Kingsley stood with red-rimmed eyes. "Alexander, your grandmother needs to speak—"

"Unnecessary." He strode past and pushed open his office door. "Some things don't require explanation."

"You!" Madeline stamped her foot. "How dare you disrespect our ancestors like this!"

The door slammed shut, cutting off all arguments.
###Chapter 185: Will You Support Me, Darling?

Madam Kingsley glanced around, noticing all the assistants in the office area had pricked up their ears.

"Let's talk inside." She quickly pushed open Alexander Kingsley's office door.

"What nonsense are you pulling, old woman?" Patriarch Kingsley demanded the moment he entered. "What could Evelyn possibly have done that's unforgivable?"

Ever since discovering the engagement ceremony was the Dowager's elaborate scheme, the entire family had grown resentful toward her.

Madeline Kingsley's eyes were red and swollen as she insisted she had valid reasons.

The family had stormed into Kingsley Group first thing that morning to confront her.

If not for Alexander's work ethic, they might not have found him at all.

"Alex, is it true about Isabella's pregnancy?" Eleanor Kingsley cut straight to the point.

Rumors swirled everywhere, all pointing to one fact—Isabella Winslow was carrying Alexander's child.

"Unconfirmed." Alexander's expression remained impassive. "I wanted a paternity test. Grandmother stopped me."

Eleanor gasped.

This was an indirect admission that he'd indeed been involved with Isabella.

"How could you—"

"You disgrace!" The Patriarch roared before turning his glare on the Dowager. "Even so, rushing to marry that Winslow girl is absurd. Anyone can see she's trouble."

"Mother, you should've at least discussed something this important with us," Eleanor couldn't help chiding.

Marrying Isabella in such haste would make the Kingsleys appear desperate for heirs.

When had the Dowager ever endured such humiliation?

Even her dutiful son was looking at her with reproach.

"I had to cut off his escape routes!" The Dowager pointed at Alexander hysterically. "Why don't you ask what this unfilial wretch has done?"

Without waiting for responses, she shrieked, "When he heard Evelyn was infertile and feared we'd force a marriage, he went and got a vasectomy!"

"Now that Isabella's finally pregnant with his child, he tried to take her for an abortion! He wants to end the Kingsley bloodline!"

......

Dead silence filled the office.

Everyone was too stunned to speak.

After a long pause, Eleanor finally managed, "Medical science can reverse that procedure..."

"Then make him undo it!" The Dowager snapped. "If doctors confirm he's functional, I'll stop pressuring him to marry Isabella. Otherwise, even if you disown her, I'll accept her as my granddaughter-in-law!"

"Suit yourself." Alexander's voice was icy. "But I'll publicly declare no relation to her. Also, Evelyn and I have reconciled."

"Re...reconciled?" Eleanor didn't know whether to be relieved or worried.

The information overload was short-circuiting her brain.

The Dowager laughed bitterly. "Reconciled? How low are her standards, forgiving you after witnessing your engagement? If she's so understanding, Isabella can be the primary wife while she plays second fiddle!"

"Mother!"
"Outrageous!"

Eleanor and the Patriarch shouted simultaneously.

"I'm outrageous?" The Dowager completely lost control. "What about the obscenities he's committed?"

She whirled on Alexander. "Why glare at me? Planning to strike your elder? For that woman, you'd abandon your family? Have the guts to renounce the Kingsley name then! Surrender everything you possess!"

"Mother, please..." Eleanor begged.

"Silence!" The Dowager shoved her away. "This is your fault! Brainwashing him about only marrying Evelyn, and now he's sterilized himself—are you satisfied? Did you put him up to this?"

"Mother, Eleanor would never—" The usually quiet Mr. Kingsley finally spoke up.

"Shut up!" The Dowager spiraled into madness. "You're all traitors to the Kingsley legacy!"

Alexander walked to his desk.

"Where are you going? You can't hide forever! Isabella will become my granddaughter-in-law whether you like it or not!"

Alexander ignored her.

He retrieved an envelope from the drawer and placed it on the coffee table before the Dowager.

"What's this?" She blinked.

"Everything returnable to the Kingsleys is here." Alexander's tone was calm. "Except my life, I relinquish all inheritance rights, shares, and family assets."

"As for my current lifestyle, most was earned through my own efforts. If Kingsley Group wishes to retain me, follow standard procedures. If not, I'll resign immediately."

The Dowager nearly fainted from rage.

"Preposterous!" The Patriarch snatched up the envelope and threw it back. "You'd sever ties over your grandmother's scolding?"

Mr. Kingsley also exploded. "Who cares about shares or assets? You're what matters! Just endure her lecturing—must you take it literally?"

Eleanor kept her head down silently.

Secretly, she was delighted.

Keep berating him—let's see what happens when you drive him away completely.

She knew her son too well. That envelope was clearly prepared long ago. He meant every word.

"This isn't impulsive." Alexander said coolly. "Grandmother schemed against Evelyn and me for Isabella's unborn child. In that case, bypass me and give everything directly to them. Since I can't continue the bloodline, this worthless heir may as well disappear."

"Don't...don't push me!" The Dowager screamed.

Alexander bowed deeply. "I believe you're capable of it."

With that, he turned to leave.

"Stop! You ungrateful wretch!" The Dowager howled hysterically.

Mr. Kingsley panicked. "Alex, come back! Don't expect me to keep covering your workload..."

Just when he'd hoped his son's reconciliation with Evelyn would bring him back to handle business, this happened.

"I'll hire a new CEO immediately! Don't regret this!" He threatened.

"Let him go!" The Dowager yanked her son's sleeve. "If he wants that woman so badly, let him surrender everything..."

......

At day's end, Evelyn deliberately left work with Martha Nash.

She wanted to avoid walking with Julian Ashford and fueling more gossip.

"I truly didn't marry Julian," she explained. Workplace rumors had spiraled into absurdity.

"Then who's your husband? Is the pregnancy real?" Martha's reporter instincts kicked in.

Evelyn hesitated. "Well..."

"Is it the Crown Prince's baby?"

"No." This answer came firmly.

"What?" Martha gaped. "Then you and the Crown Prince..."

"We're really not like that." Evelyn smiled wryly. "Others can speculate, but you're my friend. I don't want misunderstandings between us."

"Alright, I believe you." Martha nodded. "So who's the father?"

Evelyn: "......"

Martha raised an eyebrow. "Aren't we friends? No lies or omissions, right?"

"Well...no lies, but privacy..." Evelyn forced a laugh. "Oh look, my stop! Thanks Martha—"

"Darling wife, done with work?" Alexander's voice suddenly cut in.

Evelyn froze.

Speak of the devil!

Alexander straightened from leaning against the wall, pulling her into an embrace. Before Martha's astonished eyes, he kissed Evelyn's forehead.

"Was work exhausting, love? Has our little one been bothering you?"

He sighed dramatically. "Dearest wife, I've resigned from Kingsley Group. Now I'm unemployed—you'll support me, won't you? My darling, promise you'll take care of me?"

Evelyn: ...Get lost!
###Chapter 186: Only the Sugar We Witness is Real

Martha Nash stumbled out of the elevator.

Ding—

The doors slid open on the ground floor.

She wandered out in a daze, nearly colliding with a tall figure.

The man steadied her swaying shoulders with quick reflexes.

"Watch your step, Martha."

She nodded mechanically. "Yes, Crown Prince."

Wait—

Crown Prince?

By the time she snapped back to reality, the elevator doors had already closed.

Martha froze, watching the floor numbers climb until they stopped at Evelyn Sinclair's level.

She covered her mouth, eyes reddening.

Would knowing too many secrets get her silenced...?

Evelyn blocked the doorway, facing off against Alexander Kingsley.

"Move. You're not coming in."

Alexander stood firm.

"Evelyn, I've returned everything to the Kingsleys. If you turn me away, I'll have nowhere to go."

She scoffed. "Who are you trying to fool?"

"Where's your mansion?"

"Sold."

"Royal Gardens?"

"Always belonged to the Kingsleys. Deed's returned."

"The floor below—"

"On the market. The agent showed it today."

"So you're just a nouveau riche now? Step aside, Property Tycoon. I can't possibly reach your level."

"Every penny goes back to the Kingsleys! Severing ties means settling every cent they ever spent on me."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Not my problem. Move—"

Alexander remained immovable. "If you don't let me in, I'll sleep right here tonight. Evelyn, we're still married. You wouldn't abandon me like this."

She'd never seen Alexander so shameless.

Crossing her arms, she said, "Ever heard 'when poverty comes in the door, love flies out the window'? I do pity you... so let's divorce."

Alexander: "?"

Evelyn: "You're penniless now. Sold your homes, still maintaining luxury cars. I can barely afford Sophie's medical bills—certainly not a grown man who won't pull his weight. We're better off apart."

Alexander: "?!"

As he opened his mouth to retort, a soft chuckle came from the elevator lobby.

Under Alexander's darkening glare, Julian Ashford stepped out calmly.

He nodded at Evelyn before swiping into his own apartment.

His parting words—"Pathetic clinginess"—drifted clearly to their ears.

Alexander's temper ignited.

Him? Clingy?

He was Evelyn's lawful husband!

What was Julian?

Not even qualified to be the other man!

Evelyn seized the chance to slip inside.

Alexander could've stopped her.

But fearing she might fall, he hesitated for one fatal second.

The door slammed shut.

Storm clouds gathered over his face as he descended.

Nathan Carter and Ethan Miller shuddered in unison at his expression.

"Lord Alex—"

Alexander bit out, "What worthless guides did you find?"

Those so-called dating manuals were utterly useless!

Nathan tremblingly produced another book. "Maybe... try this one?"

Alexander: "And if it fails?"

Nathan looked ready to cry. "Then Ethan and I stay single forever?"

Ethan blinked. Why was he dragged into this?

Late at night, Evelyn peeked through the peephole.

The hallway stood empty.

She exhaled in relief—only to worry about avoiding Julian tomorrow.

Yet when she opened her door next morning, she nearly tripped over the man sprawled across her threshold.

"Sleep well, Evelyn?" Alexander sat up from his makeshift bed.

Evelyn gaped. "Have you lost your mind?!"

He'd actually slept outside her door all night?

"Naturally." Alexander stood, wheeling his suitcase inside with brazen confidence.

Evelyn bristled. "What are you doing?"

"Moving in with my wife." He pulled out toiletries and headed straight for the bathroom.

"Get out!" she snapped.

After rinsing, Alexander planted a kiss on her cheek. "What was that?"

Evelyn trembled with rage.

Alexander would always be her nightmare!

Worse, before she could react, he'd already dragged his bedding inside, arranging it on the sofa.

"Your hallway's too hard. Much comfier here." He stretched out contentedly.

Evelyn eyed his legs dangling off the couch. "How can you sleep like that?"

"True." Alexander suddenly rose, gathering his blankets. He stole another kiss. "My wife cares after all. I'll take the bedroom then."

Evelyn: "?"

She stood stunned.

What had gotten into Alexander?

Since when did he have this level of audacity?

"Not going to work?" Seeing her frozen by the door, Alexander propped himself up. "Can't bear to leave me alone? Worried I'll spiral unemployed?"

Evelyn: "In your dreams!"

She stormed out.

Fine. She'd sleep on the sofa from now on!

Horizon Media's entertainment department buzzed unusually today.

Rumors spread like wildfire—Isabella Winslow was pregnant before marriage.

Accompanying them were leaked photos from her supposed engagement to Alexander.

"God! No wonder Evelyn won the lawsuit! Alexander and Isabella were really involved—they even have a child!"

"Is Isabella marrying into the Kingsley family?"

"Nothing's certain without a marriage certificate."

"Would the Winslows allow their daughter to have a child out of wedlock?"

Ordinary families might, but the Winslows were old money!

Editors flocked to Martha.

"Martha, are we covering this?"

"Orange Media's already moving..."

"They leaked this. If we don't act—"

Martha slammed her desk. "Since when does Horizon follow Orange's lead?"

"But—"

"No buts! Isabella's tight with Orange. This could be fake news. Do we want another cease-and-desist from Alexander's lawyers? Horizon doesn't have another Evelyn!"

Her tone brooked no argument. "Back to work! Whether Isabella's carrying a puppy or a kitten, we're staying out of Kingsley drama!"

Once alone, Martha clutched her head.

Knowing earth-shattering secrets but being unable to share was torture!

Isabella's pregnancy? Engagement? All lies!

Only their ship was real!

Alexander himself admitted Evelyn carried his child!

Alexander and the Crown Prince fighting over Evelyn's doorstep!

And she had to keep it all bottled up!

This bittersweet agony—who could understand?
###Chapter 187: The Ambush

The Financial and Entertainment departments had been buzzing with activity lately.

After Melissa Lee and Martha Nash's open feud, junior editors from both departments secretly formed a group chat.

The moment Evelyn Sinclair joined the "Finance & Entertainment United" chat, messages exploded.

Finance Team's Will Young: [Heard Isabella Winslow is pregnant?]

Entertainment Team's Lily Davis: [Martha banned us from covering this story! So frustrating!]

Finance Team's Zack Zhang: [Our scoop's hotter—Alexander Kingsley resigned!]

Evelyn watched the flood of messages and quietly typed ellipses.

[Evelyn must know the inside story!] someone teased.

[Did Alexander really quit?] another pressed.

Her fingers hesitated over the screen. [I don't know either.]

She'd been avoiding Alexander like the plague.

Ever since his personality shift, every encounter left her flustered.

[Go ask him!] The group clamored. [You've known him forever!]

Evelyn sighed. [I'd like to live a few more years.]

Martha lurked in the chat, rolling her eyes.

These clueless kids—the man resigned for Evelyn!

She'd sacrificed a headline to protect their relationship.

Evelyn had just exited the chat when Melissa summoned her.

"Must be hard assigning you work these days." Melissa's tone dripped sarcasm. "This interview should suit you."

She handed over a file. "Old Mr. Eaton's temperamental, but you handled Alexander. This should be easy."

Arriving at the Eaton estate, Evelyn spotted a familiar car in the garage.

"This way, Miss Sinclair." A maid interrupted her thoughts.

To her surprise, the elderly gentleman spoke enthusiastically for two hours.

Only when the housekeeper came with his medication did Evelyn escape.

Footsteps echoed sharply in the empty hallway.

She froze at the figure waiting around the corner.

"Miss Winslow?"

Isabella toyed with her diamond ring, smiling sweetly. "What a coincidence, Evelyn."

"Excuse me." Evelyn moved to step past her.

Isabella blocked the way. "Heard about Alex and me?"

"Not interested." Evelyn shook off her grip.

Isabella suddenly seized her arm. "How about an exclusive?"

Their struggle brought them to the staircase landing.

"Let go!" Evelyn wrenched free.

A cold glint flashed in Isabella's eyes as she shoved Evelyn's back.

"Aaaah—!"

A bloodcurdling scream and the sound of tumbling bodies filled the mansion.

"What happened?" Madeline Kingsley rushed to the scene and gasped at the sight below the stairs.
###Chapter 188: The Young Madam Was Hospitalized

The Kingsley mansion's staircase gleamed coldly under the lights.

Smoke-gray marble reflected Isabella Winslow's distorted silhouette as she lay crumpled at the landing like a broken-winged butterfly. A crimson stain spread beneath her, soaking the pale fabric of her dress.

"Isabella!" Madeline Kingsley stumbled forward, her skeletal fingers trembling against the young woman's bloodless face. "Call an ambulance! Now!"

Isabella weakly lifted a hand, pointing up the staircase. "Grandmother... It was Evelyn... She pushed me..."

At the top of the stairs, Evelyn Sinclair gripped the banister until her knuckles whitened. Her initial shock hardened into icy composure as she watched the chaos below.

Madeline charged up the steps, her palm raised to strike.

Evelyn didn't flinch. Her unblinking gaze held a silent ultimatum—this slap would sever their last remaining ties.

The air froze.

Madeline's hand hovered midair, trembling slightly.

"Aaaah—" Isabella's bloodcurdling scream shattered the stalemate. "My stomach... It hurts..."

The older woman whirled back toward her fallen granddaughter, abandoning Evelyn without a second glance.

Chaos engulfed the mansion. The family physician administered painkillers before staff loaded Isabella onto a gurney. Only when the commotion faded did Evelyn unclench her grip from the railing. Her palms were slick with sweat, her abdomen throbbing with dull pain.

She'd sensed the trap the moment she entered. Refused every offered drink and snack. When Isabella appeared, every nerve had gone on high alert.

The actress had lunged first. Evelyn had caught her wrist instinctively. During the tumble, Evelyn grabbed the banister while Isabella rolled down the steps.

"Miss Sinclair." The butler materialized behind her. "The police are here. You'll need to answer some questions."

Evelyn steadied her breathing. "On what grounds?"

"Assaulting the Kingsley heiress seems sufficient." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Pray the judge shows mercy. Prison might be your safest option after crossing this family."

"Indeed, the truth must come out." Evelyn rose gracefully. "Isabella attempted murder. I acted in self-defense. The security footage will confirm it."

The butler's smirk deepened. "Oh, the cameras captured everything. But you shoved a woman carrying the Kingsley heir."

Evelyn remained silent. As officers led her away, she turned back. "Your secret dealings with old Mr. Eaton won't stay hidden forever."

The butler's face drained of color.

Alexander Kingsley slept deeply in Evelyn's bed.

The disciplined billionaire never indulged in daytime naps. Even during their relationship, he'd maintained rigid self-control. But the lingering scent on the pillows had disarmed him completely.

The phone's shrill ring shattered the peace.

"Lord Alex, Young Madam Isabella fell down the stairs at the Eaton residence..." The voice oozed false concern. "She's en route to Provincial Hospital. The perpetrator—"

"Which ward?" Alexander vaulted upright.

"Emergency—"

He crushed the phone mid-sentence. The elevator took too long—he took the stairs three at a time. Motion-activated lights flickered to life, illuminating his thunderous expression.
###Chapter 189 That child wasn't even his
Alexander Kingsley floored the accelerator, the engine roaring as he sped toward Provincial Hospital.

His phone screen flickered between light and dark. Evelyn Sinclair's number kept ringing with no answer. After the final busy signal, it shut off completely.

His knuckles turned white from gripping the steering wheel.

That child wasn't even his.

Yet hearing she'd fallen down the stairs felt like an invisible hand crushing his heart.

He convinced himself with a flimsy excuse—Evelyn had a delicate constitution. This pregnancy was rare for her. Losing it would devastate her.

The hospital lobby lights stabbed his eyes.

"Any pregnant women brought in after falling down stairs?" He slammed his palm on the maternity ward's front desk.

"Alexander?"

Madam Winslow's shocked voice came from behind.

Alexander turned to face the flustered expressions of the Winslow couple. Madam Winslow studied his frantic demeanor, her gaze calculating.

Madeline Kingsley hurried down the corridor. "Alexander! Isabella's in critical condition, you need to—"

"Perfect." Alexander's lips curled into a cold smile.

He'd been itching for a chance to verify the paternity of Isabella's baby.

"What do you mean?" Madeline's voice rose sharply. "Did you put Evelyn up to pushing her?"

Alexander's pupils constricted.

"She can't bear children, so she wants to rob the Kingsleys of an heir!" Madeline trembled with rage. "If anything happens to Isabella's baby, I'll make her pay!"

"Where is Evelyn?" Alexander's voice was glacial.

"You'll never find her!" Madeline wrenched her arm free.

The operating room doors burst open.

"Family of Isabella Winslow!"

The Winslows rushed forward. Madeline tried to follow, but Alexander seized her wrist.

"Let go! You ungrateful wretch!" Madeline shrieked.

Kingsley family members swarmed in, pulling them apart.

"You'd lay hands on your own grandmother for Evelyn?" Madeline sobbed.

Alexander remained unmoved. "Last chance. Where is she?"

"If Isabella suffers, I'll take half that girl's life!" Madeline screamed hysterically.

"Mother, Evelyn would never—" Eleanor Kingsley's protest was cut off.

"She pushed Isabella down the stairs!" Madeline spat. "I saw it with my own eyes!"

"The Eatons have surveillance," Patriarch Kingsley said grimly.

The footage arrived swiftly.

The video showed Isabella repeatedly grabbing at Evelyn. At the stairwell landing, she suddenly shoved Evelyn from behind.

At the last second, Evelyn caught the railing to steady herself. Isabella, however, tumbled down like a broken marionette.

"Isabella attacked first!" Patriarch Kingsley slammed his fist on a table.

Madeline paled. Slowed frames revealed Evelyn had reflexively grabbed Isabella's arm.

"She dragged Isabella down on purpose!" Madeline insisted. "Isabella was carrying a child! How could she—"

"And how couldn't she?" Alexander's eyes frosted over. "Evelyn is pregnant too. Why don't you mention that?"

The air turned to ice.
###Chapter 190: Do You Still Want This Child?

"Pregnant?" Madeline Kingsley blurted out. "How could she—"

She stopped mid-sentence.

Eleanor Kingsley gasped. "Evelyn is pregnant?"

"When did this happen?" Patriarch Kingsley's face lit up with joy. "Alex, speak up!"

Alexander Kingsley ignored their questions, his piercing gaze fixed on his grandmother. "You just demanded she repay the Kingsleys with half her life?"

Madeline turned pale.

"Will the child in her womb suffice as payment?" Alexander's voice was glacial.

"N-no..." Madeline shook her head frantically. "Why didn't you tell us sooner—"

Alexander wrenched his arm free. "If anything happens to Evelyn today, I'm severing all ties with the Kingsley family."

"Where is Evelyn?" Eleanor's voice cracked with urgency.

Madeline fumbled helplessly. "The Eatons said... they'd handle it..."

When Alexander called the Eaton residence, the butler answered proudly, "We've already reported those troublesome journalists to the police."

"You're the one who called me?" Alexander recognized the voice immediately.

"Yes, yes, that was me," the butler fawned.

"Who authorized you to involve the police?" Alexander demanded.

"I took the initiative," the butler explained hastily. "Later, the master approved—"

"Which precinct?" Alexander cut him off.

......

At the police station, a female officer was consulting her superior. "The female suspect claims she's unwell. She looks terrible. Should we send her to the hospital?"

"Where is she?" Alexander's chest tightened.

Evelyn Sinclair curled up on a chair in the temporary holding room, clutching her abdomen.

The dull ache in her lower abdomen had started when she arrived at the station. After drinking cold water, the pain intensified, spreading to her stomach in sharp spasms.

Beads of sweat formed on her forehead as her vision blurred.

"Evelyn!"

Through the haze, she heard Alexander's voice. When she looked up, she saw not only his anxious face but the entire Kingsley family behind him.

"I..." she began, but the world spun violently.

As darkness claimed her, a chorus of shocked exclamations filled her ears.

......

Emergency Room, Provincial Hospital.

"Doctor, how's my wife?" Alexander followed the physician closely. "She's fainted before—is it malnutrition? The baby—"

The doctor gave him a cold look. "You're her husband?"

Alexander nodded urgently.

"You knew she was pregnant and still let this happen?" the doctor snapped. "She nearly fell down the stairs, and you waited this long to bring her in? Do you even want this child?"

"That's not—"

"Then what is it?" the doctor scoffed. "Only care about the baby? Make up your mind—do you want it or not?"

"Yes! Absolutely!" Madeline rushed forward. "Save the child at all costs!"

The doctor sneered. "Now you're concerned? Where were you earlier? I can't stand families like yours—neglectful until disaster strikes, then putting on this act!"

Madeline hung her head in shame.

Eleanor intervened diplomatically. "Doctor, please do your best. The mother's safety comes first."

"The mother's constitution is decent, but she has uterine scarring from previous trauma. Extreme caution is required." The doctor's tone softened slightly. "Also, her emotional evaluation shows depressive tendencies. You all need serious self-reflection!"

Once the doctor left, Patriarch Kingsley rounded on his wife. "Look what you've done! You nearly killed our granddaughter-in-law and great-grandchild!"

"Evelyn never told me—" Madeline tried to defend herself.

"Tell you?" Patriarch Kingsley roared. "With your previous attitude, who would dare? The doctor said she's depressed—you drove her to it!"

Madeline shrank back, silenced.

"You will apologize properly later!" the old man commanded.

When the doctor announced visiting hours, Madeline moved forward—only for Alexander to block her path. "Grandmother, think carefully. Your precious darling is still lying in a hospital bed. Are you sure you want to see Evelyn now?"

He refused to let Madeline near Evelyn.

This sudden concern wasn't for Evelyn—only for the child she carried.
###Chapter 191: Madeline's Regret

Madeline Kingsley stood frozen, her limbs stiff with uncertainty.

Ever since learning of Isabella Winslow's pregnancy, she had treated the woman like her own flesh and blood.

She'd wanted to give Isabella the entire world on a silver platter.

Looking back now, even she found her own behavior unbelievable.

"Alex..." Her voice trembled. "Will Evelyn... ever forgive me?"

Alexander Kingsley's lips curled into a cold smile. "Of course she will. The Sinclairs value loyalty above all else—as long as your remorse is genuine."

His tone turned icy. "Which is precisely why I won't let you see her."

The thought of Evelyn softening toward his grandmother made his chest constrict with pain.

If even he didn't deserve her forgiveness, why should anyone else receive it so easily?

"Alex, your grandmother truly regrets her actions," Eleanor Kingsley interjected, noting Madeline's red-rimmed eyes.

Alexander's gaze sharpened like a blade. "Apologies are meaningless without guarantees."

"What guarantees?" Patriarch Kingsley demanded.

"Regarding her precious favorite." Alexander's smile turned sardonic. "She needs to say it herself."

Madeline shuddered before finally lifting her head. "From now on, only Evelyn is our family's daughter-in-law. Only her children..."

Her voice faded to a whisper.

Only then did Alexander give a curt nod and enter the hospital room.

Evelyn Sinclair lay in bed, staring blankly out the window.

"Evelyn!" Eleanor rushed forward to clasp her hand. "Are you feeling better?"

Alexander silently claimed the other side of the bed, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Evelyn's ear.

"Next time something happens, call me first," he murmured.

Patriarch Kingsley quickly added, "Or your grandfather!"

Mr. Kingsley adjusted his glasses. "I've already arranged for our lawyers."

All eyes turned to Madeline.

She wrung her hands. "Evelyn... This old woman was blind..."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Don't say that, Grandmother."

The distant warmth in that smile made Madeline's heart clench.

She suddenly remembered raising her hand to strike Evelyn on the staircase—the devastating disappointment in those eyes that had pierced her soul.

"Evelyn..." Tears streamed down Madeline's face. "I failed you..."

Alexander cut in sharply. "Evelyn needs rest."

He knew this foolish girl too well. She forgave too easily.

Just as she'd forgiven him.

But some wounds couldn't be healed with mere apologies.

"It's all my fault..." Madeline sobbed into Patriarch Kingsley's sleeve. "How could I have—"

BANG!

The door burst open.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Mrs. Winslow stormed in like a hurricane. "You murderer!"

She skidded to a halt upon seeing the room full of Kingsleys.

"Madeline!" Mrs. Winslow wailed. "Isabella... She's lost the baby! And it's all her fault!"
###Chapter 192: The Winslows' Scheme, Mrs. Kingsley's Fierce Protection

Madeline Kingsley's eyes reddened with self-reproach.

Isabella's mother barged into the hospital room with an entourage, radiating hostility.

"Your family caused my daughter's miscarriage!" Mrs. Winslow shrieked, her voice piercing.

The elderly matriarch froze in shock.

"What nonsense is this?" Eleanor Kingsley immediately stepped forward, shielding Evelyn's bed. "You've got the wrong people, Mrs. Winslow."

Her lips curled in a cold smile. "Are the Winslows addicted to fraud? First harassing Alexander, now targeting Evelyn?"

Mrs. Winslow stiffened.

Among Kingsbury's elite circles, Eleanor Kingsley was her greatest fear. The Kingsleys' wealth was formidable, Eleanor's wit razor-sharp, and Mr. Kingsley fiercely protective of his wife.

"Now, dear in-law—" Mrs. Winslow's bravado faltered.

"Who's your in-law?" Eleanor cut her off mercilessly. "Your daughter got herself knocked up and tried pinning it on our family. Karma took care of her little scheme. Now you dare show your face here?"

Mrs. Winslow trembled with rage. "Isabella was carrying a Kingsley heir!"

"Fine," Eleanor arched a brow. "Let's DNA test that miscarried fetus. If it's Alexander's, we'll take responsibility. If not..."

She stepped closer. "That's criminal fraud."

Mrs. Winslow's gaze darted away before landing on Madeline. "You personally approved their engagement, Madam Kingsley—"

"I was a fool!" Madeline snapped. "Your daughter pushed Evelyn down the stairs and got her just deserts. How dare you come here?"

"DNA test!" Eleanor pressed. "Do you have the guts?"

She added coldly, "And we're reporting Isabella for assault."

Mrs. Winslow paled.

She'd come to humiliate Evelyn upon hearing of her hospitalization. Isabella had gambled everything on this pregnancy. With the baby gone and no gains, she'd sought petty vengeance.

She never expected the entire Kingsley family present.

Nor that even doting Madeline would turn against them.

Realizing defeat, Mrs. Winslow fled in disgrace.

The Kingsleys regarded Eleanor with newfound respect.

Turning to Alexander, Eleanor ordered, "Investigate why Isabella was at the Eatons'."

Madeline whispered guiltily, "I took her... She said she wanted parenting advice..."

The scheme became clear.

Isabella had used the opportunity to eliminate her rival. Even if Madeline later discovered Evelyn's pregnancy, it would be too late—securing her position as the Kingsleys' "only heir."

"Why was Evelyn assigned to interview the Eatons?" Eleanor pressed.

Evelyn answered truthfully, "A last-minute assignment from my editor."

"How convenient." Eleanor's smile turned icy. "The Winslows' reach is impressive. Did they think Kingsleys are easily fooled?"

Her meaningful glance at Madeline carried both grace and warning: "Worst of all, exploiting your devotion to family, using you as their pawn. Mother, you almost lost your true grandchild."

Madeline could only nod repeatedly.

"That child was never mine," Alexander stated abruptly.

At their puzzled looks, he explained, "She once stole my hotel keycard... I have no memory of..."

His gaze flickered to Evelyn.

Security footage showed Evelyn leaving quickly that night, with Isabella entering afterward. He suspected tampering.

"No memory means nothing happened," Mr. Kingsley declared firmly, glancing pointedly at Evelyn.

A nurse entered, announcing visiting hours were over.

Outside, Eleanor immediately chastised Alexander, "She's carrying your child. When will you make Evelyn your wife?"
###Chapter 193: The Lie Exposed, Isabella's Desperate Escape

In the Kingsley ancestral home, Mr. Kingsley nervously rubbed his hands together. He was the only one who knew about Alexander and Evelyn's reconciliation, yet had to pretend complete ignorance.

"We..." Alexander scanned the room, his tone calm, "have already registered our marriage."

"What?" Mr. Kingsley sprang up first, delivering an Oscar-worthy performance.

Madeline Kingsley nearly dropped her teacup. She suddenly remembered Evelyn's words from last time - they hadn't been a provocation after all.

"What about the wedding?" Eleanor pressed anxiously. "Wedding dresses don't look good on pregnant bellies."

"No wedding." Alexander remained impassive. "We've decided on a secret marriage."

The Kingsleys exchanged bewildered glances.

"The pregnancy was unexpected." Alexander added. "The marriage is just to legitimize the child."

Madeline nodded repeatedly while the others looked troubled. This didn't seem like reconciliation at all.

Eleanor couldn't help sighing. "You're truly despicable."

...

"Lord Alex!" A subordinate rushed in. "The Winslows have taken Isabella and fled!"

"Where?" Alexander's gaze turned icy.

"Private jet. Straight to another country."

Madeline's voice trembled. "And the baby...?"

"The doctor confirmed she'd already miscarried." The subordinate reported. "They fled without even completing the D&C surgery."

Eleanor sneered. "Guilty conscience!"

Patriarch Kingsley slammed the table. "Disgraceful!"

Madeline turned pale. She'd nearly made the family acknowledge an illegitimate child, and almost harmed Evelyn's unborn baby.

...

In the hospital room late at night, Alexander set aside some documents.

"I told them about the secret marriage." He suddenly spoke.

Evelyn kept her eyes closed, murmuring a soft "Mm."

"Everyone signed NDAs." He paused. "I'll screen the staff again."

No response came from the hospital bed.

Alexander stood and approached, the mattress dipping slightly under his weight. He leaned over Evelyn, his piercing gaze intense.

"Evelyn." His voice lowered. "I'm furious today."
###Chapter 194: The Fetus's Secret

Evelyn's lashes fluttered slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes.

Alexander's voice was low and restrained. "Does nothing about you concern me when I'm not around?"

She pressed her lips together, offering no immediate reply.

"Evelyn," he suddenly asked, "why did you agree to marry me back then?"

The question froze the air between them.

Hadn't he been the one forcing her hand?

Standing before the civil registry office, he'd given her an ultimatum—marry him or lose their child. When had she ever had a choice?

"Remember what you said that day?" Alexander continued when she remained silent. "You asked if I could protect this child."

Her fingers unconsciously tightened around the bedsheet.

She had indeed said those words.

"But when you truly needed me, you chose to face it alone." Suppressed anger laced his voice. "Do you despise me that much?"

The question had been a blunt knife grinding against his heart for too long.

Alexander Kingsley, decisive in all matters, became hesitant only in matters of the heart.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, her eyes clear. "My phone was confiscated."

Alexander visibly stiffened.

"I felt unwell when I went downstairs. The Eaton family called the police immediately." Her tone was calm. "By the time the interrogation ended, I was in terrible condition. The officers promised to take me to the hospital—it was faster than waiting for you."

The answer caught him off guard.

Alexander slowly straightened, his expression returning to its usual composure. "I'll handle Horizon Media. But you need to take care of your health."

Secretly, he wished she would leave Horizon and stay far away from Julian. Yet reason told him that pushing further would only disrupt their fragile balance.

Evelyn exhaled inwardly in relief.

This was the Alexander she knew.

His forced gentleness had always felt unnatural—like plastic flowers blooming unnaturally on an iceberg.

"Are you returning to Kingsbury?" she changed the subject.

The man who'd claimed to resign yesterday was already reviewing documents today.

"Yes. It'll be busy." He set aside his work.

"Will you move back home?"

"Not unless you come with me." His expression darkened instantly.

Evelyn lowered her eyes to the white sheets. "My place only has one bedroom."

"The bed is big enough."

Evelyn: "..."

......

Melissa clutched her phone, brows furrowed.

Evelyn was unreachable, and Isabella's call had gone unanswered for too long.

"Isabella, about Evelyn—"

"I'm abroad for my pregnancy," Isabella's weak voice finally came through. "I won't be returning anytime soon."

"You're really pregnant?" Melissa gasped. "With Alexander?"

"Shh. We're secretly married." Isabella lowered her voice. "The last engagement angered him. This time, we must keep it quiet."

Hanging up, Melissa's emotions churned.

William's furious roar snapped her back to reality.

"I told you not to act recklessly! Now the Eatons are at our doorstep!"

Melissa's face paled.

Opening the door, she found Julian standing in the hallway, his gaze icy.

"Julian..." Her voice trembled.

"Birds of a feather." He turned to leave after spitting out the words.

Melissa rushed to block his path. "Why can't you see my worth?"

"Which part?" Julian smirked coldly. "Your talent for scheming?"

The words stabbed into Melissa's heart like a blade.

What shocked her more was Julian's transformation. The once gentle man now radiated sharp edges.

"At least I wouldn't let you become like this," she choked out.

Julian suddenly smiled, as if reverting to his old self.

"Have you ever considered," he said softly, "that this is the real me?"

Melissa took a step back.

"We only met in middle school. What childhood friendship?" He advanced step by step. "The dance lessons were for someone else. So was catching butterflies."

His smile vanished, replaced by cold indifference. "The only one who truly grew up with me is Evelyn."

In the hallway, Melissa collapsed to the floor, tears streaming.

......

The Eaton family's steward looked deathly pale.

The elder Mr. Eaton slammed evidence before him. "Traitorous scum!"

"Master, I only—" The steward trembled violently.

"Send him to the police," the younger Mr. Eaton said coldly.

It all traced back to one sentence Evelyn had whispered before leaving. How had she known his secret?

Alexander's fury forced the Eatons to punish their steward severely. Investigations revealed he'd taken Isabella's bribes to harass Evelyn.

This journalist was the reason Alexander Kingsley had moved heaven and earth.

......

The Kingsley estate buzzed with joy.

"I wonder if it's a boy or a girl?" The Dowager Madeline beamed.

Eleanor quickly interjected, "Either would be Kingsley's treasure."

Turning to the senior maid, the Dowager asked, "You're experienced. How can we tell the baby's gender?"

"Nowadays, a blood test at two months can reveal it."

The next day, the Dowager took Evelyn's hand eagerly. "Darling, let's check the baby's gender, shall we?"
###Chapter 195: Sour Soup and Probing

Evelyn Sinclair had just set down her book when Madeline Kingsley pushed open the hospital room door.

"Evelyn dear," the elderly woman's wrinkled face creased into a smile. "I went to the temple today to get a fortune slip—they say it can predict the baby's gender."

Evelyn's fingers stilled. She lifted her gaze with practiced grace. "Grandmother, this isn't the Middle Ages. Do people still believe in such things?"

"Oh, but better safe than sorry!" Madeline leaned in conspiratorially. "They say it's incredibly accurate. The slip reads—"

"Grandmother." Evelyn's interruption was gentle but firm. "Boy or girl, this is Alexander's and my child."

Madeline's smile faltered. She tucked the slip away with a strained chuckle. "Well, of course..."

She turned to a food container and produced a steaming bowl. "Here, I made this specially for you."

The pungent aroma of vinegar assaulted Evelyn's senses. She frowned at the yellowish broth—it smelled like someone had emptied an entire vinegar bottle into it.

"How much vinegar did you add?"

"Just a dash," Madeline's eyes darted sideways. "Some hawthorn for appetite."

Evelyn stirred the soup and fished out a lemon peel. "Since when is this hawthorn?"

Madeline's cheeks flushed. "Must you be so difficult?"

"Testing the 'sour for boy, spicy for girl' theory?" Evelyn set the spoon down with a clink. "Why don't you try it first?"

She made to ladle some broth, but Madeline recoiled. "My—my blood pressure! Acidic foods are forbidden."

The standoff broke when the door swung open. Alexander Kingsley strode in, his sharp gaze flickering between them. "Having soup?"

Madeline suddenly found the wall fascinating.

Evelyn pushed the bowl toward him. "Your grandmother's thoughtful gift."

Alexander drank without hesitation, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Hmm. Appetizing."

Madeline brightened. "See? I told—"

"If by appetizing you mean battery acid," he set the bowl down, "then yes."

The older woman's face cycled through shades of red and white.

"Grandmother," Alexander's voice turned glacial. "Don't you have bridge games to attend?"

"I was just concerned about Evelyn's—"

"Concerned enough to check our child's genitals?" His laugh held no warmth. "Since when did the Kingsleys become sexist peasants?"

Madeline fled without another word.

Alexander poured Evelyn a glass of water. "You shouldn't have to deal with that."

Their fingers brushed during the exchange, sending a jolt through both.

"The doctor cleared me for discharge," she said abruptly.

He nodded. "You're coming home."

"I want my apartment."

"No." His refusal was absolute. "Security's inadequate."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Then you—"

"I'm staying with you." As if stating the obvious.

Her eyes widened. "It's tiny."

Alexander caged her against the bed, his breath warm on her cheek. "Tiny?" His low chuckle vibrated against her. "And I'm... not?"

Scarlet bloomed across Evelyn's ears.
###Chapter 196: Caution in Newlywed Bliss

Evelyn froze for a second, her cheeks burning crimson.

Had she misunderstood him?

Alexander's words were perfectly innocent, yet they made her ears turn red.

"You..." She stumbled over her words.

"Hmm?" He leaned in closer, his breath brushing her ear. "Did I say something wrong? When did you become so stingy... refusing even me."

"Stop it!" She pushed against his chest, but he caught her wrist.

His lips grazed her fingertips, his gaze dark with possessive hunger—as if he wanted to devour her whole.

Evelyn squirmed, feeling branded by his touch.

"Alexander, remember our agreement," she protested, trying to pull free.

"The agreement never said I couldn't kiss you," he countered, unmoving. "Or that we couldn't live together."

She averted her eyes from his scorching stare.

"What about Isabella Winslow? The whole city saw your engagement."

His expression turned icy. "Must you do this, Evelyn?"

He knew her too well.

Bringing up Isabella was just her way of reminding him of Julian Ashford.

She didn’t want reconciliation.

This marriage was only for the baby.

The realization tightened his chest.

The only comfort was that she valued this child more than Julian.

But the thought of her carrying another man's baby made it hard to breathe.

"Evelyn," he pulled her flush against him, "I'm the legal father now. Do you want our child raised in a broken home?"

She pressed a hand to his chest. "We'll discuss that after the birth. If you still want to be a father by then."

"I'm starting now." His arms locked around her, leaving no room for refusal.

"Alexander—"

"You expect me to watch you live across from Julian?" he cut in. "To let another man covet my wife?"

"He wouldn’t—"

"Did you change the locks?" he challenged.

Evelyn hesitated.

Julian had returned the key...

"I saw you leaving together," Alexander said coldly. "I won’t tolerate it again."

Suddenly, he asked, "How did this happen?"

Her breath hitched.

That was a question she couldn’t answer.

He took her silence as confirmation.

"You're my wife now," he gritted out. "The agreement states you can't see Julian again."

But the apartment she lived in belonged to Julian.

If not for his grandmother's interference, she wouldn’t have moved out.

"Grandmother wants you back at the estate," he warned. "Don’t force me to side with her."

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Isn’t this coercion?"

Her expression stung him.

"Just let me in," he conceded. "I’ll follow your rules on everything else."

She bit her lip.

She knew better than to yield.

Give him an inch, and he’d take a mile...

"You sleep in the living room," she stated firmly.

"Fine." He agreed easily. "But I’m getting a sofa bed."

Without waiting for a reply, he took the keys and ushered her inside.

Evelyn stared.

It dawned on her then.

The living room had been his goal all along.

The talk of cohabitation was just a ruse to get inside.

Since when did Alexander play mind games?

His efficiency was staggering.

Within an hour, the living room held a sofa bed and a coffee table, making the space feel cramped.

As Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, he handed her a document.

"Read this."

She flipped it open—a confidential file in English.

"What’s this supposed to mean?" She feigned calm.

"Living here," he said meaningfully, "you’ll have access to intel like this anytime."

She shoved it back at him.

"I don’t need it."

Retreating to her room, she leaned against the door, steadying her racing heart.

Alexander had dangled bait.

Right now, her career mattered more than anything.

And he’d casually drop business secrets her way.

Should she take advantage?

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"What now?" She cracked the door open just enough to speak.

"A goodnight kiss isn’t too much to ask, is it?"

The door slammed shut in response.

Absolutely too much!

Alexander was the epitome of pushing boundaries.

......

Madeline Kingsley stewed in frustration after returning home, venting to her daughter-in-law: "I only wanted to know the baby’s gender. It’s not like I’d reject a girl. Why are they so guarded?"

Eleanor Kingsley stayed silent.

"They refuse to move back," the matriarch grumbled on, "and ignore doctor’s orders by leaving the hospital early. Don’t they care about the baby?"

"Young couples cherish their privacy," Eleanor deflected. "They’ve just reconciled. Give them space."

"If not for the pregnancy, I wouldn’t interfere!" Madeline huffed. "Eleanor, talk Evelyn into returning. She listens to you."

Eleanor wanted no part in this.

"Evelyn might heed me, but Alexander would resent it," she sighed. "He already blames me for not helping him win her back last time."

Seeing Madeline wasn’t done, Eleanor excused herself to prepare her husband’s late-night snack.

Alone with her longtime maid, Madeline complained, "This generation is so willful!"

"Exactly!" the maid agreed. "My daughter-in-law quit her job the moment she got pregnant. With the Kingsley fortune, why must the young mistress keep working?"

"Precisely!" Madeline slapped her knee. "Alexander should put his foot down!"

The maid lowered her voice. "The problem lies with the young mistress... Lord Alex is besotted. He indulges her every whim."

Leaning closer, she whispered, "Newlyweds can be reckless. The mistress is delicate—what if they harm the baby..."
###Chapter 197: She Shouldn't Have Touched Her Baby

Madeline Kingsley staggered back half a step.

"This..."

"The young mistress should return home," the maid whispered. "All women have soft hearts. If the man takes initiative, who could refuse? Besides, she must worry about Lord Alex straying during her pregnancy..."

Madeline's brows furrowed.

"Fine," she sighed heavily. "I'll play the villain."

The maid quickly added, "You're doing this for the Kingsley family. Lord Alex and the young mistress will understand eventually."

The next morning.

Madeline blocked Evelyn Sinclair's doorway.

"Evelyn, come home with Grandma." She grasped Evelyn's hand. "No more tonic. Just rest for the baby."

Evelyn's fingertips turned cold.

"Grandmother," Alexander Kingsley stepped between them. "We're in a hurry."

"Is work more important than your child?" Madeline persisted.

"The doctor said moderate work benefits the fetus." Alexander guided Evelyn into the car.

In the rearview mirror, Madeline's figure grew distant.

"Angry?" Alexander asked.

Evelyn stared out the window. "Next time, I won't guarantee respecting my elders."

Ice crystallized in her eyes.

The grandmother who once doted on her was long gone.

"She's just your grandmother." Evelyn's voice was flat. "Don't blame me if I show no mercy next time."

Alexander's gaze darkened.

The car stopped near Horizon Media.

"Follow her closely," Alexander ordered his men.

Nathan Carter reported, "We found the Winslows, but Isabella's whereabouts remain unknown."

"Keep searching." Alexander tapped the armrest absently.

Evelyn entered Horizon's building.

Julian Ashford waited for her.

"Feeling alright?" His eyes dropped to her abdomen.

Evelyn averted her gaze. "Fine."

"The Financial Summit is starting soon." Julian's voice tightened. "You're going to the frontlines?"

"Yes."

Julian clenched his fists. "Be careful."

After the door closed, he punched the wall violently.

He should have stopped her.

But selfishness kept him silent.

Julian shut his eyes in anguish.

He knew whose child Evelyn carried.

He knew Isabella lurked in the shadows.

Yet he chose to stand aside.

In the conference room, Melissa Lee smiled meaningfully.

"Editor Sinclair, you'll handle Mr. Strauss's interview."

Tammy Tan pulled Evelyn aside. "The quote is absurdly high, but Melissa gave us peanuts for budget."

Evelyn chuckled. "I'll handle it."

Her hand rested on her stomach.

Melissa Lee, you should never have laid a finger on my baby.
###Chapter 198: Grandma, Why Did She Hit My Stomach?

Melissa Lee came looking for Evelyn Sinclair the moment she took over the assignment.

"How's the Winston Strauss interview coming along?" Melissa asked casually.

Evelyn had anticipated this. "I've already transferred all relevant materials to Evelyn."

She knew exactly what Melissa wanted.

True to form, Melissa didn't press further, only offering a knowing smile.

As she walked away, her nails dug deep into her palms.

If Evelyn actually secured this interview, Julian Ashford must be pulling strings behind the scenes.

The thought made Melissa's eyes flash with malice.

Ever since Julian publicly humiliated her last time, she'd given up all hope.

But she'd make sure Evelyn paid dearly.

If that woman dared return, Melissa would make her regret it!

......

When Evelyn received the materials from Melissa, she noticed the meeting time had already been scheduled.

Winston Strauss would arrive early Sunday morning, and his assistant arranged a 10:30 AM meeting at the Regent Grand Hotel.

"Free for lunch this Sunday?"

That evening, Evelyn had just stepped out of the shower when Alexander Kingsley cornered her in the hallway.

"Why?"

Though they'd been living under the same roof, they'd barely spoken these past few days.

"I have a meeting at the Regent. Join me for lunch?" His gaze burned into her.

Evelyn frowned slightly. "No, thanks."

She turned and entered her room, missing the dark expression that instantly clouded his face.

Standing alone in the empty living room, Alexander felt the full weight of Evelyn's indifference for the first time.

She no longer saw him.

The realization tightened his chest.

......

The next morning, Evelyn ran into Madeline Kingsley just outside the residential complex.

"Come home with Grandma, dear," the elderly woman said with affection.

Evelyn's expression remained cold. "How did you know I was attending the summit?"

Mrs. Laurel, standing behind Madeline, quickly explained: "Mrs. Kingsley mentioned it last night—"

Evelyn had no patience for excuses and turned to leave.

"You can't go!" Madeline suddenly grew agitated. "Last year's summit had a pregnant woman trampled into miscarriage!"

Evelyn whirled around in shock.

Where did this absurd rumor come from?

"Come home with me!" Madeline signaled with her eyes.

Mrs. Laurel immediately seized Evelyn's arm.

"Let go!" Evelyn stomped hard on Mrs. Laurel's foot.

The maid yelped in pain and released her grip, allowing Evelyn to break free.

"Stop her!" Madeline barked.

Mrs. Laurel, still in pain, chased after Evelyn and grabbed her again.

Suddenly, Evelyn clutched her stomach and doubled over.

"Mrs. Laurel... why did you hit my stomach..." Her face went deathly pale, her voice trembling.
###Chapter 199: I Heard You're Having Some Old Man's Baby

Mrs. Laurel jerked her hand back, face turning pale. "I—I didn't..."

Madeline Kingsley rushed forward in quick strides.

All she saw was Mrs. Laurel gripping Evelyn's arm. Fury and alarm twisted her features. "Evelyn! Are you hurt?"

Evelyn lifted her misty eyes. "Grandmother, don't blame Mrs. Laurel. She just... accidentally bumped my stomach with her elbow..."

Madeline trembled with rage, raising her hand to strike the maid.

"You foolish old woman!"

Mrs. Laurel scrambled backward, waving her hands frantically. "Madam, I truly didn't! I merely gave the young mistress a light tug—"

"I saw you yanking her violently!" Madeline snapped. "How dare you handle her so roughly when she's carrying a child?"

The maid hung her head under the scolding, then suddenly gasped. "Madam, check on the young mistress first!"

They both turned.

The spot where Evelyn had been crouching was now empty.

Madeline froze.

Mrs. Laurel shrieked, "Oh no! The young mistress faked it! I told you I didn't touch her! She framed me to escape!"

"Where is she?" Madeline spun in circles, frantic.

She'd sneaked out today alone with Mrs. Laurel.

After her last complaint at the Kingsley estate, even Eleanor had dismissed her concerns.

"Alexander knows his limits, and Evelyn isn't reckless," William Kingsley had said. "Mother, stop meddling."

That night, the family patriarch had reprimanded her severely.

Now, in the blink of an eye, Evelyn had vanished.

Their chaotic search yielded nothing. Convinced Evelyn had fled by car, they sped off in pursuit.

Only after their taillights disappeared did Evelyn emerge from the neighborhood shadows.

Her gaze was icy.

Madeline Kingsley had crossed too many lines.

Some lessons needed to be taught.

......

Between the old woman's interference and traffic delays, Evelyn arrived five minutes late at Regent Grand Hotel.

She'd secured only thirty minutes with Mr. Nash, chief aide to Winston Strauss.

But at the entrance, security blocked her path.

"A journalist is already meeting with Mr. Nash," the towering guard said flatly. "One appointment per slot."

Evelyn didn't force entry.

She stood aside, reviewing the morning's events.

She'd been back at Horizon Media for days.

The summit schedule was set long ago.

Why had Madeline chosen today to ambush her?

This reeked of orchestration.

Mrs. Laurel?

After decades of loyal service and generous treatment, had she betrayed the family like Mrs. Wilson?

The door across the hall opened.

A familiar figure emerged, bowing obsequiously.

"Mr. Nash, the deposit will arrive shortly. Full payment before the interview, guaranteed."

Inside, a handsome young man gave a curt nod before closing the door—but not before his annoyed expression morphed into stunned admiration at the sight of Evelyn.

She straightened up.

The groveling man turned.

Their eyes locked.

"Well, if it isn't Editor Sinclair?" Simon York feigned nonchalance.

Her former Horizon Media colleague—the one who'd stabbed her in the back.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to his badge.

[Orange Financial]

So he'd jumped ship to Orange Media and switched to finance?

"What?" Simon puffed up. "Editor Sinclair can leap from entertainment to finance, but I can't find better opportunities?"

Evelyn turned to leave.

Simon chased after her like an excited puppy.

"Where's that famous sharp tongue, Editor? Cat got it?"

When she ignored him, he raised his voice:

"Who'd have thought we'd meet again so soon—with me coming out on top? Remember kicking me out of Horizon? Regret it now?"

"On top?" Evelyn halted abruptly.

Her voice carried farther than his: "A spineless hack who sells professional ethics for cash thinks temporary luck is worth bragging about?"

Simon's face darkened.

The Evelyn he knew was gentle and reserved—never this cutting.

"Am I wrong?" She stepped closer. "I wonder if Mr. Strauss knows what caliber of journalist he's dealing with."

"You—you're slandering me!" Simon panicked.

"What caliber? The kind who betrays interviewees and frames colleagues for money. Do your new coworkers know why Horizon fired you? Should I warn Mr. Strauss his exclusive might end up auctioned off?"

"Lies!" Simon sputtered. "When did I ever betray an interviewee?"

Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Isabella Winslow paid you to fabricate her engagement to Alexander Kingsley—manipulating stock prices. What financial outlet would hire such 'talent'?"

"Fabricated? They were practically engaged!" Simon exploded. "So I took money—who are you to judge? At least I'm not some old man's pregnant mistress shopping for a rebound guy!"

The door behind him swung open.

A tall, hazel-eyed man with chestnut hair stepped out.

Right behind him stood Alexander Kingsley, his expression thunderous...
###Chapter 200: Public Claim of Possession

Simon York froze in place.

His eyes widened in disbelief as Alexander Kingsley and Winston Strauss emerged side by side from the room.

How could it be them?

Why were they together?

More terrifyingly—how much had they overheard?

Cold sweat drenched Simon's back as he mentally replayed his conversation with Evelyn Sinclair.

"You took Isabella Winslow's money?" Alexander's voice cut like a blade.

Simon's legs trembled. "N-no, that's not—"

He frantically pointed at Evelyn. "She wrote the article—"

"So you didn't personally admit to taking bribes?" Alexander interrupted, his gaze sharp as steel.

Simon shuddered.

He never imagined facing Alexander under these circumstances.

"Winston, what's happening?" A calm male voice spoke from behind.

Winston Strauss approached leisurely, his eyes lingering briefly on Evelyn's face.

"Journalistic dispute," Winston replied in fluent Mandarin, his tone languid.

Lance Yeager stepped forward smoothly. "This reporter claims they'll pay the deposit soon."

"Soon?" Winston's voice turned dangerously soft. "Meaning not yet?"

"Correct." Lance smiled at Simon. "Apologies. The interview is canceled."

Simon paled. "Mr. Yeager—"

Security guards already moved to forcibly escort him out.

Stumbling backward, Simon shot Evelyn a venomous glare.

If he couldn't get this scoop, neither would she.

......

The hallway regained silence.

Lance studied Evelyn with interest. "You're also a journalist?"

Evelyn handed him her business card with practiced ease. "Horizon Media. We've corresponded."

"Evelyn Sinclair..." Lance murmured, admiration flashing in his eyes. "A beautiful name."

As he reached for his own card, two piercing stares halted him.

Alexander's expression darkened. Winston arched an amused brow.

"Made your decision?" Alexander demanded coldly.

Evelyn blinked. "About what?"

"Lunch." His voice turned glacial.

Winston and Lance exchanged surprised glances.

"I—" Evelyn began.

"Forget it." Alexander turned to Winston. "Reservations are set."

Winston nodded. "The interview can wait."

Lance gave Evelyn a regretful look before retreating behind Winston.

"Move." Alexander suddenly yanked Evelyn against his chest.

Under the stunned gazes of Winston and Lance, his arm locked possessively around her waist.

As the four reached a corridor turn, Alexander abruptly pinned Evelyn to the wall.

"Not happy to see me?" His low voice carried a dangerous edge.
###Chapter 201: A Surge of Jealousy

Alexander Kingsley's gaze landed on Evelyn Sinclair as she flipped through her interview notes, head bowed.

The light in his eyes dimmed instantly.

"Did you come here just to see me?" He leaned in, his voice laced with subtle hope.

Evelyn looked up, her expression calm. "I have an interview scheduled with Mr. Winston Strauss. Lance arranged it."

Alexander's fingertips turned cold.

Thirty minutes ago, he had recognized her voice outside his door. His heart had skipped a beat. She remembered his schedule—she must have come to wait for him, to share lunch.

The thought had made even Simon York's rudeness unimportant.

Until he overheard her conversation with Lance.

She had only remembered Winston's name.

"Is the interview more important than me?" His grip tightened around her wrist, rougher than intended.

Evelyn winced. "This is work."

Work. Always work.

Alexander smirked. She had refused his invitation without hesitation, yet agreed instantly when Winston was involved.

She remembered every detail about the penthouse guest but acted as if he didn't exist on the same floor.

As the restaurant door clicked shut, he pinned her against the wall.

"Using me and then leaving?" His breath was hot. "I hold the rights to Winston's interview."

Evelyn struggled. "You're being unreasonable."

"Unreasonable?" His fingers traced the reddened skin of her wrist. "Out of my entire schedule, you only saw Winston's name?"

A knock interrupted them.

Lance's voice carried through the door. "Lord Alex, Mr. Strauss is asking when you'll join him."

Alexander studied Evelyn's tense lips—then smiled.

"Tell Winston," he called back, "his interviewer is unavailable today."
###Chapter 202: The Miserly Alexander Kingsley

Before Evelyn could finish speaking, she ignored Alexander's warning glare and stared directly at the elegantly seated woman inside.

Evelyn's posture was impeccable, her demeanor graceful.

But her mind was in turmoil.

She had assumed the scenario would play out like this:

Alexander asked her to lunch, got rejected, and then invited Winston instead.

But Lance's sudden appearance shattered that assumption.

So whether she agreed or not, Alexander would have dined with Winston anyway?

That meant his earlier invitation was nothing but a trap!

"Hold on." Alexander unceremoniously shut the door.

He turned back to Evelyn, lowering his voice. "Stay away from Lance."

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

......

"And who is this?"

Winston's gaze settled on Evelyn, though his question was directed at Alexander.

"Reporter Sinclair," Alexander answered first.

Lance eyed the two sitting shoulder-to-shoulder and raised a brow. "Just a reporter?"

Earlier, when Evelyn tried to create distance, Alexander had the waiter remove the extra chair.

Now he sat pressed against her, his possessiveness unmistakable.

Winston smirked meaningfully. "Interesting. I never thought Alex actually liked women."

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

She couldn't help but glance at Alexander.

His expression was icy, completely ignoring the teasing.

Lance fanned the flames. "Lord Alex never gets close to women. The whole circle thinks he prefers men. Didn't you know, Reporter Sinclair? We've known him for four or five years—only male assistants around him."

"Four or five years..."

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "That is a long time."

Then what did that make her, his invisible girlfriend?

"How long have you two been together?" Lance pressed eagerly.

"Less than a month," Evelyn replied coolly.

From their marriage date, that was technically true.

Winston and Lance exchanged a look.

"Reporter Sinclair," Lance suddenly softened his tone, "you want to interview Mr. Strauss?"

The abrupt gentleness sent a chill down Evelyn's spine.

She nodded.

Lance smiled wider. "But you know our conditions, right?"

Evelyn suppressed her discomfort. "That's what I intended to discuss with you."

"Order." Alexander tossed the menu between them. "If we're eating, then eat properly. Think of the baby."

The statement made even Winston hold his breath.

Alexander shot Lance a cold look. "No talking during meals."

Lance nearly choked.

Weren't they supposed to negotiate?

Double standards!

......

The moment Evelyn left for the restroom, Lance immediately lowered his voice. "Lord Alex! You're in a sham marriage?"

Alexander frowned. "What sham marriage?"

"Stop pretending!" Lance looked pained. "Fine, you like men—but tricking someone into marriage? How could you do this to Reporter Sinclair and your boyfriends?"

Alexander: "......"

"Enough!" Lance waved a hand. "We all know your preferences. Fooling your family is one thing, but getting her pregnant? A miser who won't spare a dime—where's your conscience?"

Alexander turned to Winston. "Control your man."

Winston was about to light a cigarette when Alexander said coldly, "No secondhand smoke around a pregnant woman."

Winston put the cigarette away and said seriously, "He's right. You're too stingy. No status, no money?"

"Fine, I'll grant the interview—you pay for it. Consider it hush money."

Lance nodded vigorously. "Save some face for Lord Alex."

Alexander: "......"

"Not a single cent," he said icily. "Take it or leave it."

"See?" Lance and Winston said in unison. "Miser!"

When Evelyn returned, the atmosphere was palpably tense.

Alexander and Winston both looked grim.

Lance gazed at her with pity, as if saying: Poor thing...

......

"How far along are you, Reporter Sinclair?" Lance suddenly asked with concern.

"Almost three months," Evelyn answered.

Lance's eyes grew even more sympathetic.

Three months pregnant, together for less than one.

How desperately must she have worked to become a tool?

No wonder the rumors said she was a homewrecker looking for a rebound.

A woman this beautiful deserved better...

Alexander was worse than a beast!

"What skincare do you use, Reporter Sinclair?" Lance asked eagerly.

"Just regular brands," Evelyn replied, confused.

Lance shot Alexander a glare. "With your means, she should be using the best!"

"I'll recommend a pregnancy-safe brand!" He snatched Evelyn's phone. "Let me sign you up for their membership."

Before Evelyn could react, a call suddenly popped up.

Lance's finger slipped, hitting speakerphone.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Melissa Lee's shrill voice blared. "Is the interview settled?"

Evelyn tensed. "We're discussing it."

"Discussing?" Melissa sneered. "Can't even lie convincingly anymore?"
###Chapter 203: Everyone Thought She Was Committing Career Suicide

Melissa Lee's shrill voice exploded from the phone speaker.

The conference room plunged into eerie silence.

Lance Yeager's fingers trembled slightly around the phone, disbelief written across his face.

Alexander Kingsley's brow furrowed. Winston Strauss's eyes flashed with surprise.

Evelyn Sinclair's fingertips turned cold.

The speakerphone button glowed accusingly.

Hanging up would seem cowardly. Continuing felt humiliating.

Trapped between two impossible choices, she chose defiance.

"Cat got your tongue?" Melissa sneered. "Weren't you so confident about securing that interview?"

"Negotiations are ongoing." Evelyn kept her voice steady.

"Ha!" Melissa's laugh scraped like nails on glass. "Planning to use your seduction tricks again? Just like how you snagged Alexander?"

Evelyn dug her nails into her palm. "Forgot your medication today, Director?"

The recording light blinked mockingly.

She yearned to shove those vile words back down Melissa's throat.

"Playing the saint now?" Melissa scoffed. "Standing up Orange Media—are you Simon York's mole?"

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "How intimately you track my schedule."

"Bullshit!" Melissa's composure shattered. "The whole industry saw you get thrown out by hotel security!"

Lance suddenly snatched the phone. "Who said she's not negotiating?"

Three seconds of dead air.

"And you are?" Melissa dripped contempt.

"Lance Yeager. Assistant to Winston Strauss."

Melissa's cackle pierced the room. "How much did Evelyn pay you to lie for her?"

Lance's face darkened.

"What's Horizon Media's budget?" he ground out.

"Pathetic acting!" Melissa jeered. "No interview? Then go home and gestate!"

Lance ended the call with violence.

"Sign the damn authorization!" He slammed the table. "Don't even think about refusing, Winston!"

Winston glanced at Alexander's thunderous expression and swallowed hard. "...No objections."

——

The atmosphere at Horizon Media's conference room turned lethal.

William Yearwood presided like a judge, flanked by grim executives.

Melissa smiled like a viper. "I heard Reporter Sinclair secured a premium interview? Let's review the budget together."

The seven-figure fee hung like a guillotine.

Knowing glances passed between attendees.

"Have terms been negotiated?" The CFO demanded.

Evelyn shook her head.

"Playing games?" The CFO stood abruptly. "Either you're deceiving the company, or deceiving Winston Strauss, or—"

"Playing both sides!" Melissa finished, eyes gleaming with malice. "Unethical ambition has no place at Horizon!"

Every gaze became a blade.

To them, she'd already dug her professional grave.
###Chapter 204: No Repeat Mistakes

"The price hasn't been discussed yet." Evelyn Sinclair's gaze swept over Melissa Lee. "There was an unexpected development—Mr. Yeager granted me direct authorization."

Melissa's chest tightened under that look.

But she remained convinced Evelyn couldn't possibly have secured the Winston Strauss interview.

Before summoning the executives, Melissa had already spun her version—

Horizon Media paved the way by connecting with Strauss's assistant, only for Evelyn to arrive late and let Orange Media steal the opportunity.

Worse, during the confirmation call, Evelyn allegedly had someone impersonate the assistant to falsely claim success.

Outraged, Melissa called this meeting to expose the truth.

A Winston Strauss interview carried astronomical costs—more symbolic than practical for Horizon. If Evelyn truly secured it, where would the funds come from?

If she lied, such deception couldn't be tolerated.

Factual reporting was journalism's most basic ethic.

If Evelyn fabricated this, how could any future reporting be trusted?

This threatened Horizon's very foundation.

William Yearwood was first to endorse Melissa's motion, personally overseeing the meeting.

Most executives knew Evelyn only through rumors of "sleeping her way up"—especially after hearing she'd stolen Melissa's fiancé Julian Ashford.

A woman trading on her looks potentially becoming their future boss's wife?

These self-righteous men recoiled instinctively.

Moreover, Melissa's father was a Horizon founding partner with substantial influence.

Their allegiance was predetermined.

They scrutinized Evelyn with merciless precision.

"Show us the authorization letter," one executive demanded, hand outstretched. "Words are worthless."

Evelyn met his gaze. "Mr. Yeager promised to send formal documentation. I returned early to prepare interview details."

Melissa snorted.

"Verbal promise? So you can claim anything now? If it falls through, just blame Strauss for changing his mind?"

"Director Lee," Evelyn's voice held terrifying calm, "lies always unravel. You could verify directly with Mr. Yeager. Why this unseemly haste?"

Her lips curved slightly. "You're overeager."

Eager to destroy her.

The Melissa Lee Evelyn knew in university hadn't been like this.

Back then, she'd been the golden girl—half of media studies' legendary duo with Julian Ashford.

Arrogant, but genuinely talented.

This Melissa was unrecognizable—

Petty. Obsessive. Love-crazed...

Even her striking beauty had twisted into something ugly.

Perhaps a life without setbacks left her unequipped for failure.

Julian's rejection had broken something in her.

Whether Evelyn returned Julian's feelings or not, she'd become Melissa's sworn enemy.

"Overeager?" Melissa's voice spiked. "You're the one spewing lies! Do you even know what a Strauss interview costs? That foreign media rely on sponsors?"

"I do." Evelyn smiled. "Last year's million-dollar session was bankrolled by financiers just to share his frame."

"Audacious!" An executive slammed the table. "Counting on protection, or betting we won't verify?"

The subtext was clear: Don't think the Crown Prince's favor lets you play god.

"Perhaps Editor Sinclair really succeeded?" another sneered. "Though I wonder where she'd find a million dollars. If she can raise it, that's... impressive."

All eyes turned to William Yearwood.

Who else but Julian would fund this?

But a million dollars—whether personal or company funds—was absurd!

William's face darkened. "Melissa, she's your subordinate. Handle this."

Malice flashed in Melissa's eyes.

With William's blessing, she had free rein.

"Evelyn, admit your mistake now, and I might plead leniency for you," she offered faux mercy.

Leniency?

Evelyn saw through the death sentence.

Melissa wouldn't just fire her—she'd ensure total ruin.

Perfect...

Ice glinted in Evelyn's gaze.

The moment Melissa targeted her unborn child, she'd crossed the line.

There would be no second chance.

This time, Evelyn would bury Melissa forever.
###Chapter 205: She's Leaving Today, Whether She Likes It or Not

A faint, icy smile curled at the corners of Evelyn Sinclair's lips.

"I'm ready to cooperate with any investigation and willing to forfeit this interview. Do as you see fit, Director. After all, you once suggested I should go home and rest for my pregnancy."

"Ha!" A senior executive couldn't help but scoff. "So now you're giving up completely?"

"Are you admitting to promising an exorbitant interview fee without authorization?" Melissa Lee pressed, her voice sharp. "Who did you consult? Who approved this? Now that the company's reputation is damaged, with potential financial losses looming—do you really think you still belong here?"

"How does the Director plan to handle me?" Evelyn countered.

"Write a public apology, then go home and wait for your delivery. The company will clean up your mess and won't pursue legal action." Melissa's smile turned venomous. "Of course, if you think this is unfair, you can resign outright—just sign a five-year non-compete agreement."

This was her real goal.

The Winston Strauss interview, the meeting—all were just pretexts.

She wanted to pin a crime on Evelyn and force her out with justification.

"Given the Director's vast knowledge, you must know what 'cuckoo in the nest' means." Evelyn regarded her with pity.

"What did you say?" Melissa froze, then erupted in fury.

How dare Evelyn accuse her of being the usurper?

She was the one who had stolen Julian Ashford!

"When did Director Lee start seeing herself as a true Horizon Media insider?" Evelyn continued. "When did you start treating the Financial Department as your personal fiefdom? When did you begin taking your position and privileges for granted?"

"Stop spouting nonsense! I graduated with a master's from Imperial Media University and worked my way up from the bottom. Everything I have today, I earned!" Melissa hissed through clenched teeth.

Including Julian—he should have been hers.

It was Evelyn, this uninvited interloper, who stole her love and now sought to take the Financial Department too.

She could have stayed in the shadows as a mistress, but instead, she flaunted her pregnancy like a trophy.

If Evelyn wasn't removed soon, she would be the one forced to leave...

"Director, you scored ten points below Imperial Media's admission cutoff in your college entrance exams. Fifty points below the competitive majors." Evelyn's tone was light, almost casual. "It was only because your father leveraged Horizon's internship program with the university that you got in. And as for how you secured your postgraduate recommendation—shall I elaborate?"

"You—" Melissa paled.

How did she know these things?

"And let's not forget, Senior, your so-called 'achievements' in the Financial Department. The veterans have seen it all. Without your father, would you even be a director?"

"You're just jealous!" Melissa shrieked. "Jealous that I have family backing while you're nothing but an orphan!"

Evelyn chuckled.

When she first joined the Financial Department, Melissa had been too proud for petty insults.

Now she was unraveling like a hysterical shrew.

And Evelyn? She remained unshaken. "Perhaps you should ask your father how he seized control of the Financial Department—and how he made you believe it was your birthright."

"Evelyn Sinclair!" William Yearwood suddenly interjected.

"Does President Yearwood have something to add?" Evelyn met his gaze directly. "Perfect timing. You were there when it happened. Why don't you enlighten Director Lee?"

"W-why are we even discussing this?" William stammered. "We're here to talk about the Winston Strauss interview—"

"But the conclusion you've reached is to expel me." Evelyn's voice was calm. "Do you think that's appropriate, President Yearwood?"

Beads of sweat formed on William's forehead.

She wasn't supposed to know any of this...

He had tested the waters. She should have remembered nothing.

Had she uncovered something?

"What's going on?" A senior executive frowned. "Is Editor Sinclair also connected to Horizon Media? Is she competing with Director Lee?"

"Let's stay on topic." Another executive's face darkened. "President Yearwood is right. This is about the Winston Strauss interview. If you think Director Lee has no authority over you, what about me, the Vice President? Do I have the right to fire you on the spot?"

Evelyn lifted her chin slightly.

"If the leadership insists, I have nothing more to say. But as for Winston's interview—I'm afraid I can't help."

"You're still hung up on the interview?" The executives laughed.

Even now, she refused to back down.

"Skip the maternity leave. Just resign. Sign the non-compete, and we'll part ways amicably. The company will handle Winston."

Melissa's smile was triumphant.

For once, the higher-ups were unanimous.

Evelyn would leave today.

Just then—

A knock sounded at the conference room door.

"President Yearwood," the secretary said cautiously, "Mr. Winston Strauss's assistant just contacted us..."
###Chapter 206 Can't Save Her
The conference room air turned to ice.

Executives exchanged uneasy glances, skepticism written across their faces.

William Yearwood's fingers drummed an impatient rhythm on the table.

Winston Strauss's assistant reached out first?

How did Evelyn Sinclair secure this interview?

A million-dollar fee—and she agreed without hesitation?

Dark scowls deepened across the room.

"Scrap the non-compete clause," someone sneered. "No point wasting company resources."

What difference would it make?

Horizon Media's influence could bury Evelyn's career overnight.

"Which assistant? What exactly was said?" William's voice tightened.

The secretary handed him a tablet. "Mr. Yeager sent the interview agreement for our approval."

Approval?

Approval to be swindled?

William was about to erupt when the door swung open.

Julian Ashford strode in.

His gaze brushed past Evelyn—so fleeting it might've been imagined.

"I hear we've landed the Winston Strauss exclusive?"

Melissa Lee cut in first. "Editor Sinclair acted unilaterally. Didn't even consult the company on pricing."

Her nails dug into her palms.

Julian didn't spare her a glance.

"Budget isn't an issue." He locked eyes with William. "Since when does Horizon pinch pennies?"

"Have you lost your mind?" William slammed the table. "We're not funding this fiasco!"

"Fiasco?" Julian's laugh was razor-sharp. "Every person here knows the value of a Strauss interview."

As father and son squared off, Evelyn suddenly chuckled.

"Mr. Yearwood just said he wouldn't do this even if we paid them?"

A vein throbbed at William's temple. "I stand by that. Unlike you—"

"Enough." Julian abruptly grasped Evelyn's hand. "If there's blame, it's mine to bear."

Melissa's pen clattered to the floor.

Married?

Gasps rippled through the executives.

William burst into laughter. "Spare the act! I checked—you're not even legally wed!"

Evelyn felt the warmth vanish from Julian's grip.

"Julian." She gently withdrew her hand. "I can handle this myself."

He stood frozen.

He should've known.

She never needed his protection.

"Fine." His voice turned hoarse. "I'll stay out of it."

Melissa's glare at Evelyn could've melted steel.

What gave this woman such power?

"Review the agreement." Julian closed his eyes wearily.

Only the rustle of turning pages filled the room.

Every person present understood—

This battle had just begun.
###Chapter 207: Humiliated Again! We Only Want Evelyn

The secretary projected the agreement sent by Lance onto the large screen in the conference room.

William Yearwood clutched the printed copy, his knuckles turning white.

Melissa Lee stared at the screen, scanning each line of the contract with laser focus.

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Impossible..." she muttered under her breath. "How could it be missing..."

The other executives exchanged uneasy glances, some already wiping sweat from their brows.

The agreement was meticulously formatted, every clause clearly outlined—except for the most critical detail: the interview fee.

"Have we triple-checked Lance's contact information?" William suddenly demanded, his voice tight.

The secretary hastily handed over a phone. "Verified three times already."

Melissa snatched it and cross-referenced the number with the one in her own contacts.

Her face grew paler by the second.

"Call him," William ordered. "Now. Get this clarified immediately."

Julian Ashford took the phone, pressed dial, and activated the speaker.

"Hello?" Lance's lazy drawl came through.

"Mr. Yeager, this is Julian Ashford from Horizon Media. Regarding the agreement—"

"What? Not enough terms for you?" Lance scoffed. "Want me to add one where you pay two million dollars for the interview?"

William shot to his feet and grabbed the phone. "Mr. Yeager! This is William Yearwood, Chairman of Horizon—"

"Don't care who you are." Lance cut him off. "One condition: Evelyn Sinclair or nothing."

The line went dead with a decisive click.

Silence swallowed the conference room.

Evelyn lightly tapped the table. "In that case, my resignation is already submitted to HR."

She turned to Melissa. "Please expedite the approval, Ms. Lee."

Melissa's face drained of all color.
###Chapter 208: Sorry, I'm Going Home for My Maternity Leave

The conference room fell dead silent.

Evelyn's words exploded like a bomb, stunning everyone present.

Not only had she secured the interview with Winston Strauss, but she'd done it without spending a single cent. This surpassed all expectations.

But the most shocking part was her casual mention of "resigning."

The executives exchanged uneasy glances, their faces etched with regret and embarrassment.

William Yearwood was the first to recover. He forced a smile. "Evelyn, we didn't have all the facts earlier—"

"You made conclusions without knowing the facts?" Evelyn chuckled. "So this is how Horizon Media's leadership operates."

Her words cut like knives.

"Since I'm leaving today, I might as well speak my mind." Her gaze swept across the room. "With Winston Strauss's interview in hand, finding a new employer shouldn't be difficult."

"Wait!" William shot to his feet. "Whoever spoke out of turn earlier—apologize to Evelyn now!"

A reluctant executive stood. "We're sorry for misunderstanding the situation—"

"Save it." Evelyn cut him off. "I'll take responsibility for my own decisions."

She turned to leave but paused beside Melissa Lee.

"Oh, and thank you, Director Lee. If not for your mocking phone call to Lance Yeager, he wouldn't have been so offended that he gave me the rights for free."

The room erupted.

"What phone call?" William demanded, glaring at Melissa.

Melissa paled. "I—I didn't know it was really Lance Yeager..."

Evelyn reached the door as William called after her. "Evelyn, please reconsider!"

"No need." She didn't look back. "I'm going home for my maternity leave."

An eerie silence descended.

Julian Ashford stood to leave, but William stopped him. "Julian, talk some sense into her."

"Why should I?" Julian's voice dripped with sarcasm. "No one stopped you from forcing her out earlier."

The tension between father and son thickened.

"That's a free interview with Winston Strauss!" William slammed the table.

"Now you realize its value?" Julian mocked. "Weren't you just calling it worthless?"

His icy gaze swept the room. "A bunch of spineless cowards."

No one dared respond.

William turned his fury on the others. "Mind your own business from now on!"

He snapped at Melissa. "I don't care how you do it—get that interview back!"

Melissa stumbled out, colleagues' whispers haunting her:

"Melissa really shot herself in the foot this time..."

"Only got her position because of her father..."

"Evelyn may be arrogant, but she delivers results..."

Each word stabbed like a blade.

She hid in a corner, nails digging into her palms.

Then Julian's voice cut through her thoughts:

"Evelyn Sinclair doesn't need men. Her talent speaks for itself."
###Chapter 209: The Secret Recording

"I'm sorry, Julian." Evelyn lowered her lashes, her voice feather-soft.

Julian studied her face for a long moment before stepping forward, trapping her against the wall.

"I know you have your reasons," he said quietly. "But Evelyn, don't go back down that path."

She turned her head away from his burning gaze.

The child in her womb had already made the choice for her.

Julian watched her before finally withdrawing the longing in his eyes. "Will you continue with Winston's interview?"

"Not sure." She pressed her lips together. "But Lance promised if I withdraw, Winston won't grant interviews to other media."

Julian gave a bitter smile. "That's your charm at work."

He knew Alexander's influence had secured Winston's cooperation. But getting Lance to make such a promise? That was purely Evelyn's doing.

Jealousy coiled like a venomous snake in his chest. Alexander could meddle freely in her affairs while he remained a powerless spectator.

That one mistake had already bound Evelyn and Alexander in a marriage of convenience. Every interaction between them diminished his hopes further.

To Melissa Lee, the conversation took on a very different meaning.

So Evelyn had seduced Lance to secure the interview!

And extracted such a promise.

"My only mistake was playing fair!" Melissa clenched her fists. "In pedigree and talent, how am I inferior? Why must she trample over me?"

The thought took root and festered.

After today's meeting, even her staunchest supporters among the executives wavered. They only saw results—her humiliating defeat, Evelyn's "capabilities."

At this rate, she'd lose everything.

......

"Mr. Yeager, a journalist named Evelyn says she has an appointment with you."

Lance was heading out when he immediately retrieved a prepared gift.

"Show her in."

The door opened. Lance moved forward with the gift, only to see a heavily made-up stranger sashay in.

"Who are you?" Lance frowned.

"Mr. Yeager, I'm the Finance Department head at Horizon Media. Melissa Lee." She sidled closer with a sultry smile.

Her low-cut minidress and towering heels accentuated her legs. No man could resist such temptation—or so she believed.

Lance gave her a once-over.

Finance Department head? Evelyn's superior?

And impersonating Evelyn to get in?

"Are you out of your mind?" Lance sneered. "First accusing others of being imposters, now becoming one yourself?"

Melissa's smile froze.

She hadn't expected such blunt hostility.

"Mr. Yeager, there must be some misunderstanding," she forced out. "Evelyn said she couldn't complete the interview, so I assumed she'd sent someone else—"

"Think I'm deaf?" Lance cut in. "I took that call myself. Heard every word between you. Get out before I call security."

Melissa refused to back down.

Proud to a fault, she'd never debased herself for any man—except Julian.

"Mr. Yeager..." She suddenly lunged forward, wrapping her arms around his waist. "Give me a chance."

"Get off!" Lance shoved her away like she was contaminated, storming to the door. "Security! Drag this shameless woman out!"

His furious shouts echoed down the hallway: "Blind? This is what Evelyn looks like? This ugly? How dare you let this trash in! I demand a room change!"

Melissa stared at her impeccably made-up reflection in the restroom mirror, trembling.

Evelyn was beautiful, but she considered herself no less. Why did Julian and Lance treat Evelyn like treasure while dismissing her as dirt?

She bit her lip hard to stifle the sobs.

Thirty minutes later, composed enough to leave, she froze at the sight awaiting her at the corridor's end...

......

Sweat slicked Melissa's palms in the elevator.

Head down, she hurried out—only to collide with someone.

"Ah!" Her ankle twisted in the stilettos, nearly sending her sprawling.

Steadying hands caught her.

"Melissa?" Evelyn's voice turned her rigid.

Melissa righted herself with forced calm. "Shouldn't you be home resting, with your... condition?"

"Was my resignation approved?" Evelyn countered.

"Check yourself!" Melissa spat.

As if she'd approve it. The rejection had been issued long ago.

This was pure mockery.

Melissa stalked off.

Evelyn remained, slowly uncurling her palm—where a tiny camera taken from Melissa's person lay.

To miss something so crucial...

Whatever it captured must be explosive indeed.
###Chapter 210: Failed Threat, Humiliated Instead

Melissa Lee's fingers trembled slightly.

Her knuckles turned white as she gripped the steering wheel. Neon lights outside the car window blurred into streaks, mirroring her chaotic thoughts.

As a reporter for Horizon Media's financial department, she should have been accustomed to high-stakes situations. But only she knew how she'd gotten this position.

Her admission to Imperial Media University was secured through her father's connections. The graduate school spot was bought with family favors. Even this job was obtained by riding on the Ashford family's coattails.

Her phone screen lit up. Taking a deep breath, she sent out the blurry photo.

[Lance, guess what I captured?]

Three minutes later, her phone rang.

"What do you want?" Lance Yeager's voice was icy.

Melissa smirked. "Simple. I want Winston Strauss's exclusive interview."

A cold laugh came through the receiver.

"With just a blurry photo?"

"Of course not." Confidence dripped from her words. "The camera holds much more interesting footage."

After hanging up, she eagerly rummaged through her bag for the micro camera. It was Horizon Media's standard equipment, which she'd brought specifically to...

"It's gone?"

Her face drained of color.

The phone rang again.

"Miss Lee," Lance's mocking tone cut through. "I'm waiting in the hotel lobby with the agreement."

Melissa forced composure. "I'll be right there."

The receptionist handed her a familiar black device. "Is this your missing camera?"

She grabbed it like a lifeline, not bothering to check the contents.

The elevator ascended to the penthouse. Lance stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows, his backlit figure ominous.

"Did you bring it?"

Melissa raised the camera. "Everything's here."

Her fingers froze the moment she entered the password—

The storage was completely empty.

Lance leisurely tore the agreement to shreds. Paper snowflakes fluttered to the ground.

"Miss Lee," he leaned in menacingly, "next time you try blackmail, make sure your evidence still exists."

Melissa staggered back, knocking over a coffee table. The shattering glass mirrored her crumbling confidence.

"Impossible... I clearly..."

"You clearly what?" Lance picked up a glass shard, twirling it before her eyes. "Like this glass, some things can't be put back together once broken."

He turned and pressed the intercom. "Security. Escort her out."

Melissa stood dazed in the elevator until the mechanical voice announced the lobby.

The glass walls reflected her disheveled appearance. She finally noticed her smeared lipstick—the crooked red grin made her look like a pathetic clown.
###Chapter 211: The Public Choice

"What does a blurry photo prove?" Melissa Lee's face turned ashen, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She slammed the table and stood abruptly. "I saw Winston kiss you with my own eyes! Don't forget my profession, Lance. This photo alone is enough to ruin you both!"

Lance Yeager lounged lazily on the sofa, a mocking smirk playing on his lips.

"Since when is a friendly hug between brothers suspicious?" He twirled his phone carelessly. "Or is the esteemed journalist Melissa Lee throwing a tantrum because she couldn’t get her exclusive interview?"

Melissa's breath hitched.

"Go ahead. Publish it." Lance suddenly leaned forward, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Horizon Media, right? I wouldn’t mind wiping your entire company from this industry—"

He drew a finger across his throat.

A chill ran down Melissa's spine.

Lance was right.

Without solid evidence, she didn’t dare act recklessly.

She had seen it with her own eyes—Winston holding Lance by the waist, pressing a kiss to his forehead.

Yet all she had was this damned blurry photo of a casual shoulder touch!

Regret crashed over her like a tidal wave.

She cursed her own complacency for letting such a golden opportunity slip through her fingers.

"Melissa Lee." Lance narrowed his eyes. "I’ll remember you."

As security dragged her out again, her nails scraped against the carpet with a grating screech.

Once the threat was neutralized, Lance finally exhaled in relief.

The door across from him opened silently.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped in, her footsteps muffled by the plush carpet. She took the miniature camera Lance handed her without a word.

"Returned to its rightful owner."

The device Melissa had treasured was, in fact, a decoy Evelyn had swapped in.

Identical in appearance to Horizon’s standard equipment, Evelyn had gambled on Melissa not checking the serial number.

The moment Evelyn discovered the footage inside, she had immediately contacted Lance.

He had just ended Melissa’s call, his entire body numb with dread.

"My boss has footage of you and Winston, but I have it now," Evelyn had said rapidly. "I’ll leave a blank device at reception. You must stop her from checking the contents."

The plan had unfolded seamlessly.

Even Lance had to admire her decisiveness.

"Alexander Kingsley is one lucky man," Lance mused suddenly.

Evelyn arched a brow.

"Beautiful, brilliant, unshakable under pressure." Lance propped his chin on his hand. "What did he do to deserve you carrying his child?"

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "Unless… the child isn’t his?"

Evelyn smiled without answering.

"I see." Lance nodded slowly. "A mutually beneficial arrangement. But once the baby’s born and DNA tests—"

"That’s his problem to handle," Evelyn said lightly. "Meanwhile, you—the world is far more accepting of same-sex relationships now. Why the fear of exposure?"

Lance’s smile froze.

After a long pause, he gave a bitter laugh. "It’s Winston who wants to go public."

Lately, Winston had been deliberately affectionate with him in public, as if making a statement.

"Winston’s family… is complicated." Lance clenched his fists. "Some of his conservative elders are pressuring him to marry and have heirs. If his orientation gets out—"

His voice trailed off.

"But Winston is powerful enough now," Evelyn cut in. "He doesn’t need his family’s approval to rule Wall Street."

Lance blinked, startled.

"Today, I happened to intercept the evidence." Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "What about tomorrow? How long can you rely on luck?"

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, dusk slowly enveloped the city. Lance studied their reflections in the glass, genuinely considering the possibility of coming out for the first time.
###Chapter 212: The Privileged Play Without Fear

"Besides, even if you resolve every crisis perfectly, secrets never stay buried forever. Your relationship with Winston will come to light eventually. Someone might even exploit it."

Evelyn spoke softly, "Instead of waiting for others to strike, take the initiative and end this threat permanently. This might be exactly what Winston wants."

Lance froze. After a long pause, he lowered his head, his voice barely audible. "Really? Is that what Winston thinks too?"

He fell silent again before murmuring, "Let me think about it. I'm... not ready yet."

Evelyn didn’t push further.

Lance handed her an elegant gift box. "These are skincare products specifically for pregnant women. If you like them, make Alexander buy more for you. Speaking of which, does he give you an allowance?"

Evelyn shook her head.

Lance stomped his foot in frustration. "Good heavens! What an absolute jerk! Listen to me, darling—never save men money. Take what you deserve!"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I prefer to keep my distance from him."

She knew all too well the agony of being trapped in that kind of entanglement. The deeper the ties, the harder the escape—and the more it would shatter her.

Once was enough.

Lance stared at her, stunned. "You're far more clear-headed than I imagined."

Evelyn had just bid Lance farewell when a bodyguard blocked her path.

"Miss Sinclair, Mr. Strauss wishes to see you."

She hesitated briefly before nodding.

Winston’s suite was far from Lance’s.

When she had led Simon on their earlier detour, she’d passed this area without realizing these two seemingly unrelated men were actually lovers.

Winston stood with his back to her by the floor-to-ceiling window. His voice carried clearly. "I heard you helped Lance resolve a problem."

Evelyn didn’t answer immediately.

Silence was safest until she understood his intentions.

After a few seconds, Winston chuckled and turned around. "You’re quite an intriguing woman, Miss Sinclair."

"How so?" she countered.

He gestured for her to sit. "Alexander’s interest in you seems to go beyond mere utility. So why are you still so cautious?"

The abrupt shift in topic made her frown.

"Look at Lance," Winston poured her a glass of water. "Because of my indulgence, he’s willful and confident—even makes decisions for me. I assumed those who are cherished all act so boldly."

Evelyn laughed.

"You said it yourself, Mr. Strauss—those who are cherished."

She had never received Alexander’s affection.

Between them, aside from the child in her womb, there was nothing left. That marriage certificate couldn’t change the fact that they were already over.

Winston raised an eyebrow. "Is that so?"

When he’d mentioned Evelyn to Alexander earlier, he’d caught the flicker of something unusual in that notoriously detached man’s eyes.

Even with their contract, Evelyn was the woman Alexander had personally chosen.

He’d assumed someone as sharp as her would recognize that distinction and act accordingly.

Yet she carried herself like a single mother, wary of every step.

Winston shook his head, amused. "For someone like Alexander, even the smallest favor would make others grovel with gratitude, no?"

Wasn’t that the truth?

Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint smile. "I used to think so too."

She had waited years for his mercy.

Only to realize he wouldn’t even grant her the chance to feel grateful.

By the time he finally offered scraps, she had already outgrown the need to bow for anyone’s meager affection...

"Give it to me," Winston suddenly extended his hand.

"What?"

He met her gaze directly. "The footage you took from Melissa Lee."

Evelyn froze—then everything clicked.

Those images had been staged for Melissa’s camera!

Lance had deliberately chosen a room far from Winston’s to avoid suspicion, yet Winston still monitored his every move.

He’d spotted Melissa first, then deliberately acted intimate with Lance—all to force Lance’s hand through her blackmail.

"Lance likes you," Winston said. "He’s always indulgent with beautiful people."

In short, an unapologetic aesthetics snob.

"Add your connection to Alexander, and he pities you enough to grant a free interview with me. So I decided to test it."

Test whether Lance would defy Melissa’s threats and choose to go public—for Evelyn’s sake.

Winston had even prepared to suppress the scandal.

He knew not to push too hard, but if Lance took this step, they might one day stand together openly.

"Yet you unraveled my scheme so swiftly, Miss Sinclair." Winston smiled.

Alexander’s eye for talent was as lethal as ever.

Precise with investments—even more so with women.

"Seems I overstepped," Evelyn said wryly.

Taking Melissa’s camera had been instinct.

The woman’s panic, the exposed equipment when she stumbled—Evelyn had sensed the trap immediately.

After viewing the footage, she’d devised the cleanest solution.

Only to realize it was all part of someone else’s design...

"I deleted the video in front of Lance," Evelyn said. "There’s nothing left in my possession."

"Oh, but there is." Winston leaned forward, exuding quiet pressure. "You’re not Melissa, Miss Sinclair. You’d never erase your only copy."

He couldn’t let this opportunity slip away.

Chances like this were rare.

Lance wasn’t a fool—too many coincidences would raise his suspicions.

Facing an opponent like Winston, Evelyn knew deception was futile.

Her lips curved. "Since you know I’m not Melissa, why not try taking it from me?"

Lance was her friend now.

She would never betray a friend’s trust.
###Chapter 213: Firing That Woman

Winston Strauss tapped his fingers lightly on the desk, his gaze fixed on Evelyn Sinclair.

"Miss Sinclair, what are you so worried about?" His lips curled into a faint smirk. "The video is only in your possession. If it leaks, Lance will suspect you first."

Evelyn met his eyes steadily.

"Mr. Strauss, I've made myself clear." Her voice remained calm. "I deleted the video in front of Lance. There are no backups. Lance is my friend—I would never betray him."

Winston's expression gradually hardened.

"You should know," he said slowly, "I agreed to this interview partly because Lance likes you, and partly out of respect for Alexander Kingsley. But the final decision is mine."

He stood, looking down at her.

"I can change my mind about signing anytime."

Evelyn let out a soft laugh.

"If you want to back out, I can't stop you." She smoothed her hair. "But you want to go public with your relationship, while I only want to respect my friend's wishes. Shouldn't you honor Lance's choice too?"

"Are you lecturing me?" Winston's eyes turned icy.

Evelyn gave a slight bow.

"Of course not."

She turned toward the door, her posture straight, without hesitation.

Winston suddenly chuckled.

"True," he muttered to himself. "Not even the Kingsley fortune could keep you. Why would a mere interview make you compromise your principles?"

Evelyn's hand rested on the doorknob.

"The interview stands," Winston said abruptly. "I don't resort to threats."

Evelyn glanced back, a faint smile on her lips.

"Mr. Strauss, you should let Lance decide for himself."

"What do you mean?" Winston narrowed his eyes.

Evelyn stepped closer, lowering her voice.

"Melissa Lee won't let this go. Even without proof, she'll find another way." A sharp glint flashed in her eyes. "And between her and me, there's still unfinished business."

Melissa Lee paled the moment she pushed open the CEO's office door.

William Yearwood sat at the head of the table, Julian Ashford beside him. Her father stood rigidly by the window.

"What the hell have you done?" Her father spun around and slapped her.

Melissa staggered back, clutching her cheek in shock.

"Dad—"

"Don't call me that!" he roared. "Winston Strauss demanded your termination! Do you know what his assistant said? That you tried to seduce him to steal the interview!"

Melissa trembled.

"That's not true—"

"Enough!" William cut in. "This isn't the time. Melissa, take a few days off. We'll discuss this after the Financial Summit."

Her father exhaled heavily.

Outside, he hissed under his breath, "Have you lost your mind? What will the Yearwoods think? What will Julian think?"

Tears spilled down Melissa's cheeks.

"It's all Evelyn's fault!" she seethed. "I had explosive footage of Winston and his assistant, but it vanished from my camera! She must have tampered with it!"

Her father's expression darkened.

"Julian and that reporter—"

"He only has eyes for Evelyn!" Melissa wiped her tears. "Don't worry, Dad. This time, I won't hold back."

Laughter filled the Financial Department's workspace.

"Evelyn is amazing! She got Winston Strauss to agree to a free interview!"

"Can you get his autograph for me? I adore him!"

"Our team's performance will top the charts again this month!"

Melissa stood outside the door, her nails digging into her palms.

She shoved it open.

The laughter died instantly.

Everyone scrambled back to their seats, the air turning tense.

"Too much free time?" Melissa sneered. "KPI all met?"

Her gaze, sharp as a blade, locked onto Evelyn.

"You. My office. Now."
###Chapter 214: Public Exposure

Evelyn Sinclair had just stepped into the office when Melissa Lee abruptly stood up.

"You stole the camera and deleted the footage!" she hissed through gritted teeth.

Evelyn calmly closed the door, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"I heard the department head is resigning?"

"Don't even think about it!" Melissa slammed her palm on the desk, causing water to splash from the teacup. "Evelyn, you won't beat me with these underhanded tricks!"

Her shrill voice pierced through the thin office glass.

Heads turned at the workstations outside.

"I never wanted to compete with you for anything," Evelyn said softly. "But you've targeted me at every turn, even spreading rumors about my relationship with Julian."

"Innocent?" Melissa suddenly burst into laughter. "Then whose bastard are you carrying?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly.

"My husband's last name is Kingsley. You should know that well. Meanwhile, you threw yourself at Winston Strauss's assistant just to steal my interview—"

"Shut up!" Melissa grabbed the mouse from her desk and hurled it.

Evelyn sidestepped the projectile.

The mouse hit the door, swinging it fully open.

The entire office fell silent.

Everyone had heard Melissa's scandal.

Evelyn walked slowly to the doorway, then turned back.

"Oh, and Mr. Strauss specifically requested that the agreement include a clause barring you from ever working at Horizon Media again. Otherwise..." She paused. "Horizon would face bankruptcy from the penalties."

Her words echoed clearly across the floor.

Melissa's face turned ashen. She snatched her bag and stormed out.

Within half an hour, the entire company was buzzing:

Melissa Lee had tried to seduce Winston Strauss's assistant to steal an interview and was fired from Horizon.

The financial department erupted in chaos.

"Is Evelyn getting promoted to department head?"

"She hasn't been here long."

"Melissa was an outsider too when she started."

"At least Evelyn actually knows what she's doing..."

In the break room, a few female colleagues whispered among themselves.

"I heard she never actually married the Crown Prince."

"The Ashfords don't acknowledge her."

"Winston only chose her for the interview because of her looks..."

Meanwhile, Julian Ashford stood in the chairman's office.

"The financial department head position will be decided by the board," William Yearwood said coldly. "It won't be Evelyn."

"And why was Melissa qualified?" Julian scoffed.

"You!" William slammed his hands on the desk. "If it weren't for what you did back then—"

Their heated argument leaked through the door.

At the Kingsley estate, Madeline Kingsley anxiously clutched Eleanor Kingsley's hand.

"With all these vile rumors spreading, why is Alexander still letting her work outside?"

Eleanor withdrew her hand impassively.

"I haven't heard anything."

"You—!" The old lady stamped her foot in frustration. "A Kingsley daughter-in-law, pregnant and interviewing men—what kind of disgrace is this!"
###Chapter 215: Forbidden Contact

Eleanor Kingsley massaged her temples.

This was the third complaint call from the matriarch this week.

"Mother, Alex has a stable career with good income," Eleanor explained patiently. "And Sophie's medical expenses—"

"Since when can't the Kingsleys afford medical bills?" The old woman interrupted sharply. "What does a girl need a career for? Look at yourself—haven't you lived comfortably?"

Eleanor's fingers stilled.

Through the window, the meticulously trimmed rose garden suddenly resembled gilded cages for songbirds.

"Mother," she said softly, "how do you know I enjoy this life?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"So I'm the villain now!" The matriarch slammed down the phone.

......

"Mrs. Laurel, am I wrong?" Madeline Kingsley studied her wrinkled reflection in the vanity mirror.

The maid hurried closer. "How could you be wrong, madam? It's dangerous for the young mistress to roam about in her condition."

She lowered her voice. "I heard she's meeting that foreign journalist alone tomorrow—"

"What?" The matriarch whirled around. "This is unacceptable!"

A triumphant gleam flashed in Mrs. Laurel's eyes. "Indeed. If word gets out—"

The old woman clenched her sandalwood comb.

The teeth dug into her palm, yet she felt no pain.

......

Evelyn Sinclair checked her watch.

Twenty minutes early, she waited in the hotel lobby.

Winston Strauss had a packed schedule—she needed every available slot to complete the interview.

"Young Mistress."

A stern, aged voice rang behind her.

Evelyn turned to find Madeline Kingsley advancing with a dozen unfamiliar bodyguards.

"Grandmother." She forced a smile. "What brings you here?"

The matriarch seized her wrist. "You're coming home!"

Evelyn winced at the sharp pain. "I'm working."

"Working?" The old woman sneered. "Consorting with disreputable men?"

A forceful yank sent Evelyn stumbling forward.

"Madam!" Mrs. Laurel feigned concern while giving a surreptitious push.

As Evelyn teetered on the edge of falling—

"Release her."

An arctic voice cut through the lobby from the entrance.
###Chapter 216: Time to Teach the Old Lady a Lesson

"Mr. Strauss." Evelyn Sinclair seized the moment while Madeline Kingsley was stunned, swiftly pulling her wrist back and subtly stepping closer to Winston Strauss.

She lowered her voice. "This is Madam Kingsley."

The elderly woman had been shaken by Winston's sharp reprimand and momentarily dazzled by his godlike beauty.

Now, she snapped back to reality, fury blazing in her eyes.

"Absolutely not!" Her voice rose sharply. "Evelyn, you're coming with me right now! What will people think if they see you with him? The Kingsley name will be tarnished!"

"Grandmother, this is work," Evelyn explained patiently. "I'm just conducting an interview with Mr. Strauss."

She never expected the most stubborn obstacle wouldn't be Alexander, but his grandmother.

"What kind of work is so urgent?" The old lady clutched her chest dramatically. "Have you no regard for gossip? Think of the family! Think of Alexander!"

She could already envision the whispers, the pointing fingers—the Kingsley reputation crumbling to dust.

"Grandmother, this interview is crucial," Evelyn said firmly. "Even Alexander has no objections."

"Of course he doesn't!" Madeline spat bitterly. "Just like last time—he said nothing then either, even helped you hide it from us—"

Winston smoothly intervened. "Madam, if you're concerned, you're welcome to supervise the entire interview."

This domineering woman was Alexander Kingsley's grandmother.

Discomfort twisted in Winston's gut.

If he were forced into a marriage of convenience, would his wife endure similar torment?

"No!" Madeline declared. "Evelyn is moving to the villa today. No more work!"

"Grandmother," Evelyn softened her tone. "This is a company assignment. Breaching the contract means penalties. I'll go to the villa, but let me finish the interview on the way, please?"

Seeing Evelyn yield, the old woman hesitated.

Mrs. Laurel stepped forward. "Madam, since the young mistress has agreed to go, why bother with—"

"Mrs. Laurel!" Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Are you stirring trouble?"

The maid recoiled. "Young mistress, I would never—"

"Daring to spread rumors right before me?" Evelyn smirked. "Perhaps Alexander should investigate you."

Beads of sweat formed on Mrs. Laurel's forehead.

"Enough," Madeline interjected. "Mrs. Laurel has served me for decades. Don't overthink it, Evelyn."

"The interview can happen during the trip," she added, shooting Winston a warning glare. "With me watching, you won't dare misbehave."

Winston remained silent.

Only respect for the Kingsley matriarch kept his temper in check.

Madeline initially wanted to ride together, but Mrs. Laurel stopped her. "Madam, your belongings are in the other car."

"Have the guards record everything," the maid whispered. "The driver is ours too."

The old woman nodded magnanimously. "Evelyn, I'll trust you this once."

"Apologies for the delay," Evelyn said regretfully.

"It's fine," Winston reassured. "Lance can cover for me."

They entered the vehicle.

Madeline and Mrs. Laurel followed closely behind.

"A few hours will suffice." Evelyn composed herself.

The driver and bodyguards were unfamiliar faces.

The old lady had gone to great lengths to isolate her in that remote mountain villa—a place Evelyn had never visited.

To Madeline, only the unborn child mattered.

Thirteen years of familial bonds, discarded without hesitation.

Evelyn opened her interview notes, a glint of steel in her eyes.

It was time... to teach the old woman a lesson.

......

The road out of the city was gridlocked.

Madeline fidgeted anxiously, demanding constant updates from the guards.

"I should've ridden with them!"

"How much longer?"

Mrs. Laurel soothed, "Soon, soon. The traffic will clear past the city limits..."

Finally, as they left the urban sprawl, the car accelerated.

Madeline relaxed slightly, already planning Evelyn's secluded prenatal care at the villa.

Then—

"CRASH!"

A truck swerved without warning, slamming into Evelyn's car with brutal force.

Both vehicles spun out—one flipping onto the roadside, the other crumpled in the middle of the road.

Madeline's car screeched to a halt.

Chaos erupted on the highway.

Amid Mrs. Laurel's screams, the old woman turned deathly pale.

"Evelyn!" She finally found her voice, trembling. "Evelyn's still in there! My great-grandchild—!"
###Chapter 217: Alexander Forces the Matriarch's Oath

A screech of tires shattered the silence over Kingsbury's Longping Avenue.

An out-of-control truck barreled into traffic like a rabid beast, triggering a chain reaction of collisions. The sickening crunch of twisting metal filled the air as shattered glass glittered like deadly diamonds under the sun.

The emergency dispatch reported two critically injured passengers—a man and woman—in a black sedan, with minor injuries to the front occupants. Strangely, the truck driver walked away without a scratch.

Madeline Kingsley swayed behind the police tape, her legs buckling.

She tried to rush forward, but her security detail blocked her path. "It's too dangerous, Madam!" The guard's voice boomed in her ears.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

When paramedics carried past a bloodied victim, the old woman's vision darkened. She collapsed onto the pavement, tears blurring her sight. "It's over..." Her lips trembled. "The baby... it's gone..."

The surgical wing hummed with unbearable tension.

The moment Alexander Kingsley appeared at the corridor's end, Eleanor Kingsley staggered toward him. "Alex!" She clutched his sleeve with desperate strength.

Mr. Kingsley pressed both hands against his son's chest. "Listen to us first—"

"Move." Alexander's voice could freeze hell.

Eleanor's tears fell like rain. "Your grandmother is devastated enough. Don't—"

"Devastated?" Alexander's lips curled into a mirthless smile. "She deserves worse."

Mr. Kingsley paled. "How dare you!"

"What should I say then?" Alexander's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Congratulate her for killing my child?"

The words struck like a sledgehammer, making Mr. Kingsley stumble back. His mouth opened, but no sound emerged.

Eleanor sobbed harder. "We're grieving too, but—"

"But what?" Alexander cut in. "But she's old, so murder gets a free pass?"

At the corridor's end, Madeline curled into herself on a bench like a chastised child. Spotting Alexander's approach, she shrank behind her husband.

The patriarch tried to stand tall, but his shoulders slumped under his grandson's glacial stare.

"Grandmother." Alexander stopped before her, his calm tone more terrifying than any shout. "Look at me."

Madeline raised tear-swollen eyes.

"You claimed everything was for Evelyn's sake." Each word fell like a hammer strike. "Are you satisfied now?"

Tears gushed down the old woman's cheeks. "I never meant—"

"Never meant?" Alexander's voice cracked like a whip. "You forced her into that car with perfect clarity!"

The hallway plunged into silence.

Alexander drew a steadying breath. "I want your word."

Madeline nodded frantically. "Anything—"

"If Evelyn survives," he locked onto her watery gaze, "you will never interfere in her life again."

Her lips quivered. "I promise—"

"Swear it." Alexander stepped closer, invading her space. "On Grandfather's health."

The old man's head jerked up, but he shut his eyes in resignation when he met his grandson's stare.

Madeline gasped between sobs. "I swear... on my husband's life... I'll never meddle again..."

Alexander's rigid shoulders eased slightly.

Then a roar echoed down the corridor: "Alexander Kingsley! Look what your family has done!"
###Chapter 218: The Second Accident

Julian Ashford grabbed Alexander Kingsley by the collar.

His eyes were bloodshot, his voice hoarse. "You swore to protect Evelyn. Is this how you keep your promise?"

Alexander didn't resist.

He let Julian yank him forward, his gaze icy.

The hospital hallway was dead silent.

Madeline Kingsley trembled in the corner.

"Enough!" Eleanor Kingsley rushed forward, tears streaming. "Evelyn's still in surgery. How long will you keep this up?"

Julian slowly released his grip.

He stared into Alexander's eyes, enunciating each word. "This is the second time."

Turning, he walked toward the operating room.

Alexander seized his shoulder. "What second time?"

Julian shook him off with a cold laugh. "Figure it out yourself."

"Tell me!" Alexander's voice held unprecedented urgency.

"Car accident." Julian spat the words and left without looking back.

Alexander stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.

The OR light still glowed.

Inside, Winston Strauss and Evelyn Sinclair fought for their lives.

Mr. Kingsley approached Madeline with a food container. "Mother, eat something."

She shook her head, her gaze drifting to Alexander.

Her grandson was staring at her with chilling intensity.

"Grandmother won't eat?" Alexander suddenly spoke.

Madeline's heart skipped.

"Bring her in," he commanded.

Soon, a middle-aged woman was escorted forward.

"Mrs. Laurel?" Madeline gasped.

The woman knelt, sobbing. "Madam, I've failed you..."

"What's happening?" Madeline's voice shook.

"Someone bribed my daughter-in-law to make me slander the young mistress..."

Madeline turned deathly pale.

She clutched Alexander's sleeve. "Investigate! Find who's targeting Evelyn!"

His eyes turned glacial.

"Only now you want answers?"

Madeline trembled. "I...I didn't know..."

"Didn't know?" Alexander sneered. "Then why did you put Evelyn in that car?"

The hallway air turned to ice.

Every eye locked on Madeline.

Her lips quivered, but no words came out.
###Chapter 219: The Night Truth Shattered

Madeline Kingsley trembled with agitation, but Alexander Kingsley didn't even lift an eyelid.

An investigation?

He'd already uncovered everything.

Bringing Mrs. Laurel today was merely to teach the old woman a lesson.

To show her what deserved belief and what didn't.

The operating room doors swung open abruptly.

"Doctor! How's Winston?" Lance Yeager's voice cracked with tears.

Alexander turned instantly, striding toward the surgical suite.

Julian Ashford had already pushed to the front.

"Doctor, how's the pregnant woman?"

The physician removed his mask calmly. "The surgery is complete, but she remains critical."

"What about the male victim?" Lance's voice rose in panic.

"His condition is more severe." The doctor scanned the crowd. "Where are the pregnant patient's relatives?"

"Here!" Madeline elbowed forward. "My daughter-in-law's baby—"

"Where's the husband?" the doctor interrupted.

"That would be me." Alexander stepped forward.

The physician led him to a side office.

Madeline stamped her foot. "Why can't this be discussed openly?"

"Mother, patience." Eleanor Kingsley restrained the older woman.

Moments later, Alexander emerged, expression unreadable.

"Everyone should leave," he stated flatly.

Eleanor understood immediately, guiding her husband to usher the elders away.

...

Evelyn Sinclair lay in the ICU, tubes snaking across her body.

Alexander stood before the glass partition, gaze heavy.

"My lord, we've found something." Nathan Carter approached quietly.

"Which matter?"

"The car accident."

Alexander finally turned. "Speak."

Nathan handed over a tablet. "Watch this surveillance footage first."

The screen showed an airport terminal.

Crowds flowed normally—until a white figure entered the frame.

Alexander's breath caught.

Evelyn.

The Evelyn from before.

He remembered that white dress.

Remembered her timidly asking if it looked pretty.

What had he replied?

The memory escaped him.

Perhaps just a glance. Perhaps a dismissive nod.

His fingers brushed the screen unconsciously.

Reaching for someone once within grasp, now impossibly distant.

Then—a car lunged forward.

Spearing straight toward Evelyn.

Alexander's heart stopped.

Evelyn scrambled aside.

The vehicle grazed her, sending her crashing onto the pavement.

Alexander immediately rewound the footage.

"That was intentional." His voice tightened. "How badly was she hurt? When did this happen?"

Nathan pointed to the timestamp.

The date struck Alexander like lightning.

He remembered now.

This was dawn on the day she left him.

"There's no hospital record." Nathan murmured. "She got up and ran into the terminal."

Agony lanced through Alexander's chest.

He'd seen those injuries later.

After she'd gone. In Sophie's hospital room.

What had he thought then?

Attributed them to her with the cruelest assumptions.

"My lord, recall that evening?" Nathan prompted. "You were at the club negotiating business... Isabella Winslow showed up..."
###Chapter 220: Is Her Pregnancy Real or Fake?

Alexander Kingsley's gaze darkened.

Memories of that night flooded back.

Isabella Winslow had taken the coat from the waiter and draped it over her own shoulders.

He'd coldly yanked it away.

Little did he know that moment had been secretly photographed, eventually landing in Evelyn Sinclair's hands as material for her news story...

It became damning evidence used against him in court.

"Lord Alex," Nathan Carter's voice tightened. "Our investigation found that Madam was also at the club that night."

Alexander's pupils constricted. "What did you say?"

Nathan silently pulled up a second surveillance clip.

"During initial evidence collection, I only reviewed footage after you left the club." Nathan's throat felt dry. "Madam actually... arrived at the entrance before you did. It seemed she was looking for you..."

"Why didn't she come in?" Alexander's voice turned razor-sharp.

Beads of sweat formed on Nathan's forehead. "Someone... bribed a waiter. The waiter told her... that you refused to see her."

The terrified waiter only admitted to taking money, avoiding specifics about what was said.

But whatever words had been used, they'd been cruel enough to make Evelyn turn away immediately.

Alexander's knuckles turned white. "Why did she go to the airport?"

Nathan's voice dropped lower. "That night... Sophie's condition became critical. Dr. Xu, her attending physician, was suddenly transferred abroad. Madam might have... come to you for help first..."

The words struck Alexander like a physical blow.

He suddenly remembered that day in the hospital ward.

When Isabella mentioned Grandfather's illness and the doctor sent overseas for treatment, Evelyn's face had gone deathly pale.

Every wound had been inflicted by his own hand.

"Keep digging," he rasped.

——

In the ICU, Alexander quietly drew the curtains.

His eyes lingered on the pale face lying motionless on the bed.

"Evelyn..."

His throat felt stuffed with cotton, rendering him speechless.

He slowly knelt beside the bed, pressing his forehead against her cold hand.

The medical tape securing her IV burned his eyes.

"I'm sorry..."

The whisper dissolved into the sterile hospital air.

——

Madeline Kingsley returned to her bedroom, her chest still tight with anger.

Mrs. Laurel's betrayal cut like a knife.

But Evelyn and the unborn child's fate hurt even more...

Her phone suddenly rang.

An incoming video call from an old friend.

The moment Madeline answered, her expression changed.

Isabella's face filled the screen!

"How dare you?" Madeline trembled with rage. "After everything, you have the audacity to show your face? You even hacked my friend's phone! You're behind what happened to Evelyn, aren't you?"

"Grandmother, wait!" Isabella frantically held up a medical report. "Look, I just got tested today—it's a boy!"

Madeline's finger froze over the end call button.

"I kept the baby safe overseas," Isabella sobbed. "I know I was wrong. I won't bother Alexander again. Just let me have this child..."

Seeing Madeline hesitate, she rushed on, "Mrs. Wilson can vouch for me! Once the baby's born, I'll send him straight to you!"

Madeline stared at the screen, her voice shaking:

"You... you're really still pregnant?"
###Chapter 221: She Wanted to Pull the Oxygen Tube

"Grandmother, I'm truly carrying the Kingsley heir." Isabella Winslow blinked her innocent doe eyes. "You can request a paternity test as soon as the baby is born."

Silence stretched for several seconds on the other end.

"Enough!" Madeline Kingsley's voice turned razor-sharp. "Evelyn just survived a car crash today, and you're already knocking on our door. Admit it—did you orchestrate the accident? How many people have you bribed? What kind of parents raise a viper like you?"

"Grandmother, I swear—"

The line went dead before Isabella could finish.

Madeline's trembling fingers blocked every contact from her old friend. She collapsed onto the bed, chest heaving.

It had to be Isabella. She'd corrupted Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Laurel, and now even her dearest confidante. That venomous woman had harmed Evelyn, endangered the Kingsley bloodline.

Tears soaked the pillow as the matriarch lay motionless.

Why such cruelty? Letting this monster carry a Kingsley child while Evelyn suffered...

What sin had their family committed to deserve this?

The hospital corridor felt like an icebox at midnight.

Lance Yeager sat frozen outside the ICU, elbows on knees, forehead pressed against clasped hands.

"Mr. Yeager, the company stock has hit the limit down. Should we proceed with your contingency plan?" A nervous executive whispered.

Lance lifted his head, voice raw. "Stabilize the shares at any cost. We wait for Winston to wake."

Though officially just an assistant, everyone knew Lance was the empire's true second-in-command.

News of Winston's accident had triggered instant market panic.

Without its titan, the conglomerate floundered. Lance shouldered the crushing burden alone.

He'd just ended hours of desperate calls. The Strauss relatives circled like vultures, eager to carve up the empire.

Lance mobilized every connection, exhausted every resource to survive this crisis.

He'd sworn to protect Winston's legacy—until the man opened his eyes.

Yet someone chose this moment to kick them while they were down.

"Mr. Yeager, what a surprise meeting here." Melissa Lee's stilettos clicked closer, her smile victorious.

"What do you want?" Lance's bloodshot eyes sharpened.

"Winston's condition seems dire. Rumor says his rivals are uniting against his companies." Melissa crouched to his eye level. "Imagine the scandal if your... relationship went public now."

Lance's fists clenched.

"Name your price." He forced calm.

The rules had changed. Before, they'd have silenced Melissa a hundred ways.

Now, even a whisper could collapse everything.

"Revoke my termination. Guarantee no further interference." She laid out terms. "We could've coexisted peacefully. Why crush an ant like me?"

Lance scoffed. "The Lee heiress obsessing over an editor position? Pathetic. What's your excuse for tormenting Evelyn?"

"You wouldn't understand!" Melissa's composure cracked. "If someone stole Winston from you, would you show mercy?"

"Winston chose me willingly. You?" Lance's gaze turned glacial. "No one owes you love."

"Spare me the moralizing!" Melissa jerked upright. "Let's see how high-and-mighty you act after tomorrow."

Lance darkened. "Is that a threat?"

"Why pretend now?" She looked down at him. "Is Evelyn Sinclair worth sacrificing Winston's empire?"

"You think this is about Evelyn?" Lance laughed coldly. "Maybe you simply crossed the wrong person."

Melissa wasn't listening. She straightened her blazer. "You have until 10 AM tomorrow. I trust you'll choose wisely."

That blurred embrace photo in her possession could destroy Winston if released now.

Surely Lance wouldn't stubbornly protect Evelyn...

Evelyn's eyes flew open in the dark hospital room.

Someone had been standing over her bed for a long time.

"Keep pretending to sleep, and I might just unplug your oxygen." Melissa's mocking voice slithered through the darkness.
###Chapter 222: Redemption in Sunlight

Evelyn Sinclair's lips trembled slightly, but no sound escaped.

The oxygen mask silenced all her words, leaving only the sharp rhythm of her breathing in the sterile hospital room.

Melissa Lee looked down at her with cold satisfaction, a smirk playing on her lips.

"Don't worry. I won't hurt you here." She leaned closer, tracing a finger along Evelyn's pale cheek. "Watching you suffer like this is far more satisfying than killing you outright."

Her gaze lingered on Evelyn's delicate features, envy flickering in her eyes.

"Such a shame the accident didn't ruin this pretty face." Melissa's voice dropped to a whisper. "But I heard you lost the baby? That saves me the trouble."

Evelyn's fingers twitched.

"Stop pretending." Melissa pulled a document from her bag. "I'm here for your signature."

She roughly grabbed Evelyn's hand, smearing lipstick on her fingertip.

"Winston Strauss's exclusive interview rights now belong to me."

The red fingerprint stained the paper like dried blood.

Melissa tucked the document away with a satisfied smile, checking her watch.

"Ten o'clock. Lance should be—"

"Exactly ten o'clock." Evelyn suddenly removed her oxygen mask, her voice startlingly clear.

Melissa whirled around.

Evelyn's eyes were sharp and alert, no trace of weakness in her posture.

"You—"

"Have you seen the news?" Evelyn's lips curved slightly.

Fumbling for her phone, Melissa's screen lit up with a breaking alert:

[Financial Titan Winston Strauss Comes Out, Aide Lance Yeager Confirms Decade-Long Romance]

Her hands shook as she scrolled to the next headline:

[Kingsley Group Emergency Funding Stabilizes Strauss's Stock Plunge]

"Impossible..." Melissa staggered back. "Alexander wouldn't—"

"Surprised?" Evelyn pushed herself upright. "Did you think you were the only one who could scheme?"

The door burst open.

Lance stood framed in the doorway, his expression dark as two police officers flanked him.

"Melissa Lee," he said with icy precision, "you're under arrest for attempted murder."

The officers seized her arms.

"It wasn't me!" Melissa thrashed wildly. "She set me up! Look at her—she's not even hurt!"

Lance held up his phone. "The recording we just made is more than enough evidence."

Turning to Evelyn, his expression softened. "He's awake."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

She'd known the tide was turning when she saw Lance pacing outside her room last night.

"He wants to see you." Lance's voice cracked. "He said... thank you for the advice."

Evelyn looked toward the window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass.

Just like the truth Lance had confessed outside the ICU, tears streaming down his face—

"His greatest wish was to hold my hand in broad daylight, without hiding."
###Chapter 223: All Miss Sinclair's Doing

Winston's condition was far worse than Evelyn's.

The surgery lasted eight grueling hours, and his recovery had been rocky. Now another critical emergency struck.

Lance trembled as he watched Winston being wheeled back into the OR. He still hadn't formulated an answer to Evelyn's earlier question.

But fifteen minutes later, he made his decision.

To hell with Melissa Lee!

To hell with society's expectations!

His parents were progressive. Winston's had passed years ago. Their families had plenty of heirs—no need for him to carry on any bloodline.

Those pushy relatives only wanted profitable marriages.

Why couldn't they live for themselves?

Red-eyed, Lance told Evelyn his choice.

She regarded him calmly. "If that's your decision, the Kingsley Group will support you."

......

Lance had considered Alexander.

What tormented him most was that Winston and Alexander were natural rivals.

Different nationalities. Opposing stances. Competing empires.

Their mutual admiration was just a facade between equals.

Lance knew if Alexander were in trouble, Winston wouldn't lift a finger.

But Evelyn assured him that if Winston's business faced crisis, Alexander would intervene.

Lance credited that promise to Evelyn.

With this safeguard, he could finally love openly.

Who cared about the media storm?

No more hiding.

Even if they lost everything... as long as they had each other...

......

"Congratulations on getting your wish."

Evelyn suddenly looked toward the door.

Lance spun around, pupils dilating.

"W-Winston?" His voice shook.

He'd just come from the ICU.

The man in that bed was still tubed up, barely out of danger last night. Multiple compound fractures. Severe brain trauma...

How was he standing here unharmed?

"Problem is," Winston leaned against the doorframe, smirking, "I wanted to keep pretending a few more days—see you worry over me. But the longer the act, the worse the beating I'd get later..."

"You—" Lance whirled toward Evelyn.

She was already removing her oxygen mask, sitting up effortlessly.

"The crash was fake?" Lance's voice wavered.

"The crash was real," Evelyn said gravely. "Someone is critically injured—just not us."

"What... the hell... happened..." Lance braced against the wall, pale.

......

"We switched cars mid-route," Winston locked the door behind him. "Only the driver and bodyguards were in that one."

He clasped Lance's shoulder. "It was a trap."

His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "All Miss Sinclair's idea."

Evelyn arched a brow.

Typical Winston, deflecting blame. He'd contributed plenty when planning this.

But she didn't expose him.

"Melissa planted a spy beside Madeline Kingsley. She wanted me dead, so she had Mrs. Laurel convince the old lady to send me on that vacation—then strike en route."
###Chapter 224: The Adoption Storm

"You knew all along?" Lance's pupils trembled.

"We got stuck in traffic that day. Winston and I exited the car in the driver's blind spot." Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly against the bed frame. "We weren't even at the scene when the accident happened."

Lance's throat moved.

He should have realized sooner.

No matter how forceful Madeline Kingsley was, Winston would never have cooperated without Evelyn's consent.

That roadside interview, sharing the same car...

Would Winston really cancel such an important meeting?

"You two..." Lance's chest tightened. "Planned this from the start?"

"We didn't anticipate the crash." Evelyn shook her head. "But the driver and bodyguards were Alexander's people."

Lance clutched his chest.

So Alexander Kingsley had known everything?

No wonder he'd confronted Madeline immediately upon arriving at the hospital.

"Why didn't you tell me?" Lance's voice shook.

Evelyn simply looked at him.

The answer was obvious.

Winston's performance had one purpose—to force Lance to go public with their relationship.

And as for her...

"How did Melissa Lee find out about your secret marriage?" Winston smoothly changed the subject. "Who else knows?"

"She's just a pawn." Evelyn's gaze turned icy.

Who else but Isabella Winslow?

......

On the third day, Madeline Kingsley finally received visiting permission.

She wrung her hands nervously. "I wanted to bring soup, but the kitchen is still being inspected..."

Evelyn listened in silence.

Madeline hesitated. "What did the doctors say?"

"They advised rest."

"Well..." Madeline's eyes darted around. "Have you and Alexander considered adoption?"

The air froze.

"Isabella's child?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

Madeline waved her hands frantically. "I refused! When she sent that message, I blocked the contact immediately—"

"I'm tired." Evelyn closed her eyes.

But Madeline persisted. "Feelings fade, but children are forever—"

"Grandmother." Alexander's voice could have frosted glass.

The Kingsley family stood at the doorway.

The Patriarch's face was stormy.

"Bring him in," Alexander commanded.

Police escorted a middle-aged man into the room.

Evelyn's pupils contracted sharply.
###Chapter 225: Blood for Blood

Evelyn Sinclair's gaze locked onto the middle-aged man's face. A strange sense of familiarity washed over her.

Memories sliced through the fog like lightning.

Her fingers clenched involuntarily.

"You know him, Evelyn?" Eleanor Kingsley grabbed her hand urgently.

Worry and fury swirled in the older woman's eyes.

Evelyn drew a deep breath.

The Kingsley family remained the one tie she couldn't sever.

"I've seen him before." Her voice came out hoarse. "At the airport months ago. He nearly ran me over."

Patriarch Kingsley slammed his palm on the table. "The same man?"

Understanding dawned on Evelyn instantly.

It was identical.

"Last time he drove a black van," she stated calmly.

Eleanor turned to Alexander Kingsley. "You confirmed this?"

Alexander's razor-sharp gaze swept the room before landing on Madeline Kingsley's ashen face.

"Let him speak for himself."

The middle-aged man trembled like a leaf. "I—I was paid—"

"Louder!" A police officer barked.

The driver flinched. "The Winslows! Their butler approached me—"

"The first time I couldn't bring myself to kill—"

"This time they threatened me—said they'd smuggle me abroad—"

"Which Winslow family?" The officer pressed.

"Winwell Ventures in Kingsbury!" The words tumbled out.

Madeline staggered, gripping the table edge.

Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"See clearly now, Grandmother?" Alexander's voice could freeze hell.

Madeline's lips quivered. "Had I known she was this vicious—"

"Remember your vow." Alexander took a menacing step forward. "No more interference."

Madeline nodded weakly.

The scales had finally fallen from her eyes.

Behind Isabella Winslow's angelic smile lurked a viper's heart.

"I... understand..."

Frost crystallized in Alexander's eyes.

This was the final warning.

Next time—

Mercy would not be an option.
###Chapter 226: Evelyn's Soaring Value

"Don't worry, you two." Patriarch Kingsley thumped his chest. "This household still answers to me. Evelyn, focus on your pregnancy. Do whatever you want from now on. If anyone dares interfere, they'll answer to me first!"

His blunt declaration hung heavily in the air. Even Madeline Kingsley, his wife of decades, flushed with discomfort.

Resentment coiled in her chest. Hadn't she already apologized? Why must everyone keep harping on it? Did they expect her to kneel and beg forgiveness?

Eleanor Kingsley noticed her mother-in-law's displeasure. "Mother was deceived by that ungrateful Mrs. Laurel," she interjected smoothly. "Evelyn needs rest. Let's give them space."

The family had celebrated the news of Evelyn's healthy pregnancy—shared by Alexander—while deliberately keeping it from the temperamental matriarch.

With Evelyn's condition still unnoticeable, they'd wait until her belly showed. By then, surely Madeline would come around...

Soon, only the couple remained in the hospital room.

Silence stretched between them until Alexander broke it. "Why did you go to the airport that night?"

Though he knew the answer, he needed to hear it from her lips.

Evelyn blinked. The memory felt like another lifetime.

That desperate rush to the airport—for Sophie's critical condition, for the specialist flying overseas. Now, looking back, all she'd gained was a near-fatal car crash.

No. She'd gained something far more precious: the courage to leave.

"It's nothing." She shrugged with practiced ease.

Alexander's chest tightened. His voice wavered. "You came to see me first?"

"Perhaps." Her tone could've discussed the weather. "Why?"

She dared ask why?

The past that once shattered her now weighed on him like stones. "I didn't know you'd come..." His voice roughened. "Evelyn, back then I—"

"It's over." She cut him off. "Truly."

He swallowed his apology.

"Yes. Over." Dropping to one knee, he clasped her hand. "Let's cherish now."

Fate had reunited them. He'd never let go again. That one-year agreement? A pretense he'd never honor.

Evelyn met his gaze steadily before withdrawing her hand. "I'm discharging next week. Thank you for cooperating."

Alexander's jaw clenched. Her polite distance always ignited his fury.

Suddenly he caged her against the bed, arms bracketing her body.

Evelyn instinctively shielded her abdomen but held his stormy stare without flinching.

This was the real Alexander—domineering, ruthless. The recent gentleness? A facade.

"Alexander." She spoke calmly as his lips hovered dangerously close. "Remember our agreement."

Their contract stipulated a marriage in name only for one year.

"You didn't refuse before." His breath scorched her skin.

Those restrained newlywed intimacies, though never as deep as before, had left him craving more.

"Gratitude." She met his burning gaze. "For protecting our child."

His knuckles whitened. The tempest in his eyes gradually stilled.

Abruptly he straightened, adjusting his collar with jerky motions. "Even after discharge, no work immediately. You want the pregnancy kept secret, don't you?"

Evelyn's calculated move served precisely that purpose—hiding her vulnerability from enemies.

"Returning to Horizon?" He feigned nonchalance.

"Naturally." Her response came swift. "I won't let others claim my achievements."

Alexander's heart sank further. Was her determination to return mere naivety—or something more calculated?

Two weeks later, Evelyn walked back into Horizon Media.

She brought an exclusive—Winston Strauss's first-ever video interview with a foreign outlet, completely unpaid. The scoop sent domestic and international media scrambling for collaborations overnight.

Evelyn's professional stock skyrocketed accordingly.

When she opened her neglected inbox, recruiter offers snowballed in—so many that her screen kept refreshing for two full minutes...
###Chapter 227: She Hadn't Considered Divorce Yet

Evelyn Sinclair opened her inbox to find dozens of unread emails neatly lined up. Offers from major media outlets worldwide flooded in. She skimmed through a few—all essentially the same.

"Does Winston Strauss's exclusive reprint rights belong to you?" The first email got straight to the point.

She arched a brow and clicked the second. The wording was more diplomatic, but the core demand remained focused on Winston.

The third came from a renowned financial outlet. The HR rep cautiously probed at the end: "We noticed your prior connection with Mr. Alexander Kingsley..."

Evelyn dialed the sender directly.

"Why is everyone asking about Winston?" she cut to the chase. "Securing an interview with Alexander is just as difficult."

A light chuckle came through the line. "Ms. Sinclair, Alexander Kingsley carries far greater risks. You of all people should know that."

The voice paused, turning cautious. "We've assessed your situation. Frankly, your ties to Alexander... work against you."

Evelyn hung up and deleted every email.

Inside the elevator at Horizon Media, employees fell silent the moment Evelyn stepped in. The whispers erupted behind her as soon as the doors closed.

"Melissa Lee hired hitmen..."

"Lost the baby too..."

"How dare she show her face here?"

Evelyn's reflection stared back from the Financial Department's glass doors. When she entered, the bustling office instantly quieted.

"Chief!" Her assistant was the first to rush over. "You're back!"

The others snapped out of their daze, crowding around with coffee, chairs, and discreetly wiped tears.

Julian Ashford's office door opened.

"Come in," he said softly, his gaze dropping to her flat stomach.

Evelyn followed, shutting the door behind her.

"Why return?" His question mirrored the emails.

"To repay the debt of gratitude." Her answer was impeccably neutral.

Julian suddenly grabbed her wrist. "The baby—"

"Winston's interview footage needs editing ASAP." She withdrew her hand, deftly changing the subject.

"Are you divorcing Alexander?" Julian pressed. "With the baby gone, is there any point keeping the agreement?"

Evelyn met his gaze. "One year. Black and white."

"Show me the contract." He stepped closer. "I'll get lawyers to—"

"Julian." Her voice sliced through. "This is personal."

The office plunged into silence. Julian's ragged breaths filled the space, his turbulent emotions barely contained.

"You can't let him go." The words seemed ripped from his teeth.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "You're overstepping."

Julian recoiled as if struck. He staggered back, knocking over a stack of files. Scattered papers mirrored the shattered decorum between them.

"Sorry..." He scrubbed a hand over his face. "I've been..."

"If my presence troubles you," Evelyn said calmly, "I can resign."

"No!" His head snapped up. "I just... don't want you repeating past mistakes."

Seeing his red-rimmed eyes, Evelyn softened. "I know my limits."

Julian exhaled heavily, as if drained. Leaning on the desk, he forced a smile. "The Financial Department is yours again. Winston's release is under your full control."

"Thank you."

As Evelyn turned to leave, she collided with a suited middle-aged man in the hallway. His stare held sheer terror.

She ignored it, returning to her team arranging afternoon tea. Colleagues raised their cups in unison.

"Welcome back, Chief!"

Amid the cheers, no one noticed the panicked man barging into William Yearwood's office.

"William!" His voice trembled. "I saw a ghost... That girl..."
###Chapter 228: The Banquet Invitation

William Yearwood frowned deeply.

Hugo Lee's face turned deathly pale.

"Are you possessed?" William set down his documents. "Any updates on Melissa's situation?"

Hugo had come to discuss his daughter's predicament.

But now, all he could see was that hauntingly familiar face.

"Worse than possession." He collapsed into a chair. "I just saw a young woman who looks exactly like Yurou!"

William immediately understood.

"You must mean Evelyn Sinclair."

"What?" Hugo shot to his feet. "That's Evelyn? She's a Sinclair... from that family..."

William averted his gaze. "Yes."

Hugo slammed his fist on the desk.

"Why wasn't I told this sooner?"

He paced furiously. "Weren't we told she had mental issues? That she wasn't a threat?"

"Calm down, Hugo." William tried to placate him. "She does have problems."

"Problems?" Hugo sneered. "She seemed perfectly lucid when she sent Melissa to prison!"

William said meaningfully, "She is Yurou and Qiuhao's daughter after all."

Lowering his voice, he added, "Fortunately, she doesn't remember the past. If she ever recalls..."

Hugo's expression darkened. "She couldn't possibly know anything. She was just a child back then."

"Who knows what her parents might have told her." William sighed. "Hugo, you're in grave danger."

Silence filled the office.

Hugo ground his teeth. "William, you've ruined me! If I'd known earlier, I could've prepared..."

William defended, "I was thinking of Julian. Who knew that girl would cause so much trouble?"

"And now?" Hugo mocked. "Just like her mother—delicate on the outside, ruthless underneath!"

Melissa remained in detention, with the Strauss family refusing to back down. A conviction would ruin his daughter's life.

The image of his weeping wife fueled Hugo's rage.

"Tell me you're not seriously considering letting her into the Ashford family?"

"Don't be absurd!" William waved dismissively. "It's just Julian being stubborn. Their father-son relationship is strained."

Hugo narrowed his eyes. "We're in this together. How do you plan to deal with this little pest?"

"Acting now would be too obvious." William cautioned. "Everyone knows her history with Melissa."

"And you have no grievances?" Hugo scoffed. "She's stealing your son away."

"Julian is manageable." William shrugged. "But you—taking action now is too risky."

Hugo understood William's game. With Melissa's scandal, the Ashfords wanted out of the alliance. Evelyn made a convenient scapegoat.

But he couldn't swallow this injustice.

"I hear Evelyn is quite sought after. How do you plan to keep her?" Hugo suddenly asked.

William caught his meaning. "Any suggestions?"

Julian's promotion request still sat on his desk. He knew Hugo wouldn't let their enemy rise—especially not a Sinclair.

......

All of Horizon Media awaited news of Evelyn's promotion.

When the transfer order arrived—

Evelyn was reassigned to the video subsidiary to establish a new financial team.

Everyone exchanged uneasy glances.

The video division was Hugo's territory. This wasn't a promotion—it was throwing a lamb to the wolves.

Evan Wells scaled back the celebration, inviting only Evelyn's closest colleagues.

"Why stay at Horizon?" Martha Nash asked bluntly.

Evelyn smiled. "Horizon gave me a job when I needed it most. I can't forget that kindness."

"But you've given them far more in return!" Evan protested angrily.

If Evelyn left, he intended to resign too.

Evelyn reassured, "I only did my job. Horizon provided the platform."

The mood remained somber.

No one dared ask about her relationship status. They only knew about her miscarriage and the mystery surrounding Alexander Kingsley.

"Why not start your own company?" Iris Cooper slurred after too many drinks. "We'd all follow you!"

Evelyn laughed. "And live on air?"

"We could get investors! Like Kings—"

Evelyn quickly covered her mouth.

"Kings what?" Everyone perked up.

"She said 'like kings of old.'" Evelyn joked. "Thank you, but I'm not considering entrepreneurship yet."

As the gathering ended, a drunken Iris leaned on Evelyn's shoulder.

Nathan Carter suddenly appeared. "Madam, Lord Alex is waiting for you up ahead."

"Madam?" Iris blinked blearily. "Oh! You're that—"

"I need to take my colleague home," Evelyn interrupted.

Nathan smiled. "Just give me the address. I'll ensure she gets there safely."

Evelyn hesitated.

"Don't worry, Madam. She's your friend," Nathan assured.

Evelyn finally relented. "Video call me when you arrive."

She approached the black sedan at the corner. Opening the door, she caught a faint whiff of alcohol.

Why was everyone drinking tonight?
###Chapter 229: That Moment, Just to Hold Her

The car window was half-open, letting in the cool night breeze.

Alexander Kingsley rested his forehead against his palm, fingers massaging his temple. At the sound of the car door opening, he lifted his gaze to Evelyn Sinclair.

The moment she frowned, he rolled down the window.

Fresh air rushed in, dispersing the heavy scent of alcohol.

"Business dinner," he explained tersely. "The client was a heavy drinker."

Evelyn remained silent, her eyes flickering to his slightly wrinkled collar—stained with liquor and the faintest trace of perfume.

The car started moving, city lights streaming past the window.

"Ethan Miller took most of the drinks for me," Alexander added, exhaustion lacing his voice.

His mind flashed to the flirtatious men and women at the dinner, their suggestive glances. What rumors had Winston Strauss and Lance Yeager spread to make people think he swung both ways?

"When did you stop hating me?" he asked abruptly.

Evelyn blinked.

"Never hated you," she answered plainly. "When I loved you, there was no room for hate. And when I stopped loving you, hate wasn’t worth the effort."

Alexander’s throat moved, pain flickering in his eyes.

When they arrived home, Evelyn paused at her bedroom door.

"You don’t have to sleep on the couch," she said softly.

Alexander stepped closer, his breath hot against her neck. "Don’t soften now. I’ll get the wrong idea."

He seized her wrist, pinning her against the door.

"Alexander!" She struggled. "One more move like this, and the contract is void."

The door suddenly swung open.

Evelyn fell backward, Alexander tumbling after her. In that split second, her mind conjured the worst possible outcome—

But the expected pain never came.

She opened her eyes to Alexander’s pale face. His arm braced her back firmly, his other hand planted on the floor, holding her suspended inches above the ground.

"Thank you," she whispered, voice trembling.

Alexander slowly lowered her. When he stood, he swayed slightly.

"Can you get up?" His tone was icy.

Evelyn nodded.

"Your stomach?"

"Fine."

He turned and left, the front door slamming shut behind him.

Downstairs, a bodyguard stubbed out his cigarette. "Lord Alex?"

Alexander yanked the car door open with his left hand. "Hospital."

As the car moved, he tested his right wrist. To catch her, he’d taken the full force of their fall with one arm.

He prayed it wasn’t broken.
###Chapter 230: Her Lonely Courage Ached His Heart

Night deepened, but Alexander Kingsley never returned.

Evelyn Sinclair leaned against the headboard, listening to the wind outside the window until she finally drifted into a fitful sleep near dawn.

When morning light filtered through the curtains, her first action was to push open the bedroom door.

The sofa bed lay perfectly smooth, without a single crease.

Her phone screen lit up, displaying Alexander's contact.

Her finger hovered over the call button, frozen in hesitation.

"Don't pity me..."

His low voice seemed to echo in her ears.

Evelyn finally closed the contacts list.

She dialed Iris Cooper's number instead, but it was still switched off.

Nathan Carter had promised to send Iris home last night, but there'd been no word since.

Ding—

The elevator's chime snapped her out of her thoughts.

Julian Ashford was leaning against the opposite doorframe. He straightened when he saw her.

"Reporting to Horizon Video today?" he asked.

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

"I'll drive you."

She instinctively wanted to refuse, but his resolute gaze gave her pause.

"Evelyn," Julian said softly, "I know my boundaries. Just to the company entrance, alright?"

The car moved steadily through morning traffic.

"Did you research the video company?" Julian asked, hands on the wheel.

"Hugo Lee is in charge," Evelyn replied, watching the scenery blur past. "Melissa Lee's father."

The air in the car seemed to freeze at the name.

"Not just him." Julian tapped the steering wheel. "Vincent Sullivan is there too. My father assigned him."

Evelyn turned to look at him.

"His son Xavier Stapleton also works there," Julian's voice darkened. "Be careful around that man."

The car slowed to a stop at a red light.

Julian turned to study her. "Contact me immediately if anything happens."

His gaze burned too intensely. Evelyn had to look away.

"I will," she murmured.

The car pulled up before Horizon Video's building.

"Evelyn." Julian stopped her again.

She bent to peer into the car.

"Stop carrying everything alone." His voice ached. "You've never been alone."

Evelyn froze for a second before turning toward the building.

The engine roared behind her like a stifled sigh.

The receptionist's eyes widened at the sight of her.

"Evelyn Sinclair?" She gave Evelyn a once-over. "Follow me."

Whispers trailed them through the office:

"New actress?"
"That aura is unreal..."
"Bet she's some big shot's daughter..."

The receptionist forced a smile. "Everyone's...enthusiastic..."

A stack of files suddenly slammed at Evelyn's feet.

"Is this the trash you call work?!" a shrill voice screeched. "Did we hire you to freeload?!"

Evelyn looked down at the scattered papers, then slowly raised her head.
###Chapter 231: Between a Rock and a Hard Place

The documents scattered across the floor made Evelyn Sinclair instinctively take half a step back.

A lanky young man crouched down in a fluster, clumsily gathering the papers. His messy hair framed dull eyes behind black-framed glasses, his lips cracked as if he hadn't drunk water for days.

Evelyn's gaze shifted away from him, only to meet another pair of intense eyes.

The man had a face that left a striking impression—not handsome, but so memorably unattractive. Evelyn quickly lowered her lashes, careful not to betray even a flicker of reaction.

"Who's this?" The unattractive man strode forward, his dress shoes crushing the freshly organized documents without hesitation.

The receptionist hurried to explain, "This is Evelyn Sinclair, transferred from headquarters—"

"I know you!" His voice boomed, silencing the entire floor. "Those fools at headquarters must be blind. You're a thousand times more beautiful than the rumors!"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

She was all too familiar with this kind of scene. Since childhood, the awestruck stares of strangers had followed her everywhere. But now, she sensed something more complex in their gazes—curiosity, speculation, even a hint of subtle hostility.

"I'm Xavier Stapleton, department manager." The man blocked the receptionist, eagerly closing the distance. "How about joining my team? We're short-staffed..."

Evelyn retreated subtly. "I should report to HR first."

The rest of the process went surprisingly smoothly. Xavier clung to her like an unwelcome shadow, yet his presence inexplicably tripled the efficiency of every department.

"Wait for my good news!" He thumped his chest confidently before turning and knocking over a colleague's coffee cup.

Alone in the hallway, Evelyn's phone buzzed.

"Evelyn, I overslept!" Iris Cooper's voice was thick with panic. "Are you okay over there?"

"Still waiting for my assignment," she replied softly.

"If anyone dares to bully you, tell me immediately! Headquarters won't stand for it!"

The call ended just as Xavier reappeared, beaming. "We're sharing a team!"

Evelyn frowned. "Sharing?"

"Just a temporary arrangement." He rubbed his hands together. "Come on, I'll introduce you to everyone."

In the farthest corner of the office, the black-framed glasses guy hunched over his keyboard. Xavier scoffed. "Country bumpkin. He'll be gone after probation."

As the workday ended, Evelyn's phone buzzed incessantly. A flood of dinner invitations poured in.

She left every message on read.

Her thumb hovered over a name in her contacts, hesitating. Should she make this call? Should she even entertain the thought?

Outside the window, dusk deepened—mirroring the uncertainty in her heart.
###Chapter 232: Wanting Her to Call

"Evelyn." Xavier Stapleton leaned against her workstation, tapping the desk. "I reserved a VIP room at Ocean Palace. Let me treat you to Australian lobster tonight."

Evelyn Sinclair didn't look up, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

Xavier perched on her desk, looming closer. "What? Don't believe me? It's a five-star restaurant with a minimum spend of five grand per person. Someone like you wouldn't normally—"

A phone rang.

Evelyn reached for it, but Xavier snatched it first.

"Who's this?" He deliberately raised his voice. "I'm Evelyn's boyfriend. Yeah, we're about to go on a date..."

Evelyn shot to her feet. Xavier dodged, continuing into the phone, "Ever heard of Ocean Palace? Want to come watch?"

"Xavier Stapleton!" she snapped.

He finally hung up, grinning as he handed back the phone. "Let's go. Don't let that ruin the mood."

"Get lost." She grabbed her bag and strode out.

Xavier chased her to the elevator. "Playing hard to get? I'm treating you and you act like this?"

The doors opened. Evelyn stepped in. Xavier grabbed for her arm—only to get whipped across the knuckles by her bag chain.

"Ah!" He yelped, then yelped again when the closing doors caught his head.

By the time he wrestled free, the hallway was empty.

Evelyn stared at the missed call from Ethan Miller, her temple throbbing.

The moment she answered, Ethan's sarcastic voice dripped through. "Having fun, Mrs. Kingsley?"

"State your business." Her tone was ice.

Ethan's voice suddenly sharpened. "Lord Alex has had a fever for three days! Shouldn't his wife care?"

Her fingers twitched.

"How is he—"

"Ask him yourself!" Ethan sneered. "Weren't you busy with seafood and some random guy?"

The line went dead.

After a hesitation, Evelyn dialed Alexander Kingsley's number.

The call rang endlessly before disconnecting.

8 PM. Water rushed in the sink.

Her phone lit up—Alexander's name flashing.

"Where are you?" His voice was rough.

"Home." She turned off the tap. "Ethan said you're sick?"

"Who was that man?" Alexander ignored her question.

"A coworker." She dried her hands. "He took my phone without—"

"Why didn't you call again?" he interrupted.

Evelyn froze.

A memory surfaced—three years ago at a Kingsley gala, him publicly reprimanding her for calling twice.

"Wasn't that your rule?" she said softly. "No second calls."

Silence swallowed the line.

Ocean Palace's lobby blazed with light yet held its breath.

Alexander sat alone on a leather sofa, staff standing rigid around him.

Ethan hurried over. "Lord Alex, we checked. She never came—"

"Ethan." Alexander lifted his gaze. "Is your skull just decorative?"
###Chapter 233: Undercurrents

At 3:17 AM, Evelyn Sinclair faintly heard the sound of a turning lock in her sleep.

Her lashes fluttered, but she didn’t open her eyes.

This was the seventh time.

From bolting upright in alarm at first to now not even bothering to roll over.

At dawn, she pushed open her bedroom door to find the living room spotless.

Evelyn stared at the steaming cup of black tea on the coffee table, her fingertips turning cold.

She quickly dialed Alexander Kingsley’s number.

“What is it?” His low voice on the other end was like a blade dipped in ice.

“Did you come back last night?”

The scratch of a pen on paper came through the receiver.

“Not coming back this week.” Alexander paused. “Be careful.”

The call lapsed into eerie silence.

Evelyn counted to ten heartbeats before softly calling, “Hello?”

“Speak.”

“N-never mind…”

Her ears burned as she hung up.

Why did she sound like a schoolgirl called out by her teacher?

On the 23rd floor of the financial tower, Evelyn stepped into the office with morning dew still clinging to her shoes.

The meeting notice in the department chat remained pinned at the top.

She reached into her bag for the USB drive—

Empty.

Desk, drawers, file racks… She searched every possible spot.

The last usage record showed yesterday afternoon.

Right when Xavier Stapleton had barged in and snatched her phone mid-call…

Evelyn pressed her lips together and posted a photo of the USB in the department chat.

[Has anyone seen my USB drive?]

Replies poured in, all variations of “Haven’t seen it.”

A private message suddenly popped up in the lower right corner.

[Evelyn, I know who took it]

The cursor blinked before another message followed:

[Roman Young. He’s a repeat offender.]

Evelyn glanced toward the corner.

A young man in black-framed glasses sat in the shadows, stiffening visibly under her gaze.

The department chat exploded.

Xavier: [Whoever stole it, step forward!]

Wendy West chimed in with sarcasm: [Did we turn into a den of thieves?]

“Enough.”

Evelyn’s quiet voice instantly silenced the entire office.

“It’s just an empty USB.”

She tapped the desk. “Meeting in thirty. Don’t waste time.”

At lunch, Wendy dragged her to the employee cafeteria.

“You’re too soft, Evelyn!” Wendy stabbed her salad with a fork. “Roman is just a—”

“Proof?”

Evelyn cut her off, noticing the figure in the corner shrink further.

“He’s about to get fired during probation!” Wendy raised her voice. “Last week he lost client files!”

The glass reflected Roman’s white-knuckled grip.

His food remained untouched.
###Chapter 234: Take Your Meds

Evelyn Sinclair toyed with the greens on her plate, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Doesn't seem like it."

She wasn't stupid. Roman Young's cowering demeanor either marked him as a scapegoat or an exceptional actor.

Either way, Xavier Stapleton was clearly up to no good.

Hugo Lee hadn't transferred her here for a vacation.

Xavier's flattery held traces of sincerity and calculation, but Evelyn couldn't be bothered to decipher it.

She knew one thing—she had to stay sharp.

The situation was obvious. Xavier had the entire department ganging up on Roman, the new hire.

Why would a meek probationary employee warrant such elaborate targeting?

Was this simple workplace bullying, or... was Roman, like her, the real target?

Evelyn found the puzzle intriguing.

"Evelyn, don't let his innocent act fool you. We've all been burned before—that's why we're warning you." Wendy West wore a look of earnest concern.

"Thanks for the heads-up." Evelyn set down her chopsticks. "But I prefer to see things for myself. Excuse me."

...

"See for herself? Does she think we're making this up?" Wendy fumed, immediately rounding up colleagues to ambush Roman after lunch.

"Roman, hand over Evelyn's hard drive. Do you even know who she is?"

Roman hung his head like a chastened child.

"Evelyn is the Crown Prince's woman—his most treasured. Touch her things, and you're out by tomorrow!"

Roman shuddered violently.

The Crown Prince's woman...

...

That afternoon, Evelyn ran into Roman outside the break room.

"E-Evelyn..." His voice trembled as he held out a hard drive. "I'm sorry... I found it on the floor..."

Evelyn took it, running her fingers lightly over the surface.

"Brand new?" she asked abruptly.

Roman paled. "I... I..."

Evelyn sighed. "My drive has a mark. Don't confess to things you didn't do."

She walked away, missing how Roman's fists clenched behind her.

...

Commotion erupted in the office.

Xavier stormed in, dragging Roman by the collar before slamming him onto Evelyn's desk.

Crash!

Glass shards scattered as blood streaked across the surface.

"Xavier!" Evelyn shot to her feet.

Xavier fished out a hard drive from Roman's pocket. "Evelyn, is this yours?"

"No." Evelyn coldly retrieved another drive from her drawer. "I found mine."

Xavier's face froze.

"Just a misunderstanding." He released Roman, then kicked him for good measure.

Roman silently gathered the broken pieces, blood dripping onto Evelyn's desk.

"Go to the hospital." She passed him a trash bin.

"Ow!" Xavier suddenly yelped. "I got cut! Look, Evelyn!"

Evelyn stared.

Was this man mentally deficient?

She briskly cleared her desk. "Xavier, take your meds if you're sick, or grab lunch if you're not. The hospital's always open."

"Now move. You're blocking my light."

Xavier stood rooted, his face cycling through shades of fury.

As the major shareholder's son, when had he ever been treated like this?

Yet he couldn't lay a finger on Evelyn.
###Chapter 235: The More You Ignore Him, The Harder He Tries

The office air turned glacial.

Xavier Stapleton slunk back to his cubicle like a whipped dog.

Within minutes, Evelyn's computer screen flickered with relentless notifications.

[Evelyn, I know hitting someone was wrong. But I only did it because I care about you. That Roman kid was taunting me with his hard drive—he had it coming!]

[You don't know how sneaky he is. He's screwed over multiple coworkers before. I was defending your honor!]

[I never lose my temper like this. You're the only one who makes me act this way...]

Evelyn didn't even blink.

Thirty minutes later, the digital bombardment resumed.

[I'm actually really easygoing. Just spoiled rotten growing up. My family's loaded—monthly allowance starts at six figures.]

[All my friends say I'm the most chivalrous guy they know. Ask anyone in the office if you don't believe me...]

Xavier cracked his door open a sliver.

Evelyn remained engrossed in her work, though the chat notifications clearly showed "Read."

Her indifference was absolute.

The spoiled heir clenched his fists. As the only son of the Stapleton fortune, he'd never met a woman who resisted his charms.

Looks didn't matter when you had wealth and connections. Even A-list actresses fawned over him—yet this nobody from a disgraced family dared play hard to get.

"Damn it!" He ground his teeth. "Think you're too good for me?"

Evelyn had every reason to be selective.

Her delicate features put celebrities to shame, her poise eclipsing every socialite he'd known.

The icier she became, the more Xavier obsessed.

He returned to his keyboard, groveling harder.

[I swear I'll never lay hands on anyone again.]

[Look, I even cut my finger. First injury for a woman!]

[We're having department drinks tonight at Ocean Palace. Give me a chance to apologize?]

Without waiting for reply, Xavier blasted the group chat:

[TONIGHT'S TEAM BUILDING AT OCEAN PALACE! WELCOME OUR NEW COLLEAGUES!]

The office erupted.

"No way! Xavier's treating us to Ocean Palace?"

"That's $200 per person minimum!"

"Boss is the GOAT! Other departments will die of envy!"

Xavier strutted out, basking in the adulation.

"Order whatever you want! When you roll with Xavier Stapleton, only the best!"

"I'm not going."

Two voices spoke simultaneously.

Evelyn declined without looking up. Roman shook his head silently.

Xavier's face darkened.

Roman's absence meant nothing—but Evelyn's...

"You have to come!" Xavier's voice cracked with desperation.

"Prior engagement." Evelyn's tone remained frosty. "Rain check."

The office fell deathly quiet.

Wendy West stomped her foot in frustration.

Everyone knew this lavish dinner hinged on Evelyn's attendance.

No Evelyn meant no extravagant feast.
###Chapter 236: Tonight's Date

"Evelyn, the team building is so important. Can't you reschedule your date?" Wendy West cooed, batting her lashes while glancing toward Xavier Stapleton.

Evelyn Sinclair kept organizing her desk files without looking up. "Sorry, it's already set."

"Then bring them along!" Wendy pressed, encouraged by Xavier's subtle nod. "The more, the merrier."

"Not a friend." Evelyn paused, sweeping her gaze across the office. "My husband."

The air turned to ice.

"You're... married?" Wendy's jaw dropped.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Headquarters knows. It's clearly stated on my employment forms."

Xavier's face cycled through several shades before settling on a strained smile. "Invite your husband then. Let's all get acquainted."

"He dislikes socializing." Evelyn grabbed her bag. "By the way, Manager Xavier already approved my half-hour leave."

Xavier blocked her path. "Team buildings happen maybe twice a year! You see your husband daily—missing one dinner won't kill you."

"We haven't shared a meal in weeks." Her tone remained even. "He's busy."

She wasn't lying. Alexander Kingsley's text had arrived at the perfect moment—two blunt words: 【Dinner tonight.】

The man never used questions. But Evelyn mentally added the unspoken mark. She could have refused. Until Xavier announced the team building, she'd been undecided.

"Using leave just for a date?" Xavier's voice dripped with envy.

"Prenatal checkup." The truth slipped out. Today's appointment at Alexander's private clinic had flexible timing.

Xavier's eyes gleamed like a cat spotting prey. "Let me drive you?"

Evelyn nearly laughed.

"Does Manager Xavier pamper all employees like this?" She emphasized the last two words, turning away before he could respond. "But I don't need such... consideration."

The office erupted the moment the door clicked shut.

"Married? Why's no one seen her husband?"
"Total lie! Just avoiding us."
"Right! 'Husband dislikes socializing'—who buys that?"

Wendy tugged Xavier's sleeve. "Boss, we can't cancel just because of her! How humiliating!"

"Proceed as planned!" He waved irritably. After the cheers faded, he locked his office and dialed Hugo Lee.

"Uncle Lee, is Evelyn actually married?"

"Paperwork says yes, but no spouse on record." Hugo's chuckle turned icy. "Probably the Crown Prince's smokescreen to pressure the Ashfords."

Xavier perked up. "So she's husband-free?"

"Your progress?" Hugo pivoted sharply.

"She's immune to charm or threats..." Xavier whined.

"Useless!" Hugo snapped. "Fail and you're replaced! Remember who holds your secrets!"

Hanging up, Xavier stormed out looking murderous. En route to Ocean Palace, he noticed an absence.

"Where's Roman?"

"He said seafood allergy—"

"Tell him to get here now or clear his desk tomorrow!"

......

The ultrasound technician smiled, handing over the scan. "Perfectly healthy."

Evelyn traced her flat stomach. "I worried about slow growth."

"Every pregnancy differs." The doctor gestured. "You'll feel more pronounced movement after six months."

"Doctor, my past..." Evelyn hesitated.

"Conceiving proves everything." The doctor patted her shoulder. "Relax. You're doing wonderfully."

At the hospital entrance, the Kingsley car waited. Lewis Bright opened the door respectfully. "Madam, Lord Alex is detained at a meeting. I'll take you to Ocean Palace."

"Ocean Palace?" Her brow arched.

"Ethan caused... an incident." Lewis suppressed a grin. "Lord Alex insisted on personally apologizing to the owner."

Evelyn instantly understood—terrorizing staff then dining for free. Classic Alexander.

The moment they entered Ocean Palace, familiar shouts erupted.

"Why can't we have the Ocean Room? Fetch the manager!" Xavier ranted at reception.

Wendy shrilled beside him: "Other rooms insult us!"

The Horizon Media group noticed Evelyn. Gasps spread.

Xavier's stare landed on Lewis, lips twisting. "This your husband?"

Lewis recoiled. "Sir, mind your words! I'm merely the chauffeur!"

No one believed him. The exchanged glances said it all—Evelyn's "husband" was an elderly servant?
###Chapter 237: Who's the Real Joke?

"Relax." Xavier Stapleton waved his hand with feigned generosity, his gaze lingering on Evelyn Sinclair. "Last time you made excuses about bringing your husband. What's one more person at dinner? I can afford it."

He suddenly leaned in close to Evelyn, lowering his voice just enough for everyone to hear. "Evelyn, though your husband... really isn't worthy of you, we all know the truth. He's just a shield, right?"

"I get it," Xavier breathed into Evelyn's ear as he pressed closer. "You could've just asked to eat at Ocean Palace instead of staging this 'accidental' meeting."

Evelyn's expression remained impassive.

Lewis Bright frowned deeply.

"Sir, please step back." Lewis shoved Xavier away.

"Old man's really committed to the act," Xavier sneered internally while forcing a smile. "Fine, fine. I know you're just doing your job as the 'butler.' I'll humor you tonight."

He slapped Lewis's shoulder with excessive force, making others wince. "I'm the most easygoing person!"

Before he could finish, Charles Candy came hurrying over.

"My sincerest apologies!" He rubbed his hands together obsequiously. "My staff failed to recognize our distinguished guests. The Ocean Hall is ready for your party."

Xavier immediately straightened his posture.

He recognized Charles from visiting Ocean Palace with his father. Assuming the manager had alerted the owner about their dispute, Xavier smirked triumphantly at Evelyn and extended his hand.

"About time. Your manager needs to learn some—"

His hand hung in midair.

Charles walked right past him, hesitating briefly between Evelyn and Lewis before decisively approaching Evelyn.

"Right this way, madam."

The Kingsley Group assistant had only mentioned Lord Alex hosting an important guest without specifying details. Charles wasn't taking any chances.

The Ocean Hall was their most exclusive private dining room.

When Lord Alex visited, only the best would suffice.

Under Xavier's stunned gaze, Evelyn and Lewis were ushered toward the hall like royalty.

"This..."

Xavier's face burned.

The moment Charles left, all staff followed in procession, leaving only one waiter who recited mechanically, "Sir, we have other private rooms available."

"We're leaving!" Xavier exploded. "Kingsbury has plenty of restaurants! Let's relocate our team building!"

Wendy West chimed in, "You'll regret offending our boss! This place will be shut down!"

The waiter bowed with a mocking smile.

Since when did small fries dare call themselves 'boss'?

Xavier stormed toward the entrance with his entourage.

A line of black-suited security blocked their path.

"Apologies. No passage allowed temporarily."

Xavier gaped. "What? This is your main entrance!"

A supervisor hurried over. "Our VIP is arriving. The front is secured. Please use the service exit."

"Service exit?" Xavier's voice cracked. "You expect me to—"

The supervisor's smile didn't reach his eyes. "If you refuse..."

He signaled the guards. "Escort them out."

A guard pressed his earpiece. "Copy that."

Turning to the supervisor, he reported, "His Lordship's arriving. Doesn't want to see riffraff."

With a wave, security personnel seized Xavier's group and dragged them toward the back.

They were dumped beside reeking garbage bins.

Sewage water pooled around their shoes.

Never in his life had Xavier suffered such humiliation.

"You'll beg for my forgiveness!" he shrieked hysterically.

The supervisor and guards advanced.

Xavier bolted faster than a startled rabbit.

He didn't dare look back to see who the VIP was.

Only when safely distant did he stop to assess his disheveled team. His face burned anew.

Someone was missing. "Where's Roman Young?"

Even his usual punching bag had vanished...

"Boss, should we still do team building?" Wendy panted.

"Damn right!" Xavier spat through clenched teeth. "Money opens doors anywhere!"

......

"Lord Alex, Xavier's been handled," a guard reported.

Alexander Kingsley nodded curtly. "Monitor him. Ban him from every reputable Kingsbury restaurant for a month."

Charles approached again. "Lord Alex, the young lady is already in Ocean Hall—"

Alexander raised a hand. "I'll go myself."

He could find the Ocean Hall blindfolded.

Beneath his black coat, his bandaged hand clenched slightly...
###Chapter 238: You Can Feed Me

Evelyn Sinclair tapped the menu lightly when the private dining room door swung open.

Alexander Kingsley strode in, his black trench coat accentuating his tall frame as cold air trailed behind him. He shut the door but made no move to remove his coat.

Evelyn looked up. His sharp features remained as stern as ever, though a subtle softness flickered in his eyes when they met hers.

"Ordered already?" His voice was deep.

"Waiting for you." She closed the menu.

A thousand words hovered on her tongue, yet none escaped. This strange familiarity left her torn between stepping closer and keeping her distance.

Alexander took the seat across from her. The wide round table created a gulf between them, blurring even his expression.

"Get what you like," he said flatly.

Evelyn quickly checked a few dishes and slid the menu toward him.

"No need. I ate." He didn’t take it.

Her fingers paused. "A quick bite before your meeting?"

"Hmm."

She picked up the menu again but hesitated.

"Alexander," she suddenly said, meeting his gaze. "Just say what you want from now on, okay?"

His eyes narrowed slightly. "Meaning?"

"If you’re hungry or want something, tell me directly." Her stare didn’t waver. "I’ll do it if I can. If I can’t, I’ll say so."

His Adam’s apple bobbed.

"I don’t like rejection," he replied, voice cooling. "So I won’t ask anything of you."

"Like right now," Evelyn tapped the menu, "you could just admit you actually want to eat."

Alexander leaned forward abruptly. "Then feed me?"

Her ears warmed. "Don’t you have hands?"

"Forget it." He reclined, tone icing over. "Order for yourself."

She snapped the menu shut. "Already did."

His brow furrowed. "That’s all? The doctor said you need more nutrients." His gaze drifted pointedly to her abdomen. "I won’t have people thinking the Kingsleys neglect you."

Evelyn instantly understood—this was about Xavier Stapleton.

The food arrived swiftly. Alexander never touched his chopsticks, simply watching her in silence. His heavy stare made each bite tasteless.

"Really not eating?" she tried again.

"Unless you feed me."

Evelyn set down her utensils. "Ethan mentioned your stomach’s been bothering you. Some congee?"

His fingers twitched. He hadn’t expected her to remember such details.

"Unnecessary." His voice softened marginally. "I have another meeting later. Lewis will drive you home after this."

"Not coming back all week?" She caught the implication.

"Hmm. Late hours might disturb your rest." The ghost of a smile touched his lips.

He needed his arm injury to heal completely before she discovered his hospital visit that night.
###Chapter 239: An Accidental Touch

Evelyn Sinclair finished her meal with deliberate calm, surprising even herself with how composed she remained.

"I'm done," she said softly, setting down her chopsticks. "Thank you."

Her gratitude was polite yet distant.

Alexander Kingsley's briefly relaxed brow furrowed again.

An invisible wall seemed to stand between them.

The closeness they once shared had been built by Evelyn herself.

Now that he was willing to lower his pride and reach out, she had retreated to a safe distance.

Every "thank you," every intentional withdrawal, reminded him how much had changed.

Even holding their marriage certificate, he couldn't shake his unease.

Especially...

Alexander forced himself to look away from her abdomen.

When caring for her, he could gaze freely. But now that jealousy had taken root, he had to restrain himself.

He clenched his jaw.

"I'll take you home," he said, changing his earlier decision to part ways.

As the car left the parking lot, Alexander subtly shifted closer to the window.

The habitual movement went unnoticed by Evelyn.

But her gaze lingered briefly on his coat, a flicker of confusion in her eyes.

Something about Alexander seemed... off today.

Lost in thought, she inched slightly toward him.

Her fingers rested tentatively on the seat between them.

The small gesture betrayed her hesitation.

Just as she debated whether to move closer—

"Screech—"

A harsh braking sound tore through the air.

"Ah!" Evelyn lurched forward, tumbling into Alexander.

He caught her instinctively.

Instantly, his face went pale.

The sharp pain of his splint being pressed sent a jolt through him.

Worse, he worried the rigid edge might hurt her.

"What happened?" he asked through gritted teeth, voice steady.

The driver sighed. "Lord Alex, someone's running a scam..."

A pedestrian had darted out at the turn. Only the driver's quick reflexes had avoided a collision.

"Who is it?"

Bodyguards were already subduing the person outside.

Lewis Bright hurried over. "Lord Alex, is the young madam alright?"

Alexander withdrew his arm discreetly, waiting for the pain to subside.

Evelyn gasped. "Him?"

"Who?"

That single word made Alexander's expression darken.

"A colleague," Evelyn murmured. "Strange... was he waiting out here?"

"What colleague?" Alexander's voice turned icy.

Up ahead, the bodyguards had pinned Roman Young to the ground.

The driver scoffed. "Even came prepared with injuries. Professional scam artist."

"No," Evelyn instinctively defended. "Those are from being beaten by coworkers earlier. He must need to talk to me about something..."

Lewis recognized the young man from Ocean Palace's lobby.

"He's from Horizon Media's video department. Should we question him?"

"I'll go." Evelyn moved to exit the car.

"Do you want everyone to know about us?" Alexander demanded coldly.

He knew he was overreacting.

But his pent-up emotions were a powder keg, ready to explode.

Evelyn froze.

"Roman's been ostracized in our department. There must be a reason he stopped the car," she explained calmly, though she couldn't fathom his motives either.

"Lewis will handle it," Alexander finally conceded.

Lewis returned shortly. "He claims he wasn't paying attention and didn't see the car..."
###Chapter 240: The Secret He Must Keep

Roman's behavior was highly unusual.

Through the car window, Evelyn saw him stagger deliberately toward the vehicle's hood.

She was about to tell the driver to stop when Alexander's icy voice cut through the tension. "Keep driving."

The atmosphere inside the car plummeted.

Evelyn noticed Alexander's pallor. Beads of sweat glistened at his temples.

"Are you unwell?" she asked softly.

Alexander ignored her, his gaze locked on Roman being dragged away by security. "He was testing us."

"Testing what?"

"Your identity." Alexander's lips curled. "A bullied intern suddenly stopping a luxury car? What's his game?"

Evelyn frowned.

She recalled Roman's recent mistreatment at Horizon Media - even basic supplies were withheld.

"His victim act is unconvincing." Alexander saw through the charade. "No one interns at Horizon by being naive. What's his real motive?"

The elevator doors slid shut.

Roman pressed himself against the wall, as if trying to disappear.

"You missed last night's department dinner," Evelyn observed.

Roman stiffened.

"F-family emergency..."

"Really?" Evelyn noted his trembling fingers. "Then why intercept my car downstairs?"

His head jerked up, panic flashing in his eyes.

"I didn't know it was yours—"

"You did." Evelyn remained calm. "You targeted me specifically."

The elevator dinged.

As the doors opened, Roman whispered urgently, "Miss Sinclair, watch out for Xavier—"

Laughter echoed from the hallway. Roman clamped his mouth shut and hurried out.

Evelyn studied his retreating figure thoughtfully.

Meanwhile, in Kingsley Group's executive office...

Alexander loosened his tie, his right hand shaking uncontrollably. Veins bulged at his temples as he gripped his wrist.

"Lord Alex, let's go to the hospital," his assistant urged.

"No." Alexander's voice was rough. "She mustn't know."

He couldn't let Evelyn see him like this.

Especially not when these injuries told their own damning story...
###Chapter 241: The Uninvited Guest

Roman's breathing grew noticeably quicker inside the elevator.

"It was... just a department dinner last night..." he stammered.

Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on the elevator doors, the mirrored surface clearly reflecting his flustered state. Despite his tall frame, he looked like a guilty child caught misbehaving.

"What did you eat?" Her tone was indifferent.

"Just... regular stir-fry..."

"Stir-fry?" Evelyn tilted her head slightly. "Wendy said you had hot pot."

The tips of Roman's ears turned crimson. "Y-yes, it was hot pot..."

The elevator's chime announcing their arrival saved him.

Evelyn stepped out first, hearing Roman exhale in relief behind her.

Around the corner, Wendy's voice carried sharply down the hallway.

"Last night was a disaster! Every restaurant turned us away. We ended up eating instant noodles at home..."

"Shh! Keep your voice down," another female colleague whispered. "Do you think it was Evelyn's sugar daddy?"

"Sugar daddy?" Wendy scoffed. "More like some tacky nouveau riche..."

"Talking about me?" Evelyn's voice cut in behind them.

Both women jumped.

"E-Evelyn..." Wendy paled.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "If you're curious about something, you can ask me directly."

Her soft-soled shoes made no sound as she walked.

Wendy forced a smile. "Evelyn, we're having another team building tonight. Will you join?"

"Didn't you already have one last night?" Evelyn countered.

Out of the corner of her eye, Roman was hastily retreating, his fleeing figure radiating panic.

"Last night... got canceled last minute," Wendy mumbled.

The office tension didn't ease until noon.

"Roman! Print these documents!" Wendy's shrill voice rang out.

Roman stood silently, then froze at the printer room entrance.

"The printer... it's broken," he reported quietly.

"Impossible!" Wendy stormed over, then shrieked, "The power cord's been cut!"

The office erupted.

"Who would do that?"
"That's so malicious!"
"What about the afternoon meeting?"

Wendy shoved a stack of files into Roman's arms. "Go print these outside! Now!"

Other colleagues quickly added to the pile.

"Mine too!"
"Take this one as well!"

Roman staggered under the weight, resembling a walking filing cabinet.

"Hurry up!" Wendy snapped.

Evelyn glanced up briefly before returning to her work.

The sabotaged printer was suspicious, but something else held her attention—

Thirty minutes after Roman left, an unfamiliar woman barged into the office with aggressive energy.
###Chapter 242: Clues Unraveled

"You've all worked hard."

A gentle female voice drifted in from the office doorway.

Wendy West sprang up from her workstation.

"Madam Zade!" She rushed forward in three quick strides. "What brings you here in person?"

A well-maintained woman stood at the entrance, her eyes radiating warmth. She smiled as she surveyed the office, a servant carrying food boxes behind her.

"I heard last night's team building was canceled, so I made some pastries to apologize."

Wendy dramatically clutched her chest. "Goodness, Madam Zade, you're too kind!"

"It's the least I can do." Madam Zade gestured for the servant to distribute the treats. "Xavier owes you all so much."

Xavier Stapleton arrived at the sound of his name, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Mom," he said in a hushed tone, "we agreed you wouldn't come."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Madam Zade's eyes before her smile returned. "I won't stay long. I don't want to interrupt your work."

"Madam Zade used to visit often," Wendy chimed in. "Everyone always loved seeing her."

"Exactly." Madam Zade gave her son a reproachful look. "You never minded before."

Xavier's expression grew uneasy. "I just don't want you exhausting yourself."

Madam Zade's smile faltered for a split second. "A mother's work is never done."

"Nothing compares to your homemade treats," Wendy said tactfully, "but you really didn't need to trouble yourself."

Xavier was clearly trying to prevent his mother's visit.

The odd behavior caught Evelyn Sinclair's attention.

"Mom, let me walk you out." Xavier began guiding his mother toward the exit.

Madam Zade suddenly turned back, her gaze sweeping past the crowd to land on Evelyn.

"That new colleague over there—"

"I'll introduce you another time," Xavier cut in.

Evelyn met Madam Zade's eyes and offered a polite smile.

"Evelyn," Wendy abruptly stepped between them, "want to try Madam Zade's pastries?"

"Thank you." Evelyn accepted the treat but set it aside, lost in thought.

She might have just stumbled upon an intriguing lead...

...

Roman Young hurried back to the office with an armful of documents.

As he passed the copy room, someone called his name.

"Roman."

Evelyn stood inside, beckoning him over.

He scrambled inside, nearly dropping his papers.

"Did you need something, Evelyn?"

She studied his face before handing him a cup of milk tea.

"I saved this for you."

"I—I couldn't possibly..." Roman fumbled to take it, almost spilling his documents.

Evelyn waited until he steadied himself. "Madam Zade brought these. I didn't want you to miss out."

Thud.

Roman's papers hit the floor.
###Chapter 243: Evelyn's Doing This to You

Roman Young crouched down in a fluster, documents scattering across the floor.

"Watch the milk tea!" Evelyn Sinclair swiftly steadied the wobbling cup. "Give it to me first."

Roman's face flushed red. "I'm so sorry, Evelyn. That was careless of me."

She shook her head, her gaze lingering thoughtfully on the printer.

As she stepped out of the office, dull thuds echoed from the fire exit.

"Who said you could touch my mother's things?" Xavier Stapleton's voice cut like glass.

Evelyn shoved the door open. "Xavier, stop!"

His kick landed hard on Roman's hand—still cradling the milk tea.

The drink splattered across the tiles.

"Are you insane?" Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Assaulting a colleague is illegal. Should I call the police?"

Xavier froze.

The usually reticent Evelyn had never confronted him like this.

"H-he wasn't doing his job properly," he stammered. "I just lost my temper..."

Since being turned away from every restaurant last night, he'd grown wary of her.

That shadowy figure in the photo—even Hugo Lee couldn't identify him.

"Get back to work!" Xavier barked at Roman.

Roman slowly rose, eyes fixed on the spilled tea.

"Go," Evelyn said softly. "Janitorial will handle this."

Lately, her heart softened too easily.

"Evelyn," Xavier caught up to her, "tonight's team building—"

"I'm working late." She didn't break stride. "The Winston Strauss interview can't wait."

"Everyone's exhausted..."

"I'll do it alone." Her heels clicked steadily. "It shouldn't inconvenience you much longer."

HR had shown her a stack of resumes today.

Xavier's knuckles whitened as he watched her leave.

The office emptied, leaving Evelyn alone.

Xavier had uncharacteristically brought Roman to the gathering.

Three rounds in, Zachary Laurier leaned forward. "Know who sabotaged the printer?"

Roman looked up blankly.

"Evelyn." Zachary dropped his voice. "She cut the cord when she heard you needed printouts."

"No way?" Wendy West feigned shock.

"Saw it myself." Zachary thumped the table for emphasis.
###Chapter 244: Really Planning to Stay with Him?

"What's her angle?" Wendy West gripped her chopsticks, knuckles turning white. "Targeting Roman for no reason?"

"Who knows," a colleague whispered. "Last time something went missing, she blamed Roman. Or maybe it's about that incident with the glasses?"

"Roman." Wendy suddenly raised her voice. "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Roman Young's fingers trembled around his bowl, lips pressed into a thin line.

"Roman." Xavier Stapleton set down his chopsticks with a metallic clink that silenced the private dining room. "Heard your probation period's almost up?"

The overhead lights glared off Roman's glasses as he slowly lifted his head to meet Xavier's mocking gaze.

"Yes."

"Want to stay?" Xavier tapped the tabletop.

The air turned to ice. Every movement stilled as a dozen pairs of eyes pinned Roman in place.

"Yes." The word scraped out between clenched teeth.

Xavier leaned forward, alcohol-laced breath hitting Roman's face. "Here's your chance. Go back to the office. Get close to Evelyn Sinclair."

Roman's pupils contracted.

"Copy the final cut of her Winston Strauss interview." Xavier studied the clear eyes behind those lenses, jealousy flashing in his own.

"Impossible!" Roman shot up, his chair screeching across the floor.

Xavier smirked. "Do it, or get out of Horizon. Your choice."

"Roman," Wendy waved her phone, "this is your last shot."

Roman's fists slowly unclenched. "After I get it?"

Wendy unlocked her screen. "Send it to this contact."

Evelyn massaged her stiff neck, the computer screen reflecting her exhausted face. She'd single-handedly edited the entire Winston Strauss interview.

With the new department launching soon, she needed to master every detail. Her fingers flew across the keyboard until a knock interrupted.

"Just leave the takeout by the—"

Her words died as Julian Ashford appeared in the doorway, takeout bag in hand, tie loosely draped around his neck.

"Passing by?" Evelyn arched a brow.

"Delivery guy got lost." Julian unpacked the containers. "I played navigator."

He settled across from her, scanning the document-covered desk.

"Settling in?"

"Only been a few days." Evelyn split her chopsticks, a grain of rice sticking to her lip.

Julian's throat moved as he quickly averted his gaze. "Eating so little?"

"Enough." She chewed carefully, cheeks puffing slightly.

Silence stretched between them until Julian spoke abruptly. "He's still contacting you?"

Her chopsticks paused at the container's edge. "Mm."

"Evelyn." Julian's voice deepened. "Are you really going to keep seeing him?"
###Chapter 245: He Clutched Her Hand Tightly

Julian Ashford's voice froze the air for a moment.

Evelyn Sinclair lowered her lashes, fingertips tracing the rim of her cup. "Julian, I think this is fine as it is."

"Fine?" His knuckles turned white. "You call this fine?"

"At least it's peaceful." She lifted her gaze, eyes calm as water.

"And how long will this peace last?" This time, Julian stared directly into her eyes.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "It'll end when it's time."

Julian's chest heaved violently. He thought he could endure this.

Hadn't he convinced himself to wait last time?

"So you still can't let him go?"

The words slipped out before he could stop them.

"It's not about letting go," Evelyn shook her head. "There are more important things."

"What could possibly tie you to the Kingsleys now?" Julian's voice strained. "You lost the baby, yet you stay. If not for him, then why?"

Evelyn's fingers curled involuntarily.

"Julian... the baby is still here."

His pupils contracted sharply.

"What did you say?"

"The accident that day... the baby survived." She didn't elaborate, but Julian's sharp mind would understand. "I'm still carrying our child."

Julian seized her shoulders.

"The baby's alive?" His voice trembled. "Say that again!"

Evelyn winced in pain.

She tried to pull away, but Julian held her firmly.

"So this was all an act? A trap for Melissa Lee to walk into?"

"You weren't injured at all? You and Winston weren't even in that car?"

"Something this huge, and you kept me in the dark."

His hands shook violently.

"Do you know how I felt when I thought you'd miscarried? I—"

"Julian, calm down." Evelyn struggled to raise a hand against his chest.

Instead, he grabbed her wrist and pressed it over his heart.

"Evelyn, can't you feel this? Alexander's heart matters, but mine doesn't?"

His grip threatened to crush her fingers.

"Julian..."

"Why didn't you tell me about the baby? Am I so untrustworthy now? Have I become useless in your eyes?"

"I—"

Bang!

The office door burst open.

Both turned simultaneously.

Roman Young adjusted his glasses nervously. "S-sorry... just grabbing a file... leaving now..."

He scrambled backward but froze abruptly in the hallway.

Footsteps approached rapidly.

Roman stumbled back inside, nearly knocking over a bookshelf by the door.

Evelyn and Julian looked toward the entrance.

Alexander Kingsley stood there.

His icy expression could frost glass, gaze locked on their intertwined hands.
###Chapter 246: Wanting to Tell Him the Truth

Evelyn Sinclair's wrist ached from Julian Ashford's iron grip.

She tried to pull away instinctively, but his fingers remained clamped like a vise.

"Julian..." Her voice trembled.

Sunlight streamed through the window, yet the office felt suddenly frigid.

Julian's knuckles turned white as he stared at her with burning intensity. "What are you afraid of? That he'll discard you?"

The words stabbed straight into Evelyn's heart.

Her pupils contracted as she stared at this unrecognizable man before her.

Was this still the gentle, refined mentor she once knew?

Alexander Kingsley stood at the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression dark as storm clouds.

He remained silent, his gaze growing colder by the second.

"Divorce would be perfect." Julian suddenly laughed, the sound sending chills down Evelyn's spine. "Our child deserves legitimacy."

Evelyn froze.

She whipped her head toward Alexander, whose eyes had turned to ice.

"Julian!" Her voice cracked with desperation. "Have you lost your mind?"

Julian ignored her, instead smirking at Alexander. "What's wrong, Mr. Kingsley? Can't even control your own wife?"

The air thickened with tension.

Roman Young shrank into the corner, wishing he could disappear.

"Evelyn." Alexander finally spoke, his voice dripping with frost. "Choose."

Her wrist had gone numb from pain.

She pleaded with Julian through tear-filled eyes. "Please..."

Julian abruptly released her.

Evelyn staggered back, catching herself on the desk's edge.

"Come here." Alexander commanded.

His gaze pinned her like a butterfly to a board.

Evelyn took a deep breath and stepped forward.

"Evelyn..." Julian's voice rasped behind her, barely recognizable.

Step two.

Step three.

Each movement felt like walking on knives.

"Evelyn..."

Julian called again, his voice hollow as a ghost's whisper.

She didn't look back.

Finally standing before Alexander, she tilted her head up to meet his stony profile.

"Move."

Alexander turned sharply.

Evelyn followed, flinching at the sound of shattering glass behind them.

The hallway brimmed with Kingsley Group employees.

Ethan Miller's disdainful stare burned into her.

The elevator descended in suffocating silence.

Watching the floor numbers blink, Evelyn suddenly spoke. "Alexander, actually..."

The words died on her lips.

How could she tell him that the child he'd long misunderstood was actually his own flesh and blood?
###Chapter 247: His "Punishment" Was Suffocating

"Enough." Alexander Kingsley cut off Evelyn Sinclair's explanation with a raised hand.
He strode to the sofa and sat down.

"Come here."

Evelyn's chest tightened at the sight of his spread legs.

"Must I repeat myself?" His gaze darkened when she didn't move. "Or should I 'invite' you myself?"

She finally understood—he'd been waiting for this moment.
Waiting for a justified reason to punish her.

"Alexander, if my mere existence is a mistake, then your anger is justified." All her unease evaporated.
The ice walls rebuilt themselves around her heart.

He didn't care about her feelings at all.

"Come. Here." He gritted his teeth.

Evelyn turned her face away.

"Don't want the child anymore?" His voice could freeze hell over.

She closed her eyes briefly.
When they reopened, only desolation remained.

No more resistance.

During his repeated pleas, during his rare apologies, the ice around her heart had thawed slightly.
Because she'd loved him once.
Because she'd waited.

Even after deciding to leave, his relentless pursuit had stirred something in her.
And then... she'd carried his child.
Their marriage had been a twist of fate.

Evelyn had wondered—if he could be a decent husband and father, she might have stayed.

But now...
His repentant words were laughable.

Alexander had promised to trust her.
Now he wouldn't even let her explain.

She stepped forward.
His hand shot out, yanking her wrist and forcing her to her knees.

"Know what to do?" Dark tempests churned in his eyes.

Evelyn stopped struggling.
For the child's sake.

She lowered her head...

...

Humiliation gave way to numbness in seconds.
She couldn't even feel his fingers threading through her hair.

When it ended, Evelyn stood.

"What were you going to say earlier?" Alexander's voice was lazy with satisfaction.

"Nothing."

Her tone was glacial.
Only after taking his fill did he bother asking?

Too late. She had nothing left to say.

"That unlucky colleague of yours—how should we handle him?" Alexander watched her stiff back.

Her entire body radiated coldness.
It extinguished any urge to be gentle.

But Alexander was done placating her.

He'd heard she was working late and brought dinner.
Only to find her with Julian Ashford.

Didn't matter who initiated it.
They'd been alone. Julian had pressed her hand to his chest.
They'd nearly embraced while discussing their child...

She'd hidden her pregnancy from him, yet told Julian.

How could he be magnanimous?
All he'd wanted was a small "compensation" before forgiving her.

Yet she acted like he was the offender.

"Unlucky colleague?" Evelyn turned, confusion flickering.

The reaction soothed Alexander slightly.
At least it proved the bespectacled nobody meant nothing.

But his expression remained icy. "Forgot there was someone else in that office?"

"Oh!" Realization struck. She inhaled sharply. "What did you do to him?"

Her concern reignited his irritation. "Afraid I killed him?" His face darkened.

Evelyn almost laughed.
His jealousy was absurd.

"He's a probationary employee who might not even pass evaluation. Spare him, Lord Alex." Sarcasm dripped from her words.

"Don't call me that." His voice turned dangerous.

From others, it was respect.
From her, mockery.

Evelyn sighed, too weary to argue. "I'm returning to the office. Release Roman Young."

She'd left in such haste, her computer was still on.

Alexander checked the time. "It's too late."

"I need to finish work. And deal with Roman."

Tonight's events had shaken the young man.
Yet Evelyn found his sudden appearance... intriguing.

...

Roman was unharmed.
But when brought before Evelyn, he was visibly rattled.

She smiled faintly. "Where's the courage you showed stopping my car?"

He stared blankly before blurting, "Why are you still working here?"

With Alexander Kingsley and Julian Ashford fighting over her—someone of her status shouldn't endure Horizon Media's hardships.

"And you?" Evelyn finished her files before countering, "Top university graduate. Why tolerate abuse here?"

Silence.

Her smile deepened.

"Guess we both have our reasons."

She stood to leave.

Roman suddenly called out, "Aren't you afraid I'll talk?"

Clearly she wanted her ties to Alexander secret.

"Will you?"

He shook his head vehemently.
Loose lips could be fatal.

His thoughts were transparent.

Evelyn chuckled. "Relax. I know you won't."

Roman nodded dumbly. "I won't tell."

"Then why return tonight?"

"To work on... a proposal." He fidgeted.

"What proposal?"

After a pause, comprehension dawned.

"This one." He lunged for his computer, fumbling with the power button. "It's slow—maybe I should just leave it running—"

"No rush." Evelyn sat back down.

Watching his nervous eagerness, she reconsidered: The department had misjudged him.
This was patience and calculation personified.

The proposal confirmed his talent.

"Xavier Stapleton doesn't know?"

Roman shook his head.

"Who were you submitting it to?"

"The board meeting... day after tomorrow." His voice trembled. "Someone from another department promised to deliver it."

"Trustworthy?"

Roman looked down. "No other options."

Evelyn nodded. "Then why come back tonight?"

His breath hitched.
Her clear gaze seemed to pierce through him.

"Just... wanted to check." He avoided her eyes.

She didn't press further, opening her mouth to speak when—

Ethan Miller burst in like a scorned spouse. "Mrs. Kingsley, do you know what time it is?"
###Chapter 248: The Lady's Affairs Are None of Your Concern

"Mrs. Kingsley, Lord Alex is extremely busy. As his wife, you should be more considerate instead of causing him trouble."

Ethan Miller couldn't help lecturing the moment they stepped out of Horizon Media's glass doors.

Evelyn Sinclair abruptly stopped and turned to glare at him.

Ethan looked baffled. "What?"

"Mr. Miller," Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. "My private matters with Alexander Kingsley are none of your business."

She spun on her heel and walked away, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Ethan stood frozen, his face alternating between pale and flushed.

Clenching his fists, he moved to follow her—only for Evelyn to suddenly glance back.

"Know your place," she said icily. "A mere assistant has no right meddling in his employer's personal affairs."

Ethan trembled with rage.

Evelyn added lightly, "And I am his rightful wife."

......

Fuming, Ethan escorted Evelyn home.

The moment he saw Alexander, he immediately whined, "Lord Alex, Mrs. Kingsley stayed out late chatting with colleagues today, so—"

"Ethan." Alexander cut him off, his gaze glacial. "Interfere in our marriage again, and you know what will happen."

Ethan looked as if he'd been struck by lightning.

Alexander slowly turned his head, a dangerous glint in his eyes. "Try me if you have a death wish."

Ethan nearly burst into tears on the spot.

After all his loyalty, Lord Alex was threatening him over that woman!

Worse, those bodyguards had reported every word like traitors!

So much for brotherhood.

This was outright bullying...

......

The next morning, an eerie tension hung over Horizon Media.

"Director Sinclair, emergency meeting. All mid-level managers must attend." The HR director intercepted her.

Evelyn frowned. "I wasn't notified."

"It was decided last minute." The director handed her a stack of documents. "These are the materials you need to prepare."

Evelyn skimmed through the files, her brow furrowing deeper.

"When's the meeting?"

"In thirty minutes."

Her stomach dropped.

Instinctively, she glanced at Roman Young's workstation—his computer was on, but his seat was empty.

With time running out, she had no choice but to tackle the immediate crisis.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard, finishing the materials at the last possible second.

When she stood, Roman's seat remained vacant.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the documents.

Even Hugo Lee had made a personal appearance for today's meeting.

This sudden ambush demanded her full attention.

As for Roman...

Everyone had their own battles to fight.
###Chapter 249: Evelyn Dodges the Trap

The moment Evelyn pushed open the conference room doors, she felt the weight of multiple piercing gazes.

Some were curious. Some were scrutinizing. And one was particularly venomous.

She lifted her eyes and met Hugo Lee's hate-filled stare.

She'd been closely following Melissa Lee's case. Though Winston had returned abroad, he kept in touch.

Lance had made it clear—they wouldn't let Melissa off the hook.

Hugo must have exhausted every resource, only to accept his daughter's imprisonment.

Melissa was his pride and joy, his greatest achievement.

As a father, how could he admit his daughter was at fault?

In his eyes, Evelyn was to blame for everything.

This woman who should've died long ago had not only resurfaced at Horizon but ruined Melissa's engagement and landed her in prison.

Given the chance, he'd make sure Evelyn joined her short-lived parents underground.

Too bad his pawns had proven utterly useless...

As everyone took their seats, the meeting began.

Evelyn scanned the room and spotted Xavier Stapleton's father, Vincent Sullivan, in the front row.

A flicker of recognition passed through her when she saw his face.

There was something oddly familiar about Vincent's eyes.

Noticing her gaze, Vincent gave her a polite nod.

Studying his features, Evelyn suddenly realized why he seemed familiar.

The meeting proceeded with orderly precision.

Horizon Video was jointly overseen by Hugo and Vincent, who sat at the head of the table.

The atmosphere was heavy with tension.

But Evelyn remained unfazed.

As a child, she'd often been brought to Kingsley Group meetings. While Alexander conducted business, she'd wait in the lounge with snacks.

Compared to Kingsley, Horizon's display was insignificant.

When her turn came, Evelyn systematically addressed each point from HR's provided outline.

Hugo's expression darkened with every word.

The materials HR gave her had intentional omissions...

Yet she flawlessly filled in every gap.

Hugo never expected Evelyn could reconstruct the missing content just by listening to others' reports.

He'd planned to attack her oversights but found no opening.

All he wanted was to humiliate her publicly.

Such a simple wish, yet it eluded him.

The memory of Melissa's haggard, deranged state during yesterday's prison visit made his fists clench.

Evelyn's presentation was concise, powerful, and impeccable.

She concluded smoothly and returned to her seat.

A brief silence fell before Vincent broke it.

"Well done. Next." His nod acknowledged her performance.

Xavier stood, shooting Evelyn a challenging look.

"I have a new proposal to present." He produced a document.

Evelyn's stomach dropped at the title.

As Xavier began reading, she rose discreetly.

All eyes turned to her, forcing Xavier to pause.

"Apologies, I forgot a file." She offered the excuse casually.

Just as Hugo bristled, Vincent granted permission. "Go ahead."

Xavier frowned at Evelyn's retreating figure.

"Continue," Vincent urged.

"Right." Xavier lowered his head to resume.

No one noticed his trembling grip on the proposal.

......

"Got some nerve, harassing Wendy?"

In the print room, a male employee kicked Roman hard in the ribs.

"You want jail time? Or will you kneel, kowtow to Wendy, and slap yourself a hundred times?"

Roman curled on the floor, clutching his stomach in pain.

He knew arguing was pointless.

That morning, he'd been heading to the meeting with his proposal when someone tripped him from behind—sending him crashing into Wendy.

She'd immediately screamed about assault.

Colleagues dragged him into the print room without question, beating him relentlessly.

They demanded groveling apologies and self-inflicted slaps.

None of that mattered to him.

Only the proposal did.

It represented all his effort, his only hope.

Now it was missing.

Had someone stolen it?

If humiliation meant freedom, he'd comply.

But the colleagues blocking the exit told him this wouldn't end easily.

"Thinking about your...proposal?" Zachary bent down with a malicious grin.

Roman's pupils contracted.

"Bet he wonders how we know about it," Wendy taunted. "Should we tell him Evelyn ratted him out?"

Roman's breath hitched.

"Idiot!" Wendy shrilled. "You were supposed to get Evelyn's interview footage for our boss, but you showed her your proposal? Thought she'd help? Dream on!"

Roman stayed silent on the floor.

"You don't know how things work at HQ," Zachary said faux-kindly. "Evelyn lost her baby in that crash and got demoted here. And you thought she was your ticket up?"

"She sold you out to suck up to our department," Wendy added. "She needs us now."

"Boss wanted Evelyn's interview to show her up, but you sided with her." Zachary delivered another kick. "Serves you right!"

Roman didn't react.

As Wendy prepared more insults, a knock interrupted.

"Open up. I need to print something for the meeting." Evelyn's voice was clear.

Panic erupted.

They yanked Roman up, hastily straightening his clothes.

"One word and you're dead," Zachary hissed.

Wendy opened the door with a simpering smile. "Evelyn, why print yourself? No assistants in the meeting?"

Evelyn's gaze swept the room, landing on Roman. "Your proposal's being discussed. Shouldn't you present it?"

Roman's head jerked up in disbelief.

Wendy and the others paled.

"Come with me," Evelyn told Roman.

He followed instantly.

"Evelyn!" Wendy stammered. "I thought you needed to print—"

"I did. But finding Roman was more urgent." Evelyn's tone was flat.

Wendy didn't dare stop them.

However much they schemed behind her back, Evelyn's status still intimidated them openly.

As they hurried toward the conference room, Evelyn paused. "Fix your appearance."

Roman quickly adjusted his clothes and hair.

"Xavier's already presented your proposal," Evelyn murmured. "Play it smart inside."

Roman blanched but nodded.

The proposal was just the prelude. His real goal was...

Taking a deep breath, he followed Evelyn in.

Xavier's face twisted at Roman's entrance, then settled into a venomous smirk.

Evelyn scanned the room—Vincent was gone.

Roman noticed too. Clutching his aching ribs, his vision darkened as he collapsed.

"Ah!" A colleague shrieked. "What's wrong with him?"

The meeting halted as they carried Roman to the lounge, debating an ambulance.

Xavier stepped forward. "He's from my department. I'll handle this. Resume the meeting."

He ushered everyone out—except Evelyn, who watched coldly.

When Roman came to, he struggled upright.

Xavier played uncharacteristically helpful. "Easy there. My family just called—my mother's unwell. My father left already..."

"Oh, he took my proposal with him. Said it was excellent."

Roman seized Xavier's collar. "That's my work!"

Xavier shrugged. "So? You gave it to Evelyn, who gave it to me."

He smirked at Evelyn. "You're so good to me. From now on, your word is law in our department."

Evelyn admitted she'd underestimated Xavier.

He wasn't just a spoiled heir—he had cunning too.

Stealing Roman's proposal, adapting swiftly, even driving a wedge between them.

"Evelyn would never betray me or ally with you!" Roman's chest heaved with rage.

As Kingsley Group's young madam, Evelyn had her reasons for staying at Horizon. Roman knew she'd never stoop to Xavier's level.

That Xavier and Wendy thought they could turn him against her was laughable.

They had no idea of Evelyn's background or influence.

That Kingsley's heir and Horizon's crown prince had clashed over her—yet she walked away unscathed.

"Xavier! How much more will you steal from me?" Roman roared.

Xavier shoved him back. "Steal from you? You're beneath me! Get lost before I make you."

He strutted toward the exit, pausing to leer at Evelyn. "You know how I feel—"

"Not interested," Evelyn cut in coldly. "Give up."

Public rejection before Roman made Xavier flush with humiliation. "Then stay out of my way!"

"Let me advise you too," Evelyn said icily. "What isn't yours will cost you doubly."

Xavier stormed out, slamming the door.

"Ungrateful bitch!" His curses faded down the hall. "Since you want it hard, don't blame me!"
###Chapter 250: A Flicker in the Darkness

Evelyn turned to see Roman curled at his workstation like a wounded animal.

His silence was deafening.

She swallowed her questions. This was private. She'd only helped because his proposal had been exceptional.

During the car incident, Roman had maintained his dignity despite desperation.

At 1 PM, Xavier announced with smug triumph that his proposal had been approved.

"Brilliant, boss!" Wendy clapped obsequiously.

"What's the project? Are we traveling?" someone asked eagerly.

"Intangible Cultural Heritage." Xavier's gaze lingered on Roman. "All hands on deck. Pack tonight—we leave tomorrow."

He singled out Roman. "Prove yourself. Your probation depends on this."

Roman kept his head down.

Muffled snickers filled the office.

Everyone knew. The proposal was Roman's work, stolen by Xavier.

Even Evelyn, the newcomer, understood now.

How many others pretended not to see?

Evelyn couldn't have leaked it. That meant his only friendly coworker was Xavier's spy.

Forced to execute his own stolen idea while fighting for his job.

Xavier's cruelty knew no bounds.

At day's end, only Evelyn and Roman remained.

Passing his desk, she paused inexplicably. His isolation tugged at her.

"Still working?"

"N-no..." He fumbled with papers.

"Walk out together?"

Despair clung to him. She feared leaving him alone.

Roman looked up, stunned.

"Come on." Evelyn sighed.

He scrambled up. "But your husband—"

The mere memory of Alexander's glare made him shudder.

"He's away." Her smile was thin.

Rarely did she lie. Her earlier claims about her marriage had been true.

She and Alexander were strangers sharing a home.

Past experience taught her—after intimacy, he always disappeared. Even during her love-struck days, she'd wondered if she was just a receptacle.

Her departure had briefly changed him.

Now...

Evelyn almost laughed.

One month into marriage, old patterns returned. A relationship sustained only by her "escape" was meaningless.

Fortunately, she'd never intended to return. Her temporary compromise was because...

Her gaze flickered to her abdomen.

Soon.

A few fleeting months. Once the baby arrived safely, she'd vanish completely.

Outside, Roman froze. "Evelyn—"

Julian's car idled at the curb, his profile obscured by cigarette smoke.

He seemed not to notice her.

"Let's go," Evelyn said.

Nathan rolled down the window, offering a polite smile.

Alexander hadn't come. Even the annoying Ethan was absent. Sending Nathan was overkill.

"Madam, your car." Nathan opened the door.

Evelyn glanced at Roman.

"Another vehicle for the gentleman." Nathan signaled a discreet sedan.

Roman looked to Evelyn helplessly.

"It's fine." She reassured him. "Prepare well. What's yours will return."

Roman stilled.

Her quiet words held inexplicable power. He nodded solemnly. "Thank you. I will."

Betrayal and humiliation had been his constant companions.

Evelyn was the first light in his darkness.

As their car pulled away, Evelyn noticed Julian's vehicle hadn't moved.

The interior was completely veiled in smoke.
###Chapter 251: Don't Make Me Force You

"You're always so gentle with your colleagues, Madam Evelyn." Nathan Carter's voice carried amusement, yet it made Evelyn Sinclair's fingertips tremble slightly.

She heard the unspoken implication.

Nathan's compliment was actually a veiled jab—she treated everyone with warmth except Alexander Kingsley, who received only her icy indifference.

Evelyn lowered her gaze without responding.

She hadn't even asked about Alexander's schedule tonight.

Nathan, like Ethan Miller, was one of Alexander's most loyal devotees. No matter how respectful they appeared on the surface, their underlying disdain for her never changed.

In their eyes, Lord Alex should remain aloof, treating her with contempt.

Now that he'd lowered himself to pursue her, she was the ungrateful one...

Evelyn closed her eyes briefly.

The words she'd said to Ethan couldn't be repeated to Nathan. This man was meticulous—she couldn't find fault in his actions.

Alexander wouldn't come himself, so he sent Nathan to torment her...

That faint guilt she'd felt evaporated instantly.

Had she begged him to send anyone?

A few bodyguards could have handled this. Instead, he dispatched his right-hand man.

This "generous gift" was more than she could bear.

"Lord Alex, Madam Evelyn has returned home safely." Nathan arrived at Kingsley Group just as Alexander finished a meeting and was having dinner.

Two simple dishes and soup. He ate with his left hand.

His right was in a splint.

No need for pretense here—only in front of Evelyn.

Nathan glanced at the injured hand and sighed inwardly.

Now he understood why Ethan always lost his temper.

Alexander hiding his injury was one thing, but if Evelyn cared even slightly, how could she not notice?

The warmth in her voice when speaking to colleagues today was something Nathan had rarely heard her use with Alexander...

Even he, not just Ethan, felt Alexander deserved better.

The Sinclair family had saved Alexander, true, but the Kingsleys had repaid that debt tenfold. If this was just about gratitude, why sacrifice himself?

Suppressing his frustration, Nathan still gave a detailed report on Evelyn's activities.

Finally, he hesitated. "Madam Evelyn... said nothing."

Alexander set down his chopsticks.

His gaze remained frosty.

"Do you know why I replaced Ethan?"

Nathan's back stiffened.

"I overstepped," he immediately conceded.

No matter his feelings, those words shouldn't have come from him.

"Demotion by one rank." Alexander wiped his mouth. "A light punishment."

Nathan exhaled in relief.

Rank could be regained—Alexander had been lenient.

But as he turned to leave, he couldn't help thinking: Alexander, always cold and unyielding, treated every crumb of kindness as a favor. Yet for Evelyn, he'd tear out his own heart.

And Evelyn?

Even during his coldest days, she remained the only woman he ever acknowledged.

What exactly was she holding against him?

Isabella Winslow visited often, but everyone knew there was nothing between them. Alexander's politeness stemmed only from her past aid to Kingsley Group...

Enough.

Nathan rubbed his temples.

Alexander had already disciplined him. He couldn't cross the line again.

3:00 AM.

Kingsbury slept.

Evelyn's bedroom door opened silently.

Alexander would never tell her he came to watch her sleep every night.

Tonight, a suitcase sat in the living room.

He'd known about her business trip for days, yet she hadn't mentioned it.

Just as Nathan said—she carried no thought of him in her heart.

Alexander's chest tightened.

No matter how often he told himself not to care, Julian Ashford's words echoed relentlessly in his mind.

That man still waited outside her office building.

He didn't want to lash out with cruel words again.

That had been his only outlet in the past.

Evelyn's departure severed that path completely.

The volcano inside him raged, with no way to extinguish it...

Evelyn stirred from deep sleep as weight settled behind her.

Dazed for seconds, she jolted awake.

She tried to move, but an iron grip held her down.

"Don't."

The hoarse voice was Alexander's.

Evelyn froze.

He held her too tightly.

The sensation against her lower back made her entire body stiffen.

Then his palm slid over her abdomen.

"When did this happen?"

He'd never asked.

When had things begun between her and Julian?

Half-asleep, it took Evelyn long moments to understand.

"You said..." She struggled to rise. "You said you wouldn't ask."

"I did. But you also promised to stay away from your senior." His grip tightened.

"Alexander! Let go!"

Evelyn didn't understand his sudden aggression.

She couldn't see the time but knew it was late.

"I have a business trip tomorrow—"

"Then behave." He forced her back down. "Don't make me force you."

Evelyn went still.

"You promised to trust me."

That vow during his attempts to win her back now seemed like a joke.

Alexander stayed silent for a long moment before suddenly seizing her wrist.

"Come here." His breath scorched her skin. "Pleasure me..."

Evelyn bit her lip.

This was the price.

Safe passage out the door required payment.

When it ended, she checked the time: 4:00 AM...
###Chapter 252: She Knew Her Place

Evelyn Sinclair rose quietly after only a brief rest.

Her movements were silent, but the moment her feet touched the floor, she heard rustling behind her.

Alexander Kingsley's hand slid across the sheets, catching only a trace of lingering warmth.

"Already?" His voice was thick with sleep.

Evelyn didn't answer, adjusting her clothes by the dim window light.

She knew better than anyone—every time Alexander forced himself on her, whatever fragile bond remained between them eroded further.

Fabric shifted in the darkness as Alexander pushed himself up.

"Turn on the light," he ordered.

Evelyn ignored him. "Go back to sleep," she said flatly.

An invisible wall stood between them.

Alexander didn't reach for the switch. He didn't want her seeing his bandaged hand—or the distance in her eyes.

"You—"

The sound of the door opening cut him off.

Evelyn paused in the doorway.

Alexander tilted his head up. "Stay away from other men. This... won't happen again."

He needed to prove something, but this was the only way he knew how.

Evelyn inhaled the crisp predawn air.

"Lord Alex, you never change."

"Don't call me that," he gritted out. "Talk properly."

"Don't worry." Moonlight caught the faint curve of her lips. "I'll honor our agreement."

Dark currents churned in Alexander's eyes.

"Remember your words," he said, voice dangerously low.

If she dared cross the line, he'd make her pay.

Roman Young's project proposal had been stolen outright by Xavier Stapleton.

Leveraging his status as a shareholder's son, Xavier pushed the project through without discussion.

Boarding the plane, Evelyn checked her seat number with icy detachment.

Xavier flashed her a smirk. "Let me help with your luggage, Evelyn."

He grabbed for her suitcase but missed.

"Oops!" Feigning a stumble, he lunged for Evelyn with groping hands.

A figure suddenly blocked his path.

Roman slammed Xavier to the floor.

"Sorry!" He kept his head down. "I need to switch seats with Evelyn. I get airsick..."

"You?" Xavier snarled through clenched teeth.

"I agree." Evelyn gave Roman a silent thank-you.

Xavier's face darkened. He pulled out his phone and texted Hugo Lee: [Is Evelyn still in contact with the Crown Prince?]

[No signs of it. Why?]

Xavier glanced at Roman shrinking into his seat. [Can we get rid of him soon?]

After a long pause, Hugo replied: [Handle it yourself during this trip...]

"Evelyn, help me out?" Wendy West batted her lashes.

Evelyn twirled a pen. "Sorry, I'm busy."

For three days, she'd refused all extra tasks.

Wendy's smile stiffened. "We're colleagues..."
###Chapter 253: All Her Tenderness Reserved for You

"I have three interviews scheduled for 3 PM." Evelyn Sinclair turned her laptop screen toward Wendy West. "Here's my calendar. You handle the new hires for our department, and I'll take care of your project proposal?"

With the project nearing completion, she needed to assemble her team quickly.

She and Xavier Stapleton held equal positions now—neither could order the other around.

Wendy's lips twisted. "With such a packed schedule, why bother coming on this business trip, Evelyn? Found the hotel view particularly inspiring?"

Who did this expense-account tourist think she was?

Evelyn's smile vanished. "Is this your opinion or Xavier's? If it's Xavier, tell him to address me directly. If it's you..." She paused. "Wendy, focus on your own affairs first."

The door slammed behind Wendy's furious exit.

"Boss, that woman refuses to leave her room," she reported through gritted teeth.

Xavier crushed his cigarette, eyes glinting dangerously.

"What about Roman?"

"Compliant as ever." Wendy lifted her chin smugly. "Today I rejected his draft and made him rewrite it. When he submits the second version, I'll use his first draft instead."

Tormenting people came naturally to her.

"Ensure his name appears nowhere on the final product—not even a punctuation mark." Xavier's voice turned icy. "Oh, and send him to me immediately after he finishes."

...

Roman appeared in Xavier's office two hours later.

"You wanted to see me, sir." His posture remained submissive.

Since the airplane incident, he'd been awaiting Xavier's retaliation.

Strangely, four days had passed with only routine harassment. But retribution would come.

Given another chance, he'd still block that filthy hand reaching for Evelyn.

Even if the consequences dwarfed a damaged suitcase.

Evelyn was sacred to him.

So when Xavier spoke next, Roman froze completely.

"Let's skip formalities between brothers." Xavier's grin unsettled him. "Certain things needn't be said aloud, right?"

Roman's head jerked up.

Brothers?

The word turned his blood to ice.

"Surprised?" Xavier slung an arm over his shoulder. "Don't pretend you didn't know our connection."

Roman lowered his gaze again.

"I know why you joined this company—why you've been lurking near my neighborhood." Xavier's breath hit his ear. "Normally, I'd treat my little brother better. But... who can guess your true intentions?"

Roman's fists clenched at his sides.

"I meant no harm." He only wanted to find his family.

"No harm? Then why endure three months of humiliation? Why abandon your bright future for Kingsbury?" Xavier sneered. "Fine. Here's your chance. Do one thing for me, and I'll take you home."

Roman didn't react as expected.

"What do you want?"

Three months had shown him Xavier's true colors.

Family reunion? Just another trap.

"Visit Evelyn tonight." Xavier's whisper turned venomous. "Knock on her door..." He detailed his plan against Roman's ear. "Succeed, and I'll keep my word."

Roman's nails dug bloody crescents into his palms.

...

Evelyn emerged from the shower, towel-drying her hair.

She almost thanked Xavier for giving her uninterrupted time to finalize three months' worth of work plans.

10:00 PM.

Her hand drifted to her abdomen. "Time for bed, little one."

A soft chuckle came from the window.

Evelyn stiffened.

Someone was in her room!

Then recognition washed over her—that voice was unmistakable.

Rounding the corner, she found Alexander Kingsley lounging on the sofa by the window.

Their eyes met. His gaze dropped to her stomach.

"Never knew you could speak like that." His voice carried an indescribable ache.

Even during their most passionate days, Evelyn had never used this tender, playful tone with him.

She'd been obedient. Quiet. Lovely.

But never coy.

Now, she poured every ounce of affection into this child.

For the baby, she'd return to him. For the baby, she'd lavish unconditional love.

Logically, he understood—with her family gone, this child was her only blood relative.

Yet jealousy gnawed at him.

Why couldn't he be her closest person?

Why did this unborn child effortlessly claim her entire heart?

The cruelest joke? He wasn't even the father.

That night, he'd asked when it happened.

He'd wanted to know when she and Julian Ashford became involved... when they conceived...

Regret had flooded him mid-question.

Some answers only brought agony.

Evelyn ignored his sarcasm, frowning. "You've been drinking again?"

As the steam cleared, the sharp scent of alcohol assaulted her senses.

That "again" held weight—his drinking had escalated alarmingly lately...
###Chapter 254: Midnight Visitor

The pungent scent of alcohol saturated the room, overpowering the delicate fragrance of body wash.

Evelyn strode to the window and shoved both panes open. The hotel's safety design limited how far they could open, allowing only a slow trickle of fresh air.

She coughed lightly.

Alexander's arm snaked around her waist, yanking her against his chest. His scorching breath grazed her ear. "I heard you've been behaving lately."

The liquor on his breath was stronger than last time—he'd clearly drunk heavily tonight.

"You..." She almost asked why Nathan wasn't with him but swallowed the question.

"Nathan stayed in Kingsbury." Alexander answered her unspoken thought. "He made a mistake recently and volunteered for overtime."

Evelyn stiffened slightly. Something had been off about Alexander for the past week.

"Aren't you going to ask why I'm here?" His arm tightened around her.

She pressed her lips together.

"A small project." He brushed it off casually. In truth, the project wasn't worth his personal attention, but after Evelyn left, he'd made Nathan scour every pending task.

Tonight, the project team had pulled out all the stops to please him. After multiple rounds of drinks, they'd even arranged "special entertainment." When Alexander stormed out, Evelyn's face was all he could see.

Alcohol lowered his defenses. Only with her in his arms did he feel any semblance of peace.

"Evelyn," his voice roughened, "stop this."

His feverish heat seeped through their clothes, but she remained an unyielding block of ice. "I need to rest."

She'd made countless compromises since their marriage, but this final boundary was non-negotiable. Thirteen years of pain couldn't be erased with sweet nothings.

"We may need to revise our agreement," she said coldly.

Alexander suddenly seized her wrist and pressed her palm to his chest. "Only touching other men's hearts? Mine beats too. Can you feel it?"

He was still hung up on that scene in Julian's office. If Julian got something, so would he.

"Know how much I've suffered?" He dragged her hand downward. "From here... to here—"

"You can't do this!" Evelyn struggled.

"I'm your husband." Alexander's breathing grew ragged. "Julian gets to touch you?"

"Don't bring him into this!" Her voice cracked with desperation.

"Then beg me." His eyes darkened. "Say it... beg me..."

He needed liquor to numb himself, needed her warmth to soothe the turmoil inside. Even just once, he had to prove she was his.

"I'll be gentle..." he murmured against her ear.

"Let go! Alexander, you—"

Sharp knocks interrupted them.

"Evelyn? You in there?" Roman's voice came through the door.

Alexander's gaze frosted over. A man visiting her this late?

"It's work-related." Evelyn softened her tone, leaning close to whisper in his ear.

Her warm breath made his entire body tense. He gripped the back of her head and crushed his lips against hers.

......

Outside the door, Xavier scowled. "Why isn't she answering? Did you warn her?"

"I've been with you the whole time," Roman muttered, fingers tightening around the anesthetic-soaked towel hidden in his palm.
###Chapter 255: On Tiptoes, Cupping His Face

"Keep knocking!" Xavier Stapleton glared at Roman Young. "She can't possibly not hear you."

Roman's fingers trembled slightly. "Maybe... she's wearing headphones..."

"Shut up!" Xavier grabbed his collar. "Unless you want to never go home again!"

Just as his knuckles were about to hit the door, Evelyn Sinclair's voice came from inside. "Roman?"

"Y-yes! It's me!" Roman answered quickly.

Xavier immediately pressed himself against the wall, hissing, "Remember—drug her first, then let me in."

The door opened.

Evelyn stood there in a robe, her damp hair dripping. "What is it this late?"

Xavier gritted his teeth in the shadows.

No matter how much he'd knocked these past days, Evelyn never answered. Yet she made an exception for Roman...

Something was definitely going on.

"Evelyn, I finished the new proposal..." Roman's voice wavered.

"Come in." Evelyn stepped aside, her tone sickeningly sweet. "But don't stay long."

Xavier watched the door close, jealousy burning in his eyes.

Five minutes passed. The room was eerily silent.

"Damn it!" Xavier kicked the wall. "That bastard tricked me—"

The door cracked open.

He barged in—only to find the room empty.

"Roman, you—"

A white sheet dropped over his head, wrapping him like a mummy.

"Who's there? Let go!" Xavier thrashed violently, only tangling himself further.

Through the fabric, he saw a tall figure raise a fist—

BAM!

The punch sent stars exploding across his vision.

Before he could recover, a brutal kick slammed into his back, knocking the air from his lungs.

"Mercy... please..." Xavier curled into a ball.

Roman had already retreated to the corner, horrified as Alexander Kingsley descended on his prey like a beast.

Each kick seemed meant to shatter bone.

Xavier's screams grew weaker.

"Enough!" Evelyn rushed forward.

Alexander was a storm of unchecked fury, his entire body radiating violence.

As his seventh kick landed, Evelyn wrapped her arms around him from behind.

"Alex!"

He froze.

Evelyn rose onto her toes, cradled his face, and sank her teeth into his lip.

Blood bloomed between them.

Alexander's pupils dilated. The rage vanished instantly.

By the time he processed what happened, Evelyn had already stepped back.

"Better now?" She wiped her mouth.

On the floor, Xavier lay motionless like a discarded rag.

Roman hesitantly checked his pulse. "H-he's alive..."

Alexander stared at Evelyn's swollen lips, his throat working.

That bite left him trembling far more than the violence ever had.
###Chapter 256: Evelyn and the Kingsley Family's Secret

Alexander Kingsley flexed his wrist slowly.
The rehabilitation training showed initial results, his joints emitting faint cracks.

"Throw him out."

Roman Young's eyes widened. "M-me?"

He fumbled like a startled rabbit.

Before Evelyn Sinclair could speak, two black-suited bodyguards entered.
They efficiently rolled up the bedsheet and hauled Xavier Stapleton away like trash.

...

Morning mist clung to the hotel alley when a janitor spotted a suspicious white bundle by the dumpster.
"What the hell?"

The moment he touched it, the bundle twitched.
"Help!" The janitor scrambled backward.

By the time paramedics arrived, Xavier was barely conscious.
Medical reports showed extensive soft tissue damage and minor internal bleeding.

"Tough bastard," Evelyn murmured over the chart.
She couldn't decide if his thick fat layer saved him or if Alexander had shown mercy.

The project team retreated urgently to Kingsbury.
Xavier remained comatose during transfer. Local police found no leads.

Security footage had mysteriously vanished.
The victim gave evasive answers.
"Just...got jumped by masked men," Xavier stammered.

The final blow came when Roman got promoted during Xavier's recovery.
Evelyn's new department occupied the adjacent office. Winston Strauss' interview teaser kept trending.

"Uncle Lee! That traitor's rising!" Xavier's wounds throbbed with rage.
He'd guarded his hospital room like a fortress, blocking Roman from contacting the Sullivans.

Yet the underling had climbed the corporate ladder unnoticed.
Now with Evelyn's backing, controlling him became impossible.

"Utter incompetence." Hugo Lee's face darkened.
Their perfect scheme lay in ruins.

Using Roman to frame Evelyn should've killed two birds with one stone.
Instead, the prey became the hunter.

Stranger still, the missing CCTV footage left Xavier too scared to press charges.
"Could that woman...have powerful backing?"

"Already checked." Hugo sneered. "The Kingsleys discarded her years ago."
He'd investigated the fire incident thoroughly.

After Evelyn's hospitalization, no Kingsley ever inquired about her.
If she truly mattered, why would they abandon her to obscurity?

Outside the hospital window, dusk deepened.
Hugo missed the blinking red light hidden in the shadows.
###Chapter 257: No Bite, Just Annoyance

The news of Evelyn Sinclair's survival struck Hugo Lee like a thunderbolt.

He had secretly investigated her whereabouts.

At age ten, Evelyn was hospitalized for mutism before vanishing without a trace. The Kingsleys never publicly announced adopting a daughter, and Alexander Kingsley gave no indication either.

Melissa Lee personally confirmed Isabella Winslow had never mentioned Evelyn's existence.

"Just have someone eliminate her," Xavier Stapleton hissed through gritted teeth.

Hugo sneered. "You think the police are decorations? Roman Young would suspect you first."

"Then we take him out too!" Xavier's eyes gleamed with malice.

"Idiot!" Hugo slammed the table. "Do you want the whole world to know his identity?"

Xavier immediately fell silent.

Hugo narrowed his eyes. "Stay out of this. I'll handle it."

......

Alexander hadn't appeared since beating Xavier that night.

Yet Evelyn kept waking abruptly in the darkness.

She'd listen intently, but her empty apartment echoed only with her own breathing.

A self-deprecating smile touched her lips.

Alexander, raised in luxury, could never endure her ordinary life.

His kindness toward her had always been as fleeting as a night-blooming flower.

"Miss Sinclair, we need to move your interview to the hotel," the HR manager apologized. "The conference room requires sudden renovations."

Evelyn nodded without reaction.

The arrangement felt suspicious.

"Let me accompany you," Roman fretted. "Xavier's been giving you strange looks lately."

"He wouldn't dare." Evelyn sounded certain.

Hugo wouldn't risk Xavier acting recklessly now.

The next day, Evelyn completed her hotel interview smoothly.

As she exited the room, a man suddenly bumped into her.

Someone pushed her from behind.

Instinctively, she raised her laptop against her chest.

"My apologies!" The man bowed repeatedly.

Evelyn recognized him as today's rejected candidate.

Her gaze swept the hallway—the pusher had vanished.

"Actually, I waited specifically to see you." The man hurried after her.
###Chapter 258: Scandal Storm

"Can I help you?"
Evelyn Sinclair instantly noticed the man's breathing growing closer behind her.

She quickened her pace, but he matched her step for step.

"Ms. Sinclair, I just wanted to ask..." His voice dripped with forced deference. "Do you think I passed the interview?"

"HR will notify you within three days." She slipped into the elevator.

The man squeezed in after her.

"How did I perform?" He pressed, undeterred.

Evelyn silently pressed the close-door button.

It wasn't that she refused to answer—his invasive proximity made her skin crawl.

Only after exiting the hotel lobby and confirming he hadn't followed did she exhale in relief.

What kind of interview was this?
More like a stalker's pursuit.

She pulled up the email and dragged his resume straight to the trash.

......

In her living room, Evelyn finalized broadcast details for Winston Strauss's exclusive interview with the news station.

"Don't worry, Ms. Sinclair. Your segment is the grand finale..."
"We'll monitor live comments in real-time..."
"You must attend tomorrow's taping..."

Hanging up, she stared absently at her phone.

Her fan group chat lay dormant except for the occasional admin clearing spam posts.

She'd specifically instructed them not to promote tomorrow's interview.

As a journalist, she wanted no part of fandom theatrics.
But neither would she hide like before.

Horizon Media's transfer to the video department had unexpectedly aligned with her goals.

In this era, newsmakers must step into the spotlight.

Ding—
Her phone erupted with vibrations.

999+ unread messages.
Martha Nash and Iris Cooper's icons blinked simultaneously.

Before she could tap a notification, Martha's call blasted through.

"What's going on with you and Alexander Kingsley?" Martha's voice crackled with urgency.

Evelyn's pulse spiked.
Had Iris slipped up?

"What do you mean?" She kept her tone steady.

"It's trending! Explosively!" Martha's words tumbled out. "Someone claims they photographed you two meeting secretly at a hotel—and that you're pregnant!"

Evelyn nearly confirmed the pregnancy outright.

But she hadn't seen Alexander in days.

"I was at a hotel today—for work." She frowned. "Who's spreading this?"

Iris's call beeped through mid-sentence.

"Congratulations!" Iris's voice trembled with excitement. "You're finally public!"

A vein throbbed at Evelyn's temple.

She didn't need to check the trending list to know—
Someone was orchestrating a storm.
###Chapter 259: The Hotel Rendezvous Scandal

Evelyn's fingers froze mid-scroll. The photo on her phone screen burned her retinas.

"That's not me in the picture." Her voice could frost glass.

Iris stammered through the phone, "But the fan groups are exploding. They're saying you and Mr. Kingsley—"

"I was interviewing candidates at the hotel today." Evelyn cut her off. "The conference room was under renovation."

A sharp inhale. "Then... the man in the photo—"

"One of the interviewees." Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "This was a setup."

Silence crackled over the line.

"Iris?" Evelyn tapped the desk. "Don't tell me you've already posted in the—"

"No! Absolutely not!" Iris's voice shook. "It's just... your tone sounds exactly like that account in the group chat..."

Evelyn chuckled. "No matter how thick the disguise, I'd recognize you."

Iris nearly dropped her phone.

After hanging up, Evelyn opened the trending page.

A flood of paparazzi shots—her back entering a hotel room, a stranger's profile following close behind, grainy footage of an "intimate embrace" in the hallway.

The elevator photo was the most laughable.

A man adjusting his tie, deliberately cropped to mimic a waist-encircling gesture.

Evelyn's lips curled.

The man's build did vaguely resemble Alexander's.

But she'd memorized Alexander's presence down to his molecular structure. A thousand doppelgängers couldn't fool her.

Her phone vibrated.

[SHOCKING! Evelyn Sinclair Sleeping Her Way to the Top Using Kingsley Lawsuit!]

The comment section resembled a shark feeding frenzy.

Isabella's fans swarmed like blood-crazed piranhas:

[Gold-digging whore! Stealing our Bella's man!]
[As if Mr. Kingsley would touch trash like her!]
[Photos don't lie, stop pretending!]

Evelyn scrolled past the vitriol without blinking.

She opened the fan group chat. Iris was frantically damage-controlling:

[Wait for official statements! Stop spreading rumors!]

The group had descended into chaos:

[If she's really pregnant why's she still working?]
[Photoshopped for sure!]
[Hotel registry leaked and you're still denying?]

A glaring message popped up:

[Isabella stans GTFO!]

System notification: SnowDreamer has left the group.

Evelyn massaged her temples.

Returning to the trending page, she focused on the original gossip account.

The setup felt too deliberate—not quite a reputation smear, not quite a relationship expose.

Unless...

Her breath hitched.

What if they didn't know about her connection to Alexander at all?

What if this entire farce was designed solely for her?
###Chapter 260: No Retreat When Her Baby Was Insulted

The authenticity of the photo no longer mattered.

Isabella Winslow's fans attacked like rabid dogs.

[How dare some nobody try to frame our Isabella?]

[Is Evelyn so desperate for money? Should we crowdfund her a grave?]

[You think you're worthy of Lord Alex? Look in the mirror, trash!]

The vitriol escalated.

Some fabricated rumors about Evelyn Sinclair scheming her way up the social ladder, even cursing her unborn child.

[Heard this slut tried to pin her bastard on Lord Alex and got caught. Serves her right for aborting it!]

[What kind of monster would that whore's spawn be? Better off dead!]

[Poor baby, stuck with such a shameless mother. Death's too good for it!]

Evelyn's fingers trembled over her phone screen.

She could endure insults aimed at herself.

But curses targeting her child? Never.

Drawing a steadying breath, she opened her fan group chat.

[Thank you for your concern. The photo was shot at a misleading angle. Here's my interview schedule from today.]

She attached appointment confirmations and message logs.

[I met with multiple interviewers—all verifiable witnesses.]

The group exploded.

[We knew Evelyn was innocent!]

[How vile to attack an unborn baby!]

[Stay strong, Evelyn! We stand with you!]

Martha Nash and Iris Cooper quickly initiated a call.

"Leave this to us," Martha said firmly. "Don't engage."

"But—"

"No buts!" Martha cut in. "Those animals crossed the line attacking a child. I won't let this slide."

Iris's voice cracked. "After Evelyn just lost her baby... How could they?"

Silence fell.

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone. "Most bystanders don't care about truth. They just want drama."

"So you'll let them slander you?" Martha snapped.

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "I suspect this wasn't Isabella's doing. The Lee family is behind it."

"Melissa Lee?" Martha scoffed. "Too incompetent to win fairly, so she resorts to this?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Martha, about Alexander and I—"

"Enough!" Martha interrupted. "Whoever's responsible, we fight back with facts."

After the call, Iris messaged privately.

"You were going to tell Martha about you and Mr. Kingsley?"

Evelyn smiled bitterly. "Never mind. We have an agreement."

"What agreement?"

"One year of marriage in secrecy."

Iris gasped. "No wonder you never explained..."

Martha moved swiftly.

Overnight, counterposts flooded social media.

Though outnumbered by Isabella's fanatics, truth finally found its voice.

Watching the shifting tides of public opinion, Evelyn's gaze hardened.

This time, she wouldn't back down.
###Chapter 261: Counterattack in the Storm of Public Opinion

Isabella Winslow's fans flooded every social media platform with posts, while Evelyn Sinclair's supporters countered with hard evidence.

The online battle escalated, dominating the trending lists.

Gradually, neutral comments rose to the top:

["At least Isabella is a celebrity. Who even is this Evelyn Sinclair?"]

["Women these days will do anything for attention."]

["Can we stop seeing celebrity drama on trending every day?"]

["Does Isabella even have any notable works? All she does is stir up publicity."]

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she read.

Martha Nash's strategy was brilliant.

Though both she and Isabella were being criticized, only the actress's reputation was truly suffering.

After all, who remembers a nobody's name?

As for the hate from strangers? It meant nothing to her.

......

Evelyn had to admire Hugo Lee's ruthless tactics.

Isabella had once used her as a pawn. Now Hugo was turning the tables, wielding the actress as his weapon.

Since the smear campaign failed, she knew Hugo's next move was coming.

Right on cue, her supervisor summoned her upon arriving at Horizon Media.

"Evelyn, this scandal is causing problems for the company." The woman in her forties fixed her with a sharp stare.

"Those are just rumors. I was only attending an interview yesterday—"

"I know you didn't meet Alexander Kingsley." The supervisor cut her off impatiently. "But are the online allegations true?"

Evelyn's gaze turned icy.

So the woman had already chosen sides.

"What allegations?" she asked calmly.

"Did you orchestrate this entire scheme?" The supervisor's tone turned accusatory. "I've heard about your history with the Crown Prince. With your qualifications, why resort to such underhanded methods?"

Evelyn met her gaze directly. "Please be specific."

"Don't play dumb." The woman sneered. "Hiring a lookalike for staged intimate photos. Fabricating miscarriage rumors to drive traffic to your interview. Young women nowadays will stop at nothing for fame."

Evelyn stopped bothering to explain.

"Your interview with Winston Strauss has been pulled." The supervisor finally revealed her hand. "With your current reputation, you're unfit to represent Horizon."

Evelyn suddenly laughed.

"What's so funny?" The woman's expression darkened.

"I find it amusing how Horizon boasts about protecting employees, yet always condemns me first when trouble arises." Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Perhaps you should check what happened to others who treated me this way."

The supervisor faltered.

Evelyn stood. "A word of advice—it's easy to take an interview down, but getting it back up won't be so simple."

She turned and left, leaving the stunned woman speechless.

......

News reached Hugo Lee swiftly.

"Insolent!" He slammed his desk.

How dare an orphan with no backing openly defy him?

"Sir, she's completely uncooperative." The supervisor fretted. "What if Isabella—"

"Relax." Hugo smiled confidently. "Isabella would welcome anyone helping take Evelyn down."

He pulled up the latest trending topic, his grin widening. "Look. The real show is just beginning."
###Chapter 262: Another Cease and Desist Letter

Isabella Winslow's fans suddenly released two photos.

One was Evelyn Sinclair's pregnancy test and miscarriage records.

The other was unmistakably a marriage certificate between Alexander Kingsley and Isabella Winslow.

The wedding date showed it happened right after Evelyn reported their engagement ring purchase.

The fan group exploded instantly.

["She was lying all along! This wasn't some interview subject—she deliberately used a lookalike to frame them!"]

["So Bella and Mr. Kingsley were already married! Evelyn is just a shameless homewrecker!"]

["The ring report was real? Then how do you explain that slut's pregnancy?"]

...

Hugo Lee watched the online storm with a cold smirk.

"Public opinion is a powerful weapon. Let's see how long she lasts."

He turned to his assistant. "Release news that Evelyn's interview program got canceled."

"Then send her another cease and desist letter—make sure the whole company knows."

...

Evelyn's fan group was in despair.

["Those documents must be fake!"]

["Disgusting! Alexander denied everything after getting married, letting a woman take the fall!"]

["I refuse to believe Evelyn would be a mistress. She's being set up!"]

Iris Cooper's call came through.

"Evelyn... is it true? Did Alexander really marry Isabella?" Her voice trembled.

"No." Evelyn's tone remained calm. "The marriage certificate is forged. The pregnancy records too."

"I'll expose them!"

"Don't." Evelyn cut her off. "I don't care."

Iris froze.

Evelyn opened the fan group chat.

["Thank you all for your concern and support."]

The moment she posted, the group fell silent.

["First, I was never pregnant—let alone had a miscarriage."]

Her fans finally exhaled in relief.

["Second, I apologize for the recent troubles."]

["Third, I've decided to leave this group."]

The chat erupted instantly.

But without hesitation, Evelyn clicked "Exit Group."

"Evelyn!" Iris stomped her foot in frustration. "You're breaking their hearts!"

"I won't drag them into this mess." Evelyn's voice softened. "My existence shouldn't hurt anyone."

Hugo's move was vicious.

He wasn't just destroying her reputation—he wanted her indebted to everyone.

"But they enjoy being fans!"

"I don't need that kind of devotion." Evelyn ended the call.

The cease and desist letter lay quietly on her desk.

Alexander Kingsley's name glared back at her.

This was the second time.
###Chapter 263: Shameless Claim of Protection

"Evelyn Sinclair, this is for you." The corporate lawyer barged in and slammed a document on her desk. "Alexander Kingsley is suing you for fabricating evidence of your hotel stay together, causing reputational damage to him and Kingsley Group."

The office fell dead silent.

New hires exchanged uneasy glances. Roman Young clenched his fists.

Evelyn picked up the document, fingertips tracing the embossed law firm seal.

"What do you suggest I do?" She leveled the lawyer with an unflinching stare. "Enlighten me."

The lawyer took an involuntary step back under her gaze.

"Issue a public apology," he said stiffly. "We'll negotiate to keep this out of court. Alexander's legal team—"

"Didn't they lose to me last time?" Evelyn interrupted mildly.

The lawyer's face darkened.

"This is different!" he spat after a pause. "Apologize or resign! Horizon won't tolerate your arrogance!"

"Why should I apologize?" Evelyn's laugh was icy. "HR knows I was interviewing that day. The company booked that hotel. Now you want me to take the fall? Are you blind?"

"Suit yourself!" The lawyer stormed out. "Resign or face termination!"

The legal notice lay abandoned on the desk.

Evelyn snapped a photo and texted Alexander: 【Your doing?】

No response.

Just like always, the man remained conspicuously absent since yesterday's incident.

The silence shattered when Iris Cooper called. "Evelyn, we've decided to disband the fan club. But we'll always support you."

After hanging up, Evelyn noticed a new hire hovering before her.

"Ms. Sinclair..." The girl twisted her fingers. "I'd like to transfer departments..."

Evelyn remembered this intern's passionate interview speech about pursuing truth.

"Submit the paperwork." She approved the request with a click.

The girl scurried away like a pardoned criminal.

The office atmosphere grew heavier. Two more staff left before lunch.

"Ungrateful snakes!" Roman threw his chopsticks down. "Don't even think about coming back!"

A male colleague shrank in his seat. "It's just probation...if leadership changes..."

"You leaving too?" Roman narrowed his eyes.

"N-no!" The man waved his hands. "Something's fishy about this..."

Evelyn reentered with Xavier Stapleton trailing behind.

"Evelyn, only I can protect you now." Xavier smirked at the half-empty office. "Look around—everyone's abandoning you."

The male colleague across from Roman paled.

"Your poaching skills are impressive." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Saves me the trouble of weeding out weak links."

Xavier pressed on. "Your department's getting dissolved. Certain people—" he glanced pointedly at Roman, "—will be out on the street."

Roman shot to his feet.

"Easy." Evelyn restrained him and turned to Xavier. "Is rumor-mongering your specialty?"

Xavier stepped closer, undeterred. "The whole company's talking. Legal's already discussing your termination. Fired by Horizon, sued by Alexander Kingsley—your career—"

"And?"

"Let me protect you!" Xavier flashed a predatory grin. "I'm your only way out."
###Chapter 264: Loyalty Begets Loyalty

Roman rolled his eyes.

Xavier's arrogant rant was utterly ridiculous.

No one understood Alexander's possessiveness toward Evelyn better than him.

Though Alexander hadn't made a move yet, Roman knew the situation could reverse instantly if Evelyn willed it.

Xavier probably didn't even know who had beaten him last time.

"Evelyn, the termination notice has been posted in the company group chat." The legal officer strutted over with inexplicable smugness, waving a handover form. "Pack your things and leave within two days."

Xavier feigned sympathy. "No need to rush. Evelyn can temporarily transfer to my department."

"Some people just don't know when to quit," the legal officer sneered, eyeing Evelyn. "A public apology would've settled this, but you had to take it this far."

"Finished?" Evelyn's icy voice cut through. "Leave if you're done."

The legal officer turned livid. "Still acting tough after getting fired?"

Her gaze swept over Evelyn with insinuation. "Then again, some people do have the looks to get by."

Roman's knuckles whitened from clenching his fists.

"Wrong again." Evelyn chuckled. "I don't answer to anyone now. Not even Hugo Lee himself could make me hold my tongue."

Xavier's face darkened instantly.

The legal officer suddenly realized termination meant nothing to Evelyn.

"We have a meeting." Evelyn waved the handover form dismissively.

Roman stood abruptly, making Xavier stumble backward in alarm.

BANG!

The office door slammed shut.

"Horizon is firing me, and this department will dissolve." Evelyn addressed the two remaining staff members. "You still have time to transfer."

"I'm staying." Roman's voice was steel. "Even if it means getting fired too."

Evelyn studied him intently.

She knew Roman had ulterior motives for joining Horizon.

"I'll find another job," the other employee said pragmatically.

"Good." Evelyn made a solemn vow. "Today I, Evelyn Sinclair, swear this—when the time comes, I won't forget those who stood by me."

Both men straightened with renewed determination.

"Starting your own venture?" Roman asked excitedly.

"Not now." Evelyn instructed, "Pack your things too."

She'd stayed at Horizon out of gratitude toward Julian.

But now she saw no reason to endure further humiliation.
###Chapter 265: Alexander's True Stance Toward Evelyn

The entire Horizon Media video department gathered around as Evelyn Sinclair packed her desk.

A cardboard box held her few personal belongings. With each item she placed inside, hushed whispers rippled through the crowd.

"She's really getting fired..."

"Serves her right for overstepping."

Xavier Stapleton sighed with fake sympathy. "Evelyn, if only you'd thought twice earlier."

He took the work files she handed him, deliberately brushing his fingers against her knuckles.

Evelyn jerked her hand back.

A dark glint flashed in Xavier's eyes.

Hugo Lee watched from the periphery, satisfaction curling his lips. He'd already confirmed with headquarters—Julian Ashford's absence proved Evelyn had truly been abandoned.

"Once she's desperate out there," Hugo murmured to Xavier, "she'll be putty in your hands."

Beyond the glass doors, gossip swirled like a gathering storm.

"Did you hear she faked that photo with Alexander Kingsley?"

"Pathetic. Isabella Winslow already posted their marriage certificate."

"Thought she was untouchable with the Crown Prince backing her. Look at her now."

The click of heels cut through the chatter.

Martha Nash entered with Iris Cooper in tow, radiating authority. "Since when did Video Department turn into paparazzi? Don't you have work to do?"

The crowd fell silent.

Hugo stepped forward with a frown. "This isn't your jurisdiction, Director Nash."

Martha flashed her press badge. "Evelyn Sinclair's scandal is trending nationwide. Entertainment Department is here for an exclusive. Problem?"

Iris raised a recorder. "Does Horizon Media's termination confirm the photo was fabricated?"

Hugo shoved the device aside. "Enough disruptions!"

Wendy West seized the moment. "Since you care so much, Director Nash, why not interview Alexander Kingsley?"

She smirked at the onlookers. "Maybe beg for mercy on Evelyn's behalf."

Iris gave a cold laugh. "What a coincidence. We just came from Kingsley Group."

She projected her voice. "Mr. Kingsley stated—"

The office froze.

"That photograph is authentic."
###Chapter 266: He Doesn't Mind Being the Man Beside Her

The moment the word "auntie" left Iris's lips, Wendy West's face turned ashen.

Iris's voice rang clear and firm.

"Clarification?" Wendy's voice rose to a shrill pitch. "That's hilarious. Was it to clear Evelyn's name or just adding more accusations against her?"

"Wendy, you seem to have quite the opinion about me."

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like ice water on boiling oil.

She had been handling documents in her office, tuning out the commotion outside. Only when Martha and Iris rushed in did she set aside her work and step out.

Wendy had been hiding in the crowd, fanning the flames to prove her loyalty by attacking Evelyn. She never expected things to escalate to a direct confrontation.

"Evelyn, I'm just stating facts." Wendy forced a stiff smile. "Don't take it personally. It's not just me saying these things."

Since the facade had crumbled, she decided to go all out. After all, Evelyn's termination was practically a done deal.

"Those who follow the crowd are either morally bankrupt or intellectually deficient." Evelyn's tone remained calm. "I believe you fall into the latter category."

Wendy's face flushed, then paled.

Evelyn never resorted to vulgar language, yet every word struck deep. Wendy scrambled for a retort but found her mind blank, unable to conjure a suitable response.

Flustered, she pulled out her phone, shifting the attack to Iris. "You said Kingsley Group would clarify? Where's the proof? I don't see it!"

Her fingers flew across the screen, but her voice grew smaller. "Where is it? I can't find it. Where...?"

The last word died in her throat.

Iris smirked. "Cat got your tongue? Oh dear, this is bad!"

Wendy's stunned silence piqued everyone's curiosity. Phones were hastily pulled out.

"What's bad?" Martha leaned in. "Isn't this Kingsley Group's statement? Wait—it's not from them. Oh no!"

The office fell dead silent, as if everyone had been frozen in place.

Hugo Lee resisted checking his phone, barking instead, "Iris, what nonsense are you spouting?"

Iris feigned deference. "Martha and I rushed here to deliver the news, but someone else beat us to it. Isn't that bad?"

"What news?" Hugo's gut twisted with dread.

Martha sighed. "It wasn't Kingsley Group who clarified for Evelyn. It was Alexander Kingsley himself!"

"Nonsense!" Hugo nearly snatched Wendy's phone. "What the hell is going on?"

Wendy trembled too much to speak. A legal staffer bravely explained, "Mr. Lee, Alexander denied any relationship with Isabella Winslow. That marriage certificate might be fake..."

"Might?" Hugo's eyebrows nearly singed off.

Wendy shakily handed over her phone. "He provided photo evidence. The headshots on the certificate were cropped from this picture..."

If even the photos were fake, how could the certificate be real?

Alexander's statement was crystal clear.

"This..." Hugo tossed the phone back. "What does this have to do with Evelyn? He only clarified things with Isabella!"

"Keep scrolling!" Iris boldly took the phone and swiped down.

Hugo tried to look away but found himself glued to the screen.

Before his clarification, Alexander had reposted the viral photos—the ones exposing Evelyn and the "fake Alexander" at the hotel.

His caption was simple:
[I don't mind being the man in those photos.]

The internet exploded.

Two meanings:
First, denying the man in the photos was him.
Second, declaring he'd gladly be the one standing beside Evelyn.

The scandal had never been about Evelyn being with Alexander at a hotel. What stung was that she'd allegedly settled for an impostor.

Had she truly been with Alexander, who would dare slander her so brazenly?

The office was now so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

"Weren't we firing Evelyn?" Martha broke the silence. "Weren't we making her publicly apologize?"

Iris muttered, "Good thing we didn't. That would've been humiliating. Forcing an innocent person to confess—how would Horizon Media ever recover?"

Hugo's face darkened like scorched iron.

He'd heard Evelyn had cut ties with the Kingsleys, but forgot one crucial detail—the Sinclairs had once saved Alexander's life.
###Chapter 267: No One Dares Disrespect the Young Madam

Alexander Kingsley's arrival struck Hugo Lee like a sledgehammer to the chest.

Cold sweat beaded on his temples as his fingers absently fiddled with his suit cuff.

How had Evelyn Sinclair managed to summon this untouchable titan?

Melissa Lee's intelligence had clearly failed catastrophically.

"Shall we continue?" Evelyn's crisp voice rang out, a delicate hammer tapping against everyone's nerves.

The legal and HR directors simultaneously turned pleading eyes toward Hugo.

The office plunged into tomb-like silence.

Alexander's denial—"Nothing of the sort"—still reverberated in the air.

His rejection had been absolute, elevating Evelyn to untouchable status in the same breath.

This wasn't distancing—it was a blatant declaration that Evelyn stood under his protection.

Hugo's Adam's apple bobbed as he ground out through clenched teeth, "Why is everyone just standing around?"

The staff began scattering like startled birds—

"Where are Horizon Media's representatives?"

A booming male voice cut through the room as a dozen suited figures filed in. The lead attorney's gaze crackled with electricity.

"Kingsley Group legal department." He flashed credentials. "Here to investigate the fraudulent cease-and-desist letter bearing our name."

The words detonated like grenades.

Every head swiveled toward the legal director.

The woman's face drained of color, her nails biting into her palms.

Evelyn's workstation sat mere feet away.

Her personal belongings were boxed up, the forged document conspicuously placed atop the pile.

The legal director's stare burned into Evelyn's back, her breathing turning ragged.

"Cease-and-desist letter?" Evelyn turned, and the woman nearly collapsed.

But Evelyn's gaze slid past her, landing instead on her abandoned desk.

The silence grew so profound one could hear a pin drop.

Evelyn leisurely sifted through the papers, each rustling sheet magnified in the stillness.

The Kingsley attorneys stood ramrod straight, an impenetrable human barricade.

The untouched tea service sat forgotten.

Their mission was singular—unmask the audacious forger.

"My apologies." Evelyn suddenly looked up. "Things got misplaced during the transition. I can't seem to find it."

Her palm rested casually atop the very document in question.

The legal director saw everything.

"I'll search more thoroughly at home." Evelyn smiled with guileless innocence.

The lead attorney's eye twitched.

The young madam was clearly toying with them like a cat with cornered prey.

What could they do?

"Of course." The attorney beamed like a benevolent statue. "You have our direct line, Ms. Sinclair."

Before departing, his razor-sharp gaze swept the room. "Counterfeiting Kingsley Group documents carries severe consequences."

The legal director's knees buckled, her body slumping against the wall for support.
###Chapter 268: Not as Foolish as They Thought

The Kingsley Group's legal team arrived in full force.

Officially, they came to defend Lord Alex's honor.

In truth, their sole purpose was to back Evelyn Sinclair.

Had she ordered them to attack, they would've torn the opposition to shreds.

Had she commanded retreat, they'd have shown mercy.

But not without delivering every necessary threat.

The lead attorney gave Evelyn a knowing smile before leaving. "Miss Sinclair, we await your instructions."

The moment the legal team departed, the in-house counsel lunged for Evelyn's box.

She grabbed the top document and shredded it violently before hurling the pieces into the trash.

"We're even now!" The counsel panted, eyes still blazing.

"You can keep your job," the department head hastily added.

All three visibly relaxed.

Without the original document, what could Kingsley Group possibly do?

"Keep my job?" Evelyn chuckled. "I was fired, if I recall."

The department head's face darkened. "That was a misunderstanding. You can stay. Just avoid stirring up trouble."

Martha Nash exploded. "Bullshit! Someone framed Evelyn, and you couldn't wait to fire her. Sounds like guilty conscience to me!"

"This is our branch's internal matter!" the department head snapped.

"Then what business is Evelyn's relationship with Alexander Kingsley of yours?" Martha shot back.

Ahem—

Evelyn cleared her throat softly.

Under everyone's gaze, she retrieved the torn fragments from the trash and meticulously reassembled them.

"You were too hasty, counsel." She held up the reconstructed document. "This was just a copy."

The trio paled instantly.

For the first time, Evelyn's smile sent chills down their spines.

"Did you really think I'd be stupid enough to leave the original on top?"

Roman Young and Iris Cooper immediately stepped forward to help carry her boxes.

"Oh," Evelyn turned to HR, "I own the rights to Winston Strauss's interview. If Horizon Media airs it without permission, prepare for litigation."

Hugo Lee and his cohorts panicked.

Only then did they realize Kingsley Group's lawyers meant business.

If Evelyn submitted that cease-and-desist letter, every forger would face consequences.

"Evelyn, let's talk this through..." Xavier Stapleton finally interjected.

Iris blocked him. "And you are?"
###Chapter 269: The Depths of Stupidity

"Who the hell do you think you are?" Iris Cooper planted her hands on her hips, staring at him like he was a piece of trash.

Her expression screamed one thing loud and clear: Ugly. Rejected. Get lost.

Xavier Stapleton's prized handsome face was being scrutinized with the same disgust one would reserve for a cockroach—for the first time in his life.

He trembled with rage.

"You—"

"You what? Even if you were the king of the world, you wouldn’t dare block Evelyn’s path!" Iris went full throttle. They weren’t even in the same department—why should she fear him?

Martha Nash had her back.

Evelyn might be gentle and easy to bully, but Iris was no pushover.

"Standing there like a damn lamppost! Ever heard of ‘good dogs don’t block the road’?" Iris raised her voice an octave.

"Enough, Iris." Evelyn gently tugged her sleeve. "People like him aren’t worth our breath."

That sentence was a knife.

In front of the entire company, it plunged straight into Xavier’s heart.

His face twisted. "Evelyn Sinclair, don’t you dare—"

"Silence!" Hugo Lee’s roar exploded from behind.

Xavier froze.

"Everyone—back to your stations! Anyone lingering loses a day’s pay!" Hugo barked.

The spectators scattered like startled birds.

"Evelyn Sinclair, your resignation is on hold." Hugo’s command was ice-cold. "Legal team, get over here. You—" He jabbed a finger at Xavier. "Get the hell back to your desk!"

This idiot picking a fight now? Asking for trouble.

"My God, what kind of hellhole is this?"

With only their own people left in the office, Iris shook her head in disbelief. "Melissa Lee’s scheming looks like child’s play compared to her father’s."

A company-wide bullying campaign? What kind of grown adult does that?

"It doesn’t matter." Evelyn’s voice was calm. "If I don’t care, they can’t hurt me."

The truth would come out eventually.

"Forget this mess. You’re not seriously staying, are you?" Martha frowned. "Request a transfer back to headquarters. Hugo’s lost his mind."

Evelyn adjusted her cuff. "If they won’t fire me, I’ll stay."

"Stay?" Iris’s eyes bulged. "What’s worth keeping in this dump?"

"Answers." Evelyn’s reply was clipped.

"Huh?"

"I want to know why Hugo’s targeting me." Evelyn lifted her gaze.

"Because of Melissa, obviously!" Iris looked baffled.

"There’s more." Evelyn’s eyes darkened. "Just like Xavier tormenting Roman Young—there’s something behind that too."

"Ugh…" Martha sighed. "Even with your investigative instincts, you don’t give yourself a break."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "If I can’t see myself clearly, how can I see others?"

She’d been naive before. Now she understood—loving herself came first.

"Fine. Team Evelyn forever." Iris switched topics. "Check out Isabella’s fans losing their minds!"

Isabella Winslow’s fandom had collectively lost it.

Alexander Kingsley had denied their relationship for the umpteenth time.

The marriage certificate’s authenticity didn’t matter.

What mattered was their darling Isabella had been wronged!

And the unforgivable part? Alexander had publicly shown favor to Evelyn Sinclair!

The fans went nuclear.

They swarmed Alexander’s and Kingsley Group’s official accounts like locusts.

[She gave you her youth, and this is how you repay her?]

[Dare you claim that baby is yours?]

[The real wife endures humiliation while you knock someone else up?]

...

Alexander actually responded.

To the baby question. He reposted it with: [If she’s willing, I’ll be the father anytime.]

The fandom detonated.

The war escalated instantly.

[Boycott Kingsley Group!]

[Nouveau riche pretending to be old money!]

[Audit their taxes!]

[Crowdfund to buy Kingsley Group! Make Isabella queen!]

[I’ll donate a month’s allowance!]

...

Martha spat out her coffee.

"What breed of idiocy is this?"

The team watched in awe.

"Real fans are scarier than paid trolls…" Iris facepalmed.

Martha shook her head. "Never thought I’d see living, breathing morons."

A dollar each to buy Kingsley Group?

Not even top global investment banks would dream that big.

"But Evelyn," Martha suddenly narrowed her eyes. "You and Alexander…"
###Chapter 270: Why Not Come Straight to Me

"What's wrong?" Evelyn Sinclair tensed up.

Martha Nash's gaze swept over her.

Evelyn's heartbeat quickened, afraid Martha would ask something awkward. Roman Young and Iris Cooper were both present. Though Iris had performed well, Evelyn still didn't fully trust her.

"Does Alexander Kingsley really have feelings for you?" Martha mused. "It's strange how he lost that lawsuit last time."

"Isn't that normal?" Iris jumped in. "Evelyn has both beauty and brains. Who wouldn't be drawn to her?"

Martha sighed. "Evelyn, I know things didn't work out with Julian Ashford. If you meet someone suitable, don't let the chance slip away."

"Mm." Evelyn responded half-heartedly.

Roman shrank into the corner, not daring to breathe too loudly.

Meanwhile, Alexander's ruthless efficiency shocked the entire internet.

The mindless comments from Isabella Winslow's fans were wiped clean within half an hour. Kingsley Group's legal team worked with terrifying speed—filing lawsuits where needed, suspending accounts where necessary.

By the end of the workday, HR remained silent about the termination. Evelyn pretended not to know and invited Martha and the others to dinner.

Returning home, she found the apartment pitch black.

"Back so soon?" A male voice from the couch made her fingers twitch.

Lights flickered on, revealing Alexander's figure. He looked impeccable, sitting there in his tailored suit.

Evelyn clutched her bag and tried to slip into the bedroom, but he caught up in a few strides. She didn't dare struggle, afraid of harming the baby—her belly had noticeably rounded these days, forcing her to switch to loose dresses.

Alexander wrapped his arms around her from behind.

"Let go!" She turned and pressed against his chest. "You're crushing my stomach."

He loosened his grip slightly but kept her trapped.

"I'm not even angry, yet you're throwing a tantrum first?" His tone carried dangerous amusement.

Evelyn glared up at him. "You weren't the one getting cursed online. You didn't receive a cease and desist letter."

"Shouldn't I be angry?" Alexander suddenly laughed. "I'm the scumbag who cheated. I'm the one who found a mistress."

"Is any of that true?"

"Neither are your accusations." He leaned in shamelessly, breath hot against her ear. "I was actually pleased at first, thinking you were finally coming back."

Evelyn jerked her head up.

So he'd known the truth all along but let the situation escalate, just to force her return.

"Why would you think I'd come back?"

"Because no one else would dare take you." His gaze darkened. "Julian Ashford didn't want you. No one else would shelter you."

His fingers traced her cheek. "If you were going to find a substitute anyway, why not come straight to me?"

He bent his head suddenly, lips brushing her earlobe. "Shall we continue what we started that night?"
###Chapter 271: Her Indifference Pierced His Heart

"Sorry." Evelyn Sinclair pulled her hand free and took a step back. "I'm not in the mood right now."

Alexander Kingsley yanked her forward, gripping her chin. "Then what are you in the mood for?"

She saw the storm brewing in his eyes.

"Julian Ashford didn't get involved in your mess, so you're upset? If they hadn't forged that cease and desist letter, you wouldn't have even bothered explaining things to me, would you?"

"Alexander," Evelyn met his gaze, her expression as distant as an ocean between them. "You promised not to doubt me again, not to use the past to hurt me..."

A faint, bitter smile touched her lips. "I should've known your promises mean nothing."

His pupils contracted, fingers tightening. "Because I broke one promise, you refuse to trust me at all? You pushed me to break it. Evelyn, are you gaslighting me?"

She flinched.

Gaslighting?

He was turning the tables.

After distorting facts and accusing her relentlessly, now he claimed she was manipulating him?

"What do you want?" she demanded bluntly.

Alexander was accustomed to control. Frustration brought out his worst side.

She knew a little compromise would placate him.

But she refused.

She'd had enough. Leaving him once should've meant freedom, yet he haunted her like a ghost.

Taking her for granted when he had her, clinging desperately when he lost her...

Unless she could erase the past entirely, an uncrossable chasm would always divide them.

Her gaze turned glacial.

That look stabbed through Alexander.

He scooped her up violently, kicking open the bedroom door.

Darkness swallowed them.

He couldn't bear that expression—not for a single second...

He saw right through her indifference.

Yet he indulged her every time.

His concessions meant nothing to her. Even this half-hearted pretense tormented him.

Did she despise him so completely?

Countless times he'd wanted to shred her careful facade and claim her utterly.

But he always restrained himself.

Turning away, he pressed a palm over his eyes, unable to savor even that meager pleasure.

He felt himself dying inside.

After all his efforts, this woman still intended to leave...

"Enough!" He shoved her away abruptly. "I don't need this."

Evelyn froze.

His sudden disinterest confused her.

Sitting silently on the bed, she finally said, "I'll find the person in that photo."

"Why bother?" Alexander stood irritably.

"Gossip that means nothing to you could destroy me." She watched his impatient movements as he dressed.

Who could ever truly hurt Alexander Kingsley?

His anger stemmed from unmet desire.

While she fought just to preserve basic dignity.

"Do what you want." He couldn't spare another word.

Evelyn actually relaxed.

This was the Alexander she knew.

No suffocating attention. No unreasonable demands.

Before she could process it, the front door slammed violently.

Just like old times—he left without a word...

Only the trembling doorframe lingered.

......

"Lord Alex?" Ethan Miller waited downstairs.

After cycling through assistants recently, Alexander had recalled Ethan.

He realized he was hopelessly nostalgic.

New things never satisfied him.

"Back to Kingsley Group." Alexander's voice was steel.

Ethan and the driver snapped to attention.

Lord Alex always left Evelyn's place in a foul mood.

But returning to headquarters was good.

Ethan preferred Alexander burying himself in work over being tortured by Evelyn.

He still resented her.

But he'd learned to hide it.

Nathan Carter's fate served as a stark warning.

At Kingsley Group, Alexander dove straight into work.

He summoned Nathan for overtime too.

Soon Ethan reappeared: "Lord Alex, Isabella Winslow called my line. She wants to speak with you."

Alexander kept typing, the desk lamp casting sharp shadows across his face in the dark office.

He finished a paragraph before looking up. "Anything else?"

Ethan wiped sweat. "Isabella—"

"Get out." Alexander cut him off.

Only then did Ethan notice his murderous expression and hastily retreated.
###Chapter 272: Public Apology

Ethan Miller fled in panic, nearly tripping at the doorway.

He knew perfectly well that Isabella Winslow had been blacklisted by Lord Alex. Yet the tearful sobs on the phone still tugged at his heartstrings.

"Miss Winslow, I'm sorry..." Ethan wiped sweat from his brow. "Lord Alex isn't available right now."

"Thank you, Ethan." Isabella's voice dripped with saccharine sweetness.

She was about to say more when she suddenly gasped. "Wait! It's Alexander!"

Alexander Kingsley's call sent Isabella into a fluster. She hastily hung up on Ethan, taking a deep breath before answering.

"Alexander..." She deliberately softened her tone. "I swear I knew nothing about those marriage certificates..."

Dead silence greeted her.

"The Yunjiang incident seven years ago." Alexander's voice cut through like ice. "How did you obtain the West family's information?"

Isabella's breath hitched.

"I... I asked a friend abroad..." she stammered.

"Compile the documents and send them to me." The line went dead before she could respond.

When she tried calling back, she found herself blocked again.

"Well?" Mrs. Winslow asked anxiously.

Isabella clenched her phone until her knuckles turned white. "This isn't over..."

"Miss Sinclair, may we talk?" The next morning, the legal representative cornered Evelyn Sinclair at her office door.

Roman Young and Sophie hadn't arrived yet, leaving the two women alone.

"The company has decided to retract the termination notice." The legal rep forced a smile. "About that cease and desist letter..."

"When does the termination process conclude?" Evelyn interrupted bluntly.

The smile froze. "Miss Sinclair, forgiveness is a virtue..."

"Forgiveness?" Evelyn's laugh was cold. "The interview trap, the photo scandal, the cyberbullying—now you preach forgiveness?"

She stood, looking down at the legal rep. "I've already archived the cease and desist. If anything happens to me, Kingsley Group's legal team gets it immediately."

The legal rep shot to her feet, face pale.

"You're trying to destroy me!"

"Destroy you?" Evelyn shook her head lightly. "You're just a pawn. The real person who should worry is the one pulling your strings."

The legal rep fell silent, sweat soaking her blouse. She didn't dare mention their conversation was being monitored in real time.

"Relax." Evelyn's lips curved. "When this goes to court, I'll name the true mastermind. After all..."

Her gaze flicked meaningfully toward the ceiling. "If someone's taking the fall, it should be the right person."
###Chapter 273: Public Humiliation

The legal officer had already considered Evelyn Sinclair's threat.

If that cease and desist letter fell into Kingsley Group's legal team's hands, they would investigate relentlessly.

She refused to take the fall for Hugo Lee.

But being exposed by Evelyn in front of Hugo felt like being stripped naked in public.

"What do you want?" Her voice trembled.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "I'll give you an out. Tell your boss my terms are simple."

She paused. "I want him to publicly apologize in the company group chat for framing me, spreading rumors, and scheming against me."

"That's impossible!" The legal officer blurted. "There's no proof he—"

"Oh?" Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "Not involving the police is me being generous. Do you really think they wouldn't find evidence?"

She tapped the desk lightly. "Just deliver the message. Whether he complies isn't your concern."

The legal officer staggered out.

Roman Young and Charlie immediately entered.

"Evelyn, the transferred colleagues want to return—"

"No." She didn't look up. "I don't take back fence-sitters."

Hugo actually thought he could trade this for the letter. As foolish as his daughter.

"Evelyn, what did you discuss with legal?" Roman asked curiously.

After hearing her explanation, he gasped. "He'd never agree!"

"He will." Evelyn was confident.

Hugo didn't fear her—but he feared Alexander Kingsley.

Not everyone dared face Kingsley Group's elite legal team.

The legal officer soon returned. "The company will issue an official apology if you stay."

"The company?" Evelyn scoffed. "I want Hugo Lee's personal apology."

She pushed the resignation form forward. "Proceed with the paperwork."

The legal officer bit her lip, hesitating. "Your interview is scheduled for the front page tonight—"

"As it should be." Evelyn arched a brow. "Winston Strauss deserves that spot."

Unless Hugo lost his mind, he wouldn't waste such prime exposure.

The legal officer left defeated.

She returned shortly after.

"Mr. Lee will apologize on the company's behalf if you surrender the letter."

Evelyn suddenly reached into the officer's pocket and pulled out a listening device.

"Save it." She shoved it back. "My terms stand. His personal apology, and I stay. The letter stays with me."

Hugo finally caved.

He had someone draft an apology, then copy-pasted it into the company chat himself.

The message exploded across Horizon Media.

The boss publicly admitting guilt? Unprecedented.

His daughter's failed scheme landed her in jail. Now his own attempt backfired spectacularly.

When word reached headquarters, William Yearwood was stunned. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Lost my mind?" Hugo trembled with rage. "That's Evelyn Sinclair for you—Autumn Detail's daughter! Mark my words, I'll destroy her!"

William stayed silent.

If someone else dealt with Evelyn, all the better.

Julian Ashford had cut ties with her anyway, even agreeing to blind dates.

That pawn was useless now.

Vincent Sullivan called next. "Hugo, was it really you?"

Hugo nearly smashed his phone.

"Evelyn is my cousin's goddaughter," Vincent reasoned. "For my sake—"

"Your cousin?" Hugo sneered. "The recluse who refused interviews for a decade, yet welcomed her with open arms?"

Vincent hung up, realizing persuasion was futile.

The company chat fell eerily silent.

The quiet only emphasized the shockwaves rippling through the staff.

Hugo Lee—a founding executive—bowing to some junior employee?

His daughter awaited trial while he suffered public humiliation...

Just then, Isabella Winslow's call came through.
###Chapter 274: Lord Alex's Rising Temper

"Uncle Lee, I'm abroad right now and can't handle things personally. I deeply appreciate what you've done for me." Isabella Winslow's voice dripped with calculated sweetness through the phone.

Hugo Lee narrowed his eyes, fingers tapping the desk. "You flatter me, Miss Winslow. This old man only has so much use left."

"Don't be modest." She gave a light laugh. "There's another small favor I'd like to ask. Compensation won't be an issue."

The rustling of papers sounded from the other end.

"Evelyn Sinclair?" Hugo feigned ignorance.

"You always understand me." Isabella's tone turned icy. "Help me with this, and Melissa's situation will be taken care of."

Hugo's breath hitched audibly.

"You know who backs me." Her words carried a veiled threat. "This trivial matter only requires a single word from you."

......

That night, Evelyn's interview video exploded across the internet.

The hashtag #EvelynSinclairsDivineBeauty rocketed to the top of trending lists at staggering speed.

[Her looks put every celebrity to shame]

[Isabella looks like a maid next to her]

[Only a blind man would choose anyone over her]

Amid the flood of praise, several jarring comments stood out:

[That's clearly a plastic surgery face]

[Professional homewrecker]

Kingsley Group's conference room. Ethan Miller cautiously presented his phone. "Lord Alex, your wife is trending."

Alexander Kingsley's gaze darkened as he scanned the screen. "Why are these pests still crawling around?"

Ethan's back stiffened.

"Comments three, five, and seven." Alexander tapped the display with elegant fingers. "Must I teach you how to dispose of garbage?"

"I'll handle it immediately." Beads of sweat formed on Ethan's forehead.

"Wait." Alexander stopped him. "Screenshot every compliment about her."

Ethan paused. "...Understood."

......

The next morning at Horizon Media's executive meeting.

Vincent Sullivan slid a proposal toward Hugo. "Evelyn's metrics are outstanding. I recommend launching a personal column for her."

Hugo responded with a cold laugh, slamming down a stack of documents. "Outstanding? Look at these negative search results!"

The room fell silent.

"Her approval ratio is dangerously low." Hugo rapped the table. "Who takes responsibility if she crashes after we invest resources?"

Vincent frowned while reviewing the data, his expression growing grave.

News spread through the company like wildfire.

"Evelyn, look at this!" Iris Cooper stomped in frustration, shoving her phone forward.

A coordinated smear campaign had erupted across platforms, all using the code name "Journalism's Little Rain" to depict Evelyn's alleged sexual exploits.

The most outrageous claim stated:

[At sixteen, Little Rain already knew to unbutton her blouse to the third button in teachers' offices]
###Chapter 275: The Absurd Fabrication

...

The gossip-laden article painted a sensationalized account of Sophie's supposed "social climbing history."

The most outrageous claim came in the final paragraphs—alleging Sophie had seduced an elderly sugar daddy old enough to be her grandfather, who lavished fortunes on her.

Vivid details described their transactional relationship: he provided resources and connections while she offered youthful beauty. The narrative grew more ludicrous, asserting Sophie desperately sought to bear his child.

Reportedly, the childless tycoon promised half his estate for any offspring. But due to past lifestyle choices causing infertility, Sophie allegedly underwent expensive fertility treatments for a precarious pregnancy.

The hard-won pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Worse, the sugar daddy's health rapidly declined. Desperate, Sophie supposedly sought new patronage—leading to her clash with Summer Sky Entertainment.

The article portrayed Sophie as a scheming femme fatale. She allegedly fabricated an affair with a finance prodigy to sabotage his relationship, exploiting his need for privacy to gain advantage.

The cruelest irony? It hinted the sugar daddy condoned this—playing the doting "father figure" to secure his mistress's future.

...

Though patently absurd, the story went viral.

Even non-fans devoured the scandal. Planted comments in curated discussion threads pointed fingers at Evelyn Sinclair.

"If only the fan club still existed!" Iris Cooper fumed. "At least someone could defend you."

These Buzz Accounts were cunning. Using pseudonyms, they could claim fictional storytelling if sued. Deleting posts only fueled conspiracy theories about powerful suppression.

Evelyn reassured her: "Disbanding was right. They shouldn't waste time on my troubles."

"Our priority is finding that interviewee." Roman Young tapped forged documents—only the photo was genuine.

Iris frowned. "What good would that do?"

"It's our breakthrough." Evelyn's gaze hardened. "I'll make Hugo Lee retract these lies himself."

Her instincts rarely erred. This mysterious applicant held the key.

...

Before leaving work, Eleanor Kingsley called.

"Evelyn, could you and Alexander come for dinner tonight?"

The gentle tone held caution. Evelyn understood—the scandal had reached the Kingsleys.
###Chapter 276: Whatever You Say, Mother

Evelyn stared at her phone screen for three seconds.

The caller ID showing "Eleanor Kingsley" made her fingers hesitate. At this hour, it could only mean...

"Evelyn, are you free for dinner tonight?" Eleanor's voice carried cautious hope.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. She could conjure a hundred excuses, but refusing Eleanor always felt like swallowing glass.

"Alright," she heard herself say.

Eleanor's relief was palpable, her words instantly brighter. "Perfect. I'll send the car for you after work."

The moment the call ended, Eleanor dialed another number.

"Evelyn's coming for dinner. What about you?" No pleasantries.

Paper rustled in the background. Alexander's voice was ice. "Meeting tonight."

"So you're not coming?" Eleanor chirped. "Good. Saves the staff from cleaning your room."

Alexander: "......"

"Oh," Eleanor added sweetly, "Evelyn and I need some girl time anyway."

The line went dead.

Alexander glared at the darkened screen, brow furrowing.

"Lord Alex," Nathan entered, "tonight's conference—"

"Cancel it." Alexander stood, checking his watch. "Reschedule everything."

He needed time... to prepare.

Living at Kingsbury had made him lax. But facing Evelyn required... effort.

The razor glided over his stubble. The man in the mirror wore a self-deprecating smirk.

Eleanor had spies everywhere. That traitor Ethan probably reported his underwear color daily.

What cosmic debt had he incurred to deserve such a mother?

......

Freshly groomed, Alexander strode into the Kingsley mansion. Eleanor sipped tea, feigning surprise.

"My, my," she trilled, "look who's here."

Alexander ignored her, scanning the empty living room.

No Evelyn.

"I told her not to come," Eleanor mused. "Since you weren't."

Expressionless, Alexander sank onto the sofa and pulled out his phone.

"Why stay?" Eleanor prodded. "This is just a hotel to you."

His grip tightened around the silent device.

Thirty minutes later, an engine purred in the driveway.

Eleanor's eyebrow arched as Alexander's fingers froze mid-scroll.

"Evelyn!" she sang theatrically.

Alexander's head snapped up.

The doorway remained empty.

"False alarm." Eleanor smiled beatifically.

Alexander inhaled sharply. "Mother."

"What?" She blinked innocently. "Can't a mother tease her son?"

"Eleanor," Alexander forced a smile, "enough."

Tears welled in Eleanor's eyes. "You won't even call me 'Mom' anymore? What did I—"

"Mom!" Evelyn's voice cut in from the foyer. "Are you alright?"

She rushed to Eleanor's side, shooting Alexander a reproachful look.

Eleanor clutched Evelyn's hand. "At least someone calls me Mom."

Evelyn patted her arm. "We'll visit more often."

Eleanor's triumphant glance at Alexander spoke volumes.

Alexander: "......"

Fine. Whatever makes you happy.

......

Dinner began late with Patriarch Kingsley's delayed arrival.

Evelyn noticed Madeline's strained smile despite her efforts.

"Eat." Alexander deposited food on Evelyn's plate, frowning at her untouched bird's nest soup. "What do you even consume at work?"

This unleashed Madeline's concern. "We should have meals delivered to you."

"No need, Grandma." Evelyn smiled. "I manage."

Madeline's face stiffened.

Post-dinner, conversation flowed in the parlor.

Patriarch Kingsley praised Evelyn's Winston Strauss interview. "Brilliant questions. Left him speechless."

As Evelyn demurred, Madeline interjected, "But... no inappropriate rumors, I hope?"

The room plunged into silence.
###Chapter 277: Rumors About Evelyn's Child

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

"What gossip could there be?" Eleanor interjected quickly. "Winston was photographed dating his assistant recently. Evelyn is the perfect person to interview him."

"That's not what I meant..." Madeline's gaze shifted uncomfortably. She shot Eleanor a reproachful look.

They had agreed on this beforehand—why was Eleanor staying silent now?

Taking a deep breath, Madeline steeled herself to play the villain.

She had promised not to interfere in the couple's affairs, but this concerned the Kingsley family's reputation.

"Evelyn, I've heard some unpleasant rumors lately." Madeline pulled out her phone. "Several of my group chats are spreading... Of course I know it's all lies, but—"

"It's being handled." Alexander's icy voice cut through. "The gossip accounts are already retracting their statements and apologizing."

Though he opposed Evelyn continuing her career, he refused to tolerate his grandmother's veiled accusations.

"Can you really erase every trace?" Madeline glared at her grandson. "My brilliant, accomplished grandson married Evelyn properly, yet they're calling you some old man—"

"Mother..." Eleanor tried to intervene.

"And what about that man at the hotel? Surely that wasn't you?" Madeline grew more agitated. "I understand you young people enjoy secret marriages, but you'll have to go public eventually. How will the Kingsleys save face then?"

Evelyn lowered her eyes.

She had never intended to make her marriage to Alexander public.

Their union had been a matter of convenience from the start.

Given the chance, she would have left long ago—disappeared to raise their child alone.

"That was an interview." Alexander spoke abruptly. "A deliberate setup."

"Since when do the Kingsleys fear gossip?" His laugh was cold. "Those same people will be scrambling to curry favor with Evelyn soon enough."

"How can you know what they say behind closed doors?" Madeline pressed.

"Are we to police every whisper now?" The Patriarch had heard enough. "Going public won't stop the rumors!"

"But—"

"Evelyn's already being targeted in secret. Imagine the attacks if they went public!"

"Must they hide forever?"

"Why the urgency?"

The elderly couple's argument escalated, ending in a bitter stalemate.

Alexander had anticipated this.

The Kingsleys were shrewd—all except Madeline, who insisted on stirring trouble.

His only solace was Evelyn choosing to stay.

After the gathering, Eleanor pulled Evelyn aside while Alexander was summoned to his father's study for a status update—the Patriarch's favorite pastime.

Only Madeline remained excluded.

Frustration welled up until she cornered Alexander in the hallway, eyes glistening.

"Alexander, I only want what's best for Evelyn!" she whispered fiercely. "The rumors claim... the child wasn't yours..."

Alexander froze.

"Who said that?" His voice turned lethal.

Unheeding, Madeline continued, "They say she used a surrogate. Not that it matters now—the child is gone anyway."

"Grandmother." Alexander turned slowly. "Do you think I'd raise another man's child?"

"Of course not." She glanced around nervously. "So... it was yours after all?"

A vein pulsed at Alexander's temple.

"She could only carry my child." The words were ground between his teeth.

Even if it weren't true—his word made it so.

"But the timeline..." Madeline hesitated. "Weren't you separated then?"

"Who told you that?" His gaze sharpened like a blade. "I warned you to stay away from certain people."

"I haven't contacted Isabella!" Madeline flushed angrily. "She's blocked! Fine—wear those horns proudly then!"

Alexander knew further conversation was pointless.

He strode toward their bedroom, his hand trembling slightly on the doorknob.

For a fleeting moment, he was transported back over a decade—to a late night when faint knocking had roused him.

Opening the door, he'd found a tearful little Evelyn clutching her stuffed toy.
###Chapter 278: Waking from Dreams, Trespassing into His Domain

"What madness is this?" The young man's eyes burned with sleep-deprived fury, his voice a dangerous rasp.

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers trembled around her stuffed toy. "I dreamed of Mom...she took me to the rooftop..."

"Shut up!" Alexander Kingsley's interruption was brutal. "Where are you now?"

Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered, "...outside your door."

"The rooftop?"

"No..."

"Then get the hell back to bed!"

Evelyn shrank away.

"Stop." His command froze her mid-step.

"I-I'll go sleep now..." She resembled a startled rabbit.

Alexander exhaled sharply before yanking the stuffed animal's ear, dragging both girl and toy into his room.

He shoved her onto the bed, wrapping the comforter around her like a cocoon. Only her glistening eyes remained visible.

"Will you stay with me, Alex?"

"Too old for this." He viciously tucked in the edges. "I'm sleeping next door."

At the threshold, he turned back, jabbing a finger at her feigned slumber. "One more sound and you'll regret it."

......

Alexander tossed in the guest room.

Evelyn's pitiful expression haunted him.

Of all the servants she could've disturbed, she chose him.

In his drowsy state, her imagined chatter tormented him. That persistent "Alex" echoed as she squirmed like a restless kitten against him in his dreams.

"Stay still!" He growled, seizing her.

The girl in his arms fought back fiercely.

The dream spiraled into absurdity.

Her puffed cheeks amused him despite himself. She retaliated by clinging like an octopus.

"Does Julian spoil you like this?" The bitter question escaped him.

Evelyn shook her head frantically, eyes wide.

As he released her, sharp pain lanced his neck—

"Ah!"

Alexander jolted awake to find the blankets ripped away.

"Rise and shine!" Evelyn chirped, standing triumphantly bedside.

He yanked the covers back. "Out!"

Her smile faltered. "Aunt Eleanor said—"

"Now!"

Only when the door clicked shut did he dare emerge.

Morning light revealed his disheveled state.

That ridiculous dream had left him...

......

The turning lock shattered his memories.

Alexander entered the apartment, scanning the empty bedroom.

"Still not back?"

He pivoted toward the study—and froze.

Evelyn curled on the sofa, an open book across her lap.

"I'll sleep here." She gestured to the folded bedding.

His pupils contracted.

Alexander hauled her upright. "This is my territory."

"Thought you might tamper with it." The instant the words left his mouth, he caught her flinch.

"Should I go next door then?" Her voice was featherlight.

"Master bedroom. Now." His order was glacial.

In the bathroom, Evelyn frowned at the sheer silk nightgown.

This revealing thing...

Sinking into the plush bedding, she inhaled sunshine-scented linens that transported her to that distant night.

A nightmare had driven her to his door all those years ago...
###Chapter 279: Someone Always Tames You

The room remained exactly as she remembered.

Evelyn's fingertips traced the nightstand, finding the same shallow scratch still there.

Alexander had preserved this place untouched for years.

She lay back on the bed, gazing at the intricate ceiling patterns.

Memories flooded in.

That winter, she'd curled up in these sheets permeated with his scent—so warm and comforting.

But the next morning, her cheerful attempt to wake him earned only an icy glare.

From that moment, she'd learned to tread carefully.

Afraid any word or gesture might annoy him.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

It's over.

Both sweet and bitter recollections dissolved into these three words.

Sleep began claiming her.

Knock knock knock—

The urgent rapping jolted her awake.

"Who?" Alexander's voice came from the study.

"Me." Eleanor's gentle tones floated through the door. "Bringing something for Evelyn."

Evelyn bolted upright.

She dashed barefoot to the study, colliding with Alexander as he moved to answer.

"Go back!" She shoved him inside, whispering fiercely. "You can't greet her like this!"

His shirt hung open at the collar, revealing his collarbone.

Evelyn frantically straightened the study before opening the door.

"Mom."

Eleanor carried a tray bearing two delicate soup bowls.

"Special tonics for you both." She winked conspiratorially. "Alexander gets calming brew. Evelyn's is..."

Her lips formed silent words: For pregnancy.

Evelyn's ears burned.

This midnight delivery was clearly an inspection in disguise.

"Where's Alexander?" Eleanor's eyes swept the room.

"Showering." Evelyn forced the lie.

Alexander played along—water sounds promptly emanated from the bathroom.

Eleanor's knowing "Oh" stretched as she settled on the sofa.

"I'll wait. Wouldn't want you drinking the wrong one."

Her gaze lingered on the neatly made bed, sighing almost imperceptibly.

Her foolish son couldn't recognize an opportunity if it slapped him.

The bathroom door opened.

Alexander emerged towel-drying his hair, scowling at Eleanor.

"Just leave the soup."

"Absolutely not." She pointed. "This bowl's for pregnancy. That one's calming."

Alexander smirked. "Let her drink first then."

"I'm watching to be sure." Eleanor stood her ground.

Evelyn suddenly grabbed a bowl and drained it.

"Your turn." She set the empty dish down, staring at Alexander.

Alexander: "......"

Eleanor arched a triumphant brow.

After a tense silence, Alexander snatched the remaining bowl and gulped two mouthfuls.

"Happy now?"

Eleanor rose, sniffing as she passed him: "Someone always tames you."

Silence reclaimed the room after the door clicked shut.

Evelyn returned to bed, cocooning herself in blankets.

Alexander eyed the sliver of remaining mattress and stalked back to the study.

Ten minutes later.

Knock knock knock!

The pounding resumed.

Alexander yanked the door open, scowling.

Eleanor stood unabashed. "Evelyn left her phone."

"My phone's here." Evelyn held it up.

"Must've been mistaken..." Eleanor craned her neck, peering past him.

Alexander slammed the door.

"Keep this up and I'll knock all night!" Eleanor's hissed threat slipped through the gap.

Inside, Alexander's expression darkened.

He strode to the bedroom and threw back the covers.

Before Evelyn could react, the mattress dipped beside her.
###Chapter 280: I Wanted to Pretend Too

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she finally understood Eleanor's intention.

She had noticed Eleanor's subtle maneuvers but chose to ignore them. The older woman clearly knew about their marital struggles and was trying to reconcile them.

"Sleep." Alexander's voice cut through the darkness, strained with restraint.

Evelyn lay rigid beside him.

Sharing a bed felt foreign now. Those midnight intrusions in her rented apartment had left scars.

Silence stretched between them.

"Waiting for me?" Alexander suddenly growled through clenched teeth.

Evelyn flinched at the accusation.

Fabric rustled as he abruptly sat up, muttering a curse before storming into the bathroom again.

She bolted upright.

The shower's roar seeped through the door as she sat frozen, pulse hammering.

......

Four times that night, Alexander retreated to the bathroom.

Each return brought icy droplets rolling down his feverish skin, his darkened gaze swallowing her whole.

Exhaustion finally claimed her before dawn.

The alarm blared twice before rousing her.

Fumbling for her phone, she registered the scorching weight pressed against her back.

Five seconds passed before she recognized Alexander's form.

Her fingers brushed his abdomen—burning.

"Alexander!" She shoved at his unresponsive body.

His brow furrowed in distress.

A touch to his forehead confirmed the raging fever.

She scrambled to call for help.

"Eve..." A weak plea stopped her.

"C-cold..." His fingertips felt like death.

She clasped his freezing hand between hers.

"Eve..." Half-lidded eyes pinned her in place. "Stay..."

Delirium glazed his words.

Alexander's illnesses always hit hard. She needed a doctor, but his grip turned vise-like.

"Eve..." He pressed his fiery forehead to her knuckles. "Hurts..."

"Let me call the physician." She bent closer.

He shook his head, rubbing against her skin like a wounded animal.

Nathan's ringtone shattered the moment.

She reached for it.

Alexander knocked the phone away.

"I said no calls!" His ragged breath burned her cheek.

Nathan's silence spoke volumes through the speaker.

"He's ill," Evelyn managed before Alexander's wandering hands startled her.

"Stop!"

"Eve..." His broken whisper cracked. "Sorry..."

"You need medical attention!" She pushed sweat-dampened hair from his brow. "Please?"

After an eternity, he gasped, "Last night's soup..."

Understanding dawned with horrifying clarity.

"Eve," clearer now, "next time... either don't come back... or play along..."

The entire Kingsley household saw through their charade. Without this pretense, Madeline wouldn't have believed those vile rumors questioning the baby's paternity.

"I wanted to pretend..." His face buried against her, voice fracturing. "Wanted to believe this child was mine... but you have to meet me halfway..."

"Did you ever consider..." Her teeth sank into her lip. "That it really is yours?"

Silence.

Her heartbeat pounded in her ears.

When awareness returned, her fingertips found wetness on his cheeks.

His hand slipped away, limp.
###Chapter 281: What's the Use of Such a Son

"Alexander Kingsley!" Evelyn Sinclair's voice trembled with alarm. "Don't scare me like this!"

...

Dawn had barely broken when chaos erupted at the Kingsley estate.

"How did this happen?" Madeline Kingsley stomped her foot in frustration before rounding on Evelyn. "You were right beside him! How could you miss such a high fever?"

Evelyn opened her mouth, her throat tight.

"Mother, it was the middle of the night," Eleanor Kingsley interjected quickly. "No one would've noticed."

Madeline huffed angrily but swallowed her retort.

The doctor was examining Alexander, diagnosing a severe fever caused by influenza.

"Strange," Eleanor frowned. "He was perfectly fine last night..."

"What exactly happened?" Madeline paced anxiously. "He finally comes home, and now this? God knows how he's been neglecting himself out there!"

She turned to interrogate Evelyn again when a phone ringtone cut through the tension.

"I need to take this." Evelyn glanced at the caller ID and stepped away.

"Evelyn, we've located the man," Roman Young's hushed voice came through.

"Where?" Evelyn tensed immediately.

"Lotus Avenue in the Mountain District. There's a conference hotel..." Roman relayed quickly. "I'll send the exact coordinates. Should I go first or—"

"You go ahead." Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Keep sharing your location. I'll be there as soon as possible."

Ending the call, Evelyn returned with an apologetic expression.

"There's an emergency at work. I need to handle it..."

"Go, go." Eleanor waved her off.

Patriarch Kingsley nodded. "Shall I have your father-in-law drive you?"

"Thank you, Father." Evelyn accepted gracefully before hurrying out.

No sooner had she left than the doctor emerged. "Lord Alex is awake. He's asking for Madam Sinclair."

"Tell him Evelyn had to leave for work!" the Patriarch called over his shoulder as he rushed inside.

Though his fever had broken, Alexander remained pale in the sickbed. His gaze swept the room before dimming noticeably.

"Evelyn had a work emergency. Your father drove her," Eleanor explained nervously.

Alexander gave a quiet "Hmm."

Madeline's eyes flashed with frustration. "I'm calling her back right now!"

"Nonsense!" the Patriarch snapped.

"How is this nonsense?" the matriarch exploded. "Is she the only busy one in this family? With Alexander this ill, she still cares about work?"

Her anger escalated. "Not that her work amounts to much—just endless scandals!"

"Enough," the Patriarch scowled.

Madeline turned on Eleanor. "Am I not even allowed to speak now? Do I have no place in this house anymore?"

"Mother, that's not what I meant—" Eleanor forced a conciliatory smile.

"Enough." Alexander's hoarse voice cut through. "I need quiet."

Madeline froze before tears spilled over. "You all find me tiresome, don't you? That Sinclair girl is the only precious one here now!"

She stormed out, wiping her eyes.

"Mother!" Eleanor moved to follow but was stopped by the Patriarch. "I'll go. You'll only bear the brunt of her temper."

Silence finally settled in the room.

"What exactly—" Eleanor began at last.

"Happy now?" Alexander's gaze was razor-sharp.

Eleanor laughed bitterly. "Happy? What mother would be happy seeing her son in this state?"

She turned on her heel. "What's the use of you anyway!"

Alexander picked up his phone, checking call records. Despite his fever, he remembered an incoming call.

Nathan Carter.

The line connected. "Lord Alex, are you feeling better?"

"What did you say earlier?"

"Just reminding you about today's schedule..." Nathan sounded confused.

"Who answered?" Alexander got straight to the point.
###Chapter 282: The Obsession Laid Bare

Nathan instantly understood.

"Young Madam," he answered respectfully.

Alexander Kingsley's next words confirmed his suspicion. "What did she say?"

"Young Madam mentioned you're ill and might need leave today. She said she'd take care of you." Nathan repeated mechanically.

A cold chuckle came through the phone, the hoarse voice sending chills down Nathan's spine.

"That last part—did you make it up?"

Nathan hesitated. "...Not entirely."

"Her exact words." Alexander's tone darkened.

Nathan dared not conceal the truth any longer. "Young Madam said she'd call a doctor."

Alexander ignored this. "Proceed as scheduled. I'll be there shortly."

"But..." Nathan was stunned.

Earlier, he'd clearly heard how severely ill Alexander sounded.

Yet now...

"Problem?" Alexander countered.

"No. I'll make arrangements immediately." Nathan responded swiftly.

Alexander forced himself up, each step feeling like walking on cotton, yet he stubbornly dressed properly.

Evelyn Sinclair had truly meant only to summon a doctor—nothing more.

Those cutting words from Madeline Kingsley, though unpleasant to hear, held undeniable truth.

Her insignificant job would always take precedence over him. Even if he died before her eyes, she'd probably just calmly contact the funeral home.

"Alex! Where are you going?" Madeline blocked the mansion's entrance. "Your father already went to the office. Can't you just rest at home? Look at your pallor—are you trying to kill yourself?"

Patriarch Kingsley and Eleanor Kingsley hurried over at the commotion.

Eleanor's temper flared at her son's ashen face, barely swallowing the words "Go ahead and drop dead for all I care."

The Patriarch mediated, "He knows his limits. He won't push himself beyond them."

Madeline wiped her tears. "Must we wait for disaster to strike before regretting? I can't control him, and those who can won't!"

"Alex," Eleanor spoke first, "let your father handle things. You need rest."

"He can't." Alexander's voice was gravelly.

Though both men held equal authority within Kingsley Group, their responsibilities were clearly divided and non-interfering.

"Move." Alexander tried to step around Madeline but found himself firmly blocked.

She stood her ground. "You're just upset Evelyn prioritized work over you, aren't you? I'll summon her back immediately!"

"Mother—" Eleanor began.

"Quiet!" Madeline snapped. "Don't think I don't know what you're scheming? Would you be happy if something happened to him?"

"That's not—" Eleanor found herself tongue-tied.

Madeline reached for Alexander's arm, intending only to emphasize her point. To her shock, the slight tug sent him staggering several steps until he braced against the wall.

"Alex!" Eleanor gasped, rushing downstairs. "Stay home and rest!"

After all, he was still her son. She couldn't truly watch him self-destruct.

Alexander frowned irritably. "I know what I'm doing."

He'd taken medicine, received IV fluids. Work would distract him from spiraling thoughts.

"I'll have Evelyn return," Eleanor grasped his wrist. "If she comes back, you'll stay, yes?"

Alexander didn't want to admit it, but the offer was too tempting.

"She won't come," he said coldly.

"If I summon her, she wouldn't dare refuse!" Eleanor declared confidently.

Alexander studied his mother, verifying her sincerity.

"Fine. Evelyn will be here shortly. No more talk of the office." Madeline reached for him again.

Alexander shook her off but ceased insisting on leaving.

......

"Boss, Roman went to the Lakeside District," Wendy reported furtively. "I overheard him mention heading to the Lotus Conference Hotel..."

"What!" Xavier Stapleton shot up from his seat. "Say that again!"

Startled, Wendy repeated herself.

"When did he leave?" Xavier's face darkened. "Why only tell me now?"

"Just now. You can still catch up..." Wendy volunteered.

"Stay put!" Xavier was already rushing out.

......

"Evelyn, the car's rented. Can you see my location?" Roman spoke through the phone while driving.

"Got it. I'll be right there." Evelyn glanced at the chauffeur. She'd wanted to drive herself, but Mr. Kingsley had insisted on assigning a professional.

Evelyn focused on the moving GPS dot, taking a deep breath.

She didn't know how Roman had tracked down that interviewee, but this time, they'd expose the mastermind.

What puzzled her most was Alexander's attitude.

Someone had impersonated him to spread rumors, yet he remained indifferent—even pleased.

He... wanted their relationship publicized.

Why not let others do the work for him?

Once exposed, another obstacle to her departure would emerge.

And this method violated no terms of their agreement.
###Chapter 283: Begging for Evelyn's Return

The phone's sudden ringtone startled Evelyn Sinclair from her thoughts as she stood by the floor-to-ceiling window.

Eleanor Kingsley's name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn..." The voice on the other end wavered with hesitation. "Are you... busy today?"

Evelyn's instincts sharpened immediately. "What's wrong?"

"Alexander..." Eleanor's words trailed off. "He woke up and insisted on going to Kingsley Group. The doctors said leaving in his condition would be suicidal..."

Evelyn tightened her grip on the phone.

When she'd left that morning, Alexander Kingsley had been delirious with fever.

Now he wanted to work?

"Is he insane?" The words burst from her lips. "Will Kingsley Group collapse without him for one day?"

"The doctor said he could drop dead any moment if this continues." Eleanor's voice trembled. "I lied that you'd return soon to keep him in bed..."

Evelyn bit her lip.

She had urgent matters today.

"I'll come back after finishing my business." She finally relented.

Hanging up, Eleanor turned to the figure in the hospital bed.

"Evelyn said she'll return after her errands."

Alexander lay with half-closed eyes, his face parchment-white.

"Where did she go?" His voice was a ragged whisper.

"Some work emergency..."

Alexander's bloodshot eyes flew open.

"Mom," he rasped, "beg her... to quit that job..."

Eleanor stared at her son in shock.

"Absolutely not." Her refusal was ironclad. "You're the one who neglected her. You have no right to control her now."

Alexander's fingers twisted the sheets.

"I'm begging you..." His voice shook. "Make her come back... now..."

Eleanor inhaled sharply.

She'd never seen her son so broken.

"Calm down—"

Alexander suddenly lunged up, yanking the IV from his hand.

"I'm going to Kingsley Group!" He struggled to rise. "I have to—"

"Have you lost your mind?" Eleanor screamed, pinning him down. "Doctors! Help!"

Medical staff rushed in as Alexander thrashed violently.

"Call her back!" He glared at his mother. "Now!"

With trembling hands, Eleanor dialed Evelyn.

"Evelyn..." Her voice quivered. "Can you... come back immediately?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Mom, what's happening?"

Alexander snatched the phone. "Come home now!" He collapsed back onto the pillows.

After examining him, the doctor pulled Eleanor aside.

"We recommend hospitalization for full evaluation." His voice dropped. "His condition... is critical."

Eleanor's legs nearly gave out.

"And..." The doctor hesitated. "Lord Alex may be showing signs of depression..."

As Eleanor prepared to argue, her phone rang again.

Evelyn's voice carried unprecedented gravity.

"Mom... there's been an accident..."
###Chapter 284: A Life-or-Death Decision

Xavier Stapleton's fingers tightened and loosened on the steering wheel.

When he saw Roman Young drive away from the rental car agency in that beat-up sedan, a dark glint flashed in his eyes.

This persistent bastard had actually tracked down Madam Zade's schedule today.

Ever since Roman joined Evelyn Sinclair's department, Xavier had felt like prey marked by a venomous snake. His carefully woven lies could be exposed at any moment.

Madam Zade's "frail health" had been his perfect cover. Hugo Lee had no choice but to take over the company while she remained bedridden, keeping constant vigil by her mother's side.

But Roman was like a shark that had caught the scent of blood—relentless in his pursuit.

Xavier's grip on the wheel turned white-knuckled as he stared at the rickety car ahead.

He should have dealt with this sooner.

All the humiliation, exclusion, and suppression had been nothing but minor irritations to that lowlife. Roman's endurance was beyond expectation.

Xavier pressed the accelerator harder.

Up ahead was the perfect spot—a construction site with a deep pit, cordoned off by barriers.

"Evelyn, I see the hotel," Roman's voice came through the phone. "Should I stake it out first or—"

A deafening crash suddenly exploded through the line.

Evelyn nearly dropped her phone.

"Roman!" she shouted into the receiver, but only static answered her.

The GPS showed his location near an abandoned construction site on Lotus Boulevard.

"Lewis, hurry!" Evelyn's voice was strained.

By the time Roman spotted the familiar Raptor SUV in his rearview mirror, it was too late.

The impact sent his car lurching violently. The airbag deployed instantly, and darkness swallowed his vision—his last conscious thought was of Xavier's twisted face.

Both vehicles teetered precariously on the edge of the pit.

"Madam, be careful!"

Lewis lunged toward the SUV while Evelyn sprinted to Roman's car.

The sound of shattering glass pierced the air. Just as Evelyn dragged Roman's unconscious body from the wreckage, his car plummeted into the abyss.

Almost simultaneously, the SUV followed.

Lewis barely managed to pull a bloodied Xavier to safety.

"Call an ambulance." Evelyn's voice was eerily calm, though her fingers trembled slightly.

She dialed Eleanor Kingsley. "Mom, my colleague was in an accident..."

Eleanor's frantic questions came through, but Evelyn gave only a brief explanation before hanging up.

In the hospital corridor, a doctor rushed over. "The patient needs RH-negative blood. The blood bank is running low—"

Before he could finish, Hugo Lee arrived with hospital administrators in tow.

"Transfuse him immediately!" Hugo's command brooked no argument.

Evelyn stood aside, watching the medical team work, her phone clutched tightly in hand. This accident held far too many buried secrets.
###Chapter 285: Save Him If You Can

"The patient is Xavier Stapleton." Hugo Lee emphasized, his gaze sweeping over Evelyn Sinclair. "RH negative blood. Don't make any mistakes."

The doctor frowned at the test results. "But—"

"Execute immediately!" The hospital director cut him off sharply. "Get the blood from the bank now."

Turning to Hugo, the director plastered on an obsequious smile. "Mr. Lee, shall we check on the patient?"

Before leaving, Hugo shot Evelyn a triumphant look.

"Doctor!" Evelyn stopped the medical staff. "My colleague is also RH negative. Can you—"

"Sorry," the doctor shook his head. "We only have one bag of blood, and—"

"These are two lives!"

"Please contact his family immediately." The doctor hurried away. "Direct relatives have higher matching probabilities."

The hallway was now empty except for Evelyn and Old Lewis.

"Young Madam..."

"Uncle Lewis," Evelyn lowered her voice. "Remember the hospital where I had my prenatal checkups?"

Old Lewis nodded.

"I'll call them to arrange a blood transfer," Evelyn spoke rapidly. "You need to personally retrieve it."

"Why not have them deliver it directly?"

"No." Evelyn's eyes sharpened. "Hugo's people will intercept it."

She quickly dialed the number and made the arrangements.

"Uncle Lewis, meet them halfway. Be careful."

Evelyn stared at the red light above the operating room.

She should have transferred Roman Young to another hospital.

But some truths had to be uncovered here.

The resemblance between Madam Zade and Roman was unsettling.

The workplace ostracization Roman faced, Xavier's viciousness today—

It was all too suspicious.

Commotion suddenly erupted at the end of the hallway.

Vincent Sullivan strode in with his assistant.

"Mr. Sullivan!" A doctor rushed forward. "Your son is out of danger."

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

So soon?

Xavier never needed that blood!

"Mr. Sullivan!" She stood abruptly.

"Vincent!" Hugo appeared out of nowhere. "Xavier has been asking for you."

Vincent's eyes flickered between them.

"Xavier already received the transfusion," Evelyn interjected. "Mr. Sullivan, what's your blood type?"

"None of your business!" Hugo snapped.

Evelyn ignored him completely. "Mr. Sullivan, my colleague is dying. He's also RH negative—"

"What's his name?" Vincent suddenly asked.

"Vincent!" Hugo was sweating now. "Don't listen to her nonsense!"

"Mr. Lee stole the only available blood," Evelyn stood her ground. "Are you really going to let my colleague die?"

"You—"

"Let her finish." Vincent waved a hand.

"His name is Roman Young," Evelyn watched Vincent closely. "From Guangming Village, Chiyuan County, Province C."

Vincent visibly stiffened.

"Guangming Village? The surname Young?"

"Xavier is waiting!" Hugo's voice trembled.

Evelyn grabbed Vincent's sleeve. "Please, save him!"

Hugo moved to shove her away.

Vincent blocked him. "Which characters for his name?"

"Epitaph's 'Ming,' dawn's 'Chen.'"

After two seconds of silence, Vincent rolled up his sleeve. "Take me to him."

"Vincent!" Hugo turned ashen. "At your age—"

"Move." Vincent's voice was ice.
###Chapter 286: Blood Bargain

"I'm Rh negative." Evelyn Sinclair met Hugo Lee's gaze steadily, her voice firm.

Hugo's hand trembled slightly. "Th-That's impossible..."

Evelyn turned to the medical staff with a nod. "No need for tests. I had a full checkup last week."

"Evelyn!" Hugo grabbed her wrist, his voice a harsh whisper. "What game are you playing?"

Her lips curled in disdain. "Why so nervous, Mr. Lee? It's just saving a life. If you hadn't guarded that blood bag like a dragon, I wouldn't have needed to ask Mr. Sullivan."

She shook off his grip. "Strange how the donor is willing while you hesitate. Unless..."

Hugo's face darkened.

"Relax," Evelyn lowered her voice. "I only want the blood to save someone. But keep obstructing me, and I might reconsider."

Vincent Sullivan had just settled into the donation chair when Evelyn's phone buzzed.

"Madam, we have the blood," Old Lin's tense voice came through. "The doctor's with us."

Evelyn glanced at Vincent mid-donation and stepped into the hallway. "Proceed first—"

By her return, the nurse was removing the needle from Vincent's arm.

"Mr. Sullivan, this amount will stabilize the patient. We'll source more soon," the doctor assured.

Vincent frowned. "This little is enough?"

"Plenty. Thank you for saving a life today." Evelyn's gratitude was genuine.

Vincent waved it off. "Just doing my part."

A memory surfaced. "My wife once stayed in Chiyuan County. The family hosting us was named Young too. She named their unborn child... Mingchen, was it?"

Outside the door, Hugo froze.

"Common name," Evelyn chuckled. "What are the odds?"

As Vincent rose, Hugo barged in with doctors.

"Vincent! Where's the blood?" Hugo's panic was palpable. "Xavier's bleeding again!"

The doctor grimaced. "New hemorrhaging sites emerged. Immediate transfusion required—"

"No Rh-negative blood left in the city," another added.

Evelyn cut in. "How's Roman Young?"

The doctor avoided her eyes. "H-He's stable..."

"Prioritize the critical case!" Hugo declared.

Vincent pressed. "Roman truly doesn't need it?"

"The doctor said no!" Hugo snapped. "Who'd lie about life and death?"

As they exited, Hugo lingered behind.

"Smart move," he hissed at Evelyn.

Madam Zade rushed in. "Darling, how's Xavier?"

"Don't worry. The blood's en route," Vincent soothed.

An elderly woman shoved forward. "Let me see my boy! My Xavier's an angel—this is someone else's fault!"

Evelyn studied the woman—Vincent's mother, judging by the resemblance. Downturned mouth, cold eyes. Trouble incarnate.

"Mother, wait for the police investigation," Madam Zade coaxed.

"Always contradicting me!" The matriarch whirled on her. "First you want in, now you play saint?"

"I didn't—"

"Silence! You're not family! Who gave you a voice here?" The tirade continued, venom dripping.
###Chapter 287: This Is No Way to Treat a Savior

Evelyn Sinclair stood at the hospital room door, her cold gaze fixed on the sour expression of the Stapleton family matriarch.

Compared to Madeline Kingsley's demeanor, this woman was truly something else.

"Mom, let me check with the doctor about visiting hours," Vincent Sullivan said quickly, trying to diffuse the tension.

The doctor soon arrived and gave permission.

The Stapleton family swarmed into the room, with Evelyn following silently behind.

"Oh, my precious grandson!" The elderly Mrs. Stapleton rushed to the bedside, dabbing at her tears.

Xavier Stapleton lay in bed with a blood bag hanging above him. Seeing his family, he immediately launched into complaints. "Mom, Dad, Grandma, it was that Roman Young from the company who hit me! I was driving normally when he rear-ended me out of nowhere—"

"That idiot!" Mrs. Stapleton bristled. "Call the police on him!"

"It's Roman Young," Xavier said, sneaking a glance at Evelyn. "I was always good to him when he worked under me..."

His eyes suddenly lit up. "Evelyn came to see me?"

"She's the one who saved you," Vincent explained. "She found you after the accident and called the ambulance."

Xavier's face brightened. "Evelyn, I knew you still cared about me."

The entire Stapleton family turned to stare at Evelyn.

Her lips curled slightly. "Watch your words, Xavier. I'm married now. Saving you was just basic decency."

After all, a life was at stake.

Even if Xavier deserved the worst, he should face justice alive.

"What's a married woman doing here, then?" Mrs. Stapleton snapped. "Shouldn't you be at home tending to your husband instead of leading my grandson on? He comes from a respectable family!"

The words were downright vicious.

"Mom!" Vincent cut in urgently.

"Mother, Ms. Sinclair was just trying to help," Madam Zade added quickly.

Since when was this how you treated someone who saved a life?

"Quiet!" Mrs. Stapleton turned on her. "You don't even care about your own son, and now you're pretending to be noble?"

She gave Evelyn a once-over. "Girls these days are full of schemes. So what if she's married? Who's to say she isn't after our family's fortune?"

Xavier's besotted expression made it clear he was still hung up on Evelyn. Yet the old woman insisted Evelyn must have seduced her precious grandson.

Madam Zade fell silent under the scolding.

Vincent frowned. "Mother, there's nothing between Ms. Sinclair and Xavier."

Though he doted on his son, he'd heard about Evelyn and Julian Ashford. He didn't believe a word of the ugly rumors.

With Evelyn's qualities, she didn't need to cling to anyone.

Just as Mrs. Stapleton was about to retort, a nurse burst in frantically.

"Emergency! There's been a blood type mix-up!"

"What mix-up?" Mrs. Stapleton looked bewildered.

Xavier bolted upright. "What about my blood type?"

"This patient is RH negative," the nurse said, rushing to the IV stand. "We accidentally gave him O type! This is bad!"

"What kind of hospital is this?" Hugo Lee exploded, more agitated than the family. "Do something!"

The nurse fumbled to remove the IV.

Xavier turned pale. "Am... am I going to die?"

Madam Zade clutched her son's hand while Mrs. Stapleton panicked, glancing around helplessly.

"Wait." Evelyn spoke up suddenly. "Maybe there was no mistake at all."

"Impossible!" the nurse snapped. "The patient has a rare blood type, and this bag is clearly labeled O!"

Evelyn smirked. "If it were truly mismatched, 15cc would be lethal. He's had nearly 100cc and is perfectly fine. How could it be wrong?"

Vincent was the first to understand.

He looked at the blood bag, then at his son. The label indeed read O type, but Xavier showed no adverse reactions beyond fear.

"What's going on?" Madam Zade murmured, utterly lost.

The situation was too absurd for anyone to process quickly.

"Either the label is wrong," Vincent said sharply, his gaze piercing Xavier, "or..."

His eyes turned icy.

"How could it be O type?" Madam Zade muttered. "You're RH negative, I'm AB... Xavier couldn't possibly be O..."

"The hospital messed up!" Hugo jumped in, rounding on the nurse. "This is unacceptable negligence!"

Vincent had already composed himself. "Run another blood test on Xavier."

He stared at his son's increasingly panicked expression. "Let's get to the bottom of this."

"What's there to get to?" Hugo blustered. "Vincent, have you lost your mind? Don't you know your own son's blood type? The hospital obviously mislabeled it!"

"Is that so?" Vincent said coolly. "When I donated earlier, I watched them tag it as RH negative myself."
###Chapter 288: The Blood Type Mystery

"So—" Evelyn Sinclair interjected with crisp clarity, "the hospital records are correct. Xavier Stapleton is indeed blood type O?"

Her words detonated like a bomb in the hospital room.

A stunned silence fell over everyone.

Vincent Sullivan and his wife froze, their faces drained of color.

If the blood type was accurate, then the only possible lie was Xavier himself.

"Dad! Mom!" Xavier lunged at Madam Zade, clutching her icy hands. "I'm your real son! The son you carried for nine months! The hospital must have made a mistake—you have to believe me!"

Madam Zade stared at him in a daze.

This child she had raised from infancy, poured her heart and soul into...

"Someone is trying to ruin me!" Xavier screamed hysterically, turning to the elderly Mrs. Sullivan. "Grandma, they're trying to destroy our family!"

Mrs. Sullivan was slow to react.

But her instinct to protect her grandson kicked in. "Yes! Someone must be framing my boy!"

Evelyn gave a light laugh. "Why not get a blood test now? Bring the transfusion bag too. Let's see who's lying."

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Xavier's face twisted with rage. "You sabotaged me during that business trip! What the hell do you want?"

He needed to muddy the waters.

"The truth is already out." A doctor suddenly entered, holding a file. "The original records confirm Xavier is type O. Someone falsified the blood report."

The words landed like a sledgehammer.

Xavier collapsed to the floor.

Hugo Lee paled in panic.

He had bribed the hospital director. How could this happen?

"What?" Mrs. Sullivan finally processed the revelation. "My son and daughter-in-law can't produce a type O child? Then this boy..."

The grandson she had doted on for over twenty years was an imposter!

"You slut!"

Mrs. Sullivan slapped Madam Zade across the face.

"I knew you cheated! You brought this bastard into our family and passed him off as a Sullivan!"

Madam Zade cupped her cheek, tears streaming. "Mother, I didn't—"

"Get out of this house! Take your bastard and get out!" Mrs. Sullivan grabbed her daughter-in-law's hair, ready to strike again.

Vincent quickly intervened. "Mother! We don't have all the facts yet!"

"You're still defending her?" Mrs. Sullivan shrieked, jabbing a finger at her son. "I always said that boy didn't look like you!"

"Mrs. Sullivan," Evelyn said calmly, "Madam Zade is innocent."

"Who do you think you are?" the old woman snarled.

"Just someone who studied biology." Evelyn remained composed. "Madam Zade has AB blood. It's genetically impossible for her to have a type O child."

The realization struck everyone at once.

"So," she continued, looking at the ashen-faced Xavier, "he was never your son to begin with."

Vincent exhaled in relief.

Madam Zade suddenly broke into loud, wrenching sobs.

For over twenty years, she had endured endless humiliation because of her "son's" unattractive appearance.

Now the truth was finally out...

"My child... Where is my real child?" Madam Zade crumpled to the floor.

Vincent pulled her into a tight embrace. "We'll find them..."

In the corner, Hugo Lee glared at Evelyn with murderous intent.
###Chapter 289: Bloodline Truth

The air in the hospital room was suffocatingly still.

Vincent Sullivan's fingers trembled slightly as he dialed the phone, but his voice was ice-cold. "Arrange paternity tests immediately. Three different institutions." His gaze remained fixed on Xavier Stapleton's pale face on the hospital bed. "Full surveillance. Anyone who interferes will face the consequences."

Hugo Lee stood in the corner, a cold sweat trickling down his back.

He knew better than anyone—once the Sullivan family grew suspicious, the truth could no longer be hidden. The most damning fact? Xavier wasn’t a Sullivan by blood.

"Dad! Mom!" Xavier struggled to get up, yanking at his IV stand. "I'm your real son! That bitch Evelyn Sinclair framed me!"

Vincent ignored him.

Strangely, now that doubt had taken root, the man who had called him "Dad" for over twenty years seemed like a complete stranger. His features, his mannerisms, his bone structure—nothing resembled the Sullivans.

"Let's go." Vincent steadied his swaying wife.

But Madam Zade suddenly shrieked, "You jinx! Did you even get pregnant back then? Where did you pick up this bastard to fool our family?" Her wrinkled face twisted with rage. "Now we’ve raised an impostor!"

Madam Sullivan froze.

At the end of the hallway, a young man in a wheelchair was being slowly pushed toward them. Bandages wrapped around his forehead, his pallid face framed eyes identical to Madam Sullivan’s.

Her hands began to shake.

"Are you—" Her voice fractured in the air.

The young man’s eyes reddened. His lips moved soundlessly.

"My child..." Madam Sullivan suddenly lunged forward, collapsing to her knees before the wheelchair. "You’re my real child, aren’t you?"

"Mom..." The young man finally choked out the word.

Vincent rushed forward. "What’s your name?"

"Roman Young." The young man lifted his face, his gaze clear and steady.

The name struck Vincent like thunder. The fog lifted instantly—this was the Roman Young Evelyn had been protecting all along!

Hugo seized the chaos to slip toward the emergency exit.

He suddenly recalled the unfamiliar medical staff, the sudden appearance of the head nurse... Everything had been orchestrated.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" He punched the wall in fury. "A perfect trap!"

At the other end of the hallway, Madam Sullivan clung to Roman’s hand.

"We can do a DNA test right away," Roman said softly. "Before my adoptive parents passed, they told me my birth parents were the Sullivans of Kingsbury."

Vincent’s pupils constricted. "What exactly did they say?"

"They said..." Roman looked out the window. "Thirty years ago, a Sullivan couple was working on a project in Chiyuan County. The wife went into labor during a landslide..."

Memories flooded back. Vincent remembered the stormy night, the mudslide crushing the clinic, the infant they’d fled with—and the faint cry of another baby they’d left behind...

"That night, there were two women giving birth at the clinic," Roman murmured. "Besides your wife... there was my adoptive mother."
###Chapter 290: The Puppet Master Revealed

The mountain clinic's conditions were heartbreakingly primitive.

When Madam Zade went into premature labor, there wasn't even a proper hospital bed. She lay on a rough wooden plank in the rural health center. Weak from childbirth, she couldn't get basic nutrition, let alone produce milk.

The newborn's face turned blue from hunger, its cries as faint as a kitten's.

Fate intervened. Another family named Young was staying at the clinic, their daughter-in-law having just delivered a healthy baby boy with more than enough milk. Madam Zade offered all her valuables, begging for just a few drops.

The Youngs' kindness brought tears to one's eyes. They refused payment and took Madam Zade into their humble home. They brewed ginger tea, stewed chicken, even shared half their own child's food.

But tragedy struck.

On the fifth night, Madam Zade hemorrhaged violently. The clinic staff scrambled to stop the bleeding, but it gushed like floodwaters. The county ambulance took six treacherous hours through a storm to arrive.

When the infant was left with the Youngs, no one anticipated the storm would trigger a mudslide.

By the time Vincent Sullivan reached the provincial hospital, his wife hovered near death. The mountain roads had been obliterated by landslides.

Three months passed before the roads reopened.

Madam Zade wept endlessly in her hospital bed. Old Mrs. Sullivan's curses stung worse than the antiseptic: "Jinx! Can't even keep track of your own child!"

When travel became possible again, Vincent got tied up with a company crisis. He sent his closest friend Hugo Lee in his stead.

Hugo returned cradling a frail, undersized baby.

Madam Zade's trembling hands received the child, her tears splashing on its sallow face. Old Mrs. Sullivan suddenly shrieked: "This bastard looks nothing like our Sullivans!"

Ironically, the same grandmother who hurled the cruelest insults would later spoil Xavier Stapleton rotten.

To ease tensions, Vincent bought a duplex villa. But the old woman constantly demanded her grandson's company, eventually taking Xavier in permanently.

Meanwhile, the real Young heir was chopping firewood in the mountains.

Roman Young stood on stools to cook at age five, worked the fields by seven. His only refuge was the village's leaky schoolhouse—books his sole sanctuary.

During middle school entrance exams, he knelt before the principal: "Let me study, and I'll stay in the top three." The principal saw a spark in the skeletal boy's eyes.

The day his university acceptance letter arrived, the entire village celebrated.

But fate is cruel. During his senior year, his adoptive parents confessed a devastating truth on their deathbeds. They sought their biological son to live in luxury, unknowingly inviting death to their doorstep.

When Xavier met the elderly couple, their mirror-like faces made him tremble. Worse yet, Hugo Lee reappeared unexpectedly.

The former accomplice now studied everyone with icy calculation.
###Chapter 291: Truth Revealed, Yet He's Absent Again

Hugo Lee's hand trembled slightly as he gripped the teacup.

He still remembered the day Vincent Sullivan handed him the infant. His mind had been preoccupied with an upcoming business deal, barely registering the bundle in his arms.

"Old Lee, do me a favor—take the baby to my wife," Vincent had said, clapping his shoulder. "I can't get away right now."

He'd given a distracted nod, accepting the swaddled child without a second thought.

Who could have predicted...

"That Roman couple deserves to die!" Hugo suddenly shattered the teacup against the table, sending shards flying.

Xavier Stapleton stood nearby, his face ashen.

"Uncle Lee, what do we do now? Roman Young already—"

"Keep your panic in check," Hugo sneered. "We've kept this buried for over twenty years. A little longer won't matter."

His eyes narrowed, recalling the scheme he'd orchestrated.

First, Xavier had appeased the Roman couple with priceless antiques. Once the fools left Kingsbury in high spirits, Hugo immediately reported a burglary to the police.

"Stealing cultural relics carries severe penalties," he said darkly. "Enough to break them in prison."

Xavier swallowed hard. "But Roman Young is now—"

"Silence!" Hugo snapped. "If you hadn't bungled this, we wouldn't be in this mess!"

The office door burst open.

Vincent stood in the doorway, flanked by a tearful Madam Zade and... Roman Young.

A paternity test report slammed onto the desk.

"Hugo Lee," Vincent's voice was glacial. "Care to explain?"

Madam Zade rushed to Roman, her trembling hands cradling his face. "My child..."

Evelyn Sinclair quietly stepped aside.

She checked her watch and signaled to Old Lin.

"Mr. Sullivan, the truth is clear now," she said softly. "I must excuse myself—there's urgent business."

Vincent followed her out. "Let me see you off, Ms. Sinclair."

In the parking lot, his gaze lingered on the understated Maybach.

"Thank you." Evelyn opened the car door. "Regarding Xavier's situation—"

"I'll handle it," Vincent said grimly. "I'll express my gratitude properly another time."

As the car pulled away from the hospital, Evelyn massaged her temples.

The Kingsley mansion blazed with light.

Madeline Kingsley was arranging flowers in the parlor when Evelyn entered. She set down her shears with deliberate calm.

"You're back."

"Grandmother, where's Alexander?" Evelyn asked urgently.

"He waited until three in the morning," Madeline sniffed. "Then some company emergency called him away."

Evelyn froze.

"What?" Madeline lifted her teacup. "Did you think you were the only one allowed to come and go as you please?"
###Chapter 292: Waiting at Kingsley Group

Evelyn's lips twitched.
The difference between Madeline Kingsley and Madam Zade was simple—one still clung to her dignity while the other had thrown it all away.

"Grandmother, I'll take my leave." She had no patience for the old woman's snide remarks.

"Not waiting for Alex?" Madeline didn't even glance up.

"No." Evelyn forced a polite smile.

"Wise choice." Madeline sniffed. "That boy forgets to eat when he's working. Might not even come home tonight. No point keeping you waiting alone. Go on."

As Evelyn turned, Madeline added, "Fetch the car keys for the young mistress. Have Lewis drive her."

She declined the chauffeur and drove herself.

The herbal pharmacy caught her eye. She braked.

The elderly doctor listened to her symptoms, pondered, then recommended several prepared remedies.

Evelyn carried the full paper bag straight to Kingsley Group headquarters.

The Kingsley vehicle glided into the underground garage without pause. Her finger hovered over the biometric scanner—one hesitant second.

When the elevator hummed to life, she exhaled.

Her access still worked. Or perhaps... he'd simply forgotten to revoke it.

"Young mistress?" Nathan Carter froze at the sight of her. "What brings you here?"

"Delivery for Mr. Kingsley." She lifted the medicine bag.

Nathan's gaze lingered on it before his professional smile returned. "Lord Alex is in a meeting. Would you like me to—"

"How long?"

His hesitation lasted a heartbeat. "Unpredictable. Shall I interrupt?"

"Don't." She shook her head. "I'll wait."

"Then please use the private lounge." Nathan gestured. "Too many eyes out here..."

She understood.

The all-white sanctuary had been her designated waiting area during their marriage. White sofa, white bookshelves, a few geography magazines and biographies. Her fingertips brushed the immaculate upholstery.

He'd kept this place maintained.

"Shall I arrange dinner, young mistress?" Nathan asked.

"Just something simple."

The meal arrived on fine china. Evelyn arched a brow. "Has Mr. Kingsley eaten?"

"Lord Alex never pauses meetings..." Nathan's smile faltered. "Unless you'd like me to—"

"Don't tell him." She cut him off.

Nathan bowed out.

......

"Eat something!" Madeline hissed, sliding a tray across the study desk.

Alex didn't look up.

The pallor of his skin alarmed her. Was he trembling? "Alex—"

"Meeting." He killed the webcam. Ice coated the single word.

Madeline retreated.

She'd issued strict orders to conceal Evelyn's visit. When Eleanor Kingsley found out, she massaged her temples in frustration.

Even she couldn't decipher the old woman's schemes now.

Telling Alex meant betraying Madeline. Staying silent meant prolonging the couple's estrangement.

Eleanor was halfway to fetching Evelyn herself when shrieks erupted downstairs. "Alex! Where are you going at this hour?"

"Kingsley Group." The hoarse reply brooked no argument.

"It's midnight!" Madeline whirled toward Eleanor. "Do something!"

Eleanor's voice could have frozen hell. "I birthed him. I raised him. Must I govern him into the grave?"
###Chapter 293: A Fleeting Silhouette

"You..." Madeline Kingsley's pupils trembled, her well-manicured fingers clutching the armrest.

Never had she imagined her docile daughter-in-law would dare confront her so bluntly.

Alexander Kingsley was already striding toward the exit.

After half a day's rest, his steps were steadier than that frail morning gait.

Eleanor Kingsley watched his retreating back with calm detachment.

She added lightly, "If you collapse from exhaustion, I'll adopt Evelyn as my daughter tomorrow and find her a suitable husband."

Alexander's frame stiffened momentarily, but he didn't turn back.

Behind him, muffled sobs escaped Madeline's lips.

In the garage, Old Lin had rushed over upon hearing the commotion. "Lord Alex!"

He watched helplessly as Alexander reached for the driver's door.

But the moment his fingers brushed the handle, the man swayed, bracing himself against the car.

"Let me drive you," Old Lin urged anxiously.

Alexander waved him off, but the older man stubbornly slid into the driver's seat. "Lord Alex, I know the Kingsley Group route well."

Alexander's expression darkened further.

Had he become so feeble that driving himself was now impossible?

Did everyone see him as a walking corpse already?

"Get out," he commanded coldly.

Old Lin audaciously locked the doors. "Madam specifically instructed me to report today's itinerary to you."

Alexander's gaze turned razor-sharp.

"Unnecessary."

He turned toward another sports car.

The Kingsley estate never lacked luxury vehicles.

"It was Madam's direct order!" Old Lin blurted desperately. "How shall I explain your refusal to her?"

Alexander froze mid-step.

Seizing the opportunity, Old Lin added, "There was nearly an accident while escorting Madam out today. A close call with another vehicle."

"What?" Alexander whirled around.

Such a serious incident, and no one had informed him?

Of course...

He'd personally forbidden any reports regarding Evelyn Sinclair.

If she chose to abandon him, why should he cling?

Old Lin gestured. "Please get in. I'll explain everything."

......

"Nathan?" Evelyn called out to the hurrying assistant at the corridor's end.

"How may I assist you, Madam?" Nathan Carter halted abruptly.

Evelyn glanced at the darkening sky outside. "Has the meeting concluded?"

What she truly wanted to ask was whether the feverish Alexander was still pushing through work.

Nathan's expression shifted. "It's over."

"And he..." Evelyn caught the odd hesitation.

Nathan forced a stiff smile. "Lord Alex is... currently unavailable for visitors."

Alexander hadn't appeared at Kingsley Group at all.

The so-called meeting had been conducted remotely.

Nathan knew his deception was improper, but he wanted Evelyn to taste the bitterness of waiting.

Let her understand what Alexander had endured all these years.

"I see." Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "There are personal items in the lounge. Please have them sent to me. I'll take my leave now."

"Madam, wait—" Conflict flashed in Nathan's eyes. "Perhaps you could stay a while longer?"

One call from him, and Alexander would come rushing.

Evelyn shook her head. "That won't be necessary."

As the elevator doors closed, her perfect smile vanished instantly.

Nathan's intentions were transparent.

This was his petty revenge for his master.

What?

Did they think Alexander lowering himself was some grand benevolence, while she, Evelyn, was unworthy of such grace?

A cold laugh escaped her.

They only saw the lofty Alexander making concessions.

But they'd forgotten how she'd been trampled into the dust.

Yes, she'd always been insignificant as weeds.

Even married into the Kingsley family, she remained the ungrateful wretch in their eyes.

Evelyn bypassed the underground garage, heading straight for Kingsley Group's main entrance.

Hailing a taxi, she gave an address she hadn't returned to in ages...

......

"Madam has been occupied, but she's kept you in her thoughts. She even called specially..."

Old Lin chattered incessantly during the drive.

He knew full well about Evelyn being expelled by Madeline.

But Eleanor had strictly forbidden servants from discussing family conflicts.

Who were they to meddle in their masters' affairs?

The backseat remained eerily silent.

"Stop the car!" Alexander suddenly barked.

Old Lin slammed the brakes. "Lord Alex?"

As they approached the garage entrance, Alexander's gaze locked onto the main gate.

"Never mind. Continue." He finally looked away.

That fleeting glimpse of a figure entering a taxi—it had looked so much like her.
###Chapter 294: Lord Alex, You're Not Actually Going to Dig Through Trash

Alexander Kingsley forced himself to stay alert.

Old Lin's chatter during the car ride went in one ear and out the other.

A car accident?

He'd thought Evelyn Sinclair was the victim. Turned out it was just that dull-witted male colleague of hers.

Old Lin kept rambling about how Evelyn had rescued the man, how she'd identified him...

Alexander nearly kicked Old Lin out of the moving vehicle.

As for Evelyn calling him?

Probably a lie Old Lin made up after failing to reach him.

That woman had long erased him from her heart.

Her ruthlessness made him question whether her past gentleness had been an elaborate deception.

Every time he sought confirmation, this was never the answer he wanted.

He craved her sincerity.

Not proof of his suspicions...

She couldn't be at Kingsley Group.

Why would she come here?

Knowing he was sick at home waiting for her.

The elevator stopped at the executive floor. Before the doors opened, Alexander could almost hear his own bitter laugh.

At the end of the hallway, Nathan Carter was heading toward the stairwell carrying a bag.

Alexander walked straight past him toward his office.

Then froze just before opening the door.

His gaze locked onto the slightly ajar break room door near the assistant stations.

His pulse quickened.

Foolish hope surged in his chest.

Knowing it was delusional, yet unable to stop himself, he moved forward.

He grasped the doorknob gently.

Several seconds of silence, broken only by his pounding heartbeat.

He pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

But someone had been here.

Alexander strode to the bookshelf.

The magazines had been disturbed.

In all of Kingsley Group, no one but him dared touch these.

Now, a magazine that belonged in the back had been moved to the front.

He turned to the sofa.

The cushions bore a distinct indentation.

His fingers traced the creases, then stilled abruptly.

A single long hair lay coiled in his palm.

......

When Nathan returned to the work area, he found Alexander's office door wide open.

"Lord Alex?" He entered in surprise.

During the conference call, he'd heard how ill Alexander sounded.

Never expected him to come to the office in this state.

Unless... he knew Evelyn had visited?

"Today's progress report." Alexander's opening words made Nathan relax slightly.

Nathan gave a detailed update.

Alexander nodded slightly. "What were you doing during my meeting?"

Nathan's stomach tightened.

"Organizing project files." Not a lie.

Just omitted the part about receiving Evelyn.

"Hmm." Alexander seemed uninterested. "Compile the overtime list."

Nathan breathed an inward sigh of relief.

Apparently Alexander didn't know about Evelyn's visit.

Hadn't it always been this way?

Evelyn would come and go, and he'd never care.

When she clashed with Isabella Winslow, he'd look the other way.

Nathan felt he'd gambled correctly.

Lord Alex was still Lord Alex—he wouldn't stay hung up on one woman forever.

But before he finished the list, Alexander came looking for him.

Personally.

Cornered him in HR.

"Nathan." Alexander's expression was terrifying.

Nathan followed him back to the executive floor.

Silence the entire way.

Until they stopped by the trash area near the emergency exit.

Alexander pointed at several large bins.

"Which one did you use?"

Nathan's mind went blank.

Lord Alex knew...

Maybe from surveillance, or maybe...

With trembling hands, he lifted one bin's lid.

Empty!

The fresh garbage bag held nothing.

Nathan stood frozen.

"Where is it?" Alexander's voice could freeze hell.

"The—the cleaning staff took it!"

"To where?"

"The garbage truck... by now it's probably already..."

Nathan's throat constricted.

Had the truck already left?

If not... was Lord Alex really going to dig through trash?

If it had... would they have to search the landfill?

"Come with me to find it!" Alexander's order made Nathan's vision darken.
###Chapter 295: The Unsolved Mystery of Kingsley Group

Nathan Carter knew every corner of Kingsley Group like the back of his hand.

But trivial details like garbage truck schedules had never crossed his mind.

Alexander Kingsley didn’t ask what Nathan had thrown away.

His expression darkened as he strode toward the underground parking lot, making Nathan avert his gaze.

Every night, the garbage truck parked on the basement level while janitors collected trash from each floor.

"Stop!" Nathan shouted when he saw workers loading black trash bags.

The janitors exchanged confused glances.

"Where are the bags from the executive floor?" Nathan demanded, abandoning all decorum.

The workers stared blankly at the identical bags.

A pungent stench made Alexander grimace. "Clear the area."

"Everyone out. I need to find something," Nathan ordered sharply.

The hesitant workers filed out.

"You take that side. I’ll handle this one," Alexander directed.

Nathan paled. "Lord Alex, let me—"

"Want to search till dawn?" Alexander’s voice was hoarse.

Nathan fell silent.

His hands shook as he opened a bag, recoiling from the putrid odor.

"Gah—"

He nearly retched.

Alexander showed no reaction as he sifted through the refuse.

"What exactly are we looking for?"

"A clear plastic bag," Nathan held his breath. "Containing... herbal medicine."

Alexander’s fingers clenched.

Medicine.

The medicine Evelyn Sinclair had bought specifically for him.

Not only had Nathan kept this from him—he’d thrown it away.

Who told Evelyn he was at Kingsley Group?

Was a common cold worth disturbing her?

"Should I ask Ethan to bring masks..." Nathan gasped.

Alexander’s glare silenced him.

Nathan resumed digging, regret weighing heavier than the stench.

Worse, Alexander was suffering alongside him.

How could Lord Alex tolerate this smell?

Oh... His nose was stuffed from the cold.

Nathan wanted to weep.

Bag after bag yielded nothing.

"Check the truck," Alexander pointed.

Nathan climbed in, hauling loaded bags back out.

An hour ago, he’d never believe Alexander Kingsley would personally rummage through trash.

All for some ordinary herbal medicine...

He swallowed complaints and kept searching.

The filth clung to his skin. His hands—accustomed to signing billion-dollar contracts—were now caked in grime.

Alexander’s hands—the ones that commanded a financial empire—were equally soiled.

"Is this it?" Alexander suddenly held up a bag.

Nathan turned, eyes widening. "Yes!"

The sealed plastic bag still contained the medicine boxes, though now stained.

As Nathan pondered cleaning methods, Alexander shrugged off his coat, wrapped the bag, and cradled it toward the elevator.

"Clean this up," was all he said.

"Lord Alex," Nathan caught up, "I—"

"The Africa project needs personnel. You’re assigned." Alexander didn’t look back.

Nathan stood frozen, his soul draining away.

The next day, Kingsley Group erupted in gossip.

Nathan Carter—Alexander’s most trusted aide—had been exiled to Africa for losing critical documents!

Rumors claimed the files were so important that Alexander personally supervised a two-hour trash search.

The usually unflappable Nathan committing such a blunder shocked everyone.

But the real mystery? What document warranted this extreme reaction?

Executives speculated wildly about which project it involved.

Lord Alex had endured the stench by the garbage truck himself.

This became Kingsley Group’s greatest unsolved mystery!

At dawn, Evelyn stepped out of her bedroom and gasped.

Alexander slept on her sofa.

She hadn’t heard him arrive.

As she nearly tripped over the coffee table, she spotted familiar medicine boxes.

Her own purchase from yesterday.

Turning, she noticed Alexander’s pallor—worse than the previous morning.

Kneeling, she reached for his forehead. His hand shot up, gripping her wrist.

"Ev..." His voice was barely audible.

Recognizing her, he released her.

"You’re still feverish?" Her palm met burning skin.

Alexander blinked wearily. "Colds... take time..." His voice remained rough.

After the trash search, he’d scrubbed himself raw.

Disinfected the medicine bag repeatedly.

Perhaps the night air had worsened his condition.

Exhausted, he’d collapsed here to avoid disturbing her.

He’d taken her medicine before sleeping.

Yet the fever had returned.
###Chapter 296: Will You Stay With Me?

"What happened to you?" Evelyn Sinclair frowned, her fingertips jerking back when they brushed his scorching forehead.

Alexander Kingsley lay weakly on the couch, but his gaze burned into her, a satisfied smile curling his lips.

That look sent tremors through her heart.

"Let's go to the hospital." Her voice softened unconsciously as she reached for his forehead again.

Burning hot.

"Evelyn," Alexander suddenly grabbed her wrist, "skip work today. Stay with me."

Her entire arm stiffened.

"Can you...talk normally for once?"

This tone, this look—where was the usual cold, aloof Alexander?

It unsettled her more than his previous attempts to please her.

"Evelyn," he buried his face in her palm, "when did you go to Kingsley Group last night?"

"I went after finishing work." She dodged the question.

"Who told you I was there?" Despite the fever, his mind was sharp.

"Someone from the Kingsley family."

She swallowed the word "grandmother."

If he really wanted to know, he'd find out.

"Phone call?" he pressed.

Evelyn hesitated. "No, I went back to the Kingsley residence."

Alexander abruptly pushed himself up.

"You went back?"

"Yes. What's wrong?" Her expression remained calm.

He swayed as he tried to stand.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn steadied him.

"Going back to the Kingsley residence." His face darkened.

The truth was worse than he'd imagined.

She had returned, only to be deliberately sent away.

Meanwhile, he'd waited like a fool, stewing in frustration when she never came back.

"Stop this." She reached for him, but he shook her off.

"Alexander!" She wrapped her arms around his waist and dragged him back onto the couch.

Too weak to resist, he collapsed onto the cushions. When he tried to rise again, she pinned him down.

"Stop moving! What if you hurt the baby?" she scolded.

Alexander froze, then pulled her tighter against him.

"Evelyn..." His earlier anger vanished as he buried his face in her neck. "Just a little longer..."

She felt his arms tighten around her.

He always held her like this—so fiercely she could barely breathe.

After everything, she no longer knew what it meant.

Once, she'd naively thought such desperate embraces meant at least some possessiveness.

Later, she learned possessiveness meant nothing. People felt possessive about jewelry and clothes too.

She refused to be an ornament in his life.

Especially after seeing Isabella Winslow standing beside him...

"Enough," she pushed at his shoulders. "Let's go to the hospital, okay?"

Alexander shook his head.

"Medicine is enough."

He fought to stay conscious.

"I'll go with you," she coaxed.

He scoffed, clearly not believing her.

Her promises to stay were empty, but her threats to leave were always real.

Once, she'd sworn to stay with him forever.

He'd almost believed her.

Now she could walk away without looking back...

"I'll take leave to stay with you." She pulled out her phone. "We'll go to the office after you recover."

With Roman Young's situation resolved, the company was due for a reshuffle. Xavier Stapleton and Hugo Lee would be at each other's throats.

Now wasn't the time to return.

Better to settle Alexander first.

In this state, even Eleanor Kingsley would worry.

Especially since he'd fallen ill after returning from the Kingsley residence.

"Two days off. Should I call a car to the hospital or inform your family?" she asked.

Alexander looked up, his eyes hazy with fever. "Two days?"

Only two?

Apparently, his illness wasn't severe enough to warrant more of her time.

"Alexander, get a grip." She frowned.

The fever had stripped away his cold facade, laying his thoughts bare.

"Even if I don't work, Kingsley Group needs you. Every day you're sick, work piles up."

She knew him too well. Kingsley Group was his life. He never allowed himself to slack.

Once recovered, he'd drown in overtime.

To her surprise, Alexander actually considered it, then smiled hopefully. "Then come to Kingsley Group with me..."

Evelyn: "......"

This was bad. The fever had fried his brain.

She cupped his face. "Hospital first, okay?"

They could deal with the rest later.

"Fine." He surrendered under her steady gaze. "Just let me sleep a little longer..."

He rested his head on her shoulder, his brow smoothing slightly.

Evelyn wouldn't let him sleep like this.

It wouldn't help his fever.

She dialed Eleanor Kingsley. "Mom, Alexander's with me."

"Good." Eleanor lowered her voice. "Last night, he insisted on going to Kingsley Group. We couldn't stop him. How is he? I heard he lost his temper there."

Even Nathan Carter had been exiled...

"He has a high fever but refuses the hospital. Can you send a car?"

Thud!

Her phone was suddenly slapped out of her hand.
###Chapter 297: Confiscating Her Phone

Evelyn Sinclair turned and met a pair of obsidian-dark eyes.

"Who were you calling?" Alexander Kingsley's voice was hoarse.

"Your mother." She emphasized the word "your."

Alexander's gaze locked onto her. Only after several seconds did the suspicion in his eyes gradually fade.

He believed her.

"Why tell her?" He frowned, lying back with a pale face. "...Water."

Evelyn started to rise, but her wrist was suddenly seized.

"Where are you going?"

"To get you water." She sounded surprised.

Only then did Alexander release her, his arm dropping limply. "One minute... I'll give you one minute..."

Evelyn bent to pick up her phone, pressing it back to her ear as she walked toward the kitchen.

Eleanor Kingsley was still on the line.

"I'm calling an ambulance right now," Eleanor said, her voice thick with worry. "Evelyn, Madeline, she—"

She wanted to defend the matriarch but found she had nothing to say.

This time, Madeline had gone too far.

Her past outbursts could be excused as ignorance or manipulation.

But this?

She knew Alexander was waiting for Evelyn.

Yet she still threw her out over a petty grudge.

If Evelyn had been allowed in yesterday, Alexander's condition wouldn't have deteriorated this badly.

The doctor had warned that even the strongest body would eventually break under such strain.

Cases of young people dying suddenly were becoming more common.

Some seemingly healthy individuals collapsed after just a few sleepless nights.

Considering Alexander's workload and the doctor's psychological evaluation...

Eleanor hadn't slept all night.

The ambulance arrived quickly.

Alexander's expression darkened when he saw the medics carrying a stretcher.

"I can walk."

Did they really think he was dying?

At the hospital, IV fluid dripped steadily.

Exhaustion washed over Alexander, but he clung to the last shreds of consciousness.

"Give me your phone." He held out his hand to Evelyn.

"Hmm?"

"Now." His eyes turned icy when she hesitated.

"What do you need it for?" Reluctantly, Evelyn handed it over.

Alexander tucked the phone beneath him. "You'll get it back when I wake up."

He was asleep before the words fully left his mouth.

......

A shrill ringtone jolted Alexander awake.

Trapped in nightmares, he heard the phone ringing but couldn't open his eyes.

Dreams came one after another.

First, Nathan Carter video-called from Africa in tears, showing him the blisters from mining and begging to be transferred back.

Then Eleanor called, pleading with him not to exile Madeline from the Kingsley estate to spare Evelyn from public blame.

He remembered saying, "Anyone who dares criticize her goes to Africa."

Finally, Evelyn called to say the baby was actually his—she'd only claimed it was Julian Ashford's to spite him...

Alexander found it strange. Hadn't he confiscated her phone? How could she still call?

Squinting, he saw Julian's name flashing on the screen.

That dream... succeeded in pissing him off enough to wake him.

As consciousness returned, he realized the phone beneath him was vibrating.

Those chaotic dreams had all been because of this damn ringing...

Alexander pulled out the phone and blinked at the screen, instantly alert.

Two words glared back at him:

Senior Brother.

There was only one person Evelyn would call by that title.
###Chapter 298: The Possibility of Another Pregnancy

My palms were damp with sweat as I stood in the hospital corridor.

"The test results are in." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Your uterus has healed well."

Sunlight streamed through the window, forcing me to squint.

"Theoretically, another pregnancy is possible." He flipped through the report. "But the risks would be higher than average."

My fingers tightened around my bag strap.

"We'll need more thorough examinations." The doctor looked up. "Have you thought this through?"

Footsteps echoed down the hallway.

"How's my wife?" A familiar voice spoke behind me.

I didn't turn. My nails dug into my palms.

"Mr. Kingsley, perfect timing." The doctor stood. "Regarding the possibility of another pregnancy—"

"We're in no rush." He cut the doctor off, moving beside me.

The faint scent of his cologne reached me.

"Let's go home." His warm hand enveloped mine. "We'll discuss this when you're ready."

I looked up and saw the worry shadowing his eyes.

"I want to try." The words escaped before I could stop them.

Both the doctor and Alexander froze.

"Are you sure?" His voice strained.

I nodded. Tears spilled without warning.

"This time, I'll keep you safe." He pulled me into an embrace, his voice rough.

The doctor cleared his throat. "We'll schedule comprehensive tests for next week."

Golden sunset bathed us as we left the hospital.

"Scared?" Alexander asked.

I watched the horizon bleed crimson, silent.

Terrified, of course.

But more terrified of losing my chance at motherhood.

"I'm here." His fingers squeezed mine.

I drew a deep breath and gazed into the distance.

This time, I would bring our child safely into the world.
The phone screen flickered as Alexander Kingsley's finger hovered over the end call button before slowly withdrawing.

When the screen lit up again, the words "Senior Julian" made his pupils constrict.

He jabbed the answer button with sudden force.

"Evelyn?" Julian Ashford's anxious voice came through. "Is it true about the Sullivan family?"

Only cold breathing answered him.

"Evelyn? Are you there?" Julian's tone grew uneasy.

A derisive laugh escaped Alexander's lips.

"The Sullivan matter," his voice grated like sandpaper, "is none of your business to ask my wife about."

Dead silence filled the line.

Three seconds later, the call disconnected with surgical precision.

Alexander stared at the darkened screen, his mouth twisting into a sneer. His gaze swept the room, finding no trace of Evelyn Sinclair, and his eyes darkened further.

Slender fingers swiped across the phone screen, bringing up the password prompt.

Her phone once stored his fingerprint.

Now every trace of him had been erased.

On the third attempt, the screen unlocked. He went straight to contacts and dragged that offensive number into the blacklist.

"He's still asleep."

Evelyn's voice floated from the doorway.

"The doctor said he needs rest—"

"Not working today, Evelyn?" Madeline Kingsley's shrill voice cut in. "I thought that company couldn't function without you."

"Mother," Eleanor Kingsley interjected hastily, "Evelyn's making time to care for Alexander despite her schedule."

Madeline sniffed. "Could've fooled me."

"Mother!" Eleanor's voice trembled.

Evelyn waited by the elevator to greet them, only to receive the old woman's icy glare.

"What?" Madeline snapped at her daughter-in-law. "Am I not allowed to speak now?"

"Alexander needs quiet," Eleanor murmured.

Hearing Evelyn's voice, Alexander on the hospital bed instantly closed his eyes and slipped his phone beneath the pillow.

Madeline's eyes reddened at the sight of her grandson's pallid face.

"Such misfortune..." She dabbed at tears. "Look how gaunt he's become in such short time."

She suddenly seized Evelyn's wrist. "Evelyn, forgive an old woman's bluntness. A wife's duty is to prioritize her husband. See what's become of Alexander?"

"Mother, Evelyn has—"

"Since when do you interrupt when I'm speaking to my granddaughter-in-law?" Madeline snapped.

Evelyn's voice turned glacial at Eleanor's discomfort. "Mother knows our situation best."

Madeline's face purpled with indignation.

This united front between mother and daughter-in-law made her the outsider.

"Evelyn," the matriarch rose abruptly, "come with me."

"Mother, whatever you need to say—"

"Mustn't disturb Alexander!" Madeline shot Eleanor a withering look before turning to Evelyn. "Just a few words."

Evelyn gave Eleanor a subtle headshake and followed the older woman out.

As the elevator descended, Evelyn watched the floor numbers change, her frown deepening.

"Let's be direct." Madeline stopped outside an examination room. "The Kingsley line must continue. You'll get checked today to see if you can still conceive."

Evelyn's head jerked up.

"Grandmother," her voice dripped ice, "you wept while promising never to interfere again."

"I tried!" Madeline's voice cracked. "But look at Alexander! A childless marriage is built on sand!"

"It's just a cold." Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Since when do adults need supervision when ill?"
###Chapter 299: The Relentless Examination

"You!"

Evelyn's blunt accusation made Madeline Kingsley's face darken instantly.

"Just an illness?" The elderly woman's voice trembled. "Alex was running a high fever all night but still insisted on going to Kingsley Group..."

"So you knew he was waiting for me," Evelyn countered without backing down, "yet lied to me about him being at Kingsley Group?"

Madeline faltered.

She hadn't expected Evelyn to uncover the truth.

"Who told you?"

"Did I need to be told?" Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "I went to Kingsley Group and didn't find him. The truth was obvious."

Madeline had been spoiled her entire life.

She'd never needed to think deeply to get her way—now, when she tried, her mind failed her.

And yet, she still clung to absurd delusions.

The epitome of incompetence masked by arrogance.

"If there's nothing else, I'll leave." Evelyn turned away. "Alex should be waking up soon."

She owed the old woman some gratitude for this performance.

Otherwise, she might never have seen the Kingsley family for the pit it truly was.

"Stop!" Madeline grabbed her arm and called down the hallway, "Doctor! Bring her in for the examination!"

A team of pre-arranged medical staff immediately surrounded them.

Evelyn's expression darkened.

"Let go!"

"Don't be difficult, Evelyn." Madeline wiped her brow. "It's just a routine checkup. Your resistance only makes me wonder—is infertility not the only issue you're hiding?"

Evelyn nearly laughed at the absurdity. "My body, my choice. No one forces me into any examination."

Madeline's suspicions only grew. "You do have a problem! What else are you concealing?"

Evelyn was beyond exasperation.

"Grandmother, release me. Don't make me resent you."

The words only enraged the old woman further. "You already do, don't you? Ever since I exposed your affair with Julian Ashford?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

Anything she said would be twisted.

But her silence emboldened Madeline.

"Doctor, how is the infertility examination conducted?" the old woman pressed urgently. "Perhaps a full-body scan would be better!"

The doctor glanced at Evelyn. "An MRI would be most comprehensive."

"I can't undergo an MRI." Evelyn's voice was steel.

Early pregnancy MRIs risked fetal development.

"Grandmother, it could harm my baby."

"Baby?" Madeline froze momentarily before scoffing. "You lost your last child, didn't you? Now you claim to be pregnant again? What illness are you truly hiding?"

"My child is still here!" Evelyn's voice rose in desperation.

"Lies!" Madeline trembled with fury. "After all I've done for you, this is how you repay me? Take her for the scan!"

"Grandmother!"

Evelyn dared not struggle violently.

Pregnant as she was, she could only plead, "Your own grandchild is in my womb. Don't do something you'll regret!"

"Ridiculous!" Madeline turned a deaf ear. "Get her to the examination room now!"

"Please cooperate, Mrs. Kingsley." Several bodyguards seized her arms, dragging her toward the scanning suite.

......

In the hospital room, Eleanor Kingsley suddenly spoke:

"Are you deaf or dead? That phone has been ringing forever."

Alexander Kingsley slowly opened his eyes, retrieving Evelyn's phone from beneath him.

A glance at the caller ID—"Wendy West."

No one he knew.

He tossed it aside.

"What is it?"

Eleanor smirked.

"Enjoying your fake nap? Developing a habit of intercepting your wife's calls?"

Mocking her son was second nature.

Alexander did look better.

Though his fever lingered, youth accelerated recovery.

Unfazed by her jab, he'd long abandoned pride around his mother.

"My being here is thanks to you," he said dryly. "Drugging your own son—what an exemplary mother."

"Please." Eleanor rolled her eyes. "You were coward enough to take a cold shower instead. Nearly gave yourself pneumonia."

Alexander sighed. "Mom, Evelyn is pregnant."

"Like I've never been?" she retorted.

He changed the subject. "Where is Evelyn? Where did Grandmother take her?"

"Wasn't she just outside?" Eleanor stood abruptly. "I'll check."

Two minutes later, she returned flustered.

"Evelyn's gone! Where are your bodyguards?"

Alexander was staring at the ringing phone again.

Wendy West was persistent.

His head snapped up. "She's not outside?"

"Checked the entire floor," Eleanor panted. "Call her—"

She broke off, staring at the phone in Alexander's hand.

Evelyn's phone was with him.

What a disaster!

......

"Grandmother, MRIs are unsafe in early pregnancy." Evelyn braced against the machine.

She wouldn't risk the child she'd fought so hard to conceive.

"The doctor said it's fine!" Madeline was immovable. "What disease are you hiding?"

"I'm not! Can't you listen to reason?"

"After the scan," Madeline waved dismissively. "Restrain her!"
###Chapter 300: How Dare You Lay a Hand on Her

"Grandmother, have you lost your mind?" Evelyn Sinclair's voice trembled.

Madeline Kingsley's face darkened instantly. "How dare you speak to me like that?" She pointed at Evelyn's abdomen. "If you're this insolent now, what would happen if you actually carried the Kingsley heir? Restrain her!"

"Be obedient, Evelyn." Madeline narrowed her eyes. "Don't force me to get rough."

Two burly security guards immediately stepped forward, gripping Evelyn's arms. One of them reached toward her stomach.

Evelyn's pupils contracted. Maternal instinct unleashed a surge of strength within her. She kicked the guard between the legs, wrenching free as he recoiled in pain, then bolted for the door.

"Stop her!" Madeline shrieked, positioning herself in front of the exit.

Without thinking, Evelyn swung her hand.

Slap!

The sharp sound echoed through the room.

At that moment, the door burst open. Evelyn's palm connected squarely with Madeline's cheek.

"Ah!" Madeline staggered backward.

Evelyn turned to flee but collided with a familiar chest. She instinctively raised her hand again, only for her wrist to be caught in an iron grip.

"Had enough?" Alexander Kingsley's voice was hoarse and low.

"Let go!" Evelyn struggled violently. "Don't touch my baby!"

She trembled like a cornered animal, every muscle taut with desperation.

Madeline clutched her reddened cheek, shrill voice piercing the air. "Alexander! Look at her! She even struck me!"

Alexander ignored her, sweeping Evelyn into his arms.

"Put me down!" Evelyn's protest died abruptly.

He pinned her against the hallway wall, crushing his lips against hers.

The metallic tang of blood spread between them. Evelyn bit down hard, drawing blood from his tongue.

"Are you calm now?" Alexander released her, thumb swiping at the crimson streak on his lip.

Evelyn shattered. Tears flooded her cheeks as she slid down the wall, her slight frame wracked with sobs.

Alexander stood frozen.

"Alexander..." She lifted tear-drenched eyes. "If anything happens to this baby... I'll never forgive—"

Each word stabbed through him like a blade.

"Understood." His response was gravel-rough. Turning on his heel, he strode back into the examination room.

Madeline was still wailing. "Everything I did was for the Kingsleys—"

"Who gave you permission to touch her?" Alexander's voice could have frozen hell.

Madeline gaped. "I'm her grandmother!"

"You're not." Each syllable was a hammer strike. "The Sinclairs saved our family. Is this how you repay their kindness?"

Slap!

Madeline's palm cracked across Alexander's face.

"You ungrateful wretch!" She shook with rage. "How dare you speak to me this way!"
###Chapter 301

Madeline Kingsley's slap landed with barely more force than a passing breeze.

Alexander Kingsley's hair didn't even stir.

Yet that single gesture flipped an invisible switch, plunging the examination room into dead silence.

Eleanor Kingsley clamped a hand over her mouth, her breath freezing in her throat.

Madeline's outstretched arm remained suspended midair as her face drained of color.

Alexander's expression smoothed into eerie calm.

The smoldering fury vanished, replaced by glacial detachment.

"Perfect." His voice could have flash-frozen the room. "Now I won't have to call you grandmother anymore."

He turned on his heel.

Madeline stumbled after him in sudden panic, grasping at his sleeve. "Alexander! You can't abandon your own grandmother!"

He shook her off without breaking stride.

The anger that had propelled him here had evaporated.

That slap shattered his last pretense of familial obligation.

He'd never been the devoted grandson—now he wouldn't even pretend.

The hallway stretched empty.

Evelyn Sinclair was gone.

Alexander's stomach dropped.

He quickened his pace, his mind laser-focused: Find her.

She'd promised to stay with him today...

"Alexander!" Madeline's wail echoed behind him. "Don't leave me—"

Eleanor's shriek followed: "Mother! Stay calm!"

Alexander hesitated for half a step before continuing forward.

He threw open the hospital room door to find Evelyn walking toward him, bag in hand.

"Evelyn." He shut the door behind him, blocking the exit.

"Give me my phone." Her eyes remained red-rimmed, but her voice steadied.

"You took the day off." He stood his ground. "You promised."

"What happened back there—you can ignore it. I can't."

"I'm not ignoring anything." His gaze flickered involuntarily toward the hospital bed.

The phone lay there.

He'd left it in his haste.

Thank God she hadn't noticed yet...

Evelyn caught the direction of his glance.

She turned just as Alexander moved.
###Chapter 302: The Sound of a Breaking Heart

Alexander Kingsley rushed to the hospital bed in three quick strides and grabbed the glowing phone.

The elevator dinged open at the same moment.

He whirled around just in time to catch a glimpse of Evelyn Sinclair's coat disappearing through the doors.

"Evelyn!" Alexander sprinted after her. "Stop!"

The VIP ward hallway stretched empty and silent, their footsteps echoing sharply.

Evelyn reached the elevator, stabbing the down button repeatedly.

"I won't chase you," Alexander suddenly halted, holding up the phone. "It's Mom calling."

The elevator took forever. When Evelyn glanced back, she recognized the flashing name on the screen.

She bit her lower lip, conflict flashing in her eyes.

Alexander seized the chance to step closer. "No one can hurt you while I'm here."

Evelyn laughed then—a bitter, broken sound.

"Hurt?" she whispered.

Hadn't the deepest wounds been carved by the man standing before her?

"Mom's waiting." Alexander advanced again, the phone screen glinting in her face.

The elevator doors finally parted, revealing impatient passengers inside.

Evelyn took a deep breath and released the button.

As the doors began closing, she stretched her hand toward Alexander—

He lunged forward like an arrow, shoving the phone into her palm while seizing her wrist, yanking her against his chest.

"Answer it," his hoarse command burned her ear.

Eleanor Kingsley's frantic voice crackled through: "Evelyn, is Alexander with you?"

"He is." Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Alexander's dark, unreadable eyes.

"Grandmother fainted! I couldn't reach Alexander, so I—"

Evelyn passed the phone to him. "Your mother needs you."

Madeline Kingsley's condition no longer concerned her.

"Hn." Alexander's voice turned glacial. "The hospital will handle it."

"But this will reflect poorly on Evelyn!" Eleanor protested. "People will say she's driving a wedge between—"

"Then fire them." His words dripped ice. "I won't tolerate gossip."

"You—" Eleanor faltered. "Some issues can't be solved with terminations."

"Should I let her keep tormenting Evelyn?" Alexander tightened his grip. "How many times must this happen?"

The woman in his arms trembled slightly, reminding him of her tear-streaked face moments ago.

In that instant, he'd heard it—the shattering of his own heart.
###Chapter 303: Please Stay With Me

The phone line remained silent for a long moment.

Eleanor Kingsley finally spoke. "If you insist, I won't force the matter."

"Insist?" Alexander Kingsley's voice rose sharply. "Can't you see how terrified Evelyn is right now?"

He rarely lost his temper with family.

But Eleanor was different.

She was the elder Evelyn respected most—the woman she genuinely regarded as a mother.

How could she say such things?

"Do you understand what this child means to her? Do you know how the Sinclairs fell?"

"What did Grandmother do? She actually tried to take Evelyn for an MRI! If you think that's nothing, then we have nothing left to discuss."

Alexander added coldly, "Forgot to mention—Evelyn already told Grandmother she's pregnant."

Dead silence filled the line.

After a prolonged pause, Eleanor murmured, "I acted thoughtlessly. If you don't need the IV, take Evelyn home to rest."

"I'm staying for observation this afternoon." Alexander abruptly changed his mind. "Resuming IV tomorrow. Evelyn will stay with me."

Evelyn Sinclair's head snapped up, disbelief flashing across her face.

The audacity of this man!

Taking today off didn't mean she'd skip work tomorrow.

After this ordeal, she didn't want to spend another minute in this hospital.

"You'll stay, won't you?" Hanging up, Alexander gazed down at her with infuriating certainty.

"I want to go home." Evelyn's quiet voice held steel.

"Then I'll take you home first. Tomorrow you can accompany me for the IV?" he bargained.

"Alex—"

"Evelyn." He cut her off. "Don't leave. I swear I'll protect you."

He refused to let this minor illness cause friction between them.

This minor illness that had made her Grandmother's target.

Now he'd rather die than see her suffer another slight.

"Here." Noting her silence, Alexander handed over her phone. "You've missed many calls."

Hesitating briefly, Evelyn accepted it.

The moment her fingers touched the device, Alexander suddenly swept her into his arms.

"Ah!" She gasped, instinctively clutching his collar.

A smirk tugged at his lips.

Ignoring his fever, he carried her straight back to the hospital room.

He knew she wouldn't return willingly.

Fine. He'd do it for her.

If she wouldn't walk, he'd carry her.

"Where will you sleep?" Evelyn asked as he gently deposited her on the bed.

"Not tired." Alexander moved closer, his gaze softening unusually. "Rest. I'll watch over you."

Evelyn hesitated. "Then get down?"

The narrow bed barely fit one—why must he crowd in?

Besides, she had no intention of sleeping.

Dozens of missed calls demanded attention.

Alexander didn't budge. This rare proximity was too precious to relinquish.

Evelyn sat up. "I'll take the sofa—"

"Evelyn." His hand closed over her knee. "Don't go."

The near-pleading tone stunned her.

Looking down, she saw half his face shadowed.

"Please," he whispered with aching sincerity. "Stay with me."

Evelyn relented.

Picking up her phone, she checked the call log.

All from colleagues.

Friends like Martha Nash and Iris Cooper, plus troublemakers like Wendy West. Roman Young had called too, leaving a message about hosting an introduction banquet—hoping she'd attend.

Confirming Alexander was awake, Evelyn returned Martha's call.

"Martha, you needed me?"

"Evelyn! Finally! How could you keep quiet about this company scandal?"

"Roman's situation?"

"What else?" Martha's voice pitched higher. "You handled this bombshell alone without warning us!"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "It happened suddenly. Xavier Stapleton lost his nerve."

"He actually tried murder? Should call him Roman Stapleton now." Martha's gossip instincts ignited.

"He couldn't bear losing everything." Evelyn's tone turned icy.

"Serves him right!" Martha spat. "By the way, Hugo Lee and Melissa are at war—know that?"

"What happened?" Interest flickered in Evelyn's voice.

Work talk temporarily numbed the earlier suffocation.

"Details unclear, but Melissa's axing half of Video Department—executives included."

"Hugo's response?"

"Went straight to President Yearwood." Martha lowered her voice. "Heard they screamed at each other in his office. Even the Crown Prince intervened."

At Julian Ashford's mention, Evelyn's expression cooled.

He hadn't contacted her lately. Though guilt lingered, this distance was best.

She couldn't give him what he wanted.

False hope was crueler than clean separation.
###Chapter 304: The Unfinished Pact

"The Crown Prince is clearly on your side." Martha Nash's excited voice carried through the phone. "He went straight to back up Vincent Sullivan. You should've seen Hugo Lee's face—looked like he'd swallowed a fly..."

Evelyn Sinclair was about to respond when Martha suddenly lowered her voice. "The juiciest part? Hugo got beaten up!"

"Expected." Evelyn scoffed.

If it were her, anyone who dared harm her child would find their bones rearranged.

"You didn't see it," Martha continued dramatically. "When Hugo stumbled out of Julian Ashford's office, he was limping with two black eyes and half his face swollen like a balloon..."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Vincent can fight that well?"

"Oh please!" Martha cackled. "The Crown Prince pretended to mediate but kept aiming for Hugo. Tsk, what a scene..."

Evelyn fell silent.

"By the way, why'd you take leave today?" Martha abruptly changed subjects. "Avoiding the fallout?"

"Mhm. Laying low." Evelyn evaded. "Yesterday was exhausting."

"Rumor says everyone on the video team guessed the truth, but Hugo and Xavier Stapleton paid them off?" Martha pressed.

"Basically."

"That bastard Xavier—was he still trying to get to you?" Martha's tone sharpened.

"He tried," Evelyn said flatly. "Didn't succeed though..."

Hanging up, Evelyn glanced down at Alexander Kingsley. His breathing was even, but he occupied only a sliver of the bed's edge, as if poised to fall.

She started shifting away when an arm suddenly tightened around her.

"Don't move." Alexander's sleep-roughened voice murmured. "Let me stay like this a while longer."

"I'll take the sofa—"

Her protest died as his leg pinned hers.

"How am I supposed to rest if you leave?" He lifted his head, eyes hazy, cheeks flushed unnaturally. "I actually slept just now."

His sincerity gave her pause.

"Evelyn..." He suddenly rasped. "I'm thirsty."

She reached for the bedside water glass. "Need help sitting up?"

"Can't you feed me?" His gaze darkened.

Evelyn nearly checked his forehead for fever.

Seeing her hesitation, Alexander pushed upright and took two measured sips before setting the glass down.

"Done."

Before she could react, he flipped her onto the mattress.

"Alexander!" Freshly free from Madeline Kingsley's shadow, this was the last thing she expected. "Stop!"

"Know why I'm sick?" His voice scraped like gravel.

Evelyn held her breath.

"Five cold showers. Soaked to the bone." His hungry stare traced her face. "Pathetic, right?"

It was.

Since she left, he'd been a ghost of himself.

Returning to the Kingsleys despite knowing it wouldn't change anything. Drinking Eleanor's suspicious soup despite the warning signs. Torturing himself despite her indifference.

"Evelyn, if I could let go, I would've by now." A bitter laugh escaped him. "Why can't I?"

Because some things cling like shadows.

"Get a grip," she turned her face away. "We're in a hosp—Ah!"

Sharp teeth grazed her neck.

"Alexander!" She thrashed violently.

"Remember what I said last time?" Madness threaded his words.

"What last time?"

"That hotel during your business trip..."

Memory struck—had Roman Young not knocked when he did...

"Not here. Anything else..." She conceded ground.

"Anything?" Alexander laughed hollowly. "More empty promises?"

"Then I won't even pretend now." Fury ignited in her. "Have you forgotten our agreement? I—"

A frantic knock interrupted.

"Evelyn! Are you both in there?" Patriarch Kingsley's voice boomed.

"Must be," came Victor Eaton's reply. "They were seen entering. Alex! Open up!"

Evelyn froze.

Had they overheard everything?

Including... the agreement?

Alexander abruptly released her, straightening his collar. "Get down."

His tone had iced over completely.

Blinking, Evelyn watched him slide back under the covers before composing herself to open the door.

"Evelyn, are you alright?" Patriarch Kingsley's concern was palpable.
###Chapter 305: The Kingsley Family's Joyful News

"I didn't..." At least everything turned out fine in the end.

Especially since Patriarch Kingsley genuinely cared for her.

"Evelyn, come with me." The old man ignored Alexander resting on the hospital bed and motioned to her. "Let me handle this for you."

"No need, Grandfather." Evelyn Sinclair took half a step back. "It's over now."

See Madeline Kingsley again? Listen to her tearful apologies?

Enough.

She'd had enough.

The resistance in Evelyn's eyes didn't escape the old man.

He sighed deeply. The girl's heart was truly wounded.

"Evelyn, family matters should stay within the family." Patriarch Kingsley glanced meaningfully at the hospital bed. "We all support you. Clear the air, then you and Alexander can move forward. We won't interfere."

Evelyn knew Eleanor Kingsley would rush to comfort her if possible.

In the Kingsley household, everyone treated her like treasure—except Madeline.

Yet this suffocating affection only made her crave freedom more.

......

Madeline sat weeping on her hospital bed. "What did I do wrong? I only cared about Evelyn's health!"

Eleanor stood nearby, exasperated.

When the tears finally slowed, she spoke. "Mother, forcing medical tests on a healthy person would anger anyone. You promised last time to stop meddling—"

"Everything's my fault! This old hag should stop interfering!" Madeline suddenly erupted. "I shouldn't care about the Kingsley bloodline!"

"Just let me die!" She made a show of climbing out of bed.

"Enough!" Patriarch Kingsley stormed in.

Mr. Kingsley hurried to support him. "Father, please be careful."

Evelyn and Alexander followed silently behind.

Madeline's tears redoubled at their arrival. "Here to scold your foolish old grandmother, are you?"

"Mother, your blood pressure," Mr. Kingsley reminded gently.

"What does blood pressure matter?" Madeline snapped. "I'll be dead soon anyway!"

"Silence!" Patriarch Kingsley roared. "You nearly harmed Evelyn and our great-grandchild, yet you dare play the victim?"

Madeline froze mid-tantrum. "Great-grandchild?"

Her face darkened. "You're lying to shame me?"

"Mother, we wouldn't—" Mr. Kingsley began.

"Faking a pregnancy just to criticize me?" Madeline's voice rose hysterically.

Evelyn clenched her jaw as Alexander's arm tightened around her waist.

Even looking at Madeline made her nauseous.

"Enough!" The patriarch's voice shook the room. "Would Evelyn refuse tests unless she was truly pregnant? Unlike you, she doesn't create drama for attention!"

Madeline shrank under his fury.

"We kept it secret because of your reckless actions! You almost killed Evelyn and our heir with that MRI! Alexander was right—who gave you the right?"

Silence filled the ward.

Finally, Madeline peeked at Evelyn. "She's really...?"

Evelyn turned away, expression icy.

"Would we joke about this?" Eleanor said scornfully. "Evelyn isn't a fraud like Isabella Winslow."

"The baby... is it alright?" Madeline's focus shifted entirely.

"The car accident caused complications, but it's stable now." Eleanor spoke vaguely. "Mother, you nearly caused a disaster today."

Realization dawned on Madeline. She looked pleadingly at Evelyn. "Evelyn..."

As Evelyn moved to leave, Alexander spoke first. "We're going. I need rest."

Madeline remembered her grandson's injuries. "Yes, rest! But Evelyn should stay with—"

"She stays with me." Alexander's voice cut like ice. "You have plenty of company."

His cold stare stung Madeline.

But soon, excitement took over. "The baby wasn't hurt in the crash?"

Eleanor sighed inwardly.

Did this woman have nothing better to do?

"Keep causing scenes, and you'll never meet your great-grandchild," Patriarch Kingsley warned.

"I just asked..." Madeline forced a smile.

No one bothered to respond.

......

"Where are you going?" Alexander gripped Evelyn's wrist at the elevator. "Stay. With me."
###Chapter 306: Your Home Is Our Home

"I want to leave."

Evelyn Sinclair's voice was soft but resolute.

Every member of the Kingsley family felt like a mountain pressing on her heart. The Sinclairs' kindness shouldn't be repaid this way.

If given a choice, she'd rather the Sinclairs had never saved the Kingsleys.

Losing her parents and her past had cost her over a decade of self-denial. Now, breaking free seemed impossible.

The cruelest irony? Fate had given her a child, binding her to the Kingsleys forever.

"Rest at my place," Alexander Kingsley insisted.

"You think I can stay here?" Evelyn's voice trembled. "Not everyone has a heart of stone like you."

She quickened her steps toward the exit.

This time, Alexander didn't stop her—he simply followed.

Outside the hospital, as Evelyn raised her hand to hail a cab, Alexander gripped her wrist.

"We'll go together."

"No." She shook him off. "I can't risk your illness."

"It's just a cold." His tone was patient. "You can accompany me for the IV tomorrow."

"Tomorrow?" She scoffed.

Did he expect her to orbit around him like before?

"Or the doctor can come to us," Alexander compromised.

"Do what you want. The Kingsley estate is spacious enough." Her expression remained blank.

"I'm not going back there." His face darkened at the mention of home.

"Then stay away from my place."

"It's our home," he corrected.

Evelyn whirled around.

"Your home is mine," Alexander stated matter-of-factly.

Before she could retort, a car pulled up.

"Get in." He ushered her inside without room for refusal.

———

Madeline Kingsley left the hospital in high spirits.

Learning of Evelyn's pregnancy had shaved ten years off her age. She insisted on visiting her granddaughter-in-law, only to find the room empty.

"Those newlyweds," the old woman chuckled, returning home with joy bubbling in her chest.

In her social group chat, someone shared photos of their grandson.

[Has my sweet boy gained weight?]

The others showered praise.

Madeline offered polite compliments while privately dismissing them. Just wait until my great-grandchild arrives—then you'll see real beauty.

[Madeline, when will Alexander give you a bouncing baby boy?]

The question stung. She had both a daughter-in-law and grandchild—yet couldn't boast.

An old friend called to console her.

"That Li woman went too far!"

"It's fine. She doesn't know about Evelyn," Madeline forced magnanimity.

Mid-conversation, she accidentally revealed Evelyn's pregnancy.

Silence.

"You just found out? The accident happened weeks ago." Her friend's tone turned pointed. "Could the whole family have known except you?"

Madeline's heart sank.

"Impossible," she deflected, though doubt crept in.

Seizing the moment, her friend mentioned Isabella Winslow. "Her baby bump is showing now. The child's perfectly healthy."

Madeline stayed quiet.

"Would you like to see her prenatal reports?" The coaxing continued.

After hesitation: "...Show me."

———

The next day, the doctor arrived to administer Alexander's IV.

Evelyn checked her watch. "I'm returning to the office this afternoon."

"Busier than me?" He smirked.

Horizon Media's video division was in chaos. The Roman Young scandal had the "Lee faction" scrambling for information from Evelyn.

"I'll pick you up." Alexander brushed a kiss against her ear before leaving.

Her earlobe burned, but she had no time to retaliate.

———

Chaos reigned at Horizon Video.

"Evelyn, help me!" Wendy West clung desperately. "I bullied Roman with Xavier before, but I've changed!"

Evelyn ignored her.

"Please talk to Roman—he's so kind—"

"HR handles staffing." Her refusal was ice-cold.

Seeing pleas fail, Wendy's eyes flashed venom.

As Evelyn turned away, Wendy lunged.

"What are you doing?" A sharp voice rang out.

Evelyn sidestepped against the wall. Wendy crashed to the floor.

"Evelyn!" she wailed. "You won't help me, but must you push me?"

A crowd gathered.

Evelyn stared down coldly. "Who taught you that trick?"

Wendy paled.

Grabbing her collar, Evelyn hissed, "What did Isabella promise you?"
###Chapter 307: Her Pregnancy Secret Leaks

Wendy West's face drained of color, turning as pale as parchment.

Her lips trembled as panic flickered in her eyes.

"H-how did you..." Her voice trailed off.

Several unfamiliar men closed in. One seized her wrist while another pinned her shoulder.

"What are you doing?" Wendy struggled frantically.

She cast desperate glances at her colleagues, only to see them deliberately looking away.

"Evelyn pushed me! Why are you arresting me?" Wendy burst into theatrical sobs.

The crowd exchanged uneasy looks. Some shot disapproving glances at Evelyn Sinclair.

To them, this seemed like petty revenge from someone newly empowered.

"Evidence?" The restraining man spoke coldly.

Wendy pointed accusingly. "It was her! She pushed me deliberately!"

"Really?" The man smirked and signaled behind him.

A compact video camera was produced.

Wendy's pupils contracted violently, her body going rigid with dread.

"Impossible..." she whispered, her face ghostly white.

The footage clearly showed her lunging at Evelyn.

Gasps erupted around them.

"My God, how vicious!"

"Playing victim when she's the perpetrator!"

"I always knew she was trouble..."

The crowd clamored to condemn her, eager to join the moral high ground.

Evelyn watched the spectacle impassively before pulling out her phone.

"Call the police."

Wendy's head snapped up, terror in her eyes.

"Evelyn! I'm sorry! I'll confess everything!"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn turned to leave.

"Isabella Winslow!" Wendy shrieked hysterically. "She put me up to this!"

Evelyn paused mid-step.

"She promised me five million to make you fall..."

Shocked murmurs spread through the onlookers.

"Who even are you?" Wendy struggled anew. "By what right—"

The man flashed his badge. "Kingsley Group legal team."

Those three words made Wendy collapse bonelessly to the floor.

Police arrived swiftly, taking Wendy and the evidence into custody.

As the squad car drove away, Evelyn's fingers drifted unconsciously to her abdomen.

Isabella knew.

The secret was out.
###Chapter 308: Twenty Years of Deception

Wendy West collapsed onto the floor, her face ashen.

She never imagined her carefully laid scheme would end like this.

The hush money promised by Isabella Winslow had vanished into thin air. That fortune could have secured her escape, silenced all wagging tongues.

But now...

"Evelyn!" She suddenly lunged forward, clutching Evelyn Sinclair's legs. "I was wrong! I truly regret it!"

Police officers swiftly pulled her away.

Evelyn gazed coldly at her once-arrogant colleague, now kowtowing with bloodied forehead.

"My elderly parents depend on me... The mortgage, the car payments..." Wendy's forehead was smeared crimson. "Please show mercy..."

"So," Evelyn's voice remained steady, "that justifies harming others?"

Wendy trembled violently.

"The law treats everyone equally." Evelyn turned to the Kingsley Group's legal team with a nod. "Let's go."

The lawyers split into two groups. One accompanied Evelyn to the police station while the other stormed Horizon Media's legal department.

"We need evidence regarding your forged cease-and-desist letters."

The legal staff turned deathly pale.

When Evelyn returned to the company, Horizon Media was in upheaval.

"Evelyn!" Sophie rushed over excitedly. "Mr. Lee's been stripped of power! Mr. Sullivan just axed half the company!"

She handed over a list densely packed with Lee faction members.

Xavier Stapleton's entire team had been purged.

"Oh," Sophie lowered her voice, "Mr. Sullivan wants to see you immediately."

Outside the CEO's office, Evelyn encountered Hugo Lee.

The man's eyes burned with venomous hatred, as if he wanted to devour her alive.

Evelyn didn't spare him a glance, pushing straight into Vincent Sullivan's office.

"You're here." Vincent smiled, extending a gilded invitation. "Next week's family banquet—you must attend."

Evelyn opened the card. Ocean Palace, Kingsbury's most exclusive venue, booked for the entire day.

The Sullivans were making up for twenty years of neglect in one grand gesture.

"Roman's recovering well?" She closed the invitation.

"He'll be discharged next week." Vincent's eyes softened. "I'll have him continue working under you."

He paused, growing serious. "I'm assembling a dedicated team for your new interview program."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Lee's faction—"

"He's finished." Vincent's smile turned icy. "The forged documents case is airtight."

The older man massaged his temples wearily. "Twenty years... I was blind for so long."

Evelyn lowered her gaze.

A question hovered on her lips.

"Uncle Vincent," she finally said, "how did you and Mr. Lee... meet?"

"University classmates." Vincent sighed deeply. "Decades of friendship, and yet..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, leaving the rest unasked.

Some truths, she knew, she'd have to uncover herself.
###Chapter 309: The Last Thing He Could Do for Her

"Ask whatever you want." Vincent Sullivan noticed Evelyn Sinclair's hesitation and smiled gently.

Evelyn's fingertips traced the rim of her teacup. Vincent clearly didn't know her true identity—he was even unaware of Hugo Lee's schemes. How could he possibly know about the feud between the Sinclairs and Hugo?

"Uncle Vincent, I heard Hugo Lee is one of Horizon's founding members?"

"He joined the company before I did." Vincent sighed, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepening.

Evelyn feigned casualness. "So he founded Horizon? The Financial Department seems to be full of his people."

"Founder is too strong a word. He merely took advantage of an existing..." Vincent suddenly stopped, his expression turning complicated.

Evelyn stood to leave. "I won't take up more of your time. See you at the banquet next week."

Vincent seemed to want to say more but only nodded in the end.

Inside Horizon Tower, the video of Wendy West pushing someone spread like wildfire.

News of Evelyn's pregnancy took flight, reaching every corner in an instant.

"You knew she was pregnant?" William Yearwood slammed a stack of photos onto the desk. "Is that why you refused the arranged meetings?"

Julian Ashford stood by the window, his back rigid. "I didn't know."

Even if he had, he would have been the last to know.

Her secrecy cut deeper than any rejection.

"And you're still obsessed?" William sneered. "Even if she has the child, the Ashfords will never accept her. A boy can stay. A girl, she takes with her."

"It's over between us." Julian turned, his eyes icy. "My marriage isn't yours to decide."

William froze.

"Since Evelyn and I are done," Julian enunciated each word, "leave her alone. The child—" His Adam's apple bobbed. "Regardless of gender, carries Ashford blood. That's my final line."

Silence swallowed the office.

Only when Julian opened the door did William snap out of it. "If you cooperate, the family won't trouble her."

Julian closed his eyes briefly.

Trading this hollow pretense for her safety—it was the last thing he could do for her.

"The Sullivans' banquet next week. The whole family will attend." William's voice chased after him.

No need to guess—another meticulously arranged meeting awaited. With Melissa Lee gone, countless others like her stood ready...

The Kingsley living room was littered with invitations.

"The Sullivans?" Eleanor Kingsley arched a brow at the gilded card. "We've never associated with them."

"That family's matriarch is insufferable." Madeline Kingsley sniffed, lifting her teacup.

A servant's excited voice interrupted. "Lord Alex is home!"

Both women turned toward the foyer.

Alexander Kingsley appeared in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression stormy.

"Did the sun rise in the west today?" Eleanor greeted him with a smile.

Alexander strode straight to Madeline.

Her smile faltered as he snatched the phone from her hands.

"Alex!" Eleanor gasped.

His long fingers swiped across the screen. His voice was glacial. "Who's been Isabella's mouthpiece? Who leaked Evelyn's pregnancy?"

Madeline went pale.

Eleanor stood frozen.

Every servant in the room held their breath.

Alexander had never lost control like this. His warning to Madeline that day had only been the beginning.

"Explain yourself!" Eleanor moved to grab the phone.

But the old woman had already collapsed onto the sofa—her prized dignity shattered beyond repair.
###Chapter 310: You Don't Deserve to Know About Her

Alexander Kingsley twisted his wrist effortlessly, evading Eleanor Kingsley's reaching hand.

His gaze swept over the red-faced, furious old woman. He took a deep breath before speaking. "Someone tried to push Evelyn down at the company today."

"What does her falling have to do with me?" Madeline Kingsley shrieked suddenly. "Should I be blamed if she sneezes too? Alexander Kingsley! You've gone too far! Cough—"

Violent coughing bent the old woman double, tears and mucus streaming down her face.

Eleanor hurriedly patted Madeline's back while turning to scold Alexander. "Have you lost your mind? Even if you're worried about Evelyn, you can't treat your grandmother this way! If you don't explain yourself properly today, don't bother coming home again!"

Alexander's expression remained icy as he tossed his phone onto the sofa.

"Isabella Winslow bribed a Horizon Media employee to cause Evelyn to miscarry." His voice held terrifying calm. "She knows Evelyn is carrying my child."

The words acted like a pause button.

Eleanor's tirade cut off abruptly. Even Madeline's coughing ceased momentarily.

"What?" Eleanor gasped before scoffing. "That does sound like something she'd do."

Everyone praised the Winslow heiress for her grace and intellect.

Only Eleanor saw the viper beneath that gentle facade.

Madeline kept coughing, but the shocking news left her speechless.

"Did you tell Isabella?" Alexander read the answer in Madeline's panicked eyes. "Or did your mahjong friends let it slip? You've been broadcasting Evelyn's pregnancy everywhere."

"I—I didn't..." Madeline's initial panic gave way to defiance. "The whole family knew she was pregnant except me! How dare you accuse me of leaking it!"

Alexander nearly laughed at the sheer stupidity.

He didn't bother explaining—Eleanor had already turned away in disgust.

"Because everyone else understood the gravity. You just found out yesterday, and today Evelyn was attacked. Madeline Kingsley, did you deserve to know this at all?"

"You...ungrateful wretch..." Madeline trembled with rage.

Alexander said nothing more, addressing Eleanor instead. "Get the details from her. I'm leaving."

He turned on his heel. Behind him, Madeline's hysterical sobs mingled with Eleanor's weary sigh.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of the company building to find Alexander's car parked in its usual spot.

As she hesitated, the window rolled down. His cold voice carried through. "Get in unless you want to make headlines."

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn opened the door.

Alexander's domineering nature hadn't changed in ten years.

Only after the car started moving did she notice the unfamiliar young man in the passenger seat.

Catching her gaze, he turned with a bright smile. "Good evening, Mrs. Kingsley. I'm Lord Alex's new assistant. You can call me Zheng."

Evelyn didn't ask about Nathan Carter's whereabouts.

Personnel changes at Kingsley Group weren't her concern.

What troubled her more was Alexander's stormy expression, which had darkened the moment she entered the car.
###Chapter 311: One Year Is Far Too Short

Evelyn didn't press for answers.

She knew Alexander Kingsley's temperament all too well.

The man had always been this way—he'd speak when ready, and any probing would only invite humiliation.

These days, his disdain no longer affected her.

But she saw no reason to invite unnecessary unpleasantness.

Silence stretched between them in the car.

"How many more like Wendy West remain in your company?" Alexander suddenly asked.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Meaning?"

"Meaning?" He echoed her words, irritation simmering beneath his tone.

Even after confronting the Kingsley matriarch, his agitation refused to dissipate.

With Evelyn, he always felt this powerlessness.

He could easily cage her away from all danger, yet she stubbornly resisted.

And he couldn't bring himself to clip her wings.

Watching her skirt peril night after night left him sleepless.

Alexander didn't understand what he feared most.

During the hours waiting for her shift to end, he'd realized one truth—he still craved the warmth she'd once given him.

Back then, whether genuine or not, she'd stayed within his boundaries, gazing at him with fiery devotion.

He'd been consumed by suspicion then. Now, those days felt like rare treasures.

"Are you certain you can protect yourself?" His voice was ice.

"Absolutely." Evelyn turned to the window, her profile cool and detached. After a beat, she laughed softly and met his eyes. "Though I wonder who put me in this position to begin with?"

Alexander's breath caught.

Right.

Wendy had acted on Isabella Winslow's orders. And why Isabella saw Evelyn as a threat needed no explanation.

His lips twisted in self-mockery.

So he was the root cause after all?

"Rest assured, I'll honor our agreement." His promise dripped with sarcasm, though it was unclear who it mocked. "The terms are clearly spelled out in black and white."

He would protect her and their unborn child.

In return, she'd remain his wife for one year...

One year?

Far too short!

Alexander's knuckles whitened.

He knew exactly what she planned.

Did she truly think she could walk away after a year? Never.

"By the way, thank you today." Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like winter sunlight.

His rigid posture eased slightly. "For what?"

"The legal team." She left it at that.

The Kingsley Group's lawyers hadn't appeared by accident.

Officially, they'd investigated the forged cease-and-desist letter. In truth, they'd come to shield her.

"Hn." Alexander's acknowledgment was barely audible.

The charged atmosphere in the car gradually softened...

After the Wendy incident, Horizon Media's video division became noticeably quieter.

The troublemakers had left. Those who remained kept to themselves.

Evelyn threw herself into assembling a new team and preparing fresh programming.

Office rumors swirled—some claimed Xavier Stapleton faced attempted murder charges, while others whispered Hugo Lee had privately apologized to the Sullivans after a surface-level reconciliation.

Two days before the Sullivan gala, Roman Young returned.

Now bearing the Sullivan name as Roman Sullivan, he'd spent his post-hospital days adjusting to family life before reappearing at work.

"Evelyn." Transformed, his eyes alight with purpose, he handed her an ornate box. "You must come tomorrow. Mother prepared this gown—see if you like it. The designer can make adjustments."

Evelyn teased, "'Mother' rolls off your tongue rather easily."

Roman scratched his head sheepishly. "Just conveying her exact words. I'm clueless about women's fashion."

When Evelyn lifted the lid and saw the snow-white fabric, she froze.

"You dislike it?" Roman tensed.

"No, it's beautiful." She managed a faint smile.

White... How long had it been?

That color had vanished from her world after leaving Alexander.

"Never mind." Roman repacked the gown. "There are blue and purple options. I'll have them sent over."

Madam Sullivan had provided multiple dresses. He'd chosen his favorite white one, only to misread her reaction.

Years of hardship had honed his ability to read subtle cues.

"I actually have suitable attire," Evelyn said without insistence.

She truly wished to avoid white, but wouldn't refuse genuine kindness.

True healing meant no longer deliberately avoiding reminders.

Roman worked swiftly. Soon, an array of gowns arrived.

Trying them in her office, Evelyn admired Madam Sullivan's impeccable taste. They'd met only twice, yet the woman had gauged her measurements perfectly.

Each gown boasted distinct styles, all flawlessly fitted.

She finally selected an amethyst chiffon dress with delicate sleeves and a skirt dusted with sequins that shimmered like starlight.

"Please thank Madam Sullivan for me." She returned the others.

The Sullivans' goodwill, so long as it remained appropriate, she would accept.

Her family's downfall had taught her—there was no virtue in unnecessary pride.

On the gala evening, the Sullivan car arrived punctually.

Autumn's chill had set in. Evelyn arrived at the venue wrapped in a lilac trench coat.

When she shed the outer layer, the attendant's eyes widened at the vision in violet.
###Chapter 312: Miss Sinclair Becomes the Headline

The ballroom lights seemed to converge on her alone.

Evelyn Sinclair entered in stilettos, and the air momentarily stilled.

"Whose daughter is that?" someone whispered.

"That dress..." A socialite tightened her grip on her champagne flute. "I tried it on and looked like a walking purple lantern."

Yet the violet sequined gown draped Evelyn's figure like it was custom-made. Not a single crease out of place, every seam sculpting her elegant curves to perfection.

"I remember now!" a guest gasped. "She's that journalist!"

Madam Zade rushed forward, eyes glistening. "Miss Sinclair!"

Vincent Sullivan practically sprinted over. "Evelyn!"

All eyes locked onto Evelyn. The hosts of tonight's gala were fawning over this young woman.

"Miss Sinclair helped reunite us with our son," Madam Zade said tearfully.

The Sullivan matriarch stood unusually quiet nearby. Since her grandson's return, she'd lost all energy for bickering—her mind consumed with settling scores with the Lees.

"If not for Miss Sinclair that day..." Madam Zade recounted how Evelyn had rescued Vincent.

Several ladies dabbed their eyes with tissues.

"Miss Sinclair is quite renowned in journalism," someone remarked meaningfully.

Knowing glances were exchanged. Everyone knew her most famous feat—suing Alexander Kingsley and winning.

"Truly a woman who rivals men," a guest praised, offering a business card. "I'd love to collaborate."

...

"How attention-seeking," Mrs. Ashford sniffed. "One would think the Sullivans are welcoming their daughter-in-law."

Julian Ashford's gaze never left Evelyn. His brow furrowed at his mother's words.

"Julian, ignore her," Mrs. Ashford tugged his sleeve, gesturing to the girl beside her. "Clarisse canceled her family's banquet just to see you."

Clarisse Choi smiled sweetly, though her eyes darkened.

She'd done her research on Julian. Behind this aloof man's demeanor, she knew exactly who occupied his heart.

When she saw how Julian looked at Evelyn, Clarisse's nails dug into her palm. The obsession in his eyes chilled her.

"Excuse me," Julian turned away.

Mrs. Ashford hurried to reassure Clarisse. "I'll bring him back."

Once alone, Clarisse picked up her glass and approached Evelyn with her friend in tow.

"Miss Sinclair," she chirped innocently. "I've heard so much about you."

Her friend played along. "Oh? Like what?"

"Miss Sinclair is a legend in journalism," Clarisse trilled. "Not only did she win against Lord Alex..."

She paused deliberately, letting ears perk up around them.

"She kept working through her pregnancy," she blinked. "Though I wonder—who's the father?"

The ballroom fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.
###Chapter 313: A Public Slap in the Face

The chandelier's glow cast an eerie silence around Evelyn Sinclair.

She could feel dozens of eyes piercing her abdomen like arrows.

"Oh my!" Chloe Cui's friend gasped theatrically, covering her mouth. "I never would've guessed!"

The deliberately hushed yet perfectly audible exclamation reached every guest in the ballroom.

Chloe smirked behind her hand. "Someone as accomplished as Ms. Sinclair surely didn't sleep her way to the top?"

The crowd's expressions shifted instantly.

Their polite masks slipped away, revealing naked disdain.

Vincent Sullivan's face darkened. His parents exchanged displeased glances.

Evelyn's pregnancy wasn't meant to be discussed here.

"Such vile gossip these days," Chloe sighed dramatically. "People actually claim Ms. Sinclair secured deals by bearing some old man's child—"

Her friend chimed in: "How ridiculous! Ms. Sinclair would never!"

Their tag-team performance cornered Evelyn perfectly.

"Miss Cui." Evelyn's lips curved into a serene smile. "Thank you for debunking those rumors."

Chloe preened—until Evelyn continued:

"You seem quite knowledgeable about sugar daddies and mistresses. After all, your father's illegitimate children could field a soccer team, couldn't they?"

Chloe's face drained of color.

"How dare you!" her friend snapped.

Evelyn sipped champagne, unfazed. "Where is your father tonight? Celebrating his third son's birthday?"

Chloe trembled, manicured nails digging into her palms.

She never imagined Evelyn knew the Cui family's darkest secret.

"A journalist's instincts," Evelyn said lightly. "Occupational hazard."

Only then did Chloe realize she'd picked the wrong opponent.

She'd meant to humiliate Evelyn and impress Julian Ashford.

Instead, she'd exposed her own family's disgrace.

The guests' gazes now brimmed with mocking amusement.

"Mr. Sullivan." A waiter approached urgently. "Madeline and Eleanor Kingsley have arrived."

The Sullivans stood immediately.

Madam Zade linked arms with Evelyn. "Come greet our distinguished guests."

She didn't spare Chloe a glance—a dismissal clearer than words.

Chloe stood rooted, cheeks burning.

"Should we..." her friend whispered, "go see the Kingsleys too?"

Chloe glared at Evelyn's retreating figure, eyes blazing.

Her carefully laid trap had become her own public downfall.
###Chapter 314: The Battle for the Kingsley Daughter-in-Law

"Shall we go to the lounge area?" Monica Chen asked solicitously, linking arms with Chloe Cui.

Chloe gently pulled away. "Don't mind me. Mrs. Kingsley is here—this is your chance."

"The Kingsleys?" Monica gave a self-deprecating laugh. "What socialite in Kingsbury could ever land Alexander Kingsley?"

She shot Chloe a meaningful glance. "Not everyone has your luck stumbling upon Julian Ashford."

Though the Ashfords weren't as prominent as the Kingsleys, Julian was still considered one of the city's most eligible bachelors.

Catching the bitterness in her tone, Chloe smirked. "Even the best men have their... obstacles."

She spat out the word through clenched teeth: "Women."

The image of Evelyn Sinclair in that lavender dress haunted her.

"What man doesn't have admirers?" Monica shrugged. "Alexander probably has more than most. Julian's practically a saint by comparison."

"Let's go greet Mrs. Kingsley." Chloe dragged Monica forward, though her chest felt like it was weighed down by stones.

......

"I'll have you know I'm still angry," Madeline Kingsley said sternly. "Since when do elders apologize to their juniors?"

"Mother, we're here to relax," Eleanor Kingsley coaxed gently.

"Relax?" The old woman snorted. "Don't think I don't know Evelyn's coming. My sources are excellent!"

Her voice grew sharper. "Neglecting her own husband's illness to meddle in other families' affairs. If that's the case, why agree to marry into the Kingsleys at all?"

Eleanor sighed inwardly.

As expected, the matriarch had her own intelligence network.

It had taken Eleanor considerable effort to uncover Evelyn's involvement with the Sullivans—the very reason she'd brought Madeline to this banquet.

Despite multiple dinner invitations, Evelyn had politely declined each one. Clearly, she had no intention of reconciling with her grandmother.

Meanwhile, Madeline's pride wouldn't allow her to admit fault. She'd been throwing daily tantrums, driving Patriarch Kingsley to escape through fishing trips.

Eleanor had hoped a public setting might bridge the rift between grandmother and granddaughter.

"Mother, you mustn't reveal Evelyn's identity," Eleanor stressed again.

"Understood!" Madeline replied tartly. "Is being a Kingsley daughter-in-law so shameful?"

"Mother..."

Eleanor regretted the entire plan.

"Madeline! Eleanor!" The Sullivans greeted them warmly.

Both women immediately spotted Evelyn standing arm-in-arm with Madam Zade.

"Our congratulations." Eleanor presented a gift, studying Vincent Sullivan. "Your son is the very image of you both."

Madam Zade laughed. "He inherited all our worst traits, I'm afraid."

Eleanor covered a smile. "Biological mothers always say that. My own son might as well be roasted pork."

"You're too kind!" Madam Zade chuckled.

"And this is...?" Eleanor pretended not to recognize Evelyn.

"Miss Sinclair, our family's savior." Madam Zade introduced eagerly. "We owe our son's return to her."

As Eleanor prepared to compliment Evelyn, Madeline let out a derisive sniff.

Eleanor discreetly nudged her mother-in-law before turning to Evelyn. "Miss Sinclair, how lovely to meet you."

Her tone held playful warmth.

Evelyn caught the cue and nodded slightly. "Mrs. Kingsley."

"This is the family matriarch," Eleanor indicated.

Evelyn's smile cooled. "Madeline."

The blatant contrast made the old woman's expression darken further. Had Eleanor not been gripping her arm, she would have stormed off.

The group moved into the ballroom, soon surrounded by fawning guests.

Gradually, Madeline's mood improved as socialites vied for her attention. Seeing her finally smile, Eleanor relaxed slightly.

The truth was clear—the rift between Evelyn and Madeline couldn't be mended. Pushing further might damage Eleanor's own relationship with Evelyn.

Wisely, Eleanor maintained distance, exchanging only occasional words with Evelyn while circulating among guests.

Every socialite present understood the unspoken rules.

Eleanor Kingsley was an impenetrable fortress—attempts to flatter her were futile.

But Madeline? A determined charmer could always win the old woman's favor.
###Chapter 315: Just Marry Into Our Family With The Baby

Madeline Kingsley sat in the corner of the banquet hall, surrounded by a flock of socialites. A benevolent smile graced her lips, but shrewdness lurked in her eyes.

"Grandmother, you must come to my birthday party next month." Chloe Cui clung to the elderly woman's arm affectionately. "My parents will be overjoyed."

The old lady patted her hand. "This old bones might just be in your way."

"Never!" The other debutantes chimed in immediately. "Having you there would be our honor."

"If you're attending Chloe's, you must visit my home too."

"Yes, Grandmother mustn't play favorites."

Eleanor Kingsley observed the spectacle from a distance, her expression icy. These girls' intentions were transparent—they might as well have "I want to marry into the Kingsleys" stamped on their foreheads.

Her gaze shifted to Evelyn Sinclair standing quietly nearby, and a playful smile curved her lips.

"Miss Sinclair, are you married?" Eleanor's sudden question cut through the chatter.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Yes, I am."

"Oh?" Eleanor feigned surprise. "Which fortunate gentleman won your heart?"

"Just an ordinary man." Evelyn's tone remained neutral.

Eleanor shook her head dramatically. "I refuse to believe that. A woman like you settling for mediocrity?"

The surrounding socialites fell silent, their stares piercing Evelyn.

"Truly, he's just an average person." Evelyn shrugged helplessly. "What's done is done."

"Divorce him." Eleanor's suggestion carried a teasing edge. "Does he treat you well?"

Evelyn sighed. "Neither exceptionally well nor poorly."

"What kind of answer is that?" Madeline interjected sharply. "Good is good. Bad is bad."

Ignoring the matriarch, Eleanor continued baiting Evelyn. "In that case, why not divorce him and marry into our family instead?"

The words detonated like a bomb.

The debutantes' faces paled. Even as a jest, such words from Eleanor carried weight.

Molly Mo couldn't resist a snide remark. "Even if Miss Sinclair divorces, she's carrying someone else's child. Who would marry her?"

"You're pregnant?" Eleanor pretended shock.

Evelyn nodded resignedly. "Three or four months along."

"Tsk tsk," a socialite muttered. "So far along and the father's identity remains mysterious."

"Rumor has it some tycoon pursued her—trading resources for the baby?"

"Could the father and husband be different men?"

Eleanor's lips curled coldly. "Even better. Miss Sinclair can bring the child into our family. My unfilial son has no intention of marrying properly anyway."

"Outrageous!" Madeline shot to her feet, livid. "How dare you spout such nonsense?"

Eleanor froze. The old woman's reaction seemed disproportionate to a harmless joke.

"Mother, I was merely jesting—"

"With me. Now." The matriarch's command brooked no argument.

Eleanor gave Evelyn's hand a reassuring pat before following Madeline to a secluded corner.

The moment they were alone, Madeline hissed, "Have you lost your mind? Making such remarks in public!"

"It was just a joke—"

"Jokes require discretion!" Madeline's voice trembled with suppressed fury. "Have you considered how this reflects on the Kingsley name?"

Only then did Eleanor grasp the gravity. The matriarch's reaction hinted at deeper implications...
###Chapter 316: Stop Obsessing Over Other Women

"Mother..." Eleanor Kingsley hesitated, "This isn't about propriety. I just don't want Evelyn to suffer anymore."

"What suffering?" Madeline Kingsley scoffed. "Is being part of our family beneath her? Why is she hiding like this?"

Eleanor's grip tightened around her teacup.

No one understood Evelyn's longing to marry Alexander better than she did.

That girl had once waited outside the Kingsley mansion just to catch a glimpse of him.

Was this the outcome she'd desired?

"Mother, let's not forget who pushed Evelyn away in the first place." Eleanor's voice trembled. "Alexander rejected her, humiliated her, tormented her..."

She wouldn't have lasted a day in Evelyn's place.

Yet Evelyn endured six years.

Six years of silent suffering earned her no mercy. Now that she'd finally found the strength to leave, Eleanor felt relieved for her.

The old woman would never understand.

She only saw Evelyn's reluctance to go public now, forgetting the years of pain that led to this moment.

"This discussion is over!" Madeline slammed the table. "Unless they divorce, the truth will come out eventually! They should stop meeting in public to avoid future embarrassment!"

Eleanor suddenly laughed.

"Mother, have you forgotten?" She met the older woman's gaze squarely. "Evelyn is Alexander's wife now, and she always will be."

Madeline's expression darkened.

"Save your schemes." Eleanor's tone turned icy. "Alexander wouldn't glance at those women you favor, and neither should you."

Madeline trembled with rage, her machinations laid bare.

But Eleanor had no more energy for arguments.

Some people would never grasp Evelyn's true worth to the Kingsley family.

......

"Miss Sinclair, you must be four months along?"

No sooner had the Kingsley women left than Evelyn found herself surrounded by socialites.

She rested a hand on her abdomen, smiling serenely. "Indeed."

Her composure only fueled their irritation.

"Mrs. Kingsley was just joking earlier. You didn't take her seriously, did you?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Of course not."

"Rumor has it you only won that lawsuit thanks to your wealthy patron." Monica Simms leaned closer. "Getting pregnant by one man while pinning it on the Ashfords, then finding a fall guy—quite the strategy."

Before she finished, an authoritative male voice interrupted:

"Miss Simms, Horizon Media doesn't operate on nepotism!"

The group startled, Evelyn included.

Hugo Lee had appeared behind them unnoticed.

"Miss Sinclair earned her position through merit." His cold gaze swept over the women. "Perhaps you privileged ladies should stop projecting your pettiness onto others."

The socialites fell silent.

Only Evelyn remained unruffled.

Hugo Lee defending her?

Preposterous.

"Miss Sinclair," he pivoted smoothly, "a word?"

"Oh?" Her lips curved knowingly.

"About your new project." Hugo lowered his voice. "I'm leaving on business—today's our only chance to discuss it."
###Chapter 317: Unwanted Spotlight

"Evelyn, give Melissa a way out." Hugo Lee pulled her aside and cut straight to the chase.

"Impossible." Her reply was absolute.

His jaw tightened. "Must you be so heartless?"

Melissa Lee's case had hit a deadlock, and Hugo was already drowning in the scandal of the fake heir at the company. He just wanted to resolve one crisis at a time—even if it meant swallowing his pride before Evelyn.

How could his precious daughter face prison?

"What more do you want?" He blocked her path. "I publicly sided with you, Evelyn. Don’t push this too far!"

"Mr. Lee," she shook off his grip, "your daughter should’ve heeded that advice. Had she left any room for mercy, she wouldn’t be in this position."

Did he seriously expect her to beg Winston to drop the charges? Delusional.

If Melissa had succeeded, Evelyn and Winston—along with their unborn child—would be dead. Three lives. And he had the audacity to make demands?

"Evelyn, don’t mistake my patience for weakness." His eyes turned vicious.

She smiled coldly. "You and your daughter share the same trait—imagining threats that don’t exist, then striking first."

"You—"

"Goodbye." She turned to leave.

"You’ll regret this!" His roar followed her.

Evelyn didn’t look back.

A sudden commotion erupted in the ballroom.

"Lord Alex is here!" someone gasped.

She froze. Alexander hadn’t mentioned attending. As she debated slipping away, Madam Zade hurried over.

"Miss Sinclair, Lord Alex specifically asked for you."

"Me?" She frowned. He could visit her anytime at home. Why here?

Madam Zade lowered her voice. "That foolish boy Roman confessed everything—how you helped him. Lord Alex didn’t look pleased. Be careful."

Evelyn glanced up and met Alexander’s gaze.

Mockery glinted in his eyes, the chill around him making onlookers tense.

"Lord Alex," Madam Zade introduced nervously, "this is—"

"We’ve met." His voice was ice.

Evelyn stood poised in her amethyst gown, luminous under the lights. Her serene composure made him seem like the intruder—a brute disturbing a goddess.

His gaze raked over her.

From her dark hair to the pearl-embellished hem, down to her delicate ankles. Too radiant.

The Evelyn in his memory always wore white—pure, untouchable. Only after she left did he realize she could blaze like this.

Now, everyone saw what was once his alone.

He wanted to hide her away.

"Miss Sinclair. Long time no see." He broke the silence first.

She nearly laughed. They’d shared dinner two nights ago.

"An eternity," she replied flatly.

"I hear your career thrives," he drawled, "and you’ve become the Sullivan family’s savior? Their heir owes his homecoming to you."

The Sullivans paled.

Evelyn recognized his anger. That day, feverish and bedridden, he’d watched her rush off for Roman’s call.
###Chapter 318: Insatiable Greed

Evelyn Sinclair understood the implication but refused to acknowledge it.

She met Alexander Kingsley's gaze, her voice perfectly composed.

"Lord Alex may be overthinking. I went there because lives were at stake, not some trivial ailment."

The air turned glacial.

Every guest sensed the sudden drop in temperature around Alexander.

People exchanged uneasy glances. Everyone knew about the bad blood between Evelyn and Alexander, but no one expected her to challenge him so boldly.

This was Kingsbury's infamous "Living Hades"!

"Alexander, when did you arrive?" Eleanor Kingsley and Madeline Kingsley approached.

Eleanor barely suppressed a smirk while Madeline turned away with a disdainful huff.

"You should've informed us," Eleanor deliberately stepped between them. "People might think you've established another family elsewhere."

Society ladies nearby tittered behind their hands, though their eyes remained glued to Alexander.

The elusive Kingsley heir rarely made public appearances.

Back when Isabella Winslow guarded him like a dragon, opportunities were scarce. Now...

"Miss Sinclair," Eleanor suddenly addressed Evelyn. "We were having such a delightful conversation earlier. Shall we continue?"

The room fell silent.

Evelyn felt dozens of scorching stares burning into her.

"My apologies," she smiled. "I have prior arrangements with Mr. Song regarding work matters."

The mentioned Roman Young stiffened, stammering, "Y-yes... project discussions..."

Alexander's glare made his knees buckle.

"Another time then." Eleanor graciously yielded.

Evelyn quickly guided the trembling Roman away.

"Evelyn, about Lord Alex—" Roman's voice shook.

"Don't worry," she assured the sweating young man. "You'll be fine."

After dismissing Roman, Evelyn turned—only to collide with a clumsy waiter.

Red wine splashed across her arm.

"Terribly sorry!" The flustered waiter thrust napkins at her.

Evelyn's fingers twitched as she accepted them—

Something was hidden inside.

......

Back in the ballroom, Alexander swirled his wine glass while scanning the crowd.

Roman had returned, but Evelyn and Julian Ashford were nowhere in sight.

"Excuse me." He set down his glass.

"Alexander!" Madeline's shrill call came from her circle of giggling socialites.

He walked away without a backward glance.

Madeline forced a laugh. "He's always been like this outside..."

"Lord Alex must be very filial at home." Yaxin Cui cozied up to Madeline.

This girl grew more pleasing by the minute—a hundred times better than that Sinclair wretch!

During a bathroom break, Madeline couldn't resist asking, "Are you seeing anyone, dear?"

"My family introduced me to Horizon Media's Julian Ashford..." Yaxin demurely lowered her eyes.

Madeline scoffed. "Far beneath our Alexander."

A calculating gleam flashed in Yaxin's eyes.

If she could secure the Kingsley heir...

"Careful on the steps, Grandma." She sweetly supported Madeline.

Suddenly, Evelyn's sharp voice came from an adjacent room: "Unhand me! Do you know who you're dealing with?"

Madeline and Yaxin exchanged glances before quietly pushing the ajar door open—

The sight inside made their pupils contract violently.
###Chapter 319: Witnessing the Betrayal

At the end of the club corridor, Evelyn Sinclair was cornered by a strange man.

"Long time no see. You've grown even more beautiful." The man reached to touch her face, but she slapped his hand away. "Playing hard to get now? You weren't so high and mighty when you hired me as your sperm donor."

"Sperm donor?" Evelyn sneered. "You've got the wrong person."

He grabbed her wrist. "Stop pretending. Aren't you carrying my child right now?"

...

Sperm donor!

Hidden around the corner, Madeline Kingsley trembled violently. Her vision darkened as she collapsed to the floor.

...

In the garden, Alexander Kingsley and Julian Ashford faced off.

"Move." Alexander's gaze was icy.

Julian blocked his path. "We need to talk."

Alexander scoffed. "What scheme are you plotting now?"

"It's about Evelyn." Julian took a deep breath. "She's pregnant."

Alexander's pupils contracted.

"But it's not yours." Julian met his eyes squarely. "I hope you can—"

"Help! Someone call for help!" A scream interrupted him.

Both men turned to see chaos erupting on the club's second floor.

Alexander's phone rang.

"Alex! Come quick! It's your grandmother!" Eleanor Kingsley's voice shook.

...

Madeline lay pale on the floor.

"The ambulance is coming." Roman Young knelt beside her, checking her pulse.

The crowd parted as Alexander strode forward.

"What happened?"

"I-I came to see Madeline," Melissa Lee said timidly. "Then I found her collapsed here..."

Madeline's eyes flew open. She clutched Alexander's sleeve.

"Divorce her! Now!" she shrieked. "That slut Evelyn is carrying a bastard child!"

Gasps filled the room.

"Mother!" Eleanor tried to cover her mouth. "You're not thinking clearly!"

"I saw it with my own eyes!" Madeline pointed at the closed door. "She's in there with some man!"

Alexander's expression darkened.

"Take Grandmother to the hospital."

"No!" Madeline struggled. "Open that door! Let everyone see that whore's true colors!"

Melissa murmured, "We should at least find out what's going on..."

At Alexander's signal, bodyguards lifted Madeline.

"Let me go!" she screamed. "Alexander! How long will you let her deceive you?"

The door swung open.

Evelyn stood there, deathly pale.

Behind her, a strange man was buttoning his shirt.
###Chapter 320: Dog Eat Dog

"Exactly," murmurs rippled through the crowd. "We should see what's going on..."

"Madeline Kingsley fainted. This can't be dropped."

"At least knock and ask..."

Alexander Kingsley's icy gaze swept over the speakers.

The whispers died instantly.

"Alex, I'm seeing this through today!" Madeline shoved away her supporters. "I don't care if this old body breaks!"

"Grandmother, Evelyn Sinclair has nothing to do with me." Alexander's voice was low. "Are you certain about interfering in private matters?"

The matriarch glared at her grandson.

His words denied involvement, yet he shielded that woman at every turn!

"She dared knock me unconscious—this isn't over!" Madeline ground her teeth. "If that door stays shut, I'll die right here!"

"Mother—" Eleanor Kingsley tried to intervene.

"Silence!" Madeline turned back to Alexander. "Will you step aside or not?"

Mrs. Ashford tightened her grip on the keycard.

One nod from Alexander, and everyone would see Evelyn's true colors.

Alexander suddenly smirked. "If things aren't as you claim, how will you compensate?"

"What—what could I possibly owe?"

"Surrender all your Kingsley Group shares." Each word fell like a hammer.

The crowd gasped collectively.

Such stakes were unimaginable!

"Fine!" Madeline slammed her cane down. "If I'm wrong, I'll leave with nothing but the clothes on my back!"

The air froze.

All eyes locked onto Alexander.

After two heartbeats of silence—

"Open it."

The crowd surged forward instantly.

Mrs. Ashford thrust the keycard at a staff member, who swiped it hastily.

Beep. The door unlocked.

Madeline and Melissa Lee charged in first.

A woman's scream pierced the air.

Eleanor began relaxing—then stiffened abruptly.

Madeline trembled as she yanked at the bedcovers. "Who are you? Show yourself!"

Melissa stood rooted, mouth agape.

Mrs. Ashford impatiently tore the sheets away—

"Miss Sinclair certainly has skills—" Her voice cut off.

Curled on the bed lay none other than Victoria Chase!

"Miss Chase?" Eleanor feigned surprise. "Why are you here?"

Madeline looked thunderstruck. "Victoria? Weren't you with me earlier?"

"Tsk. A man's shirt..." Eleanor nudged the discarded clothing, then eyed the open window. "Did he jump out?"

Onlookers immediately spotted fabric snagged on tree branches outside.

"I—I don't know..." Victoria clutched the sheets, deathly pale.

Madeline's mind went blank.

This should've been Evelyn. How did it become Victoria?

"Grandmother, do recall our wager." Alexander's voice stabbed like an icicle.

Madeline shuddered, meeting her grandson's bottomless gaze.

Understanding dawned. Darkness swallowed her vision as she collapsed in truth.

Hospital corridor.

"Aunt Ashford, I was framed!" Victoria grabbed Mrs. Ashford's wrist.

The older woman smiled, withdrawing her hand. "Shall I notify your family to collect you?"

Victoria's blood turned to ice.

Her aristocratic dream had shattered.

One question burned: Where was Evelyn Sinclair?

As the crowd dispersed, only Melissa remained.

At a deserted corner, Victoria suddenly shoved open a conference room door.

"Inside." Her voice dripped venom.

Melissa followed reluctantly.

Lights flickered on.

"What's your game?" Victoria hissed.

"Excuse me?" Melissa played dumb.

"Did you set me up?" Victoria advanced step by step. "Plotting to take my place?"

"Are you insane?" Melissa raised her voice. "You're the one who told me to gather everyone!"

Their glares clashed like drawn swords.

The room reeked of gunpowder.
###Chapter 321: The Mastermind

"Are you blind or just stupid?" Chloe Cui yanked Monica Mo's collar. "You came running just because I told you to? Didn't even check if I was here?"

Her lips curled into a sneer as her nails dug into Monica's flesh. "Stop pretending we're sisters. If something really happened to me, you'd have a clear path to the Yearwoods, wouldn't you?"

"You're insane!" Monica shoved her away. "Who cares about the Yearwoods? You're the one fawning over Madam Kingsley, desperate to marry into the Kingsley family. You blocked me every time I tried to approach her, and now you're turning this around on me?"

"You?" Chloe scoffed, tilting her chin up. "As if the Kingsleys would ever look twice at trash like you."

"You're delusional!" Monica exploded. "You're the one who asked me to play along with your act! We agreed I'd call for help when I saw Madam Kingsley unconscious. How was I supposed to know you'd disappear?"

"Weren't you there when Hugo Lee explained the plan?" Chloe's voice rose sharply. "Didn't he say you had to wait until you saw me with Madam Kingsley?"

"That's bullshit!" Monica trembled with rage. "You only told me you'd drug Madam Kingsley and fake your own collapse. How was I supposed to know you'd change the plan last minute?"

"Admit it!" Chloe lunged at her. "You conspired with Evelyn Sinclair! Isn't that man Cheng your old flame?"

Slap!

A stinging blow landed across Chloe's face.

"You dare hit me?" Chloe screeched, grabbing Monica's hair.

They crashed to the floor in a violent tangle. Nails clawed bloody streaks across skin. Expensive gowns tore at the seams.

Click.

A soft mechanical sound froze them mid-fight.

Whoosh.

The entire wall slid apart.

The banquet hall fell deathly silent. The Kingsleys. The Yearwoods. The Sullivans. Every elite family watched with icy disdain.

Eleanor Kingsley set down her teacup with deliberate calm. "So this is how it is."

Her gaze swept over the two disheveled women before settling on Hugo Lee, who was sweating profusely. "You thought you could scheme against the Kingsleys?"

Hugo's knees buckled. "This is a misunderstanding—"

"Misunderstanding?" Alexander Kingsley's voice cut through like frozen steel. "Who is Cheng?"

Chloe and Monica collapsed in unison.

"Miss Sinclair was framed—"
"We never meant to harm Madam Kingsley—"

Their panicked excuses dissolved into incoherent babble, interrupted by a soft chuckle.

"Oh? Who framed me?" Evelyn Sinclair emerged from the shadows, arm-in-arm with an elegant older woman.

Madam Zade patted Evelyn's hand. "I was the one who took Evelyn away. We spoke for hours."

Gasps rippled through the room.

Hugo's face turned ashen. Chloe and Monica clung to each other, shaking.

Alexander rose from his seat, his black suit making him look like an avenging deity. "Excellent."
###Chapter 322: His Evelyn Has Returned

"What a disgraceful scene at what should have been a joyous celebration." Madam Zade's knuckles turned white as she gripped her wine glass.

Her icy gaze swept over the pale faces of Chloe Cui and Monica Mo. "Miss Sinclair is an honored guest of the Sullivan family. Who gave you the audacity to play such dirty tricks at our banquet?"

Under normal circumstances, Madam Zade might have hesitated to make a public scene.

But tonight was different.

The Kingsleys had made their stance clear.

Whatever history existed between Evelyn Sinclair and Alexander Kingsley, the Kingsley family was determined to protect her now.

"Mrs. Kingsley, we truly—" Chloe's voice trembled.

"Save your explanations." Eleanor Kingsley rose gracefully, extending her hand toward Alexander.

His gaze lingered on Evelyn's face for a fleeting moment before he escorted his mother from the banquet hall.

With the Kingsleys' departure, the event dissolved into chaos.

Hugo Lee attempted to slip away in the crowd but found his path blocked by dark-suited men in the parking garage.

"Mr. Lee, a word."

Cold sweat drenched his back.

Evelyn returned to her apartment and began packing in silence.

A quick survey revealed few belongings worth taking—just work equipment and essentials.

Her fingertips brushed the dusty surface of her desk.

This small apartment held too many memories.

She'd thought she could stay a little longer...

As she wheeled her suitcase toward the door, she collided with a pair of stormy eyes.

"Where are you going?" Julian Ashford's voice tightened at the sight of her luggage.

They hadn't faced each other like this in months.

Evelyn blinked, then offered a faint smile. "Thank you for everything, Julian."

"For what?" His brow furrowed.

"For the apartment. For all your help." Her words floated like feathers.

A sharp pain lanced through Julian's chest.

"Was it Alexander who came to your rescue tonight?" His voice turned hoarse. "You hid nearby while I spoke with him?"

Evelyn didn't deny it.

She'd discovered he rented this place—now even this last connection would be severed.

Julian laughed suddenly, the sound edged with bitterness. "After how you left the Kingsleys, you're rushing back to him so soon?"

He expected anger or shame.

Instead, Evelyn lifted tear-bright eyes. "That's enough, Julian."

He froze as if struck by lightning.

"You—" His voice shook.

"I've received your guilt and atonement." Her throat constricted. "It's time to move on. Both of us."

Her hand rested lightly on her abdomen. "I've found someone to protect for a lifetime. I hope you can too..."

Julian stood paralyzed as she walked past him, suitcase wheels clicking against the floor.

Only when the sound faded did he snap back to reality.

She remembered...

Everything.

The obsessions he'd clung to suddenly slipped through his fingers.

"His name is Guo Cheng. Just happens to share my build." Alexander tossed surveillance photos onto the coffee table.

Madeline Kingsley jabbed at an image. "That's him! Evelyn was with—"

"Watch this." Alexander signaled his assistant to play a video.

The footage showed Madeline and Chloe lurking outside a door. Suddenly, Chloe pressed a handkerchief to the older woman's neck—

Madeline collapsed. Chloe dropped beside her...

"What—" The matriarch's eyes bulged.

"They lured Evelyn there, had that man say suggestive things." Eleanor's lips thinned. "Mother, you were their pawn!"

"But Evelyn's baby—"

"DNA doesn't lie."

A clear voice rang from the doorway.

"Evelyn!" Eleanor sprang up in delight.

Evelyn stood on the steps, backlit by courtyard lights like scattered stars.

Alexander's breath caught at the suitcase in her hand.

Her face held a long-absent ease—a weary bird returning to its nest.

In that moment, he knew with absolute certainty—

His Evelyn had returned.
