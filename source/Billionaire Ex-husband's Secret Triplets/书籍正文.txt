###Chapter 1

Pain.

That was the first thing Evelyn Vanderbilt registered as consciousness slowly returned. A sharp, throbbing ache pulsed through her skull, radiating down her spine. Her entire body felt heavy, bruised—as if she'd been tossed into a storm and battered by its fury.

She groaned, struggling to open her eyes.

Darkness.

Then—warmth. A solid weight pressed against her, the scent of expensive cologne—something woody and rich—filling the air. A man’s breath ghosted over her bare shoulder, his lips tracing the curve of her neck.

Her stomach twisted.

Dawn light seeped through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the rumpled sheets. Evelyn jolted upright, heart hammering.

She was naked.

And so was the stranger beside her, his back turned, his breathing deep and even.

Memories crashed into her—fragmented, hazy.

Her birthday.

Vivian’s smug smile.

A glass of sangria, handed to her with false sweetness.

Then—nothing.

Until now.

Her fingers dug into the sheets. She had been drugged.

Evelyn swallowed hard, forcing herself to move. She dressed quickly, hands trembling, refusing to look back at the bed. She needed to get home. Needed answers.

The Vanderbilt mansion loomed before her, its grandeur mocking her disheveled state.

Inside, her father, Richard Vanderbilt, sat rigid on the sofa, his expression thunderous.

"Where were you last night?" His voice was dangerously calm.

Evelyn’s throat tightened. "I—I stayed at a friend’s."

Slam.

A photograph hit the coffee table.

Evelyn’s blood turned to ice.

There she was—unconscious, being half-carried into a hotel room by a man she didn’t recognize.

Vivian descended the stairs, heels clicking, her face the picture of concern. "Dad, don’t be too hard on her." She turned to Evelyn, lips curving in a saccharine smile. "Zoe, really, couldn’t you at least be discreet? Even if you’re in love, you should know better than to—"

Evelyn’s nails bit into her palms. "I was unconscious. Vivian drugged me."

Richard shot to his feet. "Enough! Your sister would never do such a thing!"

Sister.

The word was a knife.

Her mother had barely been gone a year before Richard remarried—to Laura Scott. And Vivian, his precious secret daughter, had slithered into their lives like a viper.

Now, she’d struck.

"I was going to give you Viana Jewelry," Richard snarled. "But you’ve disgraced this family. Get out."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "You’re… kicking me out?"

A porcelain mug shattered at her feet. "Now!"

Vivian followed her outside, her mask slipping. "I did spike your drink," she purred. "How does it feel? Knowing some stranger had you while you were helpless?"

Evelyn’s voice was steel. "You and Laura got everything. What more do you want?"

"Your place." Vivian’s eyes gleamed. "Why should you be the Vanderbilt heiress while I’m the bastard?" She waved her phone. "Leave, or this video goes public. Ruin your life forever."

Evelyn turned away, jaw clenched.

Just as she reached her car, a Rolls-Royce pulled up.

A man stepped out—tall, commanding, his presence like a storm.

Nathan Goldmann.

CEO of Blackgold Group. The most powerful man in Bassburgh.

His gaze locked onto Vivian. "Are you Vivian Vanderbilt?"

Vivian’s breath caught. "Y-yes."

"Were you the woman in Empyrean Hotel, Room 6228?"

Evelyn froze.

That was her room.

Vivian’s lips curved. "Yes. That was me."

Nathan’s expression darkened.

And Evelyn realized—

Vivian had just made the biggest mistake of her life.
###Chapter 2
At the bustling airport of Cornelia's royal capital...

A striking woman emerged from the crowd, effortlessly commanding attention. But it wasn't just her poised elegance that turned heads—it was the three breathtaking children by her side.

Evelyn Vanderbilt carried her youngest, Daisy, whose golden curls bounced with each step, making her resemble a porcelain doll. Behind them, her twin boys, Caleb and Liam, mirrored each other with their striking amber eyes and flawless complexions.

A woman leaning against a sleek Mercedes gasped as she removed her sunglasses. "Holy hell, Zoe! You had three in one go?" Sophia Hill's jaw dropped. Triplets were rare enough, but these children looked like they'd stepped out of a Renaissance painting. She couldn't help but wonder—what divine being had Evelyn seduced to produce such ethereal offspring?

Evelyn set Daisy down and ruffled their hair. "Meet your godmother, Sophia."

Sophia had been Evelyn's lifeline after the Vanderbilts exiled her. When Evelyn discovered her pregnancy abroad, it was Sophia who convinced her to keep the babies. The rebellious heiress had even pawned a $6 million antique to fund their new life.

"Nice to meet you, Godmother!" The trio chirped in unison, though their bows were hilariously uncoordinated.

Sophia clutched her chest dramatically. "You little heartbreakers!"

Caleb nudged Liam. "Godmother's kinda weird, huh?"

Evelyn flicked both their foreheads. "What was that?"

Daisy, ever the traitor, piped up: "They said Godmother looks silly!"

Sophia burst out laughing as she drove them toward the city. Through the rearview mirror, she watched the children doze off in a puppy pile. "Seriously, Zoe—why come back now?"

Evelyn twirled a lock of hair around her finger. "Viana Jewelry offered me $7 million to design for them."

Sophia nearly swerved. "Your family's company? With Vivian running it?" She snorted. "When that witch finds out you're Zara—the designer who crafted Stoslo's royal crown—she'll have a meltdown."

Zara's fusion of Victorian craftsmanship with modern aesthetics had revolutionized jewelry. Luxe had offered $90 million for her talents—yet Evelyn had countered with $150 million.

"And the Vanderbilts actually paid?" Sophia whistled.

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Every penny. Now I'm taking back what's mine."

As they pulled up to Viana's headquarters, Evelyn kissed her children goodbye. The moment she left, the "angelic" trio pounced on Sophia.

"Tell us everything about Mommy and the Vanderbilts!" Liam demanded.

"We need to know who hurt her," Caleb added solemnly.

Daisy nodded fiercely. "So we can make them super sorry."

Sophia shuddered. These weren't kids—they were tiny avengers.

Inside Viana, Evelyn approached the receptionist. "I'm here to see Vivian Vanderbilt."

The woman barely glanced up. "Appointment?"

"No. She contacted me."

The receptionist scoffed. "Director Vanderbilt doesn't see randoms."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Is rudeness part of Viana's training now?"

A shrill laugh cut through the lobby. "Well, well. The exiled princess returns."

Vivian sauntered over, her designer heels clicking like knives. Six years had transformed Evelyn from a timid girl into a woman who radiated quiet danger.

"You invited me, remember?" Evelyn's voice was honey-laced poison.

Vivian's smirk faltered. "To grovel, maybe. Not to insult my company's reputation."

"Reputation?" Evelyn chuckled. "Funny. Under you, Viana's profits dropped 40% last quarter."

Vivian's hand flew out—

CRACK.

The slap echoed through the marble hall.

A deep voice froze everyone mid-breath. "Problem here?"

Nathan Goldmann emerged from the elevator, his icy gaze sweeping the scene.

Vivian instantly transformed into a wounded dove. "Nathan, she cursed Viana to ruin!"

Evelyn touched her stinging cheek, her eyes glinting with something far more dangerous than tears.

The game had just begun.
###Chapter 3

Evelyn spun around and locked eyes with the man. Her breath caught in her throat.

His face was striking—pale skin, sharp features, and piercing amber eyes that held an icy depth. His lips were thin, pressed into a firm line.

He looked uncannily like Caleb and Liam. Even his eyes were the exact same shade.

Evelyn had only discovered she was carrying triplets during labor in Stoslo. Her first two sons bore no resemblance to her, but her youngest, Daisy, had inherited her features—except for the jet-black hair, just like the man standing before her now.

Curiosity burned in Evelyn’s gaze.

Who is he? What’s his connection to Vivian?

Nathan Goldmann studied Evelyn’s face, his brows furrowing slightly. This woman…

Vivian noticed Nathan’s scrutiny and clenched her teeth. No way. He can’t recognize her.

She wouldn’t let that happen.

Wrapping her arms around Nathan’s arm, she put on a pitiful expression. "Nathan, I—I shouldn’t have acted so rashly. But my father poured his soul into Viana Jewelry. I was just trying to protect it."

Nathan’s expression darkened. Ignoring her excuse, he stepped forward. "You said Viana Jewelry would go bankrupt. What makes you think you have the right to say that?"

Evelyn scoffed. Her father poured his soul into it? Please. Richard had done nothing but leech off someone else’s hard work. Vivian was rewriting history.

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting Nathan’s cold gaze head-on. "So what if I did?"

The room collectively held its breath.

How dare she talk back to Nathan Goldmann?

Was she insane?

Nathan’s expression turned stormy. Evelyn crossed her arms, smirking. "What’s it to you? Defending her because you’re her man?"

Perfect match. A pair of entitled brats.

Anyone who fell for Vivian’s act couldn’t be worth much.

"Do you even realize what you’re saying?" Nathan’s voice was like ice.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh, I do. This company headhunted me, and now they’re playing games. Truly stellar professionalism."

Vivian paled. "What—what are you talking about? Viana never approached you!"

Was this bitch delusional?

"Miss Vanderbilt, your memory seems selective. Just last month, you offered $150 million to poach me from Luxe. If Viana has no respect for me, then our collaboration ends here."

The room erupted in shock.

Evelyn was Zara—the world-renowned jewelry designer?

Vivian looked like she’d been slapped. "That’s impossible! You can’t be Zara!"

Nathan’s cold glare silenced her mid-sentence. Her face flushed with humiliation.

Evelyn turned to Nathan. "I assume you’re the one who bankrolled that offer?"

Neither Richard nor Vivian had that kind of money. It had to be him.

Nathan studied her. Something about her felt familiar, but he couldn’t place it.

Vivian panicked. "Nathan, she’s lying! There’s no way she’s Zara!"

Evelyn and Zara—the elusive designer—were the same person? Impossible. She’d lived with Evelyn for years. If her stepsister had talent, she’d have known.

Besides, Zara’s identity was a well-kept secret. Anyone could claim to be her.

"Prove it," Vivian challenged, smirking. "The real Zara has a royal badge from Stoslo. Show us yours."

Let’s see her bluff her way out of this.

If Evelyn couldn’t produce it, she’d be exposed as a fraud—and she’d have just crossed Nathan Goldmann. Good luck surviving that fallout.
###Chapter 4

Everyone knew that Nathan was a VIP who had been personally received by the royal family of Stoslo. He was even close friends with the princess. Naturally, he would recognize the commemorative medal of the royal family. If Evelyn dared to show him anything fake, he would see right through her deception!

Vivian scoffed. "Why would I waste my time showing you something so precious?"

The implication was clear—Evelyn wasn’t worthy.

Vivian trembled with barely contained fury, yet a smirk still played on her lips. "Or are you just too scared to prove it?"

She turned to Nathan, her tone dripping with sweetness. "Look at her, Nathan. She’s a fraud. She knows you’ve seen the real medal before, so she doesn’t dare take it out."

Nathan’s lips curled into a cold smile. "The $150 million offer was my decision. Hiring Zara as our designer was also my call. So, if you can prove you’re really her, I’ll let today’s incident slide."

He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "But if you fail…" His gaze hardened. "You won’t last another day in Bassburgh."

As he neared, a familiar scent of cologne hit Evelyn—Gi.

Her breath caught.

Why does he wear the same cologne as the man from that night six years ago?

Nathan straightened, taking in her pale face. "Since you can’t prove it, leave now. Before I have someone escort you out."

Vivian smirked triumphantly.

Evelyn, you fool. Why come back just to dig your own grave?

Evelyn suddenly lifted her chin, a bright, defiant smile on her lips. "Are you sure about that, Mr. Goldmann?"

Nathan narrowed his eyes, silent.

"And what will you do about the slap I just took from Miss Vanderbilt if I do prove my identity?"

Vivian’s expression twisted. She glanced nervously at Nathan.

Despite being his lover, he had never so much as touched her in all these years. If not for her carefully crafted lies and the reservation under her name from six years ago, he would’ve doubted her long ago.

"Nathan—"

"She’ll apologize," Nathan said coolly.

Evelyn paused, her hand stilling in her bag. She looked up, incredulous. "I get slapped, and all I get is an apology?"

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "What do you want, then?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "We’re raised with manners, taught to return kindness—or in this case, a slap for a slap. Don’t you think that’s fair?"

The room fell silent.

This woman actually dares to bargain with Nathan Goldmann. Could she really be…?

Nathan’s lips pressed into a thin line.

She’s the first person in Bassburgh who dares to speak to me like this.

After a beat, he exhaled sharply. "Don’t push your luck."

"Then find yourself another designer." Evelyn pulled out the medal, holding it up. "Since you’ve seen the royal commemorative medal before, take a good look."

She tucked it back into her bag and strode away without another glance.

Vivian’s nails dug into her palms.

How is this possible? That bitch can’t be—

Zara is the designer Nathan personally poached from Luxe. Without his $150 million offer, I never could’ve matched that price.

And now, it turns out to be Evelyn?!

Did I just humiliate Nathan by attacking her?

"Nathan, I—"

She reached for his arm, but he pulled away, his voice icy. "Clean up your own mess."

Then he walked out without looking back.

Outside, his bodyguard opened the door of the waiting Rolls-Royce. Nathan slid in, his voice sharp as he addressed the man in the passenger seat. "I want everything on the designer Zara on my desk in forty-eight hours."

Seaview Villa

"Ugh, Vivian Vanderbilt is the worst!"

Daisy clutched her doll, leaning in with Caleb and Liam to stare at the computer screen. The woman on the monitor scowled back at them. "She’s so ugly."

Liam turned to his siblings. "She hurt Mommy. We can’t let her get away with it."

Daisy propped her chin on her hand. "But how?"

"We have to keep it from Mommy," Caleb mused, then snapped his fingers. "Didn’t Godmother say Vivian has a sugar daddy? Let’s start with him!"

"What’s his name again?" Daisy frowned.

"Nathan Goldmann!" Caleb typed, and the search results loaded instantly.

All three froze.

The man on the screen… looked just like them.

Liam’s eyes widened. "Mommy never told us about Dad. Could he be—?"

Caleb smirked, mischief glinting in his eyes. "If he is, this just got a whole lot easier."

Liam frowned. "But how do we get close to him?"

Daisy grinned, patting her chest. "Leave it to me! Isn’t ckgold Group looking for a child model for their new line? I’ll get the gig!"

"Sweethearts, I’m home!"

The three quickly closed the tab and rushed out to greet Evelyn.

"Mommy! Your Highness!" They threw themselves at her.

Evelyn laughed, crouching to hug them. "Behave for Godmother?"

"Mommy, would we ever cause trouble?" Caleb blinked innocently.

Daisy nodded. "Godmother even promised us cake!"

Evelyn sighed.

I know my kids. They’re definitely up to something.

Caleb was the schemer, Liam the protective older brother, and Daisy—well, Daisy was the wildcard who dragged them into chaos.

"Mommy, you look upset," Liam said softly. "Did someone hurt you?"

Evelyn hesitated.

That man today… his face, his scent—it all reminded her of that night.

"Mommy, you’re hiding something!"

She forced a smile, standing. "Leave the grown-up stuff to grown-ups. I’ll make dinner."

Just then, her phone rang.

An unknown number.

Her lips twitched.

Vivian Vanderbilt.
###Chapter 5

Evelyn stepped onto the balcony with her phone pressed to her ear. "Changed your mind, Director Goldmann? Or should I say... desperate now?"

Vivian's voice crackled with barely contained fury. "Don't push it, Evelyn. We're offering you a hundred and fifty million—consider it a privilege!"

Evelyn smirked, leaning against the railing. "Privilege? Sounds more like your problem, not mine." She twirled a strand of hair around her finger. "If this isn’t a genuine offer, save your breath."

"Wait!" Vivian’s tone turned icy. "You seem to have forgotten—I still have that video."

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. The mention of the video sent a chill down her spine.

Silence stretched between them until Vivian let out a low laugh. "No witty comeback? Good. If you don’t want your little secret from six years ago splashed across every tabloid in Bassburgh, meet me tomorrow. My office. 9 AM."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Fine. I’ll be there."

She ended the call before Vivian could gloat further.

Behind her, tiny footsteps pattered away. Daisy rushed back inside, whispering to her brothers, "That witch threatened Mommy again!"

Liam cracked his knuckles. "Then we stick to the plan. Tomorrow, while Mommy’s out—we move."

Caleb nodded, fingers flying across his tablet. In seconds, he’d uploaded Daisy and Liam’s profiles to Young Faces, the elite children’s modeling division under Goldmann Enterprises.

Perfect.

If we get selected, we’ll be face-to-face with Nathan Goldmann himself.

Time to find out if he’s really our father.

The next morning, Evelyn strode into Viana Jewelry, her heels clicking against the marble floor. The secretary ushered her into Vivian’s office, where the woman lounged on a velvet sofa, sipping coffee.

Vivian smirked as the door shut behind them. "I wasn’t sure you’d show."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "You’ve got the video. Did I have a choice?"

A flicker of discomfort crossed Vivian’s face.

Not that I ever planned to leak it.

If Nathan found out the truth about that night...

But Evelyn doesn’t know it was him. And I intend to keep it that way.

Vivian stood, smoothing her skirt. "Let’s skip the theatrics. Sign this, and the money’s yours." She slid a contract across the desk.

Evelyn didn’t touch it. "Funny. You need me now."

"Need you?" Vivian scoffed. "Please. The only reason you’re here is because Nathan wants you."

"Ah, so he’s the one footing the bill." Evelyn tilted her head. "Six years, and you’re still clinging to him like a lifeline. Pathetic."

Vivian’s nails dug into her palms. "Sign. The. Contract."

Evelyn stepped closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "After what you did to me? Kneel. Apologize. Then we’ll talk."

Vivian’s hand flew up—but Evelyn caught her wrist mid-swing. "Still hitting first, asking questions never?"

"Listen, you little—"

SMACK.

Evelyn’s palm connected with Vivian’s cheek, the sound echoing through the room.

Vivian staggered, eyes blazing. "You b—"

"Does Miss Zara always conduct business this way?"

A deep voice cut through the tension.

Nathan stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Of course he’d show up now.

Vivian instantly melted into faux distress. "Nathan, don’t blame her! I—I must’ve upset her somehow..."

Nathan ignored her, his gaze locked on Evelyn. "Threatening my employees now?"

Evelyn met his stare. "Self-defense isn’t a threat."

His jaw tightened. "Sign the contract. Or I’ll ensure no designer in Luxe touches you."

She laughed coldly. "You need me. Yet you let your lapdog slap me yesterday. And now I’m the villain?"

Nathan stepped closer, voice low. "Apologize."

"For what? Returning the favor?" Evelyn spread her hands. "Should I also apologize to every scammer who ever robbed me?"

His eyes darkened. "Enough excuses."

Evelyn turned on her heel. "Then we’re done here."

She barely made it two steps before Nathan grabbed her arm, yanking her toward the stairwell.

"Let go!" She twisted, but his grip was iron.

He leaned down, breath hot against her ear. "You will apologize."

Evelyn glared up at him. "Or what?"

His lips curved—a predator’s smile. "Try me."
###Chapter 6

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh, her fiery gaze locking onto Nathan. "Not in this lifetime."

Nathan hadn't anticipated this. The woman wasn’t just audacious—she was downright obstinate. His jaw tightened. "If you refuse, the name Zara will vanish from the fashion and jewelry industry by dawn."

He hadn’t intended to push her this far, but Vivian had saved his life six years ago. Without her, he would’ve been trapped in a deadly scheme that night.

Though he felt no romantic attachment to Vivian, he’d kept her close all these years, indulging her every material whim without question.

Viana Jewelry had been struggling lately, which was why he’d shelled out $150 million to secure Zara’s services on Vivian’s behalf.

He knew Vivian had provoked Evelyn first, and he’d planned to make her apologize in private.

But no woman would lay a hand on Vivian in his presence.

Evelyn’s wrist throbbed where he gripped her, the pain sharp enough to make her wince. Yet she refused to let a single tear fall in front of him. "I did nothing wrong. I won’t apologize."

Nathan’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "The Goldmanns control the business world. With a word, not only will your reputation burn in Zlokova, but Stoslo will forget Zara ever existed. Still feeling stubborn?"

The Goldmanns…

Evelyn’s teeth clenched.

So that’s his leverage.

She wasn’t afraid of being blacklisted—but her children still needed to attend school in Bassburgh. And she would reclaim her mother’s legacy, Viana Jewelry.

For the bigger picture, I’ll swallow this humiliation.

"Let go of me first."

Nathan released her, his piercing gaze unwavering. "Choose wisely."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Fine. An apology it is."

She strode back into the office, stopping in front of Vivian. Her crimson lips parted, the words dripping with icy precision. "My apologies."

Vivian blinked, stunned. She hadn’t expected Evelyn to cave—but Nathan must have intervened.

Suppressing her smug satisfaction, Vivian offered a saccharine smile. "It’s alright. About the contract—"

Evelyn snatched the pen and signed without hesitation, her lips curving in a smirk no one noticed.

Forced back into Viana Jewelry without resistance? Perfect.

Now, I’ll show them what happens when you invite a viper into your home.

She dropped the pen and walked out, leaving silence in her wake.

Nathan approached the desk, scanning the contract before setting it down. Vivian sidled up to him, batting her lashes. "Nathan, thank you."

His voice was flat. "Stay away from her."

Then he was gone, his assistant trailing behind.

Vivian snatched up the contract, triumph gleaming in her eyes. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, you’ll still lose in the end."

Outside, a Maybach idled at the curb. Oliver Lawson, Nathan’s assistant, held the door open.

Nathan slid inside. "The files I requested?"

Oliver handed him a tablet. "Everything’s here, sir."

Nathan scrolled through the documents—until Evelyn Vanderbilt caught his eye.

Her ID address matched the Vanderbilts’ current residence.

His expression darkened.

At the Blackgold Group…

Daisy and Liam stood outside the towering skyscraper, craning their necks to take in the gleaming structure—the crown jewel of Bassburgh’s corporate empire.

Inside, the lobby buzzed with impeccably dressed professionals. Some carried stacks of files, others conversed fluently in foreign languages with clients.

Amid the chaos, two tiny figures drew curious glances.

A receptionist spotted them and crouched down with a warm smile. "Hello, sweethearts! Who are you looking for?"

Daisy pulled a neatly folded paper from her duck-shaped backpack. "We’re here for the Young Faces audition. The man outside said to come in."

The receptionist nearly melted at her cherubic voice. "Did your parents bring you?"

Liam shook his head. "Mommy’s busy. We can handle it."

"Oh, you precious things! Come with me."

"Thank you, pretty lady!" they chorused, bowing in unison.

She led them to the studio, where racks of designer children’s clothes and professional photography equipment filled the space. A line of kids waited their turn, parents hovering anxiously.

A stern woman in a tailored suit—Natalie Daniell, the brand director—scowled at the latest test shots. "This is unacceptable! I need photogenic children, not deer in headlights!"

The receptionist cleared her throat. "Ma’am, these two—"

Natalie whirled around—and froze.

Her eyes widened as they landed on Daisy and Liam.

These children…

They look exactly like Nathan Goldmann.
###Chapter 7

"Madam Natalie, we're here for the audition!" Daisy lifted her head, her sparkling eyes twinkling like tiny constellations.

Natalie inhaled deeply, steadying her pounding heart.

How could such adorable children possibly belong to Nathan Goldmann? Knowing him, there's no way he could have produced such charming little angels.

She crouched down, gently ruffling their hair. "What are your names?"

"I'm Daisy!"

"And I'm Liam."

The two answered in perfect unison.

Natalie was utterly enchanted by their cuteness.

Forget their charm—they're absolutely stunning. If they were in front of a camera…

Snapping out of her daze, she stood and called out to her team. "Everyone, hurry! Get these two little models prepped and styled—now!"

She could already picture the breathtaking results.

Meanwhile, the Maybach pulled up outside Goldmann Tower. The driver signaled the waiting bodyguards to clear a path through the crowd, forming two disciplined lines.

Nathan stepped out, his long strides carrying him swiftly through the lobby.

Across the building, Natalie had just finished shooting a few test shots. Without any edits, she immediately sent two raw photos to Oliver.

Oliver slowed his pace, pulling out his phone. His eyes widened as he zoomed in on the images.

"Mr. Goldmann!" he called, catching up.

Nathan barely glanced at him as he stepped into his private elevator. "What is it?"

Oliver handed over his phone. "You need to see this."

Nathan's gaze darkened as he studied the screen.

He rarely spent more than a minute looking at anything on his phone—but this time, he stared for three full minutes.

"Natalie sent these. The 'Young Faces' brand team found these two child models. They… resemble you."

Upon closer inspection, the boy’s eyes were identical to Nathan’s. Both children shared his striking features—especially the boy.

Nathan’s brow furrowed as he returned the phone. "Where are they now?"

"Still in the studio."

Without hesitation, Nathan pressed the button for the photography floor.

For reasons he couldn’t explain, he needed to see them.

Meanwhile, Caleb sat at his computer, hacking into Goldmann Tower’s surveillance system. He zoomed in on Nathan heading toward the studio and immediately called Liam.

Liam’s smartwatch buzzed. He discreetly stepped aside. "Caleb, what’s the update?"

"Nathan’s coming for you. Get Daisy to approach him—and don’t forget to grab his hair!"

"Got it."

Liam whispered the plan to Daisy, who nodded eagerly. "Roger that!"

Caleb smirked at his screen.

No risk, no reward. Once we get Nathan’s DNA, we’ll finally know if he’s our father.

Nathan arrived at the studio, and Natalie greeted him with surprise. "Mr. Goldmann! What brings you here?"

Oliver cut in before Nathan could respond. "Where are the child models?"

Natalie pointed. "Over there."

The two were perched on a chair, curiously examining the camera lens.

Nathan approached them.

"Daisy, Liam," Natalie called. They turned—only to find Nathan standing behind them.

Both tilted their heads up, meeting his gaze. Instinctively, Liam stepped in front of Daisy, his expression protective.

His frown mirrored Nathan’s perfectly.

"Who are you?" Liam demanded, though he already knew the answer.

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "Who are you?"

"Is that any of your business?"

Oliver and Natalie exchanged nervous glances.

This kid has nerves of steel.

Daisy tugged Liam’s sleeve, feigning fear. "Liam, I wanna go home."

Liam patted her head reassuringly. "Don’t worry. I’m here."

A flicker of amusement crossed Nathan’s eyes.

Do I really look that intimidating?

Softening his tone, he said, "I own this company. Where are your parents?"

Oliver and Natalie nearly gasped—Nathan had never spoken so gently before.

Daisy answered shyly, "Mommy’s busy. And we don’t know where Daddy is."

Nathan fell silent—until Daisy suddenly stretched out her arms. "Mr. Handsome, I want a hug!"

The entire room froze.

This child just asked Nathan Goldmann to pick her up?!

Liam pulled her back. "Daisy, Mommy said strangers could be dangerous."

"But he doesn’t look dangerous," Daisy protested.

The next second, Nathan lifted her effortlessly into his arms.

Everyone’s jaws dropped.

Daisy wrapped her tiny arms around his neck, gazing at him with wide, innocent eyes. "Mr. Handsome, your eyes are just like Liam’s!"

Nathan had never held a child before. The sensation was… unexpectedly warm.

This girl… She reminds me of someone.

"What’s your mother’s name?" he asked quietly.
###Chapter 8
"Mommy said we can only tell people her name is Her Royal Highness if anyone asks."

Daisy giggled mischievously.

Liam remained stoic, but a tiny smirk tugged at his lips before he schooled his expression.

'These two are absolute treasures. What kind of mother teaches them these things?'

Nathan's gaze lingered on Liam, the boy who mirrored his features so perfectly.

If Vivian hadn't been the only woman he'd been with, he might have questioned if these children were truly his.

Daisy checked her tiny wristwatch dramatically. "Mr. Handsome, we have to go now. Her Royal Highness will worry if we're late."

Nathan set her down and turned to Oliver. "Take them home."

Oliver blinked, then nodded. "Right away, sir."

"Bye, Mr. Handsome!" Daisy waved enthusiastically, grabbing Liam's hand as they followed Oliver out.

The moment they stepped outside, she triumphantly showed Liam a single strand of hair tucked in her palm.

Tugging Oliver's sleeve, Daisy put on her best pleading face. "Sir, our mommy is sick in the hospital. Can you take us there?"

Oliver softened instantly. 'Such thoughtful kids.'

"Of course. Hop in."

At Seaview Villa

Evelyn arrived home to find Caleb alone at the piano. She glanced around. "Where are Daisy and Liam?"

Caleb didn’t miss a note. "They went to audition as child models. Aunt Sophia went with them."

Evelyn dropped her bag on the sofa, stunned. "Child models?"

"Yeah. They said you work too hard, so they want to help."

She ruffled his hair affectionately. Caleb scowled. "Mom, stop."

"Oh, is the little maestro grumpy?"

"Hmph!" He puffed his cheeks.

Evelyn sighed. "Sweetheart, you don’t need to worry about money. Mommy can take care of all three of you."

Caleb’s fingers stilled on the keys. "But you do work too much. And guess what? I got into the Royal Academy of Music. I’ve saved enough for tuition."

He lifted his chin proudly. "Once I win a scholarship, we’ll send Liam and Daisy to the best schools. You can just... relax."

Tears welled in Evelyn’s eyes. "My little prodigy, already planning for his siblings."

She’d discovered Caleb’s talent late, and prestigious schools had clamored to enroll him. But she’d hesitated—he was so young.

Now, at five, his passion was undeniable. She couldn’t hold him back.

"Mommy, we’re home!" Daisy burst in, Liam trailing behind.

Evelyn swept them into a hug. "Caleb told me about the audition?"

Daisy beamed. "We got picked! Aren’t we awesome?"

Evelyn kissed their cheeks. "The most awesome. Now, who’s hungry?"

No matter how heavy her heart, these three always lightened it.

The moment Evelyn disappeared into the kitchen, the kids huddled.

"Well?" Caleb whispered.

Liam nodded. "Sample’s at the lab. Results in two days."

Daisy grinned. "Piece of cake."

Vanderbilt Manor

"What? Zara is that witch Evelyn?" Laura’s face twisted with rage.

'Not only is she back, but she’s also the legendary designer Zara? The one Nathan hired to save Viana Jewelry?

And Vivian stole her place as the woman from that night! If Evelyn finds out Nathan’s the father...'

Vivian wrung her hands. "Mother, what do I do?"

Laura smirked. "So what if she’s Zara? You have Nathan. She wouldn’t dare make a scene."

Her voice dropped to a hiss. "But you must secure him. Get pregnant. Now."

Vivian flushed. "He hasn’t even touched me in six years!"

Laura rolled her eyes. "Must I spell it out? Seduce him. Men can’t resist temptation."

A slow, calculating smile spread across Vivian’s face. "I understand, Mother."
###Chapter 9

The next morning at Viana Jewelry…

Evelyn sat in her private office, flipping through years of the company’s jewelry designs. She slammed the files onto the desk with a scoff. "Where’s the innovation? From what I can see, they don’t even understand the meaning of ‘design.’ Has Viana Jewelry spent millions just to produce mediocre collections?"

The staff members exchanged uneasy glances. One cleared her throat. "Miss Zara, Director Vanderbilt insisted all new designs must adhere to Viana’s original concept."

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, lips curling into a smirk. "And what exactly is this ‘original concept’?"

She snatched up a catalog and waved it dismissively. "These pieces wouldn’t even turn heads at a flea market. Director Vanderbilt must be so proud—firing the entire elite design team and then peddling knockoffs when Viana couldn’t produce anything worthwhile. Even failure should have standards."

The clerk stiffened, lips pressed tight.

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Take me to the raw materials warehouse."

"Yes, Miss Zara."

As they headed toward the elevators, Evelyn froze mid-step.

Nathan Goldmann stood there, his sharp gaze locking onto hers.

She ignored him, brushing past—until his voice cut through the silence. "No greeting?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw. Right. The man who’d casually dropped $150 million.

She forced a smile. "Lovely to see you, Mr. Goldmann."

His brow arched. "Where are you off to, Miss Vanderbilt?"

Her pulse spiked. He knows my real name?

Nathan stepped closer. "Well?"

This man has too much free time.

She tilted her head. "Do I need your permission to visit the warehouse?"

Vivian’s lover sure loves control.

"Perfect," he said smoothly. "I’d like to see what you uncover."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll.

The warehouse was a cavernous space stacked with uncut gemstones and raw ores. The clerk flicked on the lights, illuminating shelves of rough diamonds and cutting equipment.

Evelyn snatched a stone, examining it under the light before striding to the cutting machine.

The clerk gasped. "Miss Zara, what are you—?"

The machine whirred. The diamond split cleanly—revealing a dull, grainy interior.

Evelyn held it up, lips thinning. "Viana’s now dealing in fakes?"

The clerk paled. "Director Chester oversees the warehouse."

"Get him here. Now."

Nathan picked up the sliced stone, dragging it across his signet ring. A visible scratch marred the surface.

Evelyn smirked. "Your girlfriend’s company is selling counterfeits. Aren’t you going to intervene?"

He met her gaze, unreadable. "This was also your mother’s company."

Her smile faltered.

"Making a scene won’t help," he said coolly. "Handle it quietly."

Quietly?

Her nails dug into her palms. If Vivian authorized this… Genuine diamonds cost a fortune. Fakes? Pennies.

"If she’s involved—"

"She knows nothing about gems," Nathan cut in. "Don’t jump to conclusions."

Evelyn almost laughed. He sounds just like Liam making excuses—

Wait. Why am I thinking of him?

The clerk rushed in with Director Chester, whose confidence evaporated at the sight of Nathan.

"Mr. Goldmann! Wh-what brings you here?"

Nathan held up the fake diamond. "Explain."

Chester’s forehead gleamed with sweat.

Damn it. Vivian ordered these. If this gets out…

But she’s Goldmann’s lover. I’ll be the scapegoat!

"I—It wasn’t me! The previous director, Xavier Zaleski, handled this batch!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Xavier worked here for fifteen years. If he’d sold fakes, he’d have been fired instantly."

Chester blanched. How does she know that?

"Someone’s lying," Evelyn murmured, stepping closer. "Are you taking the fall, Chester?"

Nathan watched her, silent.

Then—

The door swung open.

Vivian stood there, eyes wide.
###Chapter 10

Vivian had heard the rumors—Evelyn and Natalie had gone to the raw material warehouse, and Director Chester had been summoned. Panic surged through her, and she rushed over, terrified that her secrets might be exposed.

She forced a calm expression, feigning ignorance. "What's going on? Evelyn, why are you here?"

Damn it. This witch came back just to ruin everything, didn’t she? She even dug into the warehouse!

I did authorize that batch of adulterated rough diamonds to cut costs, but I never expected her to uncover it the moment she returned!

Evelyn’s gaze was icy. "Care to explain these fake ores?"

Vivian clenched her fists but kept her voice steady. "I—I don’t know anything about gemstones. The procurement goes through me, but I assumed they were the same quality as before."

Her ignorance had always been her shield.

Natalie smirked. "How generous of Father to hand the company to someone who can’t even tell real from fake. Does he want Viana Jewelry to collapse?"

"I swear, I had no idea!" Vivian’s desperation leaked into her voice as she turned to Nathan. "Nathan, you have to believe me."

Evelyn, you conniving little—I’ll make sure you regret this.

Nathan wasn’t entirely convinced, but Vivian had been by his side for years. She might not know jewelry, but she had always been eager to learn. She didn’t seem like a liar.

His cold stare shifted to Director Chester. "You’re fired."

Chester paled but didn’t argue. He knew better than to cross Nathan.

Vivian bit her lip in relief. At least Nathan still trusted her.

Nathan turned to Evelyn. "From now on, you’re in charge of raw material procurement."

Then he walked away without another word.

As Evelyn headed back to her office, Vivian caught up and grabbed her arm. "You did this on purpose, didn’t you?"

Evelyn raised a brow, amused. "Did what on purpose?"

"You—You led Nathan to the warehouse! Did you think he’d believe you over me?" Vivian’s voice dripped with venom. "You saw it yourself. He trusts me. Stop wasting your time."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Oh, so you think I orchestrated this to turn him against you? That I care that much about your little romance?"

She scoffed. "He followed me on his own. Blame him, not me."

"I don’t believe a word you say."

"Then why bother confronting me?" Evelyn rolled her eyes. "And don’t think this is over. If it weren’t for my mother founding Viana, I’d have exposed you already."

Nathan’s influence was vast, but Evelyn wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

As she turned to leave, Vivian grabbed her again. "Don’t think you can do whatever you want just because you’re back. That video of yours—"

Evelyn had had enough. In one swift motion, she snatched Vivian’s phone.

"Give it back!" Vivian lunged, but Evelyn dodged.

Evelyn smirked at Vivian’s panic. "You love holding that video over my head, don’t you?"

She walked to the corridor window, held the phone over the ledge—and let go.

Vivian watched in horror as her phone plummeted nineteen floors, shattering on impact.

"You—!"

"Now how will you threaten me?" Evelyn didn’t even glance back as she strode away.

Vivian trembled with rage—but also relief.

Good. Now Nathan will never find out the truth about that night.

I can’t wait any longer. Tonight, I’ll make sure Nathan finally sees me as his woman.

Dusk fell.

In the Goldmann mansion’s study—

"Sir, I’ve confirmed it," Oliver’s voice came through the phone. "Evelyn Vanderbilt is Richard’s daughter with his late wife. She’s the eldest Vanderbilt heir. Her mother founded Viana Jewelry, but after her death, Richard took full control. The reason she left six years ago is still unclear."

Nathan flipped through the documents in his hands, his expression darkening.

Is she targeting Vivian because she resents losing the company? But if she’s a Vanderbilt, why didn’t Vivian recognize her?

It was late. Nathan set the files aside and returned to his room—only to find someone in his bed.

The lights flicked on, revealing Vivian in sheer lingerie, sitting up with a coy smile.

His gaze turned glacial. "What are you doing here?"

She was allowed in the mansion—but never his bedroom.

Vivian had hoped her bold move would entice him, but his reaction was pure disdain.

She bit her lip. "Nathan… since that night six years ago, you’ve kept me at arm’s length. Did I do something wrong?"

Her voice was soft, pleading—the perfect picture of vulnerability.

He’s a man. He can’t resist this.

When he didn’t respond, she slid off the bed and wrapped her arms around his neck, tilting her face up—

But the moment her lips neared his, Evelyn’s sharp, defiant eyes flashed in his mind.

He shoved Vivian away, disgust clear in his eyes.

"Nathan!" She stumbled back, hurt and confused. "Do you… hate me?"

Why? Why could he take Evelyn that night but push me away now?

"What happened six years ago was a mistake," he said coldly. "I let you stay by my side. I’ll compensate you however you want. But this won’t happen again."

He turned to leave—then paused. "Evelyn is a Vanderbilt, isn’t she?"

Vivian stiffened.

Why is he bringing her up? Does he know?

"She’s… my sister."

"Then why didn’t you recognize her at the company? Why did you slap her?"

Nathan had assumed Evelyn provoked her. But after digging into her past, he’d learned the truth—Viana Jewelry was her mother’s legacy, and Richard had stolen it.

Vivian’s nails dug into her palms, but her face remained innocent. "We’ve had… conflicts. She resented my mother and me from the moment we joined the Vanderbilts."

Her eyes welled with tears. "She’s the one who drugged me that night six years ago. Father was furious and exiled her because of it."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

She was drugged too? Did Evelyn really do that?

Given Evelyn’s arrogance, it wasn’t impossible.

But the thought unsettled him.

"Get some rest," he said curtly and left.

The moment the door closed, Vivian’s face twisted with hatred.

Evelyn. Evelyn. She’s a threat I can’t ignore.

I won’t let her stay at Viana. I’ll destroy her before she destroys me.
###Chapter 11

The following morning...

Daisy and Liam's photoshoot for the 'Young Faces' brand exploded across social media, flooding Instagram and Twitter within hours. The adorable duo even trended at number three on the hot search charts, their natural charm captivating the internet.

#PureJoy: These photos are absolutely stunning!

#BlessedByGenes: OMG, their faces—did angels personally sculpt them? I'm green with envy!

#ParentGoals: I need to see what their parents look like.

#LuxuryInMiniature: These are just kids' clothes, but these two make them look like high fashion. Is it their aura or what?

The comment sections were ablaze, with everyone obsessing over the children's striking features.

Nathan Goldmann sat in his office at Goldmann Enterprises when the trending topic caught his eye.

The children in the photos didn't just look comfortable in front of the camera—they owned it, moving with effortless chemistry as if born to be stars.

He couldn't explain why he was so drawn to them.

Just then, Oliver Lawson knocked and entered. "Sir, the sales for 'Young Faces' have skyrocketed. Hiring those two was clearly the right move."

Nathan nodded but kept his gaze fixed on the screen.

Oliver hesitated before adding, "Also, Royal Crown Entertainment reached out. They want to sign the kids."

Royal Crown was the most prestigious talent agency in Bassburgh, the only entertainment subsidiary under the Goldmann Group.

Their roster was filled with A-listers, and any artist they scouted was destined for greatness.

Nathan's lashes lowered slightly. "We need their parents' consent first. They're too young for us to decide for them."

Oliver blinked. "But their paperwork doesn’t list any parental contacts."

Nathan finally looked up. "No parents' information?"

"There’s a phone number, but we can’t verify if it’s real." Oliver flipped through the documents and pulled out the anonymous number the children had provided.

At Seaview Villa...

Evelyn slipped on her shoes and turned to the triplets. "Be good while Mommy’s at work. Call Aunt Sophia if anything happens, okay?"

The three waved enthusiastically. "Bye, Mommy!"

Evelyn blew them a kiss and left.

The moment the door closed, the phone rang.

The triplets exchanged glances before rushing to answer. Only one person could be calling this number—Goldmann Enterprises.

Daisy stretched onto her tiptoes and chirped, "Hello, this is the residence of Her Royal Highness! Who’s speaking?"

A deep, smooth voice replied, "It’s... the man who carried you the other day."

Daisy gasped. "Mr. Handsome! It’s you!"

"Are your parents home?"

"Mommy’s at work. What’s up, Mr. Handsome?" She propped her chin on her hands, swinging her legs.

A faint smile tugged at Nathan’s lips. "Where are you? I’ll come pick you up."

Oliver nearly choked. Since when did the CEO of Goldmann Enterprises play chauffeur?

Nathan hung up after getting the address, grabbed his keys, and stood.

"Sir, should I fetch them instead?"

Nathan tossed him the keys. "You’re driving."

Oliver sighed.

At Seaview Villa #9, the children bounded out excitedly when the car arrived.

Oliver suppressed a grimace. This looks suspiciously like a kidnapping.

Daisy climbed in beside Nathan, her sunflower tutu bouncing. Caleb, disguised as Liam, followed.

"Mister, where are we going?" Caleb asked, feigning innocence.

Nathan studied him. Something felt different about the boy today.

"Have you eaten?"

"Not yet. Are you treating us?" Caleb blinked.

Nathan noticed a mole near Caleb’s eye he hadn’t seen before. He ruffled the boy’s hair. "You weren’t this friendly last time."

Caleb grinned sheepishly. "I thought you were a bad guy."

"My brother gets super scary when he thinks someone’s bad," Daisy added.

Nathan’s lips quirked. "Take us to The Grand Courtyard," he told Oliver.

The restaurant’s entire space had been reserved for them.

Nathan gestured to the menu. "Order whatever you like."

The kids scanned the extravagant options. Daisy pointed at the most expensive dish. "Liam, I want this!"

"Okay, then we’ll get that."

"And this!"

"That too."

"And this! And this!"

Caleb groaned. "Are you a bottomless pit?"

Daisy huffed. Liam would’ve let me order everything.

Nathan sipped his water, inexplicably amused.

The manager approached apologetically. "I’m sorry, but we’re out of Australian lobster today. Every restaurant in the area is."

Daisy’s face fell. Lobster was her favorite—just like her mom.

Nathan set down his glass. "How long to airlift some from the coast?"

Oliver’s jaw dropped. Is he seriously chartering a flight for lobster?

The manager stammered, "T-Two hours, sir."

"Arrange it."

Daisy and Caleb gaped. "Mister, you’re so rich."

Oliver muttered, No kidding.

Nathan smirked. "Ever considered acting?"

Daisy tilted her head. "Is a company scouting us?"

"Yes, but only if you want to."

"I’m in!"

Nathan raised a brow. "Will your parents agree?"

"We don’t have a dad. Just Her Royal Highness. It’s hard for her to support us alone, so we wanna help!"

No father? Nathan’s expression darkened briefly.

"What does your mom do?"

Caleb grinned. "She’s amazing—she’s a designer!"
###Chapter 12

"A designer?"

Nathan's expression darkened slightly as he studied Caleb intently. "What's her name?"

"Our mom isn't famous enough for you to recognize," Caleb deflected smoothly before flashing an innocent smile. "Mister, do you have a girlfriend?"

Nathan's eyes narrowed.

'A girlfriend? There's a woman living in my penthouse, but I've never acknowledged her as such.'

Caleb continued cheerfully, "Want us to introduce you to our mom? She may not be famous, but she's amazing! And gorgeous too - just look at us! You can imagine how beautiful she must be!"

Nathan pressed his lips together in silence.

'These children are exceptionally good-looking. Their mother must be attractive too.'

'Yet something about them feels... familiar. Especially the girl's face.'

Caleb's smartwatch buzzed. Glancing at Liam's caller ID, he excused himself. "Need to use the restroom."

At the bathroom entrance, Caleb answered. "Liam?"

Liam's excited voice came through from the hospital lab. "Got the DNA results. He's our father!"

Caleb's grip tightened on his watch. "No wonder we look alike. But why is he with that witch?"

"Remember what Godmother told us?" Liam explained. "Mom was framed six years ago and kicked out. Dad doesn't know we exist - probably because of that woman."

Caleb's expression turned stormy. "She thinks she can keep our father? Over my dead body!"

As Caleb turned, someone shoved him hard.

"Watch where you're going, you little brat!" Laura Scott brushed imaginary dirt off her designer dress - a limited edition piece she only wore for special occasions.

Then she froze.

The boy looked exactly like a younger Nathan Goldmann.

Caleb stood calmly. "You're the clumsy one, lady."

"Who... who's your mother?" Laura demanded, a sinking feeling in her gut.

'Could this be some woman's illegitimate child with Nathan? But he's never shown interest in anyone except that one night six years ago...'

'No. That Vanderbilt bitch only slept with him once. The odds are impossible.'

'Unless... with Evelyn back in Zlokova...'

Caleb scoffed. "As if you deserve to know."

Laura grabbed his arm viciously. "Your mother clearly failed at raising you properly!"

Caleb's gaze turned icy - an exact replica of Nathan's infamous glare. "Did yours teach you to bully children?"

"Is your mother Evelyn Vanderbilt? That scheming whore?" Laura spat.

At the insult, Caleb bit her hand hard.

"Ah!" Laura shoved him away in rage.

Caleb collapsed dramatically, bursting into tears. "Help! This lady is attacking children!"

Waiters rushed over at the commotion, finding a sobbing child and a furious woman.

"She pushed me and called my mom horrible names!" Caleb wailed between fake sobs.

The manager hurried to inform Nathan, who immediately strode toward the scene with Quincy. Daisy arrived moments later.

"Liam!" Seeing her "crying" brother, Daisy charged at Laura. "Why did you hurt him?"

"You little vermin!" Laura raised her hand. "I'll teach you some manners!"

Daisy deliberately stepped into the slap's path, falling to the ground with a red mark blooming on her cheek.

Gasps erupted. Laura paled. "She... she ran into it!"

Then she froze completely.

Nathan stood there, his expression thunderous.

"Mr. Goldmann, I—"

Nathan ignored her, kneeling to examine Daisy's cheek before wiping Caleb's tears. Their distress inexplicably twisted something in his chest.

"Apologize. Now." His voice was deadly calm.

Laura trembled. "What are these children to you?"

Nathan's jaw tightened.

'They're strangers. And yet...'

"That's irrelevant. You will apologize, or I'll make sure Vivian learns exactly how her mother behaves in public."
###Chapter 13

Laura’s face twisted with fury as she stormed out of the restaurant, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. She couldn’t believe Nathan had actually made her apologize to those brats.

Those little devils better not be Evelyn’s.

Inside, Nathan watched Daisy and Caleb hurry away, their small figures disappearing through the grand doors. His chest tightened inexplicably.

Oliver blinked in surprise. "Mr. Goldmann, those kids have quite the attitude, don’t they?"

Nathan didn’t respond. His mind was elsewhere.

Outside, Caleb wiped his face, the tears already gone. He smirked at Daisy. "See? Told you I could cry on command."

But Daisy wasn’t laughing.

Her cheek still stung from Laura’s slap. Caleb’s expression darkened as he gently touched the red mark. "That witch is going to regret this."

Daisy bit her lip. "Caleb… that woman is Vivian’s mother. Do you think Daddy really doesn’t want us?"

Her voice wobbled. The pain from the slap was nothing compared to the sinking feeling in her chest. Nathan had only demanded an apology—nothing more.

Caleb squeezed her hand. "He’s just blinded by Vivian right now. But we’ll make him see the truth. We can’t let him know who we are yet."

Not until we’re sure he’s worth it.

Daisy nodded firmly. "Yeah. We’ll protect Mommy no matter what."

Viana Jewelry

Laura barged into Evelyn’s office without knocking, her face flushed with rage. "You conniving little—!"

Evelyn didn’t even look up from her files. "Laura, must you always sound like a broken record? ‘Btch’ this, ‘btch’ that. It’s getting tiresome."

Laura slammed her hands on the desk. "Don’t play dumb! You came back to Zlokova with two bastards, didn’t you?"

Evelyn’s fingers stilled.

Bastards?

She closed the folder slowly, her gaze icy. "What are you talking about?"

Laura scoffed. "I saw two kids today. Spitting image of you. Admit it—they’re yours!"

Evelyn’s pulse spiked, but her face remained blank. "I have no idea what you’re referring to."

Sophia wouldn’t have taken them out in public… Would she?

Laura narrowed her eyes. "You’re lying."

Evelyn leaned back, feigning indifference. "Even if they were mine, why would you care? Worry about your own daughter. Last I checked, Viana Jewelry is drowning in scandals under her ‘leadership.’"

Laura’s face twisted. "You—!"

Evelyn cut her off. "Tell me, Laura, do you even know what’s happening in your own company? Or are you too busy playing the trophy wife?"

Laura’s nostrils flared, but then a smug smile curled her lips. "You think you’re so clever, don’t you? But let me remind you—Vivian is Nathan Goldmann’s girlfriend. You’ll never compare."

Evelyn’s fingers twitched, but she kept her voice steady. "I have zero interest in your daughter’s love life. But Viana Jewelry? That, I will take back."

Laura stormed out, leaving Evelyn alone with her thoughts.

Those kids…

She exhaled sharply.

I won’t let the Vanderbilts use them against me.
###Chapter 14

Laura might be furious with Evelyn, but she had bottled up all her rage. The moment she returned home, she went straight to Richard and complained about Evelyn.

Richard set down his newspaper, clearly taken aback. "Zoe is back in Cornelia?"

"Yes, she’s now Zara, a world-famous jewelry designer. I heard Vivian say she’s so arrogant she doesn’t even respect Mr. Goldmann, let alone Vivian and me."

Since Richard knew his daughter Vivian was involved with Mr. Goldmann, he had high expectations for her and valued her immensely.

Naturally, he couldn’t stand by when he learned Evelyn had disrespected Mr. Goldmann. After all, Richard cared about both reputation and status—and offending the Goldmanns was out of the question. How could he just sit back and watch as his perfect future son-in-law slipped away?

Richard folded the newspaper and placed it aside. "That girl—I haven’t seen her in six years, and she’s already provoking Mr. Goldmann?"

Laura sat beside him, clutching his arm with feigned distress. "Exactly! I went to her company today to warn her out of kindness, but she—she insulted me!"

"Darling, Zoe used to listen to you the most. We can’t let her continue acting so recklessly. Who knows when Vivian might suffer Mr. Goldmann’s wrath because of her? By then, it’ll be too late to fix."

Richard’s expression darkened. "I’ll make sure that girl comes home tomorrow."

Laura smirked inwardly.

‘I might not be able to shut your mouth, you little wretch, but let’s see if you dare defy your own father.’

At dinner, Evelyn noticed Daisy’s slightly swollen cheek and frowned. "Daisy, what happened to your face?"

"Mommy, we had lunch with Godmother today and ran into Vivian’s mom. That horrible woman suddenly asked if we were your kids—then she hit me!"

Evelyn’s face turned stormy in an instant, her grip tightening around her spoon. If not for fear of frightening the triplets, she would’ve stormed out with a knife right then.

‘Damn you, Laura! So that’s why she came to my office earlier.’

‘But wait—how does Laura know I have children? And how is she so sure they’re mine?’

Daisy reached out, placing her small hand over Evelyn’s. "Don’t be mad, Mommy. It doesn’t hurt much. I’m just sad because other kids have their daddies to protect them… but I don’t."

Evelyn’s heart clenched, her gaze dimming. She could give her children the best life possible—but she couldn’t give them a father’s love.

Guilt gnawed at her. She didn’t even know how to explain their father to them.

After all, she knew nothing about the man herself.

Liam looked up earnestly. "Mommy, why did Daddy leave us?"

Caleb nodded. "Yeah, why doesn’t Daddy want us?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Daisy burst into dramatic tears. "Waaah! Daddy must’ve found another woman! That’s why he left Mommy and us! Waaah!"

Caleb and Liam exchanged glances.

‘Daisy’s acting skills are next-level.’

"There’s no such thing, Daisy. Your daddy didn’t abandon you." Evelyn forced a smile, gently wiping her daughter’s tears.

Daisy sniffled, eyes red. "Really?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Of course. Why would he abandon you?"

"Then why have you never told us about Daddy? Where is he?"

Daisy was ready to bombard her with more questions, but just then, Evelyn’s phone rang—Sophia’s name flashing on the screen.

Saved by the call, Evelyn excused herself and stepped onto the balcony. "I’m eating. What’s wrong?"

But instead of Sophia’s voice, a stranger spoke. "Are you Ms. Hill’s relative? This is the traffic police department—"

Evelyn rushed to the station and found Sophia slumped in a chair, looking utterly pitiful.

She exhaled sharply. "Sophia, what did you do?"

"I—I accidentally hit someone’s car. And it’s… it’s someone I can’t afford to offend."

Sophia had clearly messed with the wrong person. If her father found out, she’d be skinned alive.

Evelyn frowned. "Whose car was it?"

Sophia glanced nervously toward the office just as a traffic officer stepped out—followed by two men.

One of them was Nathan Goldmann.

Evelyn’s expression froze. She turned to Sophia, teeth gritted. "You really know how to pick your targets. Why didn’t you just finish him off in the accident?"

Sophia pouted. "I swear it was an accident! I was in a hurry—how was I supposed to know—?"

She’d nearly fainted when she realized she’d rear-ended a Rolls-Royce. And when she saw who stepped out, she’d wished the ground would swallow her whole.

Nathan’s gaze darkened when he spotted Evelyn.

Especially after what Vivian had told him last night.

He strode toward them, his voice icy. "So you’re her guarantor?"

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Yes. This was my friend’s mistake. Let’s handle this properly—name your price for compensation."

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable. "Compensation isn’t necessary. The car’s being scrapped anyway."

‘Scrapped?’

Evelyn shot Sophia a look. "Was it that bad?"

Sophia shook her head. "Just a dent!"

Oliver, standing nearby, smirked. "Miss Vanderbilt, Mr. Goldmann never repairs his cars. Even a scratch means it’s written off."

"So you expect my friend to buy a brand-new car?" Evelyn’s tone turned sharp.

Oliver shrugged. "That depends on your attitude right now."

Evelyn was about to snap back when Sophia tugged her sleeve frantically. There was no way she could afford a new car.

Evelyn knew Nathan wasn’t short on money—this was purely retaliation against her.

"Miss Vanderbilt," Nathan said coolly, "does my offer displease you?"

His piercing stare unnerved her. He hadn’t planned to demand compensation—but after Vivian’s accusations last night, seeing Evelyn here stirred something in him.

‘No woman has ever affected me like this. And yet, because of two children and now her, I’m losing control?’

‘Did she really do what Vivian claimed six years ago?’

‘Then let’s see what she’ll do for her so-called friend today.’
###Chapter 15

Evelyn inhaled deeply, steadying her nerves before forcing a polite smile. "I'm uncertain what attitude Mr. Goldmann expects from us. If an apology is what he seeks, then I'll offer one on her behalf."

An apology—that’s all he wants, right?

Summoning every ounce of composure, she dipped into a slight bow. "My apologies, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan’s lips curled with faint irony as he observed her lowered stance. "I never expected Miss Vanderbilt to apologize for her friend. Hard to believe you're the same person who'd harm her own sister."

Evelyn straightened abruptly, suspicion darkening her gaze. "What exactly are you implying, Mr. Goldmann?"

Hurt my sister? Is he talking about Vivian?

Nathan closed the distance between them, his voice a careless murmur near her ear. "I thought you were someone who owned her actions. Turns out, you're just like the rest."

With that, he turned away dismissively. "Consider today’s incident forgotten—this once."

Sophia exhaled shakily, her racing heart finally settling as they left. But Nathan’s cryptic words lingered. "Zoe, what was he talking about?"

Evelyn shrugged, feigning indifference. "Who knows? Maybe he thinks I’m targeting Vivian deliberately and feels the need to defend her as her man."

Sophia’s eyes widened. "Wait—Vivian Vanderbilt is Nathan Goldmann’s lover?" She scoffed. "Is he blind? Out of all women, he chose her?"

Evelyn shot her a pointed look. "Gossiping already? I’d worry more about explaining last night to your father."

Without another word, she strode off.

Sophia pouted but hurried after her.

The Next Day

Evelyn handed a procurement list to the purchasing department. "Order the rough diamonds exactly as specified. Any mistakes will be on you this time."

The clerk scanned the document and nodded. "Understood."

As Evelyn turned to leave, the office phone rang. The clerk set the list down and answered.

Another employee seized the moment, snapping a photo of the supplier details from the slip before slipping back to her desk. Within seconds, the image was discreetly sent to Vivian.

Seated in her office, Vivian smirked at the message.

Since you’re overseeing procurement, don’t blame me for what comes next.

Her landline buzzed. She picked up. "Yes?"

"Viv, I’ve been calling your cell for hours! Why is it off?" Laura’s voice crackled through the line.

Vivian’s grip tightened. "That witch smashed it. I’ll replace it tomorrow. What do you want?"

"Your father’s summoning her home tonight. Bring Nathan for dinner. Once you make your relationship official, your father won’t let her stay a second longer!"

Vivian frowned. "Mother, when has Nathan ever agreed to dine with us? What if he refuses?"

In six years, he’d never once accepted an invitation to the Vanderbilt estate.

Laura’s tone turned sharp. "Persuade him. Your father’s counting on you. If you can’t even do this, how can we secure your future?"

The words struck a nerve.

Father only values me because of Nathan. Without him, I’m nothing compared to Evelyn.

Evelyn sat in her office, reviewing staff records. Her focus landed on Gregory Fannon—her mother’s former assistant, the one who’d sustained Viana Jewelry’s sales after her death.

The company’s decline began the day he resigned.

Her phone vibrated. Richard Vanderbilt’s name flashed on the screen.

She hesitated.

Returning to the Vanderbilt manor felt surreal. The moment she stepped inside, the housekeeper gasped. "Miss Evelyn?"

Laura, draped in an evening gown, set her teacup down with a saccharine smile. "Zoe, you’re finally home!"

Evelyn’s expression iced over at the sight of her.

You still owe me for that slap. And I will collect.

Laura simpered. "Your father missed you. That’s why he invited you tonight. Must you look so hostile?"

Evelyn’s laugh was brittle. "Feels more like a last supper."

Laura’s smile faltered. "How could you say that about a family dinner?"

"Spare me the act. I prefer when you call me a bitch—it’s almost endearing."

Before Laura could retort, Richard’s voice boomed from the stairs. "Six years abroad, and this is how you speak to your mother?"

Evelyn smirked. "My mother’s dead. You watched her burn, remember?"

Richard’s face purpled with rage. "Is this what you learned overseas? Disrespecting your elders?"

Guilt had once gnawed at him for casting her out. Now, all he saw was defiance.

Laura intervened, playing the martyr. "Richard, don’t blame her. I’m just her stepmother. Her resentment is understandable."

Evelyn scoffed. "You’re worse than a stepmother."

"Evelyn Vanderbilt!" Richard roared. "I called you here for dinner, not a fight. If you can’t behave, leave!"

She met his glare, unflinching.

Just like six years ago. He’ll always believe them over me.

"Gladly." She spun toward the door—only to freeze as Vivian entered, clinging to Nathan’s arm.

Richard and Laura fawned over him, their anger vanishing. "Mr. Goldmann! We didn’t expect you!"

Nathan’s gaze slid to Evelyn, his tone dry. "The Vanderbilts are... lively tonight."

Richard coughed. "Ah, this is my younger daughter, Evelyn."

"Ah, the renowned designer Zara. I hadn’t realized she was a Vanderbilt."

Richard nodded stiffly. "She... takes after her mother."

Evelyn watched the charade, arms crossed. Their sycophantic act was almost amusing.

"I’ll excuse myself. Enjoy your meal."

Vivian blocked her path. "Zoe, stay. We’re family."

Laura chimed in, oozing faux warmth. "Yes, dear, don’t upset your father."

Evelyn’s smile was razor-thin. "How touching."
###Chapter 16

Evelyn remained silent.

‘They went through all this trouble just to get me to stay for dinner. They even invited Nathan here and are now insisting I don’t leave. Fine. I’ll stay and see what this mother-daughter duo is plotting.’

She lifted her head and smiled. "Alright, then. I’ll stay for dinner."

Vivian and Laura hadn’t expected her to agree, but everything was going according to their plan.

Throughout the meal, Evelyn kept her head down, eating quietly. Richard and Laura barely spoke, likely due to Nathan’s presence.

Nathan himself barely touched his food. He had almost refused Vivian’s invitation to accompany her back to the Vanderbilt manor—until Evelyn’s name was mentioned.

Since Vivian claimed Evelyn had invited him, he wanted to see what game she was playing.

"Zoe, how have you been all these years?"

That was probably the first time Richard had ever pretended to care.

Evelyn didn’t even glance up. "I’ve been wonderful, thanks to you."

A flicker of discomfort crossed Richard’s face.

Laura shot Vivian a look, prompting her to act.

Vivian placed food into Nathan’s bowl. "Nathan, you should eat more."

Laura smiled sweetly. "Mr. Goldmann, thank you for looking after Vivian all these years. She’s always been such a thoughtful and well-mannered girl, but please be patient with her if she ever makes mistakes."

Evelyn nearly choked on her laughter.

Nathan noticed, his gaze sharpening. "Miss Vanderbilt seems to have something to say about that?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn.

She feigned innocence. "What could I possibly say? Though I am curious—Mr. Goldmann, you’re in your thirties, and you’ve been together for six years. Shouldn’t you be marrying our thoughtful and well-mannered Vivian by now?"

She emphasized the words mockingly, seeing right through their scheme.

Laura’s smile froze. Vivian stiffened.

Nathan’s glare could have burned through steel.

Vivian hurried to smooth things over. "Nathan, Zoe’s just joking. Don’t take it seriously."

Evelyn wasn’t done. "Vivian, why do you sound so formal with your own boyfriend?"

Vivian’s face darkened with fury.

Richard’s expression soured. Laura quickly intervened. "Zoe, really! This isn’t a matchmaking session."

‘Damn it. She had to bring up marriage? Is she trying to humiliate us?’

‘We only invited Nathan to remind her of her place, not to force the issue so blatantly. But now she’s ruined everything!’

Evelyn wasn’t stupid. The moment they insisted she stay for dinner with Nathan present, their intentions were clear.

So she played along—enthusiastically.

Ignoring Laura, she stared at Nathan. "Mr. Goldmann, don’t tell me you’ve never considered it."

She pretended to be shocked when his expression darkened. "That’s not right. A woman’s youth shouldn’t be wasted. Vivian’s already twenty-six—she’s not getting any younger."

Vivian’s embarrassment grew, but she didn’t dare look at Nathan.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Or… are you toying with my sister’s feelings?"

"Evelyn Vanderbilt!" Richard slammed the table, forgetting Nathan’s presence entirely. "Watch your mouth! How dare you speak to Mr. Goldmann like that?"

Evelyn smirked. "Getting angry over the truth? Father, even Mr. Goldmann isn’t upset. Are you really less magnanimous than him?"

If Nathan retaliated now, he’d only prove her point.

"You—!" Richard’s veins bulged.

‘This wretched girl! I never should have let her come back today.’

Evelyn set down her fork and stood. "Seems I’m no longer welcome. I was just helping voice the obvious, but suddenly, I’m the villain. As expected—I’ll always be an outsider here. Enjoy your meal."

Richard trembled with rage. Laura and Vivian weren’t faring much better.

Vivian glanced nervously at Nathan. "Nathan…?"

He stood, his expression icy. She didn’t dare say another word.

Without a backward glance, he strode out.

Richard, having lost his appetite, threw his napkin down and stormed upstairs.

Mother and daughter seethed—Evelyn had ruined everything.

Outside, Evelyn hailed a cab—until a hand yanked her back.

She stumbled, catching her balance before glaring at Nathan. "Mr. Goldmann, what’s the meaning of this?"

His jaw clenched. "Did you do that on purpose?"
###Chapter 17

"Mr. Goldmann, why would you assume I orchestrated this? All I did was suggest you and Vivian might be a good match, didn’t I?" Evelyn protested, struggling to free her wrist from his grip.

Nathan yanked her forward, nearly sending her tumbling into his arms.

His voice was icy. "You’re the one who told Vivian to invite me to the Vanderbilt estate. Was this your scheme all along?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned, before meeting his gaze with an incredulous laugh. "So now I’m the mastermind behind Vivian’s invitation? How flattering."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, stay out of matters between Vivian and me. Whatever game you’re playing, don’t overestimate your cleverness."

"Let me make this clear, Nathan," Evelyn snapped, wrenching her hand free. "I never told Vivian to invite you. I don’t know what lies she’s feeding you, but they have nothing to do with me."

She squared her shoulders, her tone sharp. "Frankly, I couldn’t care less about your relationship. So go tell your girlfriend to stop dragging me into her drama. I’m not her convenient scapegoat!"

Fury burned through her, stripping away any pretense of politeness. She turned to leave, but Nathan suddenly seized her arm and shoved her into his car.

"Mr. Goldmann, what the hell? Let me go!" Evelyn slammed her palms against the locked door, glaring at him as he slid into the driver’s seat. "If you don’t release me right now, I’m calling the police!"

"Do what you want." Nathan ignored her threat and sped off.

From the shadows of the Vanderbilt manor, Vivian clenched her fists, her eyes burning with resentment as she watched the car disappear.

The car screeched to a halt in the middle of nowhere. Nathan cut the engine, leaving only the chirping of crickets and the distant crash of waves.

Evelyn shot him a venomous look. "What now? Planning to dump my body here?"

"Get out," he ordered coldly.

She scoffed, peering into the pitch-black wilderness. "You’re seriously leaving me here?"

His jaw tightened. "Do I need to repeat myself?"

With a muttered curse, Evelyn shoved the door open and stepped out. The moment her feet touched the ground, Nathan sped away, leaving her stranded.

Watching the taillights vanish, she gritted her teeth. "You absolute bastard."

The night swallowed her whole. No streetlights, no signs of civilization—just an endless stretch of road and the eerie rustling of trees. She fumbled for her phone, but the screen displayed the dreaded "No Service" warning.

Great. Am I really spending the night in the middle of nowhere?

Nathan drove for miles before pulling over, gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white.

What the hell is wrong with me?

He’d never lost control like this before. The thought that Evelyn had manipulated Vivian into inviting him had infuriated him beyond reason.

But what if she’s telling the truth? What if Vivian lied?

His mind churned with conflicting thoughts.

She’s alone out there. Probably terrified.

With a frustrated growl, he spun the car around and headed back.

When he returned, he found Evelyn sitting on the curb, her back to him, facing the ocean. Moonlight draped over her like liquid silver, highlighting the elegant curve of her neck as she gathered her curls into a loose ponytail.

The sight stirred something primal in him—an urge to unravel the mystery she embodied.

Evelyn turned, startled, then smirked. "Oh? The mighty Nathan Goldmann actually has a conscience?"

He scowled, ignoring the heat creeping up his neck. "Get in the car."

She arched a brow. "Front seat or back?"

"I’m not your chauffeur."

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn slid into the passenger seat. "You’re a walking contradiction, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan ignored her jab, focusing on the road.

Silence stretched between them until Evelyn’s phone rang. She glanced at the screen—Liam.

Shit. It’s past nine. They must be worried.

Her voice softened instantly. "Hey, sweetheart."

Nathan’s grip on the wheel tightened. Sweetheart?

"Sorry, something came up. I’ll be home soon. Love you." She ended the call with a kissy noise.

Nathan’s tone dripped with disdain. "Boyfriend?"

Evelyn grinned. "Something like that."

Two little "someones," actually.

Nathan said nothing, but irritation coiled in his chest.

He dropped her off downtown without another word, leaving Evelyn bewildered by his erratic behavior.

By the time she got home, it was past ten. Liam stood by the door, arms crossed.

"Mommy, were you with that man again?"

Evelyn laughed. "How’d you guess?"

Liam sighed like a weary adult. "You only call us ‘sweetheart’ when you’re dealing with a jerk."

Smart kid.

She ruffled his hair. "Where are Caleb and Daisy?"

"Asleep."

"Thank you for looking after them."

Liam shrugged. "I’m the oldest. It’s my job."

The next day at Viana Jewelry, Evelyn stepped into the elevator—only for Vivian to yank her aside.

"Looking for a fight?" Evelyn smirked.

Vivian’s eyes burned with fury. "You scheming little—what did you do with Nathan last night?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Oh? Did he not come home?"

Vivian’s nails dug into her palms. "Stay away from him, or you’ll regret it."

Evelyn leaned in, her smile sharp. "Or what? You’ll cry to Daddy again?"

Vivian’s face twisted with rage. This bitch will pay.
###Chapter 18

Evelyn crossed her arms and glared at Vivian. "Why don't you ask your boyfriend that question instead of me? What’s your problem?"

This is ridiculous. She’s acting like I stole her man.

Vivian’s face paled with fury. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, don’t get too comfortable. Your time is running out!"

With a dramatic flick of her wrist, she stormed off, leaving her threat hanging in the air.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes as she watched Vivian’s retreating figure. Who will have the last laugh? That remains to be seen.

At Evelyn’s office…

Evelyn was scrolling through the internet when one of her staff burst in, breathless. "Ms. Zara, we have a situation!"

Calmly, Evelyn lifted her gaze. "What happened?"

"Several customers purchased jewelry from our store and discovered they were counterfeit. They traced the origin back to us and are now in the lobby. The purchasing department claims they sourced the materials based on your order."

Evelyn exhaled, shut down her computer, and stood. "Let’s go handle this."

In the lobby…

A group of furious customers had gathered, voices rising in outrage.

"Viana Jewelry has been in business for decades! How dare you sell fakes? Do you even care about your reputation?"

A woman slammed a pearl bracelet onto the counter. "This cost me thousands! I had it verified—these are fake pearls! Is this how you treat loyal customers?"

Vivian emerged from the crowd, her secretary trailing behind. She smiled sweetly at the woman. "Madam, please, let’s not jump to conclusions. There must have been a mistake with the supplier."

"A mistake?" The woman pointed at the receipt. "This is your store’s packaging, your receipt! The evidence is right here!"

Vivian remained composed. "Our products have never been fraudulent. The issue must lie with the supplier. Once our designer arrives—"

"I’ll compensate double the amount."

All eyes turned to Evelyn, who had just entered the lobby.

She picked up the bracelet, examined it briefly, and nodded. "These are fake pearls."

The woman scoffed. "See? Even she admits it!"

Vivian feigned concern. "Zoe, you were the one who placed the order. The purchasing department followed your instructions. How did this happen?"

Her secretary handed Evelyn the order slip.

Evelyn skimmed it and smirked. "Yes, this is my signature."

Vivian gasped dramatically. "Zoe, are you trying to ruin Viana’s reputation? This is fraud!"

The woman turned on Evelyn. "You did this? You’re despicable! Refund my money now!"

The crowd erupted in agreement.

"If you don’t fix this, we’re taking legal action! Viana Jewelry is scamming its customers!"

Vivian hid a smirk. This is it, Evelyn. Your downfall.

Just then, Nathan and Oliver appeared.

Vivian rushed to Nathan, her voice trembling. "Nathan, counterfeit jewelry has been found again—and Zoe was responsible for sourcing the materials this time!"

The woman stepped forward. "Mr. Goldmann, I spent thousands on fake pearls from your company. This is unacceptable!"

Nathan’s cold gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Explain yourself."
###Chapter 19

Evelyn glanced at Vivian, setting down the pearl necklace in her hand with a faint smirk. "I didn't authorize this batch of prototypes, so I won't take the blame for this."

Vivian grabbed Evelyn's wrist, her grip tight. "Zoe, you should come clean. Viana is still your father's company. You wouldn’t want to ruin his hard work, would you?"

"I am telling the truth." Evelyn pulled her hand free, her expression unreadable as she picked up the pearl bracelet and approached the lady. "Madam, I understand your frustration. You paid for genuine jewelry, not counterfeits."

She held up the bracelet, her voice steady. "But rest assured, I won’t let Viana’s reputation be tarnished by fakes. You’ll get a full refund—and the authentic piece once I resolve this."

The woman blinked, surprised. The offer was more than fair—her money back and the real jewelry? She nodded slowly. "Fine. But I want answers. What’s going on with these fakes?"

Evelyn turned to the purchasing department staff, her gaze sharp. "When I handed you the order, I warned you—if anything went wrong, you would be held accountable. Remember?"

The clerk paled, lowering her head. "But... we followed your order exactly."

Vivian cut in, voice sweet but edged with accusation. "That’s right, Zoe. The purchasing department acted on your instructions. How can you blame them?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then should I blame you instead?"

Vivian stiffened, her smile faltering.

Nathan watched silently, his cold eyes assessing. He knew Viana had been founded by Evelyn’s mother. She wouldn’t sabotage her own legacy.

Evelyn held up the order slip for all to see. "Anyone in the jewelry business knows Jade Mountain Co. Half of Bassburgh’s top jewelers source their gems from them."

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd. "Jade Mountain’s stones are impeccable," one guest remarked. "Their raw materials are never fake."

Evelyn tapped the pearl bracelet. "These 'pearls' are just powdered pearl mixed with crystal. And as we all know, crystal is cheap—barely worth $200 an ounce for top grade."

The lady gasped. "So my bracelet is worthless?"

"Completely." Evelyn’s gaze locked onto the purchasing clerk. "You’ve worked here for years. How could you mistake Jade Mountain’s quality for this?"

The clerk shrank under her scrutiny.

Vivian’s pulse raced. She couldn’t let Evelyn turn this around. "Maybe Jade Mountain’s materials aren’t all genuine!"

Silence fell. Then—snickers.

Evelyn smirked. "Director Vanderbilt, you’re embarrassing yourself. Questioning Jade Mountain’s integrity? That’s like accusing the sky of not being blue."

Vivian’s face burned.

"The fakes didn’t come from the supplier," Evelyn declared. "Someone inside Viana swapped them. And I won’t be their scapegoat." Her eyes flicked to Vivian. "I’ve handled every gemstone imaginable in Stoslo. You really think I can’t spot a fake?"

She turned to the purchasing team. "Consider this department dissolved."

The staff blanched.

Vivian panicked. "Zoe, you can’t just fire them! They followed orders—"

"Then is the problem my order?" Evelyn countered.

Vivian floundered.

Nathan finally spoke, his tone icy. "Replace the purchasing head. The department failed."

Evelyn scoffed. "And the director who oversees them? Does she face no consequences?"

Vivian’s breath hitched.

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "Vivian lacks your expertise. She didn’t know."

Evelyn’s smile was razor-thin. "Ignorance isn’t an excuse when you’re in charge."
###Chapter 20

Evelyn had nothing more to add after hearing Nathan's words. With a dismissive wave, she conceded, "Fine, you're the majority shareholder. Your word is final here."

She turned on her heel, her professional smile instantly returning as she addressed the clients. "Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll follow me to our VIP lounge, we can discuss the compensation details."

The group nodded and trailed after Evelyn into the private room.

Vivian's lips curled in secret satisfaction as she witnessed Nathan defending her position.

'Just as I thought - I'm still Nathan's favorite.'

"Nathan, I had no idea things would escalate like this," Vivian said with practiced remorse, her eyes downcast in contrition. "I'll be more careful in the future."

Nathan's gaze flickered over her briefly. "You're inexperienced with market dynamics. Leave these matters to Evelyn moving forward." With that, he strode away with Oliver in tow.

Vivian's manicured nails bit into her palms as she lowered her head.

'Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn!'

'Not only did this backfire, but now I have to defer to her? I'm the legitimate director of Viana Jewelry!'

Inside the VIP suite, Evelyn had staff bring out authentic versions of the disputed pieces. "As our apology, please accept these complimentary replacements," she said, arranging them on the conference table. "All refunds have been processed through your original payment platforms and should reflect shortly. We deeply regret today's incident."

She rose and bowed formally.

The lead client chuckled, waving a hand. "No need for such formality. We understand the situation now, and your explanation was thorough. Consider the matter closed."

"Thank you for your understanding, madam." Evelyn personally escorted them to the elevator, watching as the satisfied group departed.

Her buoyant mood evaporated the moment the elevator doors reopened on her floor. Nathan stood waiting by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silhouette stark against the cityscape.

"Mr. Goldmann," she said coolly, "you do realize this isn't Vivian's floor?"

"I was waiting for you." He turned slowly, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

Evelyn forced a tight smile as she approached. "To what do I owe this honor? More grievances about your precious Vivian?"

"Must you always take that tone with me?" His voice carried an edge of irritation.

"It's who I am." She shrugged nonchalantly.

Nathan's lips thinned into a displeased line.

'She's perfectly cordial with everyone else. Only with me does she turn into this prickly creature.'

"Does it bother you that I defended Vivian today?"

Evelyn blinked in genuine surprise.

'What?'

Nathan's gaze turned knowing. "Your rivalry with Vivian is no secret. I'm aware you resent her for inheriting your mother's company."

He closed the distance between them deliberately. "You should practice forgiveness. She's never once complained about what you did to her six years ago."

"And what exactly did I do?" Evelyn's sudden laugh held no warmth. "So in your narrative, Vivian's the victim?"

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly but he remained silent.

The mirth drained from Evelyn's face. "Of course. She's always the poor, misunderstood one. Even my father falls for her damsel act - why wouldn't you?"

"Evelyn Vander—"

"Mr. Goldmann," she cut him off flatly, "you know nothing of my experiences, so you have no right to judge. Whatever fairy tales Vivian has spun for you, I'll say this with absolute certainty - I was the one wronged six years ago."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and strode into her office, the door clicking shut with finality behind her.
###Chapter 21

The sleek black car glided through the countryside roads, its tinted windows reflecting the golden afternoon light. Nathan Goldmann stared blankly at the passing scenery, his mind still replaying Evelyn's words from earlier.

His fingers tapped restlessly against the leather seat as he became lost in thought.

"Sir?" Oliver Lawson's voice cut through the silence, more insistent this time.

Nathan blinked, snapping back to reality. He rubbed his temples. "Yes?"

Oliver extended the phone toward him. "Your father is on the line."

Taking the device, Nathan pressed it to his ear. "Father."

At the sprawling Goldmann estate...

"You reckless boy! Did you get some poor girl pregnant?" The elder Goldmann's voice boomed through the receiver as he sipped his aged whiskey.

His tablet displayed two children's photos - their features bearing an unmistakable resemblance to his son.

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. "That's impossible."

"Then explain why Royal Crown Entertainment just signed these two carbon copies of you?" The old man's glass thudded against the marble table. "I'm having them brought here immediately."

"Father, I haven't been with any woman who—" Nathan's protest was cut short by the dial tone.

He exhaled sharply. "Change course. We're going to the estate."

Meanwhile, in another vehicle winding through the countryside...

Daisy Vanderbilt pressed her nose against the window, her breath fogging up the glass. "Wow! Look at all those trees!" Her small hands gestured excitedly at the passing landscape.

Liam studied the stern-faced bodyguard beside him before asking, "Where exactly are we going?"

The elderly driver chuckled, his kind eyes crinkling in the rearview mirror. "To meet someone very important. You'll see soon enough."

"But why does he live so far away?" Daisy tilted her head, her pigtails bouncing.

"This isn't just any house, little miss," the driver explained. "The Goldmann estate is more like a private kingdom."

As they crested a hill, a picturesque village came into view - its cobblestone streets lined with charming cottages. Daisy's mouth fell open at the sight.

The car continued past the village, ascending a private road lined with ancient oaks. When the mansion finally came into view, both children gasped.

The estate sprawled across manicured grounds, its ivy-covered stone walls framing a breathtaking chateau. A grand fountain danced in the circular driveway, its crystal-clear water catching the sunlight.

The driver helped them out, leading them along a path flanked by blooming gardens. They crossed an arched stone bridge over a tranquil pond, its surface dotted with lily pads.

At the bridge's end stood an elegant white pavilion where an older gentleman waited.

"Sir," the driver announced, "I've brought the children."

Nathan's father turned, his sharp eyes softening as they fell upon the young visitors. He extended his hands warmly. "Come here, my dears."

Liam and Daisy exchanged glances before approaching cautiously.

The old man studied Liam's face intently before smiling. "And what might your name be, young man?"

"Liam Vanderbilt, sir," the boy answered politely.

The elder Goldmann nodded before turning to Daisy. "And you, little one?"

"I'm Daisy!" she chirped, her bright eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Chuckling, the man gestured to the plush chairs beside him. "Sit with me, children. We have much to discuss."
###Chapter 22

Daisy tilted her head to study him. "We've met someone who looks exactly like us too."

"Oh?" Theodore Goldmann's question was interrupted by the booming voice of the security guard stationed near the rose bushes. "Good afternoon, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan strode into the garden pavilion with purposeful steps. His gaze immediately landed on the two children seated beside his father. "Dad, you can't just bring random children here without consulting me first."

"And why ever not?" The elder Goldmann chuckled, ruffling Daisy's golden curls. "When I saw how much they resemble you, I simply had to invite them over. Is that a crime?"

He handed each child a slice of decadent chocolate cake topped with fresh strawberries. "Try this, my dears. The pastry chef prepared it specially this morning."

"Thanks, Grandpa!"

Liam accepted his portion politely while Daisy immediately sank her teeth into the treat, frosting smearing across her cheeks.

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. Only his father would kidnap children based on a passing resemblance.

"Stay right here, my little cherubs." The old man rose gracefully. "Grandpa needs to have a quick word with your... uncle."

As the two men disappeared down the marble pathway, Daisy turned to Liam with frosting-covered lips. "Do you think he really is our grandpa? He seems to like us an awful lot."

Liam nodded thoughtfully. "If Grandpa approves of us, convincing Daddy to come home should be easy." Meanwhile, in the oak-paneled study...

"Father, those children can't possibly be mine. You shouldn't have brought them here without contacting their parents first. What if—"

"What am I, a kidnapper?" Theodore waved away his son's concerns. "I don't care whose children they are. Those bright young things have charmed me completely."

He settled behind his antique mahogany desk, fixing Nathan with a stern look. "You're not getting any younger, son. If you'd settled down properly, I could have grandchildren their age by now."

Nathan remained silent.

"Tell me truthfully - are you absolutely certain you've never fathered children? Because young Liam Vanderbilt's eyes and Daisy Vanderbilt's smile... they're unmistakably Goldmann features."

Nathan froze. "What did you say their last name was?"

Vanderbilt? Not Van Der Beek?

"You didn't even bother checking their information when it was right in front of you?" Theodore tapped the manila folder on his desk.

He'd dispatched investigators to Royal Crown Academy the moment he'd seen the children's photograph.

Nathan scanned the documents - Names: Liam Vanderbilt and Daisy Vanderbilt, both aged five years old!

A sudden knock interrupted them. Daisy peeked through the doorway, clutching an ornate chess set. "Grandpa, will you play chess with me?"

The old man's stern expression melted instantly. "Of course, my dear! Nothing would give me greater pleasure."

Without a backward glance at his son, Theodore followed the little girl back to the garden.

Nathan stared at the retreating figures before turning his attention back to the papers. He hadn't checked their surnames before, but now...

Vanderbilts. Both five years old.

Five years. If Vivian had been pregnant six years ago, after a full-term pregnancy, the child would be exactly five now.

But Vivian had never been pregnant. The woman in that room six years ago was supposed to be Vivian... so what had really happened?

Nathan moved to the French windows overlooking the garden. The children sat at the wrought-iron table, engaged in a lively chess match with his father. Liam stood protectively behind Daisy, his serious expression making him look like a miniature bodyguard.

"Daisy, who taught you to play so well?" Theodore asked as she captured his bishop.

"Mommy!" Daisy beamed with pride. "She knows all kinds of games - chess, checkers, even nine men's morris!"

The old man's laughter rang across the manicured lawns. "How refreshing! I thought modern children only knew how to stare at screens all day."
###Chapter 23

"Actually, Mommy believes it's important to understand our heritage. She's fascinated by antiques—that's how she created her signature 'Victorian-inspired jewelry' back in Stoslo."

Nathan's father chuckled. "I'd love to meet your mother someday."

Daisy beamed, thrilled she had finally steered Grandpa's attention toward Mommy.

Nathan glanced at Liam, who stood beside him. The little boy wiped his cheek with the back of his hand before shooting Nathan a look that was anything but friendly.

Oddly, that defiant expression reminded Nathan of someone.

"The first time I saw you, you had a mole near your eye."

Liam rubbed the spot defensively. "I drew that on."

"Grandpa, you lost!" Daisy giggled, bouncing on her toes.

She didn’t realize he had let her win. Watching her laugh so freely, the old man found himself smiling too. Maybe age had softened him—or maybe he was starting to enjoy the idea of having a granddaughter.

As evening approached, Nathan drove Liam and Daisy back to Seaview Villa.

"Goodbye, mister!" Daisy waved enthusiastically before grabbing her brother’s hand and skipping toward the porch.

Nathan didn’t leave immediately. He lingered, watching them disappear inside, lost in thought. He had never suspected they were his children—but now that he knew they were Vanderbilts, questions gnawed at him.

He pulled out his phone and dialed Vivian.

At the Vanderbilt manor—

"Nathan asked about what happened six years ago again?" Laura strode over, her expression tight with unease.

Vivian nodded, biting her lip. "I don’t know why, but I think he’s suspicious. Especially since Evelyn came back—he’s been paying way too much attention to her!"

That night when Nathan had questioned her about Evelyn, she had spun a story painting Evelyn as the schemer, the villain. It had worked—until she saw them leave together in the same car. Nathan hadn’t come home that night.

She hadn’t dared ask him, so her fury had festered, aimed solely at Evelyn.

Laura’s face darkened. "I knew it. That little witch is playing games. At dinner, she was deliberately provoking us, making Nathan doubt us."

"We can’t let her keep this up. With that face of hers, any man would fall for her if given enough time."

"Mom, I’ve tried getting rid of her, but she’s too clever. I can’t outmaneuver her."

Vivian’s patience was fraying. With Nathan digging into the past, the truth would surface sooner or later.

Laura paced, fingers tapping her chin. Then, a slow smirk curled her lips. "Vivian, do you still have Victor Baldwin’s number?"

Vivian stiffened. "Mr. Baldwin?"

"Yes. That old man has been obsessed with her for years. He never got what he wanted six years ago—let’s arrange a proper reunion. This time, we’ll make sure she can’t escape."

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in her office, sketching designs. Since her mother’s death, Viana Jewelry had struggled to establish a distinct style.

After Luxe’s success with Victorian-inspired pieces, Evelyn hadn’t introduced anything new.
###Chapter 24

Evelyn tapped her pen against her lips, lost in thought. The blank page before her mocked her creative block.

"Zoe."

Vivian stood at the doorway, her expression unreadable.

Evelyn set the pen down with a sigh. "No audience here. Drop the sweet act. It's making me sick."

Normally, Vivian would have fired back with a sharp retort. But today, she remained eerily composed. "I'm not here to argue. I know you're the business expert between us."

She placed a folder on the table. "You're aware of Viana Jewelry's current dilemma. There's a client willing to sponsor us. Join me tonight to negotiate the terms."

Evelyn flipped through the contract, her lips curling into a smirk. "Fine. I'll go."

"See you then." Vivian turned away, her eyes glinting with something cold.

Evelyn studied the contract more closely, her brow lifting. She was curious about the kind of client Vivian had chosen.

At Blackgold Group’s headquarters, Nathan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, his dark gaze fixed on the city below. He twisted the black ring on his finger absently.

Oliver stepped into the office. "Mr. Goldmann, the background check on Miss Evelyn Vanderbilt came up empty. It’s as if someone deliberately erased her records."

Nathan turned slightly. "A data lock?"

Oliver nodded. "Exactly. Only a handful at Luxe know that Zara, the famous designer, is actually Evelyn Vanderbilt. They confirmed it after seeing her photos."

He hesitated. "But... we still couldn’t verify if she gave birth in Stoslo. No hospital records matched."

Nathan said nothing.

The children bore the Vanderbilt name. And the only Vanderbilt he had ever been with was Vivian.

Oliver cleared his throat. "You seem... unusually interested in Miss Evelyn."

Nathan’s gaze sharpened. "Are you looking for a transfer to the Arctic?"

Oliver paled. "N-No, sir. I’ll get back to work."

He had no desire to join his brother, Harrison, counting polar bears in the tundra.

That night, at a high-end karaoke lounge—

Evelyn followed Vivian into a private suite. Victor Baldwin rose when he saw them, his eyes lighting up. "Ah, you’ve arrived!"

Vivian smiled sweetly. "Mr. Baldwin, this is my sister, Evelyn. Traffic was terrible—I hope we didn’t keep you waiting."

She settled beside him, while Victor’s gaze raked over Evelyn.

Six years had only made her more breathtaking.

That figure. That face. She was perfection.

Hunger coiled in his gut.

Vivian clenched her teeth as Victor ogled Evelyn like a starving man at a feast.

Evelyn was a walking temptation.

"Miss Vanderbilt," Victor extended his hand, grinning. "We’ve met before. I’m an old friend of your father’s."

Evelyn shook his hand briefly, her touch cool. "Pleasure."

Victor didn’t let go.

She yanked her hand free and took a seat across from him. "So. You’re interested in sponsoring Viana Jewelry?"
###Chapter 25

Victor's lips curled into a smirk as he nodded approvingly. "Exactly right. When I heard Miss Vanderbilt had rejoined Viana Jewelry, I immediately saw an opportunity to collaborate with you personally."

Vivian barely concealed her contempt. At forty-nine, Victor Baldwin was practically fifty, yet his illegitimate son with his ex-wife had just turned eighteen. The man was notorious for his wandering eye and countless affairs, which ultimately drove his wife to file for divorce.

She remembered how Victor had first laid eyes on Evelyn at Richard's birthday gala years ago. Since that night, he'd been obsessed, frequently asking Vivian about her stepsister. That's why Vivian had drugged Evelyn last time - to give the lecherous businessman his chance. Pity he'd wasted it.

"Because of me?" Evelyn let out a melodic laugh. "Mr. Baldwin, I'm truly flattered."

"Zoe, Mr. Baldwin greatly admires your talent," Vivian interjected smoothly, pouring the older man a generous glass of wine. "As Viana's director, I'd like to toast your generous advertising platform and investment in our company."

"Now that's what I call a proper toast!" Victor grinned, downing the entire glass in one gulp.

Vivian turned to Evelyn with feigned concern. "Zoe, I know you don't drink, so I ordered juice for you." She held up two glasses, deliberately offering the one in her right hand.

Victor had prepared the drinks himself, instructing Vivian that the left glass was "clean." Evelyn accepted the offered glass, raising it to her lips. Just as the liquid was about to touch her mouth, she suddenly gagged violently.

Both Victor and Vivian froze at her unexpected reaction.

Evelyn patted her chest, lowering the glass with an apologetic smile. "Forgive me, I haven't eaten all day. My stomach's protesting. Could we order some appetizers first?"

Victor blinked before nodding understandingly. "Of course. Vivian, call the waiter."

Biting back irritation at being ordered around, Vivian obediently went to summon service.

Evelyn turned her dazzling smile on Victor. "Mr. Baldwin, would you pick a song for me? How about 'Sweet Dreams'?"

"Your wish is my command," he chuckled.

After all, the little lamb had already walked into the lion's den. Where could she possibly run? As Victor moved toward the karaoke machine, Evelyn swiftly switched her glass with Vivian's.

Vivian returned just as Evelyn finished the switch.

Seeing Evelyn sip the juice, Vivian's eyes gleamed with triumph.

"Zoe, I've ordered food. Maybe save the juice for after you eat? Cold drinks on an empty stomach aren't good for you." Evelyn smiled sweetly and set her glass down. "Of course."

Thirty minutes later, their glasses stood empty amidst half-finished plates.

Suddenly, Evelyn's phone rang. She stood gracefully. "Excuse me, I need to take this outside. I'll be right back."

As Evelyn exited, Vivian moved to follow, but Victor yanked her back down.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"We can't let her escape!"

Victor's grip tightened. "She drank the juice. Where could she go? And even if she does leave..." His eyes raked over Vivian's body with a predatory grin. "I'll still have you, won't I?"

Vivian paled as the realization hit her. "What... what do you mean?"

"You think I'm stupid?" Victor sneered. "I spiked both drinks. If she gets away, you'll make an excellent consolation prize." He dragged her onto his lap.

Vivian struggled violently. "Have you lost your mind? I'm with Nathan Goldmann!"

Victor laughed cruelly. "Goldmann would never marry a bastard like you. Besides..." His hands wandered familiarly. "This isn't our first time, is it? When you came begging for money last year, you were quite... accommodating."
###Chapter 26

Victor Baldwin had no intention of letting either Vanderbilt sister escape tonight. He could simply wait for the other one to return, then have his way with both of them!

Vivian struggled briefly before the fast-acting drug took effect. Her limbs went slack, her body collapsing against him like a ragdoll. Victor smirked as he pinned her against the tiled wall. "That's it, baby. Come to daddy." Right there in the dingy club restroom...

Meanwhile, Evelyn knelt before the toilet, fingers clawing at her throat as she forced herself to vomit up every last drop of the spiked juice. She gasped for air, using the grimy walls to pull herself upright.

"Damn it!" Her voice was hoarse. "Both drinks were drugged!"

Not only was Victor after her - he'd targeted Vivian too.

The irony wasn't lost on Evelyn. Vivian had tried to set her up. But Evelyn wasn't about to play the victim. Let Vivian experience the consequences of her own scheming.

Splashing cold water on her face, Evelyn stumbled out of the nightclub. The neon lights blurred as she waved desperately at passing cabs. None stopped.

Her vision swam. The world tilted.

She collapsed onto the pavement, knees scraping concrete.

Nathan Goldmann's car slowed as Oliver pointed. "Sir, isn't that Miss Vanderbilt?"

Nathan's eyes darkened. "Pull over."

The moment his polished Oxfords hit the curb, Nathan stalked toward the crumpled figure. Had this reckless woman gotten herself drunk?

Hearing footsteps, Evelyn lifted her head. Her glassy eyes locked onto his.

The flush across her cheeks, the way her lips parted slightly - it was unexpectedly alluring. Nathan's throat tightened as he hauled her upright. "What the hell are you doing passed out on the street?"

Any predator would see her as easy prey.

Evelyn shook her head violently, shoving at his chest. "Don't... touch me..."

She turned to leave but stumbled. Nathan caught her effortlessly, her body molding against his in a way that made his muscles tense. When Vivian had thrown herself at him days prior, it hadn't sparked this visceral reaction.

He was losing control.

Nathan set her upright, gripping her shoulders. "Miss Vanderbilt, do you think—"

His words died as he noticed the blood dripping from her chewed fingertips. "Have you lost your mind?" he growled, capturing her wrists.

"Please..." Her voice was barely a whisper, stripped of its usual defiance. "Hospital..."

The raw plea cut through him. Something was very wrong.

Nathan swept her into his arms, barking at Oliver, "Drive. Now."

At the hospital...

The nurse adjusted Evelyn's IV before eyeing the two men. She zeroed in on Oliver. "Are you the boyfriend?"

Oliver's eyes bulged. "I—what?"

The nurse scanned the chart disapprovingly. "These performance-enhancing drugs require consent. I understand wanting to spice things up, but they're dangerous."

Oliver's face burned crimson. "No, I've never even—"

The nurse walked off, leaving Oliver sputtering. He turned helplessly to Nathan. "Sir, I—"

"Wait outside."

Once alone, Nathan studied Evelyn's unconscious form. He'd never properly looked at her before - not when every encounter involved claws and fangs.

The steady beep of the monitor filled the silence as he traced the delicate arch of her brows, the stubborn set of her jaw even in sleep. Who was this woman beneath the armor?
###Chapter 27

Nathan had never seen Evelyn look so peaceful in sleep before.

His gaze lingered on the crescent-shaped nail marks indenting her palms. Had she really clawed at her own skin to stay conscious after being drugged? How had someone as sharp as her fallen into such a trap?

If he hadn't found her tonight... if she hadn't managed to escape... His jaw tightened at the possibilities.

Evelyn's brows suddenly furrowed, her body tensing as tremors ran through her. A nightmare.

"No!" Her scream startled him. "Evelyn?" Nathan leaned closer.

In her dream, Evelyn relived that horrific night six years ago - but this time, the faceless man from her memories had Nathan's voice...

Her eyes flew open to find Nathan's face inches from hers. Instinct took over. "Ahhh!"

"Mr. Goldmann, is everything—" Oliver burst through the door only to freeze at the sight of the bright red handprint blooming across Nathan's cheek. He executed a perfect about-face. "I saw nothing!"

The door clicked shut with finality.

Evelyn blinked up at the storm clouds gathering in Nathan's expression. "Haha... you startled me! I thought you were some creep trying to—"

Nathan touched his throbbing cheek. "This is my thanks for rescuing you?"

"That was pure reflex!" Evelyn protested, then tilted her chin up defiantly. "Want to slap me back? Even steven?"

Nathan decided he preferred her unconscious.

"What were you doing at that karaoke bar?" he demanded.

Evelyn's smile turned saccharine. "Would you believe me if I said charity work?"

She flopped back onto the pillows with a dismissive wave. "I'm going back to sleep. You can see yourself out."

Nathan's fingers twitched with the urge to throttle her.

He'd carried her to safety, waited at her bedside, and this was the gratitude he received?

Storming out, he nearly collided with Oliver, who was studiously examining the ceiling. "Take her home when she wakes," Nathan bit out.

Oliver's mouth opened and closed like a fish.

Meanwhile, Vivian staggered from the karaoke bar's back entrance, her dress torn, her makeup smeared. "Evelyn, you bitch!" she hissed. If Evelyn hadn't escaped, Vivian wouldn't have ended up in Victor Baldwin's groping hands!

This wasn't over.

When Evelyn awoke again at 10 PM, she found Oliver perched stiffly on a hallway chair. "You're still here?"

Oliver rose with the enthusiasm of a condemned man. "Mr. Goldmann insisted I drive you home."

He braced for gushing gratitude—after all, Nathan Goldmann didn't arrange transportation for just anyone.

"Alright then. Let's go." Evelyn breezed past him as if he were a taxi hailed on the street.

Oliver sighed. Just another day in the life of Nathan Goldmann's long-suffering assistant.

The drive passed in silence until they reached an all-too-familiar gated community. Oliver's eyebrows climbed as Evelyn tossed two crumpled bills onto the seat. "For your trouble."

He picked up the mangled currency—barely enough for a coffee. "This is a Bentley!" he sputtered to the empty car. "And I'm not Uber!"

His eyes widened further at the security guard's greeting. "Miss Vanderbilt! Welcome back to Seaview Villas."

Wait—Evelyn Vanderbilt lived here too?
###Chapter 28

The conference room at Viana Jewelry headquarters was thick with tension the next morning.

For the executives present, the meeting felt like thirty minutes of pure torture.

The source of their discomfort sat at the head of the table, radiating a dark, oppressive aura.

Nathan Goldmann’s mind wasn’t on the discussion at all.

Instead, it was consumed by thoughts of a certain infuriating woman from the night before.

A woman who had haunted his dreams, leaving him restless and agitated.

He clenched his jaw. He must be losing his mind.

When the meeting finally ended, Nathan stormed back to his office, his mood blacker than ever.

Oliver Lawson followed, carrying a stack of documents. "Mr. Goldmann, the meeting ran longer than expected."

Nathan dropped into his chair with a scowl. "We’re going swimming tonight."

Oliver paused mid-step. "Swimming? Why?"

Nathan’s expression didn’t change. "To cool off."

Oliver blinked. "Ah."

Then, hesitantly, he added, "By the way, sir, when I escorted Miss Vanderbilt home last night—"

"Don’t mention her." Nathan cut him off sharply.

Oliver wisely shut his mouth. Clearly, this wasn’t the time.

"If you’re set on swimming, I’ll cancel your RSVP for Mr. Boucher’s birthday party. Though your father was quite insistent you attend."

Nathan’s glare silenced him.

Oliver sighed. He was just the messenger.

Meanwhile, at Viana Jewelry, Evelyn Vanderbilt strode down the hallway when she overheard two employees whispering.

"Have you seen Director Vanderbilt today? She’s a walking storm cloud. Nothing pleases her, and yet she’s barely competent herself."

"Too bad she’s a Vanderbilt. We just have to deal with it."

Evelyn stopped dead in her tracks.

Then, with a cold smile, she turned and marched straight to Vivian’s office.

"I said leave me alone!" Vivian hurled a folder toward the door without looking.

It landed at Evelyn’s feet.

Evelyn picked it up, her lips curving into a smirk. "It’s barely morning. What’s got you so worked up?"

Vivian’s head snapped up. "Evelyn."

The events of last night flashed through her mind, and rage surged through her.

She lunged forward, hand raised to strike.

Evelyn caught her wrist effortlessly. "Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Weren’t you the one who tried to set me up last night?"

She wasn’t falling for the same trick twice.

Only a fool would.

"I—I don’t know what you’re talking about," Vivian stammered, too exhausted to argue.

"Then why are you so angry?" Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Unless… you weren’t the only one drugged?"

Vivian paled.

She couldn’t let Evelyn find out what had happened between her and Victor Baldwin last night!

She yanked her hand back. "Do you really think Mr. Baldwin will just let you go? Once he sets his sights on something, he doesn’t stop until he gets it!"

Evelyn’s smirk deepened. "Good. Those who set their sights on me tend to regret it."

Vivian’s face drained of color.

Why was this woman so impossible to deal with?

"Oh, right." Evelyn pulled out a document. "I’m rehiring an old staff member. Sign this."

Vivian didn’t even glance at it. "Over my dead body."

Evelyn shrugged. "Fine. I’ll just ask Nathan."

Vivian snatched the papers and signed immediately, not bothering to read them.

In that moment, she looked exactly like Evelyn had when she’d been forced to sign her own documents days before.
###Chapter 29

Evelyn stepped out of Vivian's office, closing the door firmly behind her.

The signed document in her hand made her lips curl in satisfaction. Dealing with fools was becoming tiresomely predictable.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Sophia.

She waited until reaching the stairwell before answering. "Soph?"

"Zoe! You absolutely must come with me to Uncle Felix's birthday gala tonight!" Sophia's excited voice crackled through the speaker. "I may have told Daddy I'd bring the legendary designer Zara. He's been dying to meet you for ages!"

Evelyn hesitated. "But I don't even know the Bouchers..."

"That's what I'm here for!" Sophia chirped. "Now that you're back in Cornelia, you need to expand your social circle. Who knows? You might find your perfect match tonight!"

"A mother of three doesn't have perfect matches," Evelyn sighed.

"Don't be ridiculous! Please say you'll come?" Sophia wheedled.

As always, Evelyn found herself unable to refuse her best friend's persistent requests.

The Regal Ballroom glittered with opulence for Felix Boucher's birthday celebration. The Bouchers represented true aristocracy in Cornelia's high society - their political influence making even the powerful Goldmann family tread carefully around them. While the Goldmanns dominated commerce, the Bouchers ruled the political arena, creating a delicate balance between the two dynasties.

Everyone knew the Bouchers had two sons. The eldest, Adrian Boucher, was Zlokova's reigning box office king - an A-list actor with multiple international awards, a platinum-selling recording artist, and major shareholder in Royal Crown Entertainment.

This was clearly no ordinary social gathering. "Hurry up, Zoe!" Sophia called from the grand staircase, impatiently waving Evelyn forward. When Evelyn finally emerged from the car, Sophia's jaw dropped.

Evelyn's midnight blue gown shimmered with golden embroidery, the plunging neckline and fitted bodice accentuating her graceful silhouette. The skirt flared dramatically, its intricate gold-threaded patterns catching the light like constellations. Diamond floral earrings swayed with her movements, complementing the celestial theme. With her artfully applied makeup, she resembled a goddess stepped straight from a Renaissance painting.

"Close your mouth before you catch flies," Evelyn teased, tapping Sophia's chin with her clutch.

Sophia pretended to swoon against her shoulder. "Why wasn't I born male? It's criminal that some lucky bastard gets to marry you someday."

Evelyn laughed, looping her arm through Sophia's. "Gender reassignment surgery exists, you know. Your father might actually prefer having a son."

Sophia stuck out her tongue and pulled Evelyn toward the entrance. Heads turned as they passed - men staring in open admiration, women with barely concealed envy. Evelyn moved through the crowd like a beam of moonlight, impossible to ignore amidst the sea of socialites.

"Told you bringing you would make an impact," Sophia whispered smugly. Compared to Evelyn's effortless elegance, Vivian might as well have been invisible.

"These aren't your average social climbers," Evelyn observed, taking in the distinguished guests.

"Obviously! Only the crème de la crème receive Boucher invitations. The Vanderbilts wouldn't normally make the cut." Sophia paused, then amended, "Well, except you. You're here as Zara - the royal court's favorite designer from Stoslo. That trumps any family name."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Last I checked, Vanderbilt was still my surname."

"You're different," Sophia insisted. "You earned your place here."
###Chapter 30

Two figures loomed at the top of the grand staircase.

The man in the navy blue suit leaned casually against the railing, swirling his wine glass with practiced elegance. His piercing gaze locked onto a mesmerizing figure moving through the crowd below. Turning to Nathan, he checked his platinum wristwatch with raised eyebrows. The CEO hadn't looked away from the woman in twelve minutes.

"That's quite the vision down there," Adrian Boucher remarked.

Nathan gave a noncommittal hum.

He'd noticed Evelyn Vanderbilt the moment she entered. Every step she took sent ripples through the room, drawing hungry stares from every man present. She didn't need to try - her mere existence commanded attention.

Adrian's lips quirked in amusement. "I don't think I've ever heard you acknowledge a woman's beauty before."

In all their years of acquaintance, Nathan had never openly admired any woman. Not even Vivian, who clung to his side at every opportunity.

Nathan finally broke his gaze. He drained his wine in one smooth motion before setting the crystal glass down with deliberate precision. Without a word, he descended the staircase.

Adrian's smirk deepened as he observed the scene below. Evelyn's laughter sparkled through the crowd, her dewy eyes catching the light. No wonder Nathan couldn't resist.

"Father, allow me to introduce the renowned Zara," Sophia Hill announced proudly.

William Hill raised his glass in greeting. "The famous jewelry designer from Stoslo. My daughter's told me so much about you. Though her descriptions hardly do you justice."

Evelyn inclined her head gracefully. "You flatter me, Mr. Hill."

Sophia beamed until she spotted the approaching figure behind Evelyn. Her smile froze.

William raised his glass politely. "Mr. Goldmann."

Evelyn spun around so fast she nearly spilled her champagne. 'For heaven's sake! This man is like a specter haunting my every move!'

Nathan barely glanced at her before clinking glasses with William. His gaze flicked to Sophia as he took a measured sip. "And this is...?"

"My daughter, Sophia Hill," William introduced.

Sophia's cheeks flushed crimson. 'Oh no no no...'

"Ah, Miss Hill." Nathan's lips curved in a knowing smile. "We met recently at the police station, if I recall."

William's head snapped toward his daughter. "What trouble have you gotten into now?"

Sophia ducked behind Evelyn with a pout. "It wasn't my fault! Just a misunderstanding!"

Evelyn shot Nathan a warning look before turning back to William with a practiced smile. "Mr. Hill, Sophia was only at the station because of me. I had a minor accident involving Mr. Goldmann's car. She came to assist me."

William looked visibly relieved.

Nathan studied Evelyn with newfound interest. Willing to take the blame to protect a friend. Fascinating.

"What a lively gathering." A smooth voice cut through the conversation.

Adrian Boucher approached with effortless grace. The navy suit hugged his athletic frame perfectly, complementing his sculpted features. He moved with the innate confidence of someone accustomed to admiration - a modern-day Apollo stepping out of mythology.

Evelyn recognized him immediately. The award-winning actor and musician only appeared in selective projects. She'd seen him portray countless characters on screen, but never in the flesh.

Adrian - named after the sun god himself. The comparison was apt. He carried himself like someone who'd never known darkness.
###Chapter 31

"Adrian!" Sophia waved enthusiastically at the famous actor.

Evelyn wasn't surprised. She knew Sophia's aunt was married to Mr. Boucher, making her Adrian's mother.

"Long time no see, Sophia. Is this your friend?" Sophia linked arms with Evelyn proudly. "My best friend!"

"Why are you here?" Nathan's gaze darkened as he stared at Adrian.

Adrian flashed his signature charming smile. "I came to meet this lovely lady." His eyes lingered on Evelyn.

Evelyn's breath caught. Did the most sought-after actor in Bassburgh just say he wanted to meet her?

Nathan remained silent, but the temperature around them seemed to drop several degrees.

Ignoring Nathan completely, Adrian stepped forward with princely grace and extended his hand. "May I have this dance?"

Sophia's eyes sparkled with excitement. Her idol had impeccable taste!

Evelyn hesitated, acutely aware of the dagger-like stares from every socialite in the room. Accepting this dance invitation would make her public enemy number one.

Sophia gave her an enthusiastic push from behind, practically shoving Evelyn into Adrian's arms.

Adrian caught Sophia's eye and winked approvingly.

Evelyn shot her traitorous best friend a glare over her shoulder. Some wingwoman she was!

As Adrian took Evelyn's hand, another strong grip closed around her other wrist. She turned in shock to find Nathan holding her captive.

Sophia's expression turned positively gleeful, as if she wished she had popcorn for this showdown. The surrounding guests erupted in hushed whispers.

Evelyn Vanderbilt, who moments ago had been invisible, suddenly became the center of attention with Bassburgh's two most powerful men vying for her.

Adrian smirked. "Mr. Goldmann, surely you're not trying to steal my dance partner?"

Nathan's voice remained icy calm. "I don't believe this is an appropriate situation."

"I think it's perfectly appropriate," Adrian countered, his smile never wavering.

"Who will you choose?" Both men demanded simultaneously, their gazes locked in a silent battle.

Trapped between the most famous actor in the country and the man who'd given her a $150 million contract, Evelyn felt sweat bead on her neck. Offending either would be disastrous.

Remembering Nathan's complicated history with Vivian, and considering this was the Boucher family's event, Evelyn made her choice.

She gently pulled her hand from Nathan's grasp. "My apologies, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan's eyes turned arctic as he watched Adrian lead Evelyn onto the dance floor.

He must have been out of his mind to make such a public scene over her.

The orchestra began a waltz. Under the glittering chandeliers, Adrian and Evelyn moved gracefully together, the picture of elegance.

Adrian scanned the room before leaning closer. "You know Mr. Goldmann?"

Evelyn kept her expression neutral. "Professionally. He offered $150 million for me to join Viana Jewelry."

"There's something more there," Adrian murmured with an actor's perceptiveness. "The way he looks at you..."

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "Your imagination is as impressive as your acting skills."

Adrian chuckled. "Ms. Zara, you're delightfully sharp."

"Thank you," Evelyn replied with practiced politeness.

Across the ballroom, Nathan's stormy gaze followed their every move, his jaw clenched so tightly it ached.

"Look at that beauty dancing with Mr. Boucher," a nearby man whispered too loudly. "I'd pay a fortune for one night with a woman like that."
###Chapter 32

The crowd of men couldn't take their eyes off Evelyn's hourglass figure.

It was human nature - men always noticed a woman's body first before her face. And who could resist such perfect curves paired with that angelic face?

But the moment that thought crossed his mind, the man shivered violently. An icy gaze had locked onto him - coming directly from where Nathan Goldmann stood!

As the music faded, thunderous applause erupted through the ballroom.

Evelyn hurried through the crowd searching for Sophia when suddenly - strong fingers wrapped around her wrist. She spun around to find herself face-to-face with Nathan.

"You-"

Before she could speak, his tailored jacket descended over her shoulders like a sudden storm.

Evelyn pulled it off with a frown. "What's this supposed to mean?"

"Wear it." Nathan's voice held that familiar commanding edge.

She arched an eyebrow. "This is how the dress is designed. Why would I-"

In one fluid motion, Nathan backed her against the velvet curtains, caging her between his arms. His breath ghosted over her lips as he growled, "Who exactly are you trying to tempt dressed like this?"

Did this woman have any idea how many predators were circling her tonight?

Evelyn pressed a finger against his rock-hard shoulder. "Mr. Goldmann, half the women here are wearing backless gowns. Why don't you go police their wardrobes instead of harassing me?"

Since when did men get voting rights on women's fashion choices? This was practically modest compared to some dresses tonight!

"Stop arguing. Keep it on." His jaw clenched audibly.

"I don't-"

Nathan leaned in until their lips nearly brushed. "Shall I dress you myself then?"

Evelyn's breath hitched, her lashes fluttering wildly. The man radiated heat like a furnace, turning their hidden alcove into a sauna.

Watching her bite that plump lower lip, Nathan's throat worked violently.

Her palms grew damp. This infuriating man was standing far too close. Was he actually going to-

Snatching the jacket, she hastily wrapped it around herself and shoved him away. "I'll wear the damn thing. No need to invade my personal space."

She glared up at him. "Wouldn't want people getting the wrong idea." With that, she spun on her heel and disappeared into the crowd.

Nathan's lips thinned into a dangerous line, his dark eyes smoldering.

He'd been seconds away from claiming that insolent mouth.

This woman was pure poison - intoxicating and lethal.

Evelyn stormed through the ballroom, Nathan's oversized jacket swallowing her frame.

Sophia materialized beside her with a wolfish grin. "Well well, isn't that Mr. Goldmann's jacket?"

'Zoe wearing Nathan's clothes? Oh this is getting juicy!'

Evelyn flicked her friend's forehead. "Wipe that smirk off your face!"

"Darling, you're the undisputed queen of tonight! Torn between Bassburgh's two most powerful bachelors? This is straight out of a romance novel!" Sophia sighed dramatically.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Get your head out of the clouds."

"I wonder what my future godchildren will look like-"

Sophia suddenly froze, her expression shifting to shock. "Zoe... I just realized something terrifying. Caleb and Liam... they look exactly like Nathan Goldmann!"

Her voice dropped to a horrified whisper. "Could he be... the man from that night six years ago?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She'd noticed the resemblance immediately when she first saw Nathan. The same sharp jawline, those piercing eyes.

But the real gut punch? His cologne. That exact same intoxicating scent from that unforgettable night.
###Chapter 33

If he truly was the man from six years ago…

Evelyn’s gaze turned icy. Vivian had orchestrated everything that night—the night she had been ruined. She had even brought in that man. But if Nathan was the one Vivian had hired to destroy her, he would have known who she was.

Besides, Evelyn refused to believe Vivian would send a man like him to her bed. A man like Nathan Goldmann? Vivian would have kept him for herself.

Sophia nudged her. "Zoe, don’t you think so?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Even if it was him, do you really think a man Vivian used would be worthy of being my children’s father?"

Sophia blinked, speechless. Only Evelyn would dare to imply that Nathan Goldmann wasn’t good enough.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed.

Seeing Caleb’s name, she excused herself and stepped into the hallway. "Caleb?"

"Mommy, Liam asked if we should save you some dinner in case you get hungry after the party."

A warmth spread through her chest. "I’m on my way home. Wait for me."

She turned—and froze.

Nathan stood behind her, his expression unreadable. How long had he been there? Had he heard?

"Your boyfriend calling you home already?" His voice was cool.

Evelyn shrugged. "Can’t blame him for worrying."

She remembered his jacket and quickly shrugged it off, handing it back. "Thanks for this."

Nathan didn’t take it. Instead, he said, "I’ll drive you."

He wanted to see this man for himself.

Evelyn’s lips parted in surprise. "Excuse me?"

"Is there a problem?"

"No, but I wouldn’t want to trouble you. The person waiting for me might get jealous." She shoved the jacket into his arms and turned to leave.

Nathan blocked her path. "You don’t want to trouble me, or you don’t want me to see who’s waiting?"

Evelyn smirked. "Mr. Goldmann, I’m flattered by your sudden concern."

"Concern?" His eyes darkened. "Don’t flatter yourself."

As if he’d ever be concerned about her.

Evelyn stepped closer, tilting her head. "No? You have a girlfriend, yet you’re insisting on driving another woman home. People might get the wrong idea."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but before he could respond, Adrian appeared, smiling. "Leaving so soon?"

Evelyn nodded. "Someone’s waiting for me."

Adrian’s smile was warm. "Let me arrange a car for you. It’s not safe for a woman to go alone at night."

She opened her mouth to accept—but Nathan cut in. "I’ll take her."

Without waiting for a response, he gripped Evelyn’s wrist and pulled her toward the exit.

Adrian watched them go, his lips curving in amusement.

Nathan’s behavior toward Evelyn was… unexpected.

Outside, Evelyn yanked her arm free. "Mr. Goldmann, what part of no don’t you understand?"
###Chapter 34

What on earth was wrong with this man?

Nathan swung the car door open with an impatient gesture. "We're not discussing this. Get in." His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn let out an incredulous laugh. She'd encountered unreasonable women before, but never a man who behaved like this!

With a resigned sigh, she climbed into the passenger seat, her expression carefully neutral.

When Nathan demanded her address, Evelyn hesitated momentarily before responding. "Just drop me at the intersection of Oceana Drive." There was no way she'd let him see where she actually lived.

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. "Oceana Drive? That's the beach villa district, isn't it?"

The car rolled to a stop at the designated intersection. Evelyn offered a curt "thanks" before swiftly exiting the vehicle.

Nathan didn't drive away immediately. His gaze followed her retreating figure toward the exclusive beachfront properties. That was definitely the gated villa community.

Evelyn walked purposefully through the villa gates, maintaining her pace even when passing what appeared to be her own residence without stopping.

From his vantage point outside the security perimeter, Nathan watched her silhouette disappear deeper into the compound, his expression growing tense.

Perhaps he'd been overthinking things. The coincidence seemed too unlikely - her living in the same neighborhood as those two remarkable children.

Only after Nathan's car had disappeared down the coastal road did Evelyn emerge from behind a decorative garden wall.

Had he seriously been trying to track where she lived?

"Mommy's home," Evelyn announced softly as she entered the villa.

Caleb immediately raised a finger to his lips, gesturing toward the couch where Daisy lay sleeping. "Shhh, Daisy just fell asleep."

Evelyn carefully lifted her sleeping daughter and carried her to bed. After tucking her in, she returned to find Liam placing a steaming bowl of soup on the dining table.

"Good job, big brother," she said with an appreciative smile.

Caleb clambered onto a chair, resting his chin in his hands. "Mommy, was Godmother's party fun?"

Liam rolled his eyes dramatically. "What's fun about those stuffy parties? Just a bunch of rich people sucking up to each other."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "Where did you hear language like that?"

"It's what they always say on TV," Liam replied matter-of-factly.

"Maybe you're watching too much TV," Evelyn sighed, realizing she needed to monitor their viewing habits more closely.

Caleb pouted. "But Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig are so babyish!"

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. What could she say? These were the children she'd raised.

"Oh! Mommy!" Caleb suddenly remembered, bouncing in his seat. "Liam and Daisy are going to debut!"

Evelyn's spoon clattered against the bowl as she turned to Liam in shock. "You're debuting with your sister?"

"Don't worry, Mommy," Liam said with surprising maturity. "We can help earn money for the family. With school starting soon, we can pay our own tuition."

Evelyn set down her spoon with deliberate care. "Do you think I can't provide for you?"

Both boys shook their heads vigorously.

"Exactly. We don't need that kind of money!"

"Mommy," Caleb began counting on his fingers, "the villa cost $600,000. Liam and Daisy's elite school is $150,000 per year. Then there's music lessons..."

Liam picked up the thread. "Plus daily expenses, the car, your handbags, clothes, makeup - that's hundreds of thousands more."

Caleb ran out of fingers and looked up helplessly.

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it again.

Caleb tilted his head and stated bluntly, "Mommy, you're broke!"

Evelyn clutched her chest dramatically as if struck. Forcing a smile through the pain, she managed, "It's fine. I still have $150,000,000 left."
###Chapter 35

"$150,000,000 isn't enough for you to waste."

Evelyn stood frozen, speechless.

Caleb lowered his head, his small shoulders slumping. "We know how hard you work to provide for us. You don't have anyone to take care of you, so we wanted to help."

Liam nodded in agreement.

Seeing them act so grown-up at such a tender age twisted Evelyn's heart. She had poured everything into giving them the best life possible—even without a father, she refused to let them feel lesser than anyone.

Her children were wise beyond their years. Normally, that comforted her. But sometimes, she wished they'd lean on her more. It would make her feel needed.

She exhaled softly, forcing a smile. "I appreciate your intentions, but the entertainment industry is dangerous. Let's revisit this when you're older. Right now, it's no place for children."

That world was ruthless. Without protection, someone could easily exploit them.

"Time for bed," she said, ruffling their hair. "Growing kids need their rest."

Once in their rooms, Caleb and Liam huddled under the covers, whispering.

"Mom said no," Caleb murmured.

Liam tapped his chin, mimicking an adult's thoughtful pose. "She's worried we'll get taken advantage of. Without connections, we'd be vulnerable."

Caleb's eyes sparkled with sudden inspiration. "What if we befriend the biggest name in the industry?"

"You mean Adrian Boucher?"

"Exactly!" Caleb grinned. "But we'll need Aunt Sophia's help."

They might not know their father's identity yet, but they could certainly adopt a godfather just as impressive. In Zlokova, Adrian was that man.

Connections were everything. With the right allies, they could soar.

◆◆◆

At Viana Jewelry...

A blond man in his forties strode through the lobby, his gray trench coat flaring behind him. Despite his age, his commanding presence turned heads.

He headed straight for the floor housing designer Zara's office.

When he entered, Evelyn swiveled her chair around and stood, smiling. "Uncle Gregory."

Gregory removed his sunglasses, surprise flickering across his face. "Zoe?"

"That's me." She nodded.

He stepped closer, studying her with warmth. "It's been years. You look more like your mother every day."

Over coffee, Evelyn updated him on Viana's situation. His expression darkened. "Viana was your mother's legacy. I've overseen it since her passing. I never imagined your father would hand it to someone like Vivian—a woman who knows nothing about jewelry."

He sipped his coffee, scowling. "He asked me to mentor her. I refused. How could Viana thrive under such incompetence?"

"That's why I brought you back." Evelyn's gaze hardened. "Now that I'm here, I'll reclaim Viana—no matter what it takes."
###Chapter 36

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "But your father already transferred the shares to Vivian. It won't be easy to make her surrender them, especially with 'that person' backing her."

'That person' referred to Nathan Goldmann.

A smirk played on Evelyn's lips. "I've been analyzing their relationship since my return. Even if Nathan is protecting Vivian, how long can that possibly last?"

"What do you mean?" Gregory asked, leaning forward.

"Vivian and Nathan have been together for six years, yet he shows no intention of marrying her." Evelyn's fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk. "Though I don't know his reasons, one conclusion is obvious."

Her eyes turned frosty. "He's reluctant to marry her, which means he never will. Vivian's clinging to borrowed time. For someone like Nathan, finding a superior replacement would be effortless." She straightened her posture. "Retrieving Viana Jewelry's shares from Vivian is only a matter of timing."

Gregory recognized the truth in her words but remained cautious. "There's no absolute guarantee. What if Mr. Goldmann does marry her eventually?"

If Vivian became Mrs. Goldmann, her status would become untouchable. Reclaiming the shares would be impossible then.

"The Goldmanns have higher standards than that." Evelyn's laughter held an edge. "To become Mrs. Goldmann, a woman would need to surpass even our Vanderbilt status. Think corporate heiresses or royalty."

Gregory looked perplexed. Mr. Goldmann had never publicly stated such requirements. They weren't selecting a queen, yet Evelyn spoke with the conviction of someone personally vetting candidates.

"Let's focus on immediate priorities." Evelyn's tone shifted. "My timeline involves establishing my own jewelry brand quickly."

Gregory's eyebrows shot up. "You can accomplish that in such a short period?"

She met his gaze with a confident smile. "What if I could convince the Board that this position rightfully belongs to me?"

"The board believes Mr. Goldmann supports Vivian. In their eyes, she's the ideal candidate."

The Board of Directors tolerated Vivian only because Richard had gifted her the shares and Nathan's backing. In any other company, an executive with her incompetence would have been ousted immediately.

"Besides attaching herself to a powerful man, what value does she bring?" Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "Viana continues to hemorrhage money. Would Nathan indefinitely fund losses for a company not his own?"

She leaned back, crossing her legs. "If that's the case, perhaps I should stop working too. Imagine waking up to automatic deposits without lifting a finger."

Gregory chuckled. "Point taken. So what's your strategy?"

Evelyn slid a document across the desk. His eyes widened as he scanned the contents.

"You're pursuing a partnership with Taylor Jewelry?!"

Taylor Jewelry dominated Zlokova's market, surpassing Viana and all competitors. With international reach, it stood alongside Stoslo's Luxe and Majestic as the holy trinity of fashion jewelry. Runway models exclusively wore pieces from these elite brands.

A partnership with Taylor would catapult Viana's reputation in Zlokova overnight. It would be equivalent to having Taylor's prestigious endorsement permanently attached to their name.
###Chapter 37

The advantages for Viana Jewelry were crystal clear.

"Zoe, Taylor Jewelry has extremely high standards. They wouldn't just partner with any jewelry company." Gregory frowned. "Why would they consider working with Viana?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Don't worry about that. I've got a pl—"

Laura Scott strutted into the company headquarters like she owned the place, her designer bag swinging from her elbow. All the employees recognized her as Vivian's mother, addressing her with deferential "Mrs. Chairman" greetings.

Just as she was heading to Vivian's office to inquire about her scheme from the other night, the elevator doors opened to reveal Evelyn deep in conversation with a striking blond man.

Her eyes turned venomous. "How shameless—bringing your latest conquest to the office now?"

Gregory's expression darkened, but Evelyn raised a silencing hand. Her smile was razor-sharp. "I could never compete with your expertise in seduction, Laura."

"How dare you speak to me like that!" Laura's hand flew up.

SMACK!

The sound echoed through the corridor. Evelyn's head snapped to the side, a red mark blooming on her cheek. Before Gregory could intervene, Evelyn's palm connected with Laura's face with equal force, sending the older woman sprawling to the floor.

Laura clutched her stinging cheek in shock.

The burning sensation in Evelyn's palm testified to the strength behind her retaliation. Seeing that angry red mark on Laura's face—just like the one Daisy had borne—filled her with grim satisfaction.

"You—you actually hit me!"

"I don't believe in uneven exchanges." Evelyn's voice was glacial. "You started this. Consider it returned in kind."

As she turned to leave with Gregory, Nathan Goldmann and Vivian appeared down the corridor.

"Mom!" Vivian rushed to help her mother up. "What happened?"

Laura whimpered dramatically about the pain. When Vivian saw the handprint on her mother's face, she whirled on Evelyn. "Zoe! How could you strike my mother? Even if you dislike her, violence is unacceptable!"

"Perhaps check the security footage before making accusations, Ms. Vanderbilt." Evelyn gestured to the cameras mounted above the elevators. Laura paled visibly. Vivian shot her mother a wary look—this wasn't good. Whatever Laura had said must have been caught on camera.

"But—even if Mom said something awful, physical retaliation is inexcusable!"

"So you've already decided I'm at fault without evidence?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Blind loyalty over facts, Vivian?" Her gaze shifted to Nathan's impassive face. "Would Mr. Goldmann like to review the footage?"

Vivian and Laura exchanged panicked glances.

Nathan's eyes darkened as he noticed the lingering mark on Evelyn's cheek. "That won't be necessary." He'd pieced together the situation without needing video confirmation.

Evelyn shrugged and turned to Gregory. "Uncle Gregory, we shouldn't keep our clients waiting."

Gregory nodded.

Vivian blocked their path. "Zoe, which client are you meeting?" Suddenly playing the eager protégé for Nathan's benefit, she simpered, "Why don't I join you? I'd love to learn from your expertise."
###Chapter 38

Evelyn spun around to face her stepsister. "Are you certain about this?"

If she went alone to negotiate with Taylor Jewelry, there might still be a sliver of hope. But if Vivian accompanied her? That hope would vanish entirely.

Vivian flashed a saccharine smile. "I can't let you handle everything while I sit idle."

Evelyn suppressed a scoff. This sudden "eagerness to learn" only surfaced because Vivian wanted to impress Nathan.

"Very well."

"Zoe—" Gregory started to interject, but Evelyn had already thrust the contract into Vivian's hands.

"This contains our partnership proposal for Taylor Jewelry. I appreciate you taking this on."

Nathan's brow furrowed, his lips pressing into a thin line.

Vivian nearly vibrated with excitement. If she could secure this deal, Nathan would finally see her true worth.

This was her golden opportunity, and she wouldn't let Evelyn sabotage it.

As Evelyn walked back to her office alone, a deep voice stopped her. "You knew she'd fail with Taylor Jewelry. Why agree to let her go?"

Evelyn turned to face Nathan, her smile razor-sharp. "You were there too. Heard her volunteer, didn't you? No coercion involved."

Nathan's eyes darkened. He closed the distance between them, gripping her wrist. "Drop the act."

"Feeling protective over such a trivial matter?" Evelyn tried to wrench free but failed. Baring her teeth, she hissed, "Mr. Goldmann, if you're so concerned about her walking into a dead end, why didn't you stop her earlier?"

Silence.

She pressed on. "Since you didn't intervene then, why confront me now?"

Nathan couldn't possibly be ignorant about Taylor Jewelry's reputation. He knew Vivian would be turned away—even if she name-dropped being Nathan's girlfriend.

"What do you truly want?"

Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "Viana Jewelry."

"To reclaim your mother's shares?" Nathan's voice remained eerily calm.

No point pretending. "Yes."

Nathan studied her defiant expression. A dangerous glint entered his eyes. "I can offer you something better."

"What?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. Had she misheard?

He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "Something far more valuable than shares—if you relinquish your claim to Viana."

Evelyn's face hardened. "Nothing interests me except Viana's shares. Not even $150 million."

Nathan chuckled darkly. "Evelyn, be reasonable. Without my approval, those shares remain out of reach."

"So you'll actively block me?" Her voice turned glacial.

He was already shielding Vivian before their sham marriage even began. What would happen after the wedding? Vivian would probably dance on her grave.

"I don't need to lift a finger." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "But if you surrender your claim, I'll gift you a new jewelry company."

Evelyn recoiled. "You want me to hand my mother's legacy to an outsider? Why?"

"Your father already seized everything." Nathan's tone turned clinical. "Legally, Viana belongs to Richard now. Your mother is irrelevant."
###Chapter 39

Evelyn's gaze flickered around the room, her expression gradually settling into something calmer.

Father took all of Mother's shares?

Why?

They were shared equity—Mother's shares. How could he just take them?

She clenched her jaw. "I don't believe you."

Nathan watched as the light in her eyes dimmed, an unexpected pang of concern tightening his chest. He had done his research on the Vanderbilts, digging into every detail of their tangled history.

He hadn’t known that Isabella, Evelyn’s mother, had been the one to co-found Viana Jewelry with Richard. He only started looking into them after Evelyn returned.

Isabella had built Viana alongside Richard, but after her death, all her shares had gone to him—not to Evelyn, her own daughter.

Vivian only had the company because Richard had handed it to her. She lacked Evelyn’s talent, her vision.

Nathan wasn’t entirely selfless in wanting Evelyn out of Viana. Maybe keeping her close would make it easier to uncover the truth.

Evelyn pulled her wrist free, her expression hardening. "Mr. Goldmann, if there’s nothing else, you may leave."

"You’ll come to me." With that, he turned and walked out.

Evelyn strode to her desk, snatched up the phone, and dialed. "Mr. Zachary? It’s Evelyn. I need to know everything about my mother’s will."

Vivian practically floated into Taylor Jewelry, expecting nothing less than red-carpet treatment.

She had no idea who Taylor Jewelry really was in Cornelia, and it showed. "I’m Mr. Goldmann’s girlfriend," she declared, chin high. "Disrespecting me means disrespecting him."

With the Goldmann name behind her, she wasn’t afraid of anyone.

"Mr. Goldmann’s influence?" A sharp, mocking laugh cut through the air. "Does that mean every fool can storm into my office using his name?"

A group of bodyguards parted, revealing an elderly woman in an emerald-green dress, seated in a wheelchair. A priceless rosewood rosary draped over her wrist.

Age hadn’t dulled her presence. Even confined to the chair, she exuded authority.

"You’re just a small jewelry company," Vivian scoffed. "Working with you is a favor."

The old woman’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Which company sent this ignorant girl? Didn’t they teach you to research before wasting my time?"

An employee whispered something in her ear. She waved him off impatiently. "Viana? Never heard of it. Throw her out."

Vivian’s face twisted. "You wouldn’t dare! I’m Nathan Goldmann’s—"

"Then bring Nathan Goldmann here," the woman snapped. "Let’s see if he dares disrespect me. Get her out of my sight!"

Security guards seized Vivian, dragging her out despite her furious protests.

Humiliated, Vivian seethed.

Evelyn had set her up. She must have known this would happen. That was why she sent her instead.

This wasn’t over. She’d make Evelyn pay.

Back at Vanderbilt Manor, Evelyn stormed inside, clutching the documents, barely sparing Laura a glance as she passed through the living room.
###Chapter 40

Evelyn ignored Vivian completely, brushing past her as if she were invisible.

Vivian grabbed her arm. "What do you think you're doing?"

"Move." Evelyn shoved her aside, ignoring the hushed whispers behind her, and strode straight into the study. She snatched the documents from the desk.

Richard froze at her audacity, his expression darkening. "How dare you come back here?"

"Do you think I want to be here?" Evelyn clutched the papers tightly. "I came for answers."

She held up the document. "What happened to my mother's shares?"

Richard stiffened. He hadn't expected this confrontation.

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn pressed on. "My mother co-founded Viana Jewelry with you. So why did her shares become yours when she died?"

"Are you questioning me?" Richard's voice rose sharply.

Outside the door, Laura eavesdropped, intrigued by Evelyn's sudden visit. But when she heard the argument escalate, a smirk curled her lips. Good. The more they fight, the better.

"Give me a real explanation," Evelyn demanded, her tone unyielding.

Richard slammed his hands on the desk. "I am your father!"

"You didn't act like one six years ago." Evelyn's eyes darkened with bitterness. "When you threw me out, did you still consider me your daughter?"

Richard clenched his jaw but said nothing.

"I kept wondering—why would you let an outsider run my mother's company?" Evelyn's voice trembled. "Now I know. You took everything. Her shares. Her properties. You erased her."

Her eyes burned, but she laughed suddenly, the sound hollow. "Looking back, if you'd truly loved her, you wouldn't have had a mistress. Or a bastard child."

SMACK!

Richard's palm struck her cheek with brutal force.

Evelyn's head snapped to the side, her hair disheveled. The red mark on her skin burned brighter than the one Vivian had left.

"If you still respect me as your father, stop this nonsense," Richard hissed.

Evelyn stared at him, searching for any trace of remorse—for her, for her mother. There was none. Only cold indifference.

Her heart shattered.

She nodded slowly, a single tear escaping. Then she smiled, bitter and broken. "I'm no longer a Vanderbilt. I can't change my blood, but I refuse to be part of this family."

"You—"

Evelyn turned and walked out, clutching the documents.

She yanked the door open—only to nearly collide with Laura, who had been lurking outside. Without a word, Evelyn pushed past her.

Laura feigned concern. "Richard, is Zoe alright?"

"Forget her." Richard sank into his chair, his hand curling into a fist.

Evelyn slid into her car, gripping the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white. The tears she'd held back finally spilled over.

She wiped them away angrily, started the engine, and drove away from Vanderbilt Manor—for good.

At a quiet café...

Sophia blinked in surprise as Caleb and Liam sat across from her, their expressions unusually serious. She sipped her coffee, eyeing them warily. "Alright, what do you two want?"

Liam grinned. "Godmother, we need your help."

Sophia raised a brow. "With?"

Caleb leaned forward. "Daisy and I are entering the entertainment industry."

Sophia choked on her coffee. After coughing violently, she gaped at them. "What? You and Daisy?"

Liam nodded eagerly. "Exactly! So we need your expertise!"

Sophia groaned. "Oh, this is going to be a disaster."
###Chapter 41

Liam nodded eagerly. "Royal Crown has scouted us."

Sophia was completely taken aback. "You two are incredibly fortunate!"

Though honestly, just looking at their angelic faces, she'd want to sign them too if she were a talent scout.

Caleb bounced over and plopped down beside her. "Godmother, will you help them?"

"I-I'm not in the entertainment industry. How could I possibly help?" Sophia shifted uncomfortably.

"But your cousin is!"

Sophia's coffee cup trembled in her hand. She forced a smile. "You know about that?"

"Wasn't hard to find out. We definitely did our research on our godmother." Caleb grinned mischievously, his golden curls bouncing.

Sophia let out a dry chuckle. "Zoe really did create some little geniuses."

"Please, Godmother? If anyone bullies you later, we'll protect you too." Caleb tugged at her sleeve with puppy-dog eyes.

That adorable face was Sophia's weakness. "Alright, alright, of course I'll help." She laughed despite herself.

Vivian slammed the signed contract onto Evelyn's desk, her face twisted in fury. "Now I understand why you agreed so readily. This was all a setup to humiliate me, wasn't it?"

"You begged for this opportunity to prove yourself." Evelyn's voice was ice. "I gave you exactly what you wanted, and you failed spectacularly. Now you're blaming me?"

Vivian trembled with rage. "I should have known better than to trust you! Taylor Jewelry? What a joke of a company!"

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "A joke? Taylor controls nearly half of Zlokova's jewelry market. How can you call yourself a Vanderbilt when you don't even know that?"

"Face it, Evelyn." Vivian crossed her arms with a sneer. "You're just jealous Father gave Viana Jewelry to me. I may not be as talented as you, but I have something you'll never have - his love and support."

She leaned in closer, her voice dripping with venom. "What's the point of coming back? I'll crush you at every turn. My advice? Don't cross me, or I'll make sure your life in Viana becomes unbearable."

Evelyn's expression darkened dangerously.

She had once believed reclaiming her mother's legacy was her sole purpose. But now she saw the truth - Viana meant nothing to her anymore.

'Father's coldness toward Mother... all because of Laura and Vivian.'

This woman who destroyed her family now dared threaten her with the very love that had been stolen from her.

Vivian couldn't resist gloating.

Evelyn had underestimated them before. She'd foolishly believed her father would always side with his firstborn.

That overconfidence had been her downfall.

What a pity. The Vanderbilt name held no power over her now. The only people who mattered were her three children. Not even Richard could touch her.
###Chapter 42

Evelyn studied Vivian for a long moment before speaking in an eerily calm voice. "You've always been so unbearably arrogant, Vivian."

She rose gracefully from her seat. "If you want Viana Jewelry so badly, consider it yours now."

Vivian's eyes widened in shock. Did this woman just hand over Viana without a fight?

Finally showing some sense.

"I knew you'd see reason eventually." Vivian let out a mocking laugh. "Should've surrendered sooner."

Evelyn crossed the room with measured steps. "This isn't surrender." She stopped inches from Vivian's face. "Consider this a temporary loan. I'll be taking Viana back when the time comes."

She no longer wanted shares. She intended to acquire the entire company!

"You?" Vivian scoffed.

"Me." Evelyn slapped her resignation letter against Vivian's chest with a cold smile. "Start counting the days until you hand Viana back to me."

Grabbing her bag, Evelyn delivered her final blow. "It's time you learned what real threats feel like, Vivian."

All those times Vivian had used Nathan as leverage?

Well, she was about to accept his proposal after all.

Evelyn walked out of Viana without a backward glance.

Vivian stared at the crumpled letter in her hand, dismissing Evelyn's words as empty threats. With the woman gone from Viana, what could she possibly do?

Nathan would always believe and protect her. Evelyn stood no chance.

At Goldmann Group...

Evelyn sat in the executive waiting area, sunglasses shielding her eyes, legs crossed elegantly. Within minutes, Nathan's assistant Oliver Lawson approached.

"Ms. Vanderbilt," Oliver said politely. "Right this way."

She followed him to the private elevator.

Inside the CEO's office...

Nathan barely glanced up from his documents when they entered. Only after Oliver left did his piercing gaze meet hers.

"I knew you'd come," he said, leaning back in his chair.

Evelyn removed her sunglasses and approached his desk. "I should thank you," she said, resting her palms on the polished surface. "Without your little revelation about the shares, we wouldn't be having this conversation."

"Conversation?" Nathan's eyebrow arched.

Straightening, Evelyn twirled her sunglasses. "Partnership. I'm not just taking your $150 million."

Nathan steepled his fingers. "What do you propose?"

"I'll transform whatever jewelry company you give me into an industry leader within a year," Evelyn stated. "I keep 25% equity, you take all profits, and you stay completely out of my operations."

Their gazes locked in a silent battle. After a tense moment, Nathan nodded. "Agreed."

Evelyn's momentary surprise vanished instantly. "Then I expect you to honor your word."

In one year, she'd have enough to reclaim Viana. He'd better keep his promise.

She signed the contract swiftly and extended it to him. "To a mutually beneficial partnership."

Oliver escorted her to the 16th floor - an entire empty floor with breathtaking city views. Her new office dwarfed the one at Viana.
###Chapter 43

Oliver Lawson stood behind Evelyn, clearing his throat. "Ms. Vanderbilt, shall I arrange the renovations if this design meets your approval?"

Evelyn turned, her golden tassel earrings catching the light. "No need. I've already hired my own team."

Ten days later...

The sixteenth floor transformation was nearly complete. The lobby shimmered in midnight black and antique gold, with delicate crystal sconces casting intricate patterns across the walls.

The VIP lounge boasted vintage furnishings, its walls adorned with asymmetrical golden panels. A grand chandelier in old European style dominated the space, separated by rich plum velvet drapes. Even the restrooms featured exquisite coral accents.

When Oliver and Nathan arrived, they paused at the elevator doors, momentarily disoriented by the dramatic metamorphosis. Workers bustled past carrying ornate furnishings, their footsteps muffled by the plush carpet.

Oliver surveyed the moody color scheme with hesitation. "Isn't it rather... dark?"

Suddenly, overhead lights blazed to life, making him start. Evelyn emerged from the shadows, her plum puff-sleeved gown rustling. "Better?"

Nathan's gaze tracked her movement. The nineteenth-century inspired dress hugged her figure perfectly, accentuated by a silk choker tied at her throat. Her forefinger bore a serpentine gold ring, its emerald eyes glinting. The feathered hat completed the ensemble, giving her an air of aristocratic mystery.

"Your aesthetic is... distinctive," Oliver murmured.

Evelyn's shoulders lifted in an elegant shrug. "Some simply lack vision."

Nathan approached, his polished shoes sinking into the plush carpet. "Going for baroque revival?"

Evelyn's lips curved. The extravagant style had been her signature once - until she'd made it ubiquitous. Now every jeweler copied it, rendering the trend passé.

"Haven't you heard of fusion design?" She plucked a leaf from a nearby pot, its serrated edges catching the light. "Observe this palm leaf - the vein structure, the texture. Imagine recreating this in filigree and tulle, then..." She dipped a finger into a water glass, letting a droplet cling to the leaf's surface. "The water becomes the pearl accent."

Oliver blinked, struggling to follow.

Nathan's mouth quirked. "I'm intrigued to see the execution."

Word of Blackgold Group's new jewelry venture spread through the industry like wildfire. "Why would Nathan Goldmann suddenly enter the jewelry business?" gossiped the fashion elite.

The answer stood on the sixteenth floor, running her fingers along gilded panels, already three steps ahead of everyone else.
###Chapter 44

"Why would you even ask? Don't you know Mr. Goldmann's girlfriend, Ms. Vanderbilt is the creative director of Viana Jewelry? That new company is obviously for her."

"I'm so jealous."

A group of employees were whispering near the water cooler. They'd all heard the rumors about Nathan Goldmann and Evelyn Vanderbilt's relationship, but no one expected them to be true. Why else would ckgold Group suddenly venture into jewelry business?

Vivian approached the reception desk carrying a pastry box. The receptionists immediately fell silent when they saw her, but it was too late. She'd caught every word.

"Is Nathan available?"

"Ms. Vanderbilt, he's in his office," the receptionist answered with forced cheerfulness.

Vivian's lips curved into a knowing smile. "So I heard you were discussing Nathan's new jewelry venture?"

The receptionist hesitated. "Ms. Vanderbilt... didn't Mr. Goldmann mention it to you?"

"He didn't." Her smile tightened imperceptibly.

The younger receptionist quickly added, "Maybe he wanted to surprise you!"

Vivian's frozen expression thawed instantly. "You're probably right. Thank you!"

She practically floated toward the elevators, heart swelling with pride. Nathan had been thinking about her after all.

When Vivian entered Nathan's office without knocking, she found him in deep discussion with Oliver. "Nathan, darling!" she called out brightly.

Nathan's gaze darkened. "Do you make a habit of barging into people's offices unannounced?"

Vivian's cheeks burned. In her excitement, she'd forgotten proper protocol. "I'm sorry, I just—"

"This isn't Viana Jewelry. You'll follow proper procedures here," Nathan said coldly, handing some files to Oliver who quickly excused himself.

Vivian bit her lip. "Of course. It won't happen again."

"What do you want?"

Nathan's icy stare would have sent most people scrambling, but Vivian stood her ground. She knew he treated her differently than others.

"I brought you some pastries." She lifted the box with a hopeful smile. "I know how busy you are, so I thought you might need a pick-me-up."

"Leave it on the desk." Nathan didn't even look up from his documents.

Vivian set down the box carefully, then hesitated. "Nathan... thank you."

This finally made him glance up, eyebrows raised. "For what?"

"For starting that new jewelry company." She clasped her hands together, feigning shyness. "I know I'm not as knowledgeable as Evelyn, but you still went out of your way to support me. It means so much."

Nathan's expression turned glacial. "The new company has nothing to do with you. Focus on managing Viana."

Vivian's face fell. Nothing to do with her?

Her nails dug into her palms as she fought to maintain composure. The humiliation burned worse than any slap.

Nathan returned to his paperwork. "If that's all, I have work to do."

Vivian exited with her head held high, but inside she was seething. Those gossiping receptionists would pay for making her look like a fool.

As she waited for the elevator, two junior designers stepped out, chatting excitedly. "That new lead designer is amazing! She bought coffee for the whole team yesterday." "I know! And her new collection sketches? Absolutely breathtaking!"
###Chapter 45

Vivian froze mid-step when she overheard the conversation. "Wait," she called out sharply.

The two employees turned in surprise. "Can we help you, Ms. Vanderbilt?"

With measured steps, Vivian approached them, her expression darkening. "Who exactly is this jewelry designer you mentioned?"

A cold dread crept up her spine.

"Oh, that's Zara - the international jewelry designer," one employee answered cheerfully.

Vivian's hands clenched into fists. That scheming woman!

Suddenly, Evelyn's parting words made sense. Of course! This explained why she'd abandoned Viana Jewelry so easily. She'd set her sights on Nathan instead!

The audacity!

Blinded by rage, Vivian stormed to the 16th floor where she nearly collided with Oliver emerging from an office.

Oliver blinked in surprise. "Ms. Vanderbilt? What brings you—"

"Move!" Vivian shoved past him and barged into Evelyn's office without knocking.

Oliver hesitated. Should he alert Mr. Goldmann?

Evelyn was sketching a new design when the door flew open. Vivian snatched the paper and tore it to shreds before she could react.

"You conniving witch!" Vivian spat. "I warned you to stay away from Nathan! What game are you playing now?"

Evelyn merely leaned back, crossing her arms with an amused smile. "Mr. Goldmann offered me a jewelry company in exchange for relinquishing my Viana shares. Shouldn't you be celebrating? I'm no longer your competition."

Vivian's breath hitched. Nathan gave her an entire company? Just like that?

No. She wouldn't allow this gold-digger near him.

"Name your price," Vivian hissed. "Take all the Viana shares you want. Just get out of CKGOLD immediately!"

Evelyn's laughter rang hollow. "I've lost interest in your little company."

"You—!" Vivian swept everything off the desk in a rage. "Know your place, Evelyn! Everyone in Bassburgh knows Nathan is mine. How dare you throw yourself at him?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "If you're so confident in your relationship, why confront me? Could it be... you're afraid?" Her smile turned razor-sharp. "How pathetic—always coveting what isn't yours."

"You bitch!" Vivian raised her hand to strike.

Evelyn caught her wrist effortlessly. "Unlike you, some of us don't define our worth by clinging to men. Maybe spend less time throwing tantrums and more time actually earning your position at Viana. Tick-tock."

She released Vivian with a dismissive flick.

Humiliation burned through Vivian as she staggered back. "This isn't over!" she seethed before storming out.

Straight to Nathan's office she went—just as Oliver had predicted.

Oliver had already briefed Nathan about Vivian's visit. When she reappeared, flushed with fury, Nathan didn't need to guess why she'd come.
###Chapter 46

Oliver couldn't quite place it, but something about Vivian rubbed him the wrong way. That frail, clueless woman didn't seem worthy of Mr. Goldmann's attention.

If Evelyn hadn’t been the one from six years ago, would Nathan have even tolerated her presence this long?

"Nathan, Zoe mentioned you gave her a new jewelry company. That can’t be true, can it?"

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "She wasn’t happy at Viana, so she left and transferred the shares to you. Is there a problem with that?"

"I—" Vivian broke into a cold sweat.

Evelyn had been telling the truth? Had Nathan really set up an entirely new company just to make her surrender the shares?

Absolute nonsense!

Vivian would rather have kept the shares of Viana!

"Nathan, I can return Viana’s shares to Zoe. Let her come back, okay? Viana was founded by her mother. How could she just abandon it?"

Yes, that was the right approach. If she showed she was willing to give the shares back, Nathan might soften toward her.

But her confidence shattered when she noticed the ice in his eyes.

Why was he looking at her like that?

"Are you questioning my decisions now?" Nathan’s tone carried a sharp edge, signaling his patience had worn thin.

Vivian paled. "Th-That’s not what I meant!"

"If not, then focus on Viana and leave the rest to me," Nathan commanded coldly.

Biting her lip, Vivian turned and stormed out, her heart burning with hatred—hatred for Evelyn!

If that wretched woman hadn’t returned, Nathan wouldn’t be treating her this way! He used to indulge her every whim, but now he wouldn’t even agree to kick Evelyn out of Ckgold!

That vile creature would pay for this one day.

At Royal Crown...

"You two better stick to the script, or all my efforts will be wasted."

Sophia carried Daisy in her arms while Liam walked beside her. As they entered the company, she couldn’t resist reminding them.

Daisy wrapped her tiny arms around Sophia’s neck and chirped, "Don’t worry, Godmother. We’ve got this."

When they reached the floor of Adrian Boucher’s studio, his assistant, Nina, blinked in surprise. "Ms. Hill?"

Her eyes widened further at the sight of the two children.

"Is Adrian in?" Sophia asked.

"He’s in his office. Can I help you with something?" Nina couldn’t stop stealing glances at the kids. They were breathtakingly beautiful!

"Oh, these two are my niece and nephew—new child stars Royal Crown just signed. I wanted Adrian to meet them."

"So these are the new talents everyone’s been talking about!" Nina had heard the rumors. She crouched down to Liam’s level and ruffled his hair. "Hello there."

Liam, either shy or indifferent, kept his head lowered. "Hi."

Nina melted. "Absolutely adorable! I had no idea they were already scouted."

A few female employees nearby immediately swarmed them, cooing and pinching cheeks.

Sophia stifled a laugh. Zoe’s kids were just too irresistible.
###Chapter 47

Adrian stepped out of his office, his brow furrowing at the unexpected commotion outside. "What's going on here?"

His sharp gaze immediately landed on the two children standing near Sophia.

Sophia gently set Daisy down and rose to approach him. "These are my niece and nephew. Royal Crown just signed them, so I brought them to meet you."

Liam stepped forward, holding Daisy's small hand. They bowed politely in unison. "Hello, Uncle Adrian."

Adrian studied them intently, his piercing eyes narrowing slightly. There was something oddly familiar about their features. He crouched down to their level, gently ruffling Daisy's hair. "What are your names?"

"I'm Daisy," the little girl beamed. "And this is my brother Liam."

Adrian straightened, turning to Sophia with a questioning look. "Since when do you have a niece and nephew?"

Sophia scratched her cheek awkwardly. "They're my best friend's kids. They call me Godmother, so they might as well be family."

"Your best friend's children?" Adrian repeated slowly.

Sophia nodded vigorously. "That's right."

"Come inside," Adrian said after a moment's hesitation.

Sophia quickly gathered the children and ushered them into the lavish office.

Adrian settled onto the couch, crossing his long legs as he observed the trio. "Who's their father?"

Liam met his gaze steadily. "We don't have a father."

Adrian's perfect eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Sophia sighed dramatically. "Adrian, their mother raised them alone. It hasn't been easy for her. That's why they signed with Royal Crown - to help support their family."

Daisy and Liam exchanged amused glances. Their godmother was laying it on thick!

Adrian picked up his coffee cup, taking a slow sip before speaking. "The entertainment industry is brutal, especially for children. You brought them here expecting special treatment?"

The siblings shared another look. This actor was sharper than Sophia had warned them about. Things were getting interesting.

Sophia gave an awkward laugh, ducking her head. "You caught me."

Adrian set his cup down with a soft clink. "Was this their idea or their mother's?"

Sophia's eyes widened, but Adrian continued smoothly. "We grew up together, Sophia. I know you wouldn't come asking favors unless someone pushed you to it."

Liam's expression darkened. "It was our decision. Our mom doesn't even know we're here. She didn't want us in this industry at all."

"Godmother, stop lying for us," Daisy tugged at Sophia's sleeve with a pout. "We only asked you to bring us because we know you're Mr. Boucher's cousin."

She stood up abruptly. "Uncle Adrian, we're not begging for your help. If you're not interested, we'll leave. Come on, Liam."

Liam gave Adrian one last measuring look before rising. "Let's go."

"Wait, Daisy—" Sophia reached out anxiously as the children headed for the door.

Adrian chuckled softly, his voice carrying across the room. "Come back here."

Sophia turned to him in shock. Was he actually agreeing? Daisy and Liam exchanged triumphant smiles before returning to their seats.
###Chapter 48

Adrian Boucher's gaze lingered on Liam's face. A strange sense of familiarity washed over him.

"You remind me of someone who suddenly pretends not to know me," he murmured.

It was exactly how Nathan behaved.

Sophia Hill gasped. "Adrian, you don’t recognize us anymore?"

Adrian smirked. "The kids are adorable. Since Royal Crown signed them, and I have a magazine shoot coming up, I’ll take them along."

At the manager’s office…

"You want them on the magazine cover?" Ethan Lynch, Adrian’s manager, stared at the two children in disbelief.

Adrian nodded. "They’re photogenic. It’ll elevate the shoot."

Ethan rubbed his temples. "How do we explain this to the publishers?"

"Leave that to me. I’ll handle it."

Ethan sighed. Adrian was a megastar, far above A-listers, and Royal Crown had signed these kids. If Adrian wanted to mentor them, the agency wouldn’t object.

But the fans—that was another story.

Adrian’s fandom was notoriously protective. The last time he worked with a newcomer, they tore them apart. Now, with children involved, Ethan worried about the backlash.

When the photos dropped…

The magazine’s official Twitter post exploded.

Trending.

400 million retweets.

80 thousand mentions.

@AngelsOnEarth: "This is a glimpse of Adrian as a father. I can’t breathe."

@ForeverAdrian: "I volunteer as tribute to babysit these angels!"

@SunshineLover: "Who are these little stars? I need them wrapped in bubble wrap."

@AdrianNation: "Adrian, share the babies! Don’t hog them!"

@BouchersBabe: "Move over, I’m claiming the top comment. #SobbingUncontrollably"

Adrian’s fans were notoriously ruthless toward newcomers—unless they were these two.

At Goldmann Group…

Oliver Lawson burst into Nathan’s office. "The kids are trending—with Adrian Boucher!"

Nathan looked up sharply. "Show me."

Oliver handed him the tablet. Nathan’s jaw tightened as he scrolled. "Why are they with him?"

"Apparently, Adrian invited them to his magazine shoot."

Nathan’s expression darkened.

Adrian never worked with newcomers. He was selective, busy—how had the kids even crossed paths with him?

"Find out who introduced them."

Oliver stepped out to call Royal Crown.

When he returned, his voice was careful. "It was Ms. Hill."

Nathan’s eyes turned glacial.

Ms. Hill? The woman with Evelyn?

Does she know my children?
###Chapter 49

The thought struck me suddenly—doesn’t Sophia Hill know Evelyn Vanderbilt? When I had sent Evelyn home that day, she had been staying at the beach villa. Could she possibly know the children?

Oliver was deep in thought when Nathan abruptly stood and walked out.

Startled, Oliver quickly followed. "Mr. Goldmann, where are you going?"

"To the 16th floor."

"Uncle Gregory, you can start here tomorrow. I’ve already informed all the employees that Viana Jewelry has let go."

Evelyn was standing by the window, phone pressed to her ear, a faint smile playing on her lips as she responded to Gregory. "Alright, don’t worry. Everything’s been arranged."

After ending the call, she held her phone loosely, lost in thought. Tomorrow, when they arrived, it would be time to officially launch the new jewelry brand. She turned—and nearly gasped when she found Nathan standing right behind her.

"Mr. Goldmann, you—"

Before she could finish, Nathan closed the distance between them, backing her against the window. His gaze was steady, unnervingly calm. "Do you have children?"

Evelyn froze, suspicion flickering in her eyes. "What does that have to do with you?" She tried to step away.

Nathan blocked her effortlessly. "Answer the question."

Her expression darkened. Why was he suddenly asking this? Had he—figured something out?

"I’m not even married. Why would I have children? If there’s nothing else, I’d appreciate it if you left."

"Who are Liam and Daisy Vanderbilt to you?" His eyes bore into hers, searching for any flicker of reaction.

A shiver ran down her spine. Her gaze dropped.

How did he know about Liam and Daisy?

Nathan braced a hand against the window behind her, leaning in. "Answer me."

She forced herself to meet his eyes, though cold sweat prickled at the back of her neck. "They’re not related to me."

"Should I go ask your friend Sophia instead?"

Evelyn nearly choked on a laugh. She gritted her teeth, forcing a smile. "Go ahead. I was wondering why you came to me first. What makes you think I have children?"

She had to stay calm. Any sign of panic would confirm his suspicions.

Nathan studied her for a long moment, doubt still lingering.

Sophia knew those children, and they were both Vanderbilts. The woman who had spent that night with him six years ago was Vivian.

If Vivian had been pregnant, the children would be around their age. But what unsettled him most was that Evelyn had been cast out of the family back then.

He had never suspected Vivian—until those two children appeared. Now, he had to re-examine everything from six years ago. Even his father believed the children were his.

Perhaps he needed to reopen the investigation into that night.

Evelyn arched a brow, scoffing. "You’re acting strange. If you want children, just ask Vivian for them."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"You think they’re connected to me just because they’re Vanderbilts? Why not suspect Vivian instead?" Her smile was hollow.

"I know it wasn’t her."

"Too bad, then. I don’t have children. Stop testing me."

"For your sake, I hope they’re not connected to you. And I hope you weren’t the woman from six years ago." His fingers brushed her chin, tilting it up. "Because if you were, you won’t survive the consequences."

The moment Nathan left, Evelyn clenched her fists, her forehead damp with sweat.
###Chapter 50

Evelyn had always believed it was just a coincidence.

But now, the truth was undeniable—the man from six years ago was him. Her composure was slipping.

That was why Laura had asked about Caleb and Daisy when she saw them with Nathan. That was also why Vivian kept her distance, terrified Evelyn would get too close to him.

No. She would never let them take her children. Never.

Vivian swept everything off the table in a fit of rage. Laura walked in just as she was losing control. "Vivian, what's wrong?"

"Mom, we have to act before that woman steals Nathan away from me."

Laura's face darkened. "What exactly happened?"

Vivian told her everything—how Nathan had given Evelyn a jewelry company. Laura's expression twisted with fury.

"That vile woman! She’s always scheming." Since Evelyn’s return, their lives had been nothing but chaos.

Now that she had left Viana Jewelry, she had gone straight to Nathan’s company. Laura suddenly remembered something. "What about the incident with Victor Baldwin? Was it exposed?"

"Enough!" Vivian snapped, grinding her teeth. "That woman ran away!"

If Evelyn hadn’t escaped, Vivian wouldn’t have ended up in Victor’s hands. It was all her fault. She was supposed to be the one with Nathan that night!

Laura wiped her forehead. "She’s becoming harder to deal with. We can’t let this continue."

Vivian grabbed her mother’s hand. "Mom, I can’t wait any longer. Nathan is already unhappy with me. He’s starting to question what really happened six years ago. I’m afraid—"

"That reminds me—why would he suspect anything? You covered your tracks perfectly."

"Who knows?!" Vivian jerked her hand away and collapsed onto the bed, seething.

Laura hesitated before speaking again. "Vivian, there’s something else bothering me."

"What?"

"At the restaurant, I saw Nathan with those children. They looked exactly like him. Even I thought they were his."

Vivian shot to her feet, her face paling. "Why are you only telling me this now?!"

"I wasn’t sure! And when I confronted Evelyn, she denied having children."

Laura placed a comforting hand on Vivian’s shoulder. "She only spent one night with Nathan. Getting pregnant isn’t that easy. But we don’t know who those children’s mother is, so you need to be careful."

Vivian froze. She had been with Nathan for six years, yet he had never touched her. How could he have been with someone else? Impossible!

She wouldn’t let anyone stand in her way—not Evelyn, not those children, no one.

"Vivian, I need to visit the hospital soon."

"Why?"

"Because of Evelyn. She came back and fought with your father over the Viana shares."

Vivian scoffed. "Isn’t that a good thing?"

"No. Your father is drafting a new will because of it. It’s obvious he still cares about her!"

Laura gripped Vivian’s shoulders. "If I could give him a son, everything the Vanderbilts have would be ours. Once that happens, my position in the family will be secure. And if you can get Nathan to confirm your relationship, we’ll crush her easily."
###Chapter 51

Evelyn knew her mother was right, but she couldn't wait for her mother to bear a son.

Those two wicked children posed a serious threat. She needed to uncover their identities and eliminate them immediately!

At Beach Villa...

"Mommy, aren't you going to eat? Why are you just watching us?" Caleb asked between bites, noticing his mother hadn't touched her food but was staring intently at them.

Daisy and Liam also sensed something unusual about their mother's behavior.

Evelyn turned to Daisy and Liam. "Have you been approached by any strange men recently?"

"Strange men?" They exchanged confused glances.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Never mind. If anyone tries talking to you, ignore them. Good children don't engage with strangers, understand?"

Liam seemed to grasp who this "strange man" might be. He shot meaningful looks at Caleb and Daisy.

Daisy scooted closer to Evelyn. "Mommy, we only met Uncle Adrian recently. No other men."

"Why did you meet him?"

"Don't be mad, Mommy!" Daisy said in her sweetest voice. "He doesn't know who you are, and we didn't tell him. He's Godmother's cousin, so he wouldn't hurt us!"

Evelyn took a deep breath and patted Daisy's head. "I've told you the entertainment industry isn't safe. By putting yourselves out there—"

What if Vivian and Laura, or even Nathan, decided to target them?

"Don't worry, Mommy," Liam interjected. "Uncle Adrian will protect us. Nothing bad will happen."

Evelyn's frustration grew. Adrian was friends with Nathan. Were her children walking straight into danger?

"No. You're not entering show business."

"But we already signed contracts," Daisy pouted. "The penalty fees are huge if we break them."

Evelyn was speechless. She felt like she might explode.

Caleb rushed to hug her. "Mommy, please don't be angry. Liam and Daisy just want to help you. With their intelligence, no one can bully them."

"Really? Wasn't your sister almost—" Evelyn stopped mid-sentence, staring at her three mischievous children.

"Wait a minute," she said slowly. "How did you encounter Vivian and Laura in the first place?" She'd been too upset about Daisy's near-kidnapping to question it before.

The three children exchanged guilty looks.

Daisy smiled innocently. "Godmother told us about them. Since Vivian and that old woman bullied you, we hate them!"

Evelyn sighed. Sophia kept "selling her out" at every turn!

"Mommy, please say yes," Daisy pleaded, swaying back and forth.

Evelyn felt utterly helpless. "You little rascals! Ganging up on me like this!"

They'd learned to act first and ask for forgiveness later.

The three children grinned triumphantly.

The next day at Royal Crown Entertainment...

Nathan arrived at the company, greeted by all the executives. Everyone knew Royal Crown was a subsidiary of the Goldmann Group.

Nathan's mother, Victoria Knowles, had once been Royal Crown's brightest star—the most beautiful woman in all of Bassburgh.
###Chapter 52

Nathan Goldmann Sr. had initially been a devoted admirer of Victoria Knowles. His infatuation had driven him to acquire Royal Crown with an exorbitant sum, all for the sake of bringing her home.

But he wasn’t the only one enchanted by her. Adrian Boucher’s father had also fallen under her spell—a scandal that had fueled gossip for years.

"Mr. Goldmann, what an honor to have you here," greeted Mr. Weatherford, the director of Royal Crown, with a practiced smile.

"Didn’t you sign two children? Where are they?" Nathan’s tone was casual, but his gaze was sharp.

Mr. Weatherford hesitated before answering, "They’ve been securing endorsement deals ever since their magazine feature with Adrian."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. "Which company?"

"An advertiser under Snowke."

Once he had the location, Nathan wasted no time.

At the shoot, the children’s manager, Angela, stood by, overseeing the session. Adrian had personally introduced her to Liam and Daisy, and their rapid rise—even before their official debut—spoke volumes about their potential.

Liam and Daisy, dressed in coordinated outfits, flawlessly executed the director’s instructions, earning praise from the entire crew. Their chemistry was undeniable, their professionalism beyond their years.

When Nathan arrived, the set fell into stunned silence.

Daisy turned, her eyes lighting up as she skipped toward him. "Mister, what are you doing here?"

He ruffled her hair, grinning. "I came to see you."

Angela’s jaw nearly dropped.

Mr. Goldmann himself? And why do they look so much like him?

Liam approached as well, and the resemblance was impossible to ignore. No one would doubt they were his children.

Nathan studied them. "Want to grab a meal after this? I think I owe you one."

Daisy beamed. "Yes, please!"

Liam shot her a warning glance but relented at her excitement.

"Mr. Goldmann, but they—" Angela started, unsure how to handle the situation.

Nathan cut her off. "Tell them I’m taking them out. I’ll return them after."

At an upscale restaurant, the server presented two platters of Australian lobster. Daisy bounced in her seat, barely containing her excitement.

Liam rolled up her sleeves before expertly cracking open the shell for her.

Nathan watched, intrigued. "Your mother taught you that?"

Liam nodded. "She loves lobster. Just like Daisy."

He carefully placed the tender meat on Daisy’s plate. She swung her legs happily, ready to devour her meal.

Nathan rested his chin on his hand, studying them. Whoever their mother was, she had raised them impeccably.

"Who is Sophia to you?"

Daisy scooped up a bite of lobster and blinked up at him. "Our godmother."

Liam kicked her under the table.

Realizing her slip, Daisy grinned. "Why do you ask?"
###Chapter 53

Nathan grinned. "No particular reason, just curious."

"Are you interested in our godmother?" Daisy giggled, her eyes twinkling mischievously.

Nathan's expression froze for a split second before he recovered.

Daisy tilted her head, her smile widening. "Or maybe… you're interested in our mommy?"

Nathan paused, then looked down with a faint smirk. "What if I am?"

Liam and Daisy exchanged shocked glances.

"But you have a girlfriend," Daisy said, feigning disappointment.

Nathan's gaze darkened slightly. "Who told you that?"

Daisy shrugged. "A little birdie whispered it to us."

"She… isn't my girlfriend." Nathan wasn’t sure why he felt the need to explain himself to two children.

Liam frowned. "Then why do you spend time with her? Grown-ups would call you a player!"

Even if this man was their father, they weren’t about to hand their mother over to him so easily.

Nathan was momentarily speechless.

Daisy turned to Liam. "Don’t say that! He’s not a bad person. He bought us lobsters!"

Liam huffed. "You’re letting lobsters buy your loyalty?"

His sister was such a traitor.

Nathan ruffled Liam’s hair. "It’s not what you think. I’ll explain everything one day."

First, he had some things to settle.

Liam looked surprised but didn’t argue further.

After the meal, they were dropped back at the company. Once the kids were gone, Nathan unclenched his fist—revealing two strands of hair he had discreetly taken from Liam’s head.

"Oliver."

Oliver turned immediately. "Yes, Mr. Goldmann?"

Nathan’s voice was calm. "Take these to the lab."

He needed answers.

The Next Day

#Shocking: Mr. Goldmann spotted dining with Royal Crown’s child stars—are they his secret children?

Paparazzi had captured Nathan with Liam and Daisy at the restaurant, and by morning, the news had exploded across every tabloid.

Oliver hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Goldmann… about the news—"

Seeing Nathan’s frown, he quickly corrected himself. "I’ll have it taken down immediately."

How dare those vultures follow him?

Nathan didn’t respond. He was more curious about Evelyn’s reaction than the headlines themselves.

Meanwhile, Evelyn, Gregory, and Xavier were in a meeting, finalizing plans for her new jewelry brand.

"Ms. Vanderbilt, have you decided on the brand name yet?" Xavier asked.

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the table, deep in thought.

Then her phone buzzed—Sophia was calling.

Evelyn excused herself and stepped into the hallway. "I’m in a meeting, what’s so urgent—"

"Drop everything! There’s a crisis!" Sophia’s voice was frantic.

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. "What happened?"

"Check the news! Liam and Daisy were photographed with Nathan Goldmann! The media’s speculating they’re his kids!"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

"I’ll handle it," she said sharply before hanging up.

She had warned Liam and Daisy about strangers—but now Nathan had somehow gotten to them.
###Chapter 54

Had he figured it out?

No, she couldn't risk Laura and Vivian discovering the truth about Liam and Daisy!

"Zoe, are you okay?" Gregory's concerned voice snapped Evelyn out of her thoughts as he approached.

Evelyn turned with a forced smile. "I'm fine. Just give me a couple days to finalize the brand name. There's something urgent I need to handle."

"Of course." Gregory nodded understandingly.

As Evelyn stepped into the elevator, she collided with a tall figure exiting. Her breath hitched when she looked up.

Nathan seemed to be deliberately blocking her path. "Where are you rushing off to?"

"Business matters. Since when do you monitor my schedule?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Have you seen today's headlines?" His piercing gaze never left her face.

Evelyn's smile faltered slightly, though not enough for him to notice. "What headlines?"

Nathan wordlessly handed her his phone.

The photo showed him with Liam and Daisy at the park. Evelyn forced a light laugh. "Oh, those adorable kids?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Her reaction only deepened his suspicions.

Returning the phone, Evelyn said briskly, "Excuse me, Mr. Goldmann. I have an appointment."

Nathan suddenly grabbed her wrist, pinning her against the marble wall. "What are you—"

"Why the sudden urgency?" His eyes searched hers intently, missing nothing. "Running somewhere?"

Evelyn clenched her fists. "We're business partners, not employer-employee. You don't control my movements."

Nathan leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. "What if I want to?"

"You—"

"I merely asked where you're going. Why so defensive?" His lips curled. "Unless... those children mean something to you?"

Evelyn bit her lip hard. She'd nearly walked right into his trap!

Her phone rang. The caller ID made her lips curve triumphantly. "Your girlfriend is calling. I really must go."

Nathan's grip loosened as he saw Vivian's name flash on screen. Seizing the moment, Evelyn slipped into the elevator. "If you're worried about me meeting your precious Vivian, feel free to tag along."

The doors closed before he could respond. Only then did Evelyn exhale the breath she'd been holding.

That call had come at the perfect moment. A second later and everything might have unraveled.

Outside the Goldmann building, her phone rang again. "What?" Evelyn snapped.

"Evelyn, answer me properly!" Vivian's shrill voice demanded. "Are those brats yours?"

Evelyn's blood boiled at the insult. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

Vivian's voice turned venomous. "Don't play dumb. Do you have children or not?"

Though her mother insisted the children resembled Nathan, Vivian had never seen them herself - until today's photos. Now she was certain. Whether they were Evelyn's or not, she couldn't wait any longer to act.
###Chapter 55

"Why are you so certain I have children?" Evelyn's voice was sharp, cutting through the tense silence.

Vivian hesitated, her fingers tightening around her phone. "Because six years ago, you—" She stopped abruptly, realization dawning on her face. Her expression shifted to one of guilt. Damn it. If she said any more, Evelyn would figure out who the man from that night really was.

Evelyn leaned back in the car seat, her gaze unnervingly steady. "What happened six years ago?"

"Nothing." Vivian forced a laugh, brittle and unconvincing. "Those kids better not be yours."

Evelyn caught the subtle shift in Vivian's tone. Her eyes gleamed with sudden understanding. "Oh? You saw the news and realized you're not as untouchable as you thought. So now you're targeting my children?"

"If they're not yours, it's none of your concern." Vivian ended the call abruptly, her face hardening. She still refused to believe Evelyn didn’t have kids. She was the one who had slept with Nathan Goldmann that night!

The timing was too perfect. Those two children had appeared right around the time Evelyn returned to Cornelia. It couldn’t be a coincidence. And if Evelyn was this defensive, Vivian would use those brats to expose the truth.

She dialed another number, her voice low and urgent. "It's me. Same arrangement. I'll pay you $80,000 upfront. Another $80,000 when the job is done."

At the Judicial Appraisal Center, a doctor in a surgical mask strode into an office.

The middle-aged man inside glanced up and smiled. "Ah, Dr. Watson. What brings you here?"

"An urgent case." Joel Watson slid a sealed folder across the desk. "Blood traces from the suspect. I need this analyzed immediately."

The man nodded, standing. "Of course. I’ll have someone handle it right away."

Once alone, the man’s gaze flicked to another sealed document on his desk—a DNA report. He quickly snapped photos with his phone, swapped the files, and slipped the original into his coat.

Moments later, at a stairwell trash bin, he shredded the incriminating papers and tossed them away.

Sophia’s phone buzzed. She paled as she opened the message.

Evelyn frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Wordlessly, Sophia handed over her phone. The screen displayed damning images—DNA results Joel had captured.

Nathan Goldmann was their father.

"Zoe," Sophia whispered, stunned. "How did you know Nathan would run a paternity test?"

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Because he tested me first." She exhaled sharply. "I knew he’d get close to Liam and Daisy. And if he did, he’d eventually test them too."

Thank God Joel worked in forensics. Without him, Nathan would’ve uncovered the truth.

Sophia hesitated. "Aren’t you… relieved? You finally know who their father is."

Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "A man who might’ve conspired with Vivian six years ago. Do you really think someone like that deserves to be in their lives?"
###Chapter 56

"Considering Mr. Goldmann's position, it would be highly unusual if he actually collaborated with Vivian to set you up six years ago."

Sophia's words left Evelyn speechless. She continued, "Besides, if he knew about what happened back then, wouldn't he have realized Caleb, Liam, and Daisy are his children? He wouldn’t have needed a paternity test."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "I get your point. He probably wouldn’t stoop to working with Vivian, but he’s still her boyfriend. I want nothing to do with anything involving her."

Sophia’s lips twitched in amusement. Evelyn was just being stubborn now.

Then, Sophia’s eyes lit up with an idea. "What about my cousin? Seeing how much he adores Liam and Daisy, I’m sure he’d be thrilled."

"Seriously? You’re dragging Adrian into this?" His fans would riot if they heard that.

Sophia burst into laughter, her shoulders shaking.

"Don’t you dare tell Caleb and the others about today. If you spill a single word, I’ll make sure you regret it!"

Sophia waved her off. "No way! My lips are sealed, I promise!"

"This involves the kids. No one can know. Vivian already suspects me, and I wouldn’t put it past her to target Daisy and Liam."

"What?!" Sophia’s expression darkened. "Should I ask Adrian to keep an eye out?"

Noticing Evelyn’s hesitation, she pressed a hand to her chest. "If you don’t trust me, at least trust him, right?"

Evelyn grabbed her bag and stood. "Then thank him for me."

That evening at Beach Villas...

The three troublemakers sat in the corner, heads bowed in reflection. Evelyn lounged on the couch, arms crossed. "Think hard about what you did wrong, or no dinner tonight."

Daisy turned, her big eyes pleading. "Mommy, that man just wanted to buy Liam and me some food."

"And you sold me out for a meal?" Evelyn arched a brow. "What’s next? Trading me for lobsters?"

Daisy pouted. They had gotten lobsters...

"What did I say about strangers? If you get kidnapped one day, don’t come crying to me."

"Mommy, we’re not dumb enough to get kidnapped," Caleb muttered.

"Stand up straight."

The trio snapped to attention, exchanging glances. They knew their mom had seen the news—their secret meet-up with their father had been exposed. No wonder she was furious.

The fact that he was dating the woman she despised most? That sealed his fate.

Unless they got rid of that witch, their mom would never accept him.

A sly grin spread across Caleb’s face. He nudged Daisy, whispering a plan. Her eyes sparkled.

Suddenly, Daisy burst into tears. "Mommy, that man smelled like Daddy! We just wanted to know what having a dad felt like!"

She crumpled to the floor, sobbing dramatically.

Evelyn froze. Her heart clenched at Daisy’s tear-streaked face.

She stood, fighting the urge to scoop her up. Instead, she frowned. "Daisy, I know you want a father, but that man isn’t—"
###Chapter 57

Evelyn couldn't deny the lie. Even if she knew the man from six years ago was Nathan, she couldn't accept it.

The children getting close to him would give Vivian an opening to strike.

Liam turned to look at her. "Mommy, why are you scared of us being near that man?"

Evelyn didn’t answer. Was she afraid Nathan would discover they were his children? Or was she terrified of what Laura and Vivian might do to them?

"Mommy, your eyebrows are furrowed inward. That means you're anxious or confused." Liam tilted his head. "Is he related to us?"

She denied it instantly. "No, you're not!"

Liam shrugged. "Your tone says otherwise. You're guilty."

Evelyn froze.

How could she forget? This boy had traded fairy tales for psychology books before he could even read properly. She could fool Caleb and Daisy, but never Liam.

She exhaled sharply, forcing calm. Time to redirect. "Let's order takeout. How about lobster?"

Daisy, who had been wailing dramatically, sat up instantly. "Yes!"

Liam and Caleb exchanged glances. Their sister was embarrassingly easy to bribe.

The next day, at Goldmann Group—

Oliver handed Nathan the report from the Bureau of Justice. When Nathan opened it, his expression darkened.

Oliver swallowed hard. "Mr. Goldmann... the results?"

Nathan set the document down after a long pause.

Oliver picked it up. The test was negative—no biological relation.

He sighed in relief. "See? They’re not yours. Just a coincidence."

Maybe the boss just had baby fever.

Nathan tapped the paper. "Look at the date."

Oliver frowned, checking the upper corner. That wasn’t from their visit. It was two days prior.

"This isn’t your report!" Oliver blanched. "How could the bureau mess up like—"

Nathan cut him off with a cold laugh. "You think this was a mistake?"

Oliver stiffened. No way. The bureau didn’t make errors like this.

If not a mistake, then someone had switched the results.

Only he and Nathan had known about the test.

"Mr. Goldmann, this report—"

"Leave it." Nathan’s voice was icy. "Run another test in Cornelia. Discreetly."

Oliver nodded and turned to leave.

"Wait."

Oliver paused. "Yes, sir?"

Nathan’s gaze lingered on the falsified document. "Let the news leak. Watch who interferes. If they did it once, they’ll do it again."

Evelyn walked into the office, passing whispers from clustered employees.

"Did you hear? Mr. Goldmann might have secret kids. The resemblance is uncanny."

"Who’s the woman? Definitely not Ms. Vanderbilt. Why else would he get a paternity test?"
###Chapter 58

Evelyn's steps slowed as a deep frown creased her forehead. Nathan had publicly announced the paternity test?

She turned toward the group of employees gathered near the elevator. Engrossed in their heated discussion, they hadn't noticed her approach. "Is this true? You shouldn't spread rumors."

"Oliver confirmed it himself. Why would he lie?"

"But why would Mr. Goldmann travel all the way to Cornelia for testing? Doesn't Bassburgh have its own Bureau of Justice?"

Evelyn froze, her hands curling into tight fists.

What was happening? Did he doubt the authenticity of the original report?

Joel had been meticulous. Nathan should have accepted the negative results at face value.

If he was truly pursuing another test in Cornelia, she needed to act fast. Her fingers hovered over her phone screen. Should she send someone to intercept the results?

Wait. Evelyn's breath caught. Nathan making this public was suspicious.

He'd already conducted one test. If he suspected tampering, this could be a trap. Sending someone would be walking right into his hands.

She forced a smile as a male colleague approached. "Excuse me, my phone died. Could I borrow yours to send one quick text?"

The man hesitated only a moment before handing over his device. "Of course."

"Thank you." Evelyn quickly composed a message to Laura from his contacts, then immediately deleted the thread.

Returning the phone, she gave a conspiratorial wink. "Just sending my cheating ex a piece of my mind. Feel free to ignore any replies."

At Vanderbilt Manor...

Laura hummed as she prepared a healthy meal in the kitchen. With pregnancy on the horizon, she needed to maintain perfect health to secure the Vanderbilt fortune for her future grandson.

Her phone vibrated with an unknown number. Lowering the flame, she read the message and nearly dropped her spatula.

Nathan Goldmann was conducting another paternity test in Cornelia? Did he actually believe those brats were his?

This couldn't be happening. She needed to warn Vivian immediately!

"Vivian, come home at once! We have an emergency!"

"Mr. Goldmann, the entire company is buzzing about the news. I believe word has spread as intended."

"Did she hear?"

Oliver blinked. Was 'she' referring to Ms. Vanderbilt? "Most likely. The topic dominates every conversation."

Nathan neatly stacked his documents. Evelyn must have heard by now. The question remained - what would she do about it?

On the sixteenth floor...

"Zoe, I've secured authorization for your official jewelry website. Once processed, we should see immediate traction. Have you decided on a brand name?" Gregory asked.

Evelyn tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Let's call it..."
###Chapter 59

"Soul?" Gregory tilted his head, his expression thoughtful.

"Every creation carries its essence. Even lifeless objects need soul—without it, they're merely hollow shells." Evelyn's voice held quiet conviction.

Gregory stroked his chin, nodding slowly. Just as he opened his mouth to respond, the office door swung open.

Evelyn's smile faltered when Nathan Goldmann strode in.

Her pulse quickened. What was he doing here?

Gregory gave a polite nod. "Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan's piercing gaze swept over them. "Gregory Fannon, I presume? Your reputation precedes you in Bassburgh's jewelry circles."

"The honor is mine." Gregory's grin didn't reach his eyes.

Evelyn forced a bright tone. "To what do we owe this unexpected visit, Mr. Goldmann?" Her fingers twitched—this man from six years ago still unsettled her.

"Business." Nathan's tone was glacial. "As primary investor in CKGold's new jewelry line, I'm entitled to progress reports."

Her laugh sounded brittle even to her own ears. "Of course. We'd never neglect our esteemed backer." She rose abruptly. "Though I fear our tea selection won't meet your standards."

"Try me." Nathan settled onto the couch with deliberate ease, his stare challenging. "I have time."

Evelyn's jaw tightened.

Gregory cleared his throat. "I'll prepare the tea."

The moment the door closed, Evelyn braced against her desk. "Let's skip the pretense. You're not here for tea."

"No." Nathan crossed his legs, the movement predatory. "I've ordered paternity tests for those children."

Her nails dug into her arms. "How... personal."

His gaze sharpened. "No reaction?"

"Why would I care about your personal affairs?" She forced a shrug, though her ribs constricted.

"Most people show surprise at such news." He leaned forward. "Your composure is... telling."

Evelyn hugged herself tighter. Damn his razor-sharp perception. Had he uncovered something? She schooled her features. Without proof, he had nothing.

"The office gossip mill already churned out that tidbit." She waved a hand. "Though I imagine Vivian will be devastated after six devoted years."

Nathan's expression darkened, a storm gathering in his eyes.

The tension shattered when Gregory returned with tea. Nathan stood abruptly. "I've seen enough."

Without another word, he strode out, leaving the scent of bergamot and unresolved questions in his wake.
###Chapter 60

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What happened to Mr. Goldmann?"

Laura shrugged casually. "Who knows? Maybe he lost his taste for tea."

At Vanderbilt Manor...

Laura Scott paced the lavish living room, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. Hours had passed with no word about the test results.

Vivian lounged on the velvet couch, her face hidden behind a silk mask. "Mother, your pacing won't change anything," she drawled. "Those brats have to disappear regardless of the test outcome."

Laura froze mid-step. "What do you mean?"

"If anything happens to those little bastards," Vivian peeled off her mask with deliberate slowness, "their so-called mother will come running out of hiding."

Laura's hands trembled. "But what if someone finds out—"

"Relax," Vivian interrupted with a dismissive wave. "I'm not planning to kill them. Just... encourage their guardian to reveal herself." A cruel smile twisted her lips. "If they get hurt during their little adventure, that's on their careless parents, isn't it?"

Meanwhile...

Angela pulled up outside a quaint patisserie and turned to the children. "Stay put. I'll grab some pastries."

"Thanks, Angela!" Daisy beamed, swinging her legs excitedly.

The moment Angela disappeared inside, two burly men slid into the car. Liam reacted instantly, clamping a hand over Daisy's mouth before she could scream.

One thug brandished a knife. "One sound and this goes in your pretty little throat," he growled.

As the car screeched away, Angela burst from the bakery, pastries forgotten. "My car!" she screamed, fumbling for her phone. Only one person could help now - Adrian Boucher.

The kidnappers drove relentlessly toward the city outskirts. The children remained eerily quiet.

"Creepy kids," muttered the passenger, eyeing them suspiciously. "Not even crying."

"Shut up and drive," snapped the driver.

They arrived at a derelict steel mill, its broken windows like empty eye sockets. The men dragged the children inside.

"Ow! You're pulling my hair!" Daisy wailed, tears streaming down her cheeks.

"Shut your trap!" the thug barked.

Daisy's sobs cut off abruptly.

Inside the decaying factory, cockroaches scuttled across the filthy floor. Daisy suddenly shrieked and latched onto her captor's leg. "Bug! Big bug!"

The man crushed the insect underfoot. "Jesus, kid, it's just a roach." He shoved her toward his partner. "Tie her up already."

After securing Liam, the crew-cut thug approached Daisy. As he bound her wrists, she peered up with watery eyes. "Mister? Can you make it a bow?"

His hands jerked in surprise. "A bow? Are you kidding me?"

The two kidnappers exchanged exasperated looks as Daisy's lower lip trembled. This wasn't going as planned.
###Chapter 61

"Sir, can you tie my bow?" Daisy's lips trembled as fresh tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Shut your mouth!" The man's roar was so loud it cracked, his face twisting in irritation.

Daisy flinched, her sobs instantly muffled. She blinked up at him, silent now, her small frame trembling.

With rough hands, the man yanked the ribbon into a messy bow before shoving away. He stalked over to his partner, the one with the buzz cut. "You think Vivian Vanderbilt’s lost it? Paying us 80 grand each just to snatch these two brats?"

Buzz Cut lit a cigarette, exhaling smoke sharply. "Got a problem with easy money? Walk away if you’re scared. I don’t need dead weight."

The first man grinned. "Hell no, I’m in. Just saying—this is too good to be true."

Two kids for 160K. Four would’ve been 320K.

Liam’s eyes flickered open. "So, this Ms. Vanderbilt—Vivian, right?"

Both men stiffened, turning to glare at him.

Buzz Cut’s jaw tightened. The other man swallowed hard. "Boss… the kid knows too much—"

Buzz Cut silenced him with a sharp look before looming over Liam. "What exactly do you think you know?"

Liam smirked. "We’re child models. Featured in Vogue with an Oscar winner. 160K for both of us? That’s a scam."

The first man’s eyes widened. "He’s got a point, boss! We’re getting ripped off!"

Buzz Cut backhanded him. "Shut your damn mouth!"

Liam tilted his head. "We’re worth at least 800K each. Do the math."

Buzz Cut’s nostrils flared. "You lying little—"

"1.6 million total," Liam cut in smoothly. "Your call."

The first man rubbed his forehead, grinning. "Boss, that’s a steal!"

Buzz Cut grabbed his collar. "One more word, and I’ll put a bullet in you first."

Liam’s voice stayed calm. "That car’s got GPS. Even if you kill us, where you gonna run with just 160K?"

Buzz Cut’s expression darkened.

The first man panicked. "Boss, we gotta renegotiate!"

Gritting his teeth, Buzz Cut jerked his chin. "Call her. Now."

The man dialed, but after a hissed exchange, he spun back, furious. "That bitch refused!"

Liam’s fingers worked subtly behind his back, the sharp edge of a hidden object sawing at his ropes. "Vivian’s just Nathan Goldmann’s girlfriend. Why beg her for 1.6 million when you can demand it straight from him?"

Buzz Cut’s eyes narrowed.

The first man groaned. "I don’t have Goldmann’s number!"

Liam rattled it off. "+1 650 265—"

The call connected.

Then—

"WAAAAH! I WANT MOMMY!" Daisy’s wail exploded like a siren.

"SHUT UP!" the man roared—forgetting the line was live.

On the other end, Nathan’s voice turned glacial. "What. Do. You. Want?"
###Chapter 62

"You— You're Mr. Nathan Goldmann, aren't you?" The voice on the phone was rough, trembling slightly. "If— If you want these kids alive, pay us two million. Otherwise, we'll kill them!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his jaw tightening. His cold gaze flicked to Oliver, who stood beside him, already sensing the urgency.

Oliver didn't hesitate. He grabbed his coat and followed Nathan out of the office without a word.

"I'll pay the ransom," Nathan said, his voice dangerously low. "But if either of them is harmed in any way, you won’t live long enough to regret it." He ended the call with a sharp click and handed the phone to Oliver. "Track it. Now."

On the other end, the kidnapper turned to his partner, a grin spreading across his face. "Boss, Goldmann actually agreed! We're getting paid!"

The man with the brush-cut remained silent, though his eyes narrowed in suspicion.

Nathan Goldmann is willing to pay two million for these brats.

While the two men were distracted, Liam had already managed to cut through the ropes binding his wrists.

Neither noticed as he crept up behind them, his movements silent.

In one swift motion, he snatched the knife from the distracted man’s belt.

The man whirled around—just in time for the blade to sink into his stomach.

"You little—!" The brush-cut man lunged, but Liam twisted away, slashing his arm instead.

Blood dripped onto the floor.

For a boy his age, Liam’s ferocity was terrifying. The brush-cut man hesitated, his bravado faltering under the cold glare of a child who fought like a seasoned killer.

"You think you can take me?" Liam taunted, twirling the knife expertly between his fingers. "Try it."

Sweat beaded on the kidnapper’s forehead.

This kid moves like a trained assassin. And my idiot partner is bleeding out.

"If he dies—"

"I'm a kid," Liam interrupted calmly. "Who’s going to believe I killed him? Even if they do, you kidnapped us first. It’s self-defense."

"Boss… I'm losing too much blood…" The injured man groaned, clutching his wound as crimson seeped through his fingers.

The brush-cut man swallowed hard, weighing his options.

If I rush him, I might end up just as bad as my partner.

Liam smirked, knowing he had the upper hand.

Then—police sirens.

Liam acted fast. He shoved the knife into the brush-cut man’s hand, pressed the blade against his own neck, and dropped to his knees, feigning fear.

"Police! Freeze!"

The door burst open before the kidnapper could react.

"Liam! Daisy!" Angela rushed in, her face pale with relief as she pulled the children into a tight embrace. "Oh my God, you scared me half to death!"

The brush-cut man, now in cuffs, protested wildly. "I didn’t stab him! It was the kid—!"

No one listened.

Outside, a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up.

Nathan stepped out, his sharp eyes scanning the scene before landing on the children. His lips pressed into a thin line as he strode toward them.

Daisy spotted him first. "Mister!"

She sprinted forward and threw her arms around him.

Nathan stiffened for only a second before lifting her into his arms. "I'm sorry I wasn’t faster."

Daisy shook her head, grinning. "It’s okay! We tricked them so the police could come!"

Nathan exhaled, holding her tighter.

Liam watched, his expression unreadable.

But for the first time, Nathan looked at him—really looked at him—and saw something unsettling in the boy’s eyes.

Something dangerous.
###Chapter 63

Nathan was taken aback. "These two are sharp."

But when his gaze landed on Liam, he noticed the boy's cold, distant expression. Frowning, he set Daisy down and approached him.

"Mr. Goldmann, you're here too?" Angela blinked in surprise.

Did he come for the kids as well?

Nathan gave her a brief nod before reaching out to ruffle Liam’s hair—only for the boy to jerk away.

"Don’t touch me," Liam snapped, his voice brittle. "If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have been taken."

Nathan froze.

Because of me?

Daisy rushed over and grabbed Liam’s hand. "Liam, stop!"

"Why should I?" Liam’s eyes burned with unshed tears. "I heard them talking. They did this because of your woman!"

Nathan’s breath hitched.

Oliver’s expression darkened.

His woman… Ms. Vanderbilt?

Slowly, Nathan crouched to Liam’s eye level. The boy’s glare was fierce, his small frame trembling with anger—emotions no child should carry.

Nathan cupped his cheek, thumb brushing away a stray tear. "I’m sorry."

Angela and Oliver exchanged stunned glances.

Mr. Goldmann never apologizes. Not like this.

Liam stayed silent.

Nathan pulled him into an embrace, one hand cradling the back of his head. "This won’t happen again. I promise."

Liam stiffened, then—hesitantly—leaned in. The warmth of Nathan’s arms was unfamiliar, yet comforting.

Is this what a father feels like?

"Mister, me too!" Daisy tugged at Nathan’s sleeve.

With a quiet chuckle, Nathan scooped both children into his arms. "Let’s go home."

At Viana Jewelry

Evelyn was buried in paperwork when her phone buzzed.

Laura? Why now?

She answered, voice cool. "Mrs. Scott. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Laura’s laugh was sharp. "Oh, you sound so unbothered. Those brats must mean nothing to you."

Evelyn’s grip tightened. "What are you talking about?"

"Those two little bastards—bet they’re suffering right now. Or maybe they’re already—"

"Laura," Evelyn cut in, her voice lethally soft. "If you’ve laid a finger on them, I swear—"

"So they are yours!" Laura hissed. "You lied!"

Evelyn’s smile was icy. "And what if they are? Hurt them, and I’ll make sure your precious daughter loses everything—starting with Nathan."

"You wouldn’t dare!"

"Try me." Evelyn leaned back, feigning nonchalance. "After all, if I really wanted him, stealing him from under your nose would be child’s play. I did learn from the best."

Laura’s breath hitched.

Evelyn pressed on. "So here’s the deal: release my children unharmed, or I’ll take Nathan and ruin your family’s reputation. Your choice."

The line went dead.

Evelyn sagged against her desk, knuckles white.

Liam. Daisy. Hold on. Mommy’s coming.
###Chapter 64

"Laura Scott and Vivian Vanderbilt, you're the ones who pushed me to this point first!"

At the Goldmann estate...

A sleek black sedan glided along the tree-lined driveway. Towering sycamores formed a natural canopy overhead, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Ahead, the ornate marble fountain at the circular plaza's center came into view, its cascading waters glistening in the afternoon sun.

Beyond the fountain stood the main residence - a sprawling Gothic Revival mansion that dominated the landscape with its imposing turrets and arched windows. The centuries-old stonework exuded timeless elegance and power.

"Mr. Goldmann, you live here all by yourself?" Daisy's eyes widened as she took in the estate's grandeur, easily three times the size of their own home.

Nathan's lips curved slightly as he watched the children's reactions. "You're welcome to stay whenever you like."

'They'll be living here soon enough anyway.'

Liam turned away sharply. "We're not interested."

Nathan merely smiled in response.

As the car stopped at the grand entrance, the head butler Mr. Chester hurried forward to open the door. His practiced composure faltered the moment he saw the two children inside.

The siblings stepped out one after another. The butler's eyes darted between them and Nathan with barely concealed shock.

"Mr. Goldmann, these children are—"

Nathan ignored the question, ushering the children inside ahead of him.

Oliver approached the flustered butler. "All will become clear in time, Mr. Chester. No need for questions now."

Inside, the double-height foyer took their breath away. A massive crystal chandelier hung from the vaulted ceiling, its prisms casting rainbow patterns across the marble floors. The assembled staff stood at attention, their professional masks slipping at the sight of their employer with two children.

'Mr. Goldmann has children?!'

Daisy immediately bounded onto one of the plush sofas, her small legs swinging freely. Nathan turned to Mr. Chester. "Have the kitchen prepare some snacks."

"Right away, sir." The butler bowed.

Liam's critical gaze swept over the room's displays of antique vases and gilded artifacts. "Our place is cozier. This feels like a museum."

The nearby maid held her breath at the bold remark.

Nathan chuckled. "True. Without a lady of the house, the decor lacks warmth."

The maid nearly choked.

'This is considered lacking?!'

Daisy hopped down and approached Nathan with wide, sparkling eyes. "Then you should come to our house! We don't have a master!"

Her smartwatch chose that moment to light up with an incoming call from "Her Royal Highness."

Nathan's eyes narrowed at the display. Before Liam could react, Nathan grabbed Daisy's wrist and answered the call.

"Mr. Goldmann, it's extremely rude to answer someone else's call!" Daisy protested loudly, deliberately overlapping with Evelyn's greeting from the other end.

The overlapping voices made Evelyn's words unintelligible to Nathan.

Evelyn froze when she heard Daisy's exclamation.

'Mr. Goldmann? Nathan Goldmann?!'

"Mommy, we're fine! Mr. Goldmann saved us. Hello? Hello? Mommy, can you hear me?" Daisy pressed the watch closer to her ear before deliberately ending the call. She blinked up at Nathan with practiced innocence. "The signal must be bad where Mommy is."

Liam exhaled silently. 'That was too close. Almost blew everything.'

Nathan's jaw tightened but he remained silent.

Evelyn's racing heart finally began to calm.

'At least Liam and Daisy are safe. But how did Nathan find them? This can't happen again. I won't give Laura and Vivian another opportunity.'

At Vanderbilt Manor...

"Damn it! The call won't go through!" Vivian paced frantically. "You said they called demanding more money. They wouldn't actually hurt the kids, would they?"
###Chapter 65

Vivian's breath hitched. That witch always kept her promises.

Her nails dug into her palms. "That can't be right. If they're dead, then—"

"No, it can't be!" Laura grabbed her arm, panic lacing her voice. "She made it crystal clear. If those brats die, she'll expose everything from six years ago to Nathan Goldmann. And don't forget—she knows he's the man from that night now."

Vivian's jaw clenched.

Damn it!

She had only meant to threaten Evelyn, but now everything was spiraling out of control.

"Maybe... maybe I should go to Nathan myself," Vivian muttered, pacing. "If I break the news to him first and convince him to search for them, he might not suspect me."

Laura nodded eagerly. "Do it. Now."

Liam and Daisy stared at the lavish spread on the Goldmann mansion's dining table, their eyes wide.

For the first time, they understood what it meant to have everything at their fingertips.

"Mister," Daisy blurted, pointing at the long table, "do you always eat this much food alone?"

Nathan, seated at the head, sliced his steak with effortless grace. "No. This is just for you two today."

He wasn’t one for extravagance, but he refused to let them feel anything less than welcome.

Oliver approached, bending to murmur something in his ear.

Nathan stilled. His expression darkened as he set down his silverware. "Kids, enjoy your meal. I’ll be back."

Liam and Daisy exchanged wary glances as Nathan and Oliver stepped away.

Nathan took the phone from Oliver, his voice low. "What did you find in Cornelia?"

"Mr. Goldmann, we caught a man lurking outside the Bureau of Justice. After interrogation, he confessed—Laura Scott hired him."

Laura Scott. Vivian’s mother.

Nathan’s grip tightened. "Keep watching for anyone suspicious until we have full confirmation."

He handed the phone back, his gaze distant. "I don’t think Vivian was the woman from six years ago."

Oliver stiffened. "Should we reopen the investigation?"

"Find the manager who worked at the Empyrean Hotel that night," Nathan said coldly. "I want answers."

Vivian arrived at the Goldmann mansion, her stomach in knots.

She hadn’t seen Nathan since her failed attempt to seduce him—an embarrassment that still burned. The maids’ smirks haunted her.

Just wait until I’m the lady of this house. I’ll make those servants regret every snicker.

But as she reached the entrance, her blood ran cold.

Oliver and Mr. Chester were ushering Liam and Daisy out.

Vivian’s smile froze.

Liam’s eyes darkened the moment he saw her, his glare dripping with disgust.

Her nails bit into her palms, but she forced a sweet tone. "Oh, thank goodness you’re safe! I heard about the kidnapping—I was so worried!"

Liam scoffed. "Do we know you?"

Her eye twitched. This little bastard dares to humiliate me?

Then Nathan stepped out, his expression icy. "What are you doing here?"

Vivian bit her lip, summoning tears. "Nathan, I came to see you. When I heard about the children, I—I had to make sure they were okay."
###Chapter 66

Nathan felt a pang of pity for Vivian's lack of intelligence.

She had approached him, offered assistance, and confessed knowledge about the kidnapped children.

Didn't that essentially prove her involvement in the case?

Nathan's eyes turned icy. "Who are they to you?"

"Do you know their mother?"

Vivian's expression shifted. How could she have forgotten Nathan hadn't discovered this yet?

"Nathan, I... I overheard people discussing it."

"Who was discussing it?" Nathan's impatience was palpable.

Vivian trembled, her face draining of color. "Nathan, surely you don't suspect me? You know me better than anyone! I would never do something like this!"

Yes, he'd once believed her to be gentle and demure, incapable of crossing moral boundaries.

Yet after six years by his side, he still hadn't uncovered the true nature hidden beneath her carefully constructed facade.

What kind of monster would harm innocent children?

"You shouldn't be here anymore."

Vivian froze in disbelief. "Nathan, are you throwing me out?"

"Throwing you out?" Nathan's gaze was lifeless. "Did you mistake my household for your home? You were merely a guest here."

Just a guest. The words struck Vivian like a physical blow.

"Nathan, I—"

"Oliver, escort her out."

Oliver nodded, stepping between them. "Ms. Vanderbilt, I must ask you to leave. Security won't be as courteous."

Vivian clenched her fists, straightened her posture, and walked away with her head held high. The moment she turned, her expression twisted into something venomous.

She would find a way to claim Nathan for herself.

At Beach Villa—

Daisy returned home and excitedly recounted everything to Caleb, her eyes sparkling with joy.

Caleb's lips twitched. His sister's priorities always circled back to food.

Liam placed his hands on his hips. "So what if his place is huge? It felt cold and empty—nothing like our warm home."

"That's true." Daisy tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Why don't we kidnap Daddy!"

"Kidnap?" Caleb's eyebrows shot up. "How exactly would we manage that?"

"Caleb, you always boast about being the smartest person alive. Can't you figure out something this simple?"

Insulted, Caleb stood on the couch. "A genius mind shouldn't be wasted on such trivial matters. Besides, what about Mommy if we bring him home?"

Their mother still hadn't accepted their father! Daisy had nearly forgotten that crucial detail.

The trio sat in contemplative silence.

Liam broke it first. "On TV, when people get locked in a room together, things happen. We could try that—lock them in a room."

Caleb and Daisy exchanged surprised glances. Liam, who rarely participated in their schemes, had actually contributed a brilliant idea!

"Alright, let's do it."

Later that night—

The first floor of an exclusive club was swiftly cleared, with a dozen black-suited bodyguards lining the corridors. No unauthorized person could approach the private room.

A middle-aged man was escorted inside by security. When he saw the imposing figure seated like a king, his face fell. "M-Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan sat with his legs crossed, fingers steepled on his knee. His voice was glacial. "I'll ask one final time. Who was the woman from six years ago?"
###Chapter 67

The middle-aged man trembled, his face pale. He had already taken $160,000 from Laura. If he betrayed her now, he would—

N?velDrama.Org owns this.

"It was… it was Ms. Vivian Vanderbilt."

The bodyguard forced him to his knees, pressing the cold barrel of a gun against his temple.

The man’s muscles tensed like a drawn bowstring, his pulse hammering in his throat. One wrong move, and he’d be meeting his maker. The money didn’t matter anymore.

His lips quivered as he struggled to speak. "That night… I—I—It was—"

The sharp click of the weapon made his bladder nearly give out. "It wasn’t Ms. Vivian! B-But I swear, I don’t know who it was!"

He was telling the truth. He had no idea who the woman was. All he remembered was that Nathan Goldmann had entered the room shortly after her.

Nathan didn’t care about the rest. He had the answer he needed.

He leaned forward, his voice dangerously calm. "Six years ago, you told me it was Vivian."

"I lied!" The man’s voice cracked. "Mrs. Scott paid me $160,000 to say that! I couldn’t refuse her, but I didn’t want to cross you either!"

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "What happened to the woman?"

"I—I don’t know! Ms. Vivian said she was drunk. I checked—she was unconscious. A real beauty. Ms. Vivian brought her there to rest."

He hesitated, then added, "When she left, she handed me the room key. I thought it was strange, but she told me to give it to a real estate tycoon named Victor Baldwin. But… I messed up. I accidentally gave it to your assistant instead. I only realized the next day when I checked the records."

It hadn’t seemed like a big deal at the time. But then Laura paid him to swear the woman in the room was Vivian, no matter who asked.

Nathan straightened. "You can go."

The man blinked, his legs shaking as he stood. "R-Really?"

Nathan gave him a chilling look. "Unless you’d rather stay."

The man bolted.

Oliver stepped forward. "Mr. Goldmann, should I look into Victor?"

"No. He’s irrelevant."

Finally, the truth about that night six years ago was clear.

Two days later…

Evelyn and Gregory sat in her office, finalizing the launch announcement for Soul. They had settled on the 9th of next month.

"Just like you said," Gregory mused, "Viana is a sinking ship. No new designs in years, stagnant funds. Even with Nathan Goldmann’s backing, they won’t last."

"They’ll collapse on their own," Gregory agreed, watching Evelyn.

Her eyes gleamed. "Viana’s already finished. But I want to push Soul further ahead."
###Chapter 68

"Explain what's happening at Viana Jewelry!" Richard's voice thundered across the office as he slammed the financial report onto his mahogany desk. "I entrusted you with this company to learn management. Where has all the capital disappeared to?"

The accounting director's urgent call had revealed staggering losses - $900,000 vanished from their accounts.

Nathan Goldmann's initial investment of $1.6 million had been nearly halved in just weeks.

Laura rushed to Vivian's defense, placing a protective hand on her daughter's shoulder. "Richard, how can you blame Zoe for this? She's completely inexperienced in jewelry business matters. This clearly wasn't her fault if someone took advantage."

"I expected her to learn!" Richard's face flushed with anger. Vivian clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. The constant criticism was becoming unbearable.

Seeing her daughter's distress, Laura saw an opportunity. "If Vivian isn't suited for this role, why not recall Evelyn? She's our top designer. Viana would thrive under her leadership again."

"Isn't she still working there?" Richard frowned.

Laura's lips curled slightly. "Darling, Evelyn resigned the day of your argument about the shares."

Richard's eyebrows shot up, though the reason wasn't surprising.

"Evelyn went to work directly for Mr. Goldmann," Laura continued smoothly. "He established an entire new jewelry company just for her. Even Vivian never received such preferential treatment from her future brother-in-law."

Laura wouldn't miss this chance to separate Evelyn from Nathan. She needed that girl far away from the Goldmann heir.

Richard's expression darkened. "I'll speak with Evelyn."

Satisfaction glimmered in Laura's eyes. Once Evelyn returned, she'd make sure the girl and her illegitimate siblings disappeared for good.

Gregory entered after finishing a call in the hallway. "I've made contact. He's agreed to assist us. Don't worry - he's completely trustworthy."

Evelyn nodded decisively. "Send him my design drafts immediately."

Gregory hesitated. "But these were created for Soul Jewelry's brand launch. Why give them to Viana?"

A knowing smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Trust me, I have a plan."

Understanding dawned on Gregory's face. It was brilliant - she was setting Viana up for a plagiarism scandal. When Vivian's mismanagement became public, Richard and the board would turn on her.

After Gregory left, Evelyn organized her documents when realization struck.

Two days had passed - Nathan should have received the DNA test results by now.

She took the elevator to the administrative floor, checking her watch. According to his schedule, Nathan shouldn't be in his office at this hour.

The massive office stood empty when she entered after knocking received no response.

Evelyn approached his desk, carefully examining the organized chaos. In the top drawer, she found an opened envelope labeled 'DNA Analysis'.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she extracted the document. The page appeared blank except for one embossed line in gold foil: 'This office is under 24/7 video surveillance.'
###Chapter 69

Evelyn's gaze slowly lifted to the security camera in the corner, its red light blinking ominously. Had she been under surveillance this entire time, or had she just walked straight into a trap? "Looking for something, Mr. Goldmann?"

A shadow moved across the doorway, sending icy shivers down Evelyn's spine. Her eyes locked onto Nathan standing there, clutching a different envelope with horror etched across his chiseled features.

Nathan had received the DNA report from Cornelia thirty minutes earlier. The bold red letters screamed 'MATCH CONFIRMED' - undeniable proof that Liam and Daisy were his biological children.

Six years. Six damn years he'd been unaware that he'd fathered twins. And fate had cruelly placed them right under his nose. If he hadn't investigated, would he ever have discovered the truth about their mother?

"You're quite the schemer," Nathan's voice was dangerously calm. "You switched the reports, didn't you?"

Evelyn forced her breathing to steady. Panicking now would be fatal. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

Nathan advanced like a predator, his emerald eyes narrowing. "Still playing games?"

"Why would I tamper with your DNA results?" Evelyn countered smoothly, placing the documents she'd brought on his desk. "I came to deliver these files. If you'll excuse me."

As she turned to leave, Nathan's muscular arm blocked her path. His large hand clamped around her wrist, forcing her backward until the edge of the desk dug into her spine.

Evelyn arched away. "What do you think you're doing?"

Nathan closed the distance between them, his breath warm against her cheek. "What does it look like?"

"Have you developed feelings for me?" Evelyn's crimson lips curved into a mocking smile. "Falling for Vanderbilt women twice would be... unfortunate."

"I've already reaped the rewards. Why should I care?"

Evelyn froze at his implication. She shoved against his chest. "I don't have time for your games, Mr. Goldmann. If you're bored, call Vivian over."

"You do it."

Evelyn almost laughed. Mentioning Vivian always got a reaction from him. "Fine, I'll call her then."

She reached for her phone, but Nathan snatched it from her grasp and tossed it onto the nearby sofa.

"Nathan Goldmann, you—" Evelyn grabbed his collar angrily, but his smoldering gaze dropped to her lips.

Desire darkened his eyes as one hand cradled the back of her neck, pulling her forward. Without hesitation, he captured her mouth in a searing kiss.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. She pushed against him with all her strength. "Have you lost your mind? How dare you— Mmph!"

His lips silenced her protest, cold at first but rapidly heating up. The more she struggled, the more possessive his kiss became.

The taste of copper filled their mouths as Evelyn bit down hard. Nathan flinched but didn't release her, remembering how the mystery woman from that fateful night had fought him too, even in her drugged state.

Realizing resistance was futile, Evelyn suddenly went still. Over Nathan's shoulder, she spotted a silhouette in the doorway.

With calculated precision, Evelyn wrapped her arms around Nathan's neck and kissed him back passionately, her icy gaze locked on the shocked woman watching them.
###Chapter 70

Vivian was consumed by raging jealousy!

"Nathan!"

Nathan slowly released Evelyn, his expression darkening. So that's why she had kissed him back.

He turned to glare at Vivian. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn wiped her smudged lipstick from her lips, the smeared crimson making her look deliciously provocative. She gripped Nathan's collar, arching an eyebrow with a smirk. "You could use more practice with your kissing technique."

Nathan's face darkened further. Was she mocking him?

Evelyn moved to leave but froze when Richard suddenly appeared behind Vivian.

Richard paled at the sight of his disheveled daughter in a room with Nathan, whose lip was bleeding from their passionate exchange.

"Evelyn, how... how could you—" Richard's rage overwhelmed him, causing him to collapse onto the floor.

"Dad!"

Seeing Vivian rush to her father's side, Evelyn found her feet rooted to the spot.

Leaning against the hospital corridor wall, Evelyn looked utterly lost.

She'd admit she'd lost control because of Nathan's actions. She'd wanted to provoke Vivian deliberately, but she never expected her father to witness it.

"Evelyn, your father is asking for you."

Laura emerged to summon her.

Evelyn lifted her head and entered the room where Vivian was playing the perfect daughter by Richard's bedside.

Richard's expression twisted upon seeing her. "You disgraceful girl, kneel!"

"Are you sure you want me to kneel?" Evelyn remained unmoving.

Richard grabbed a cup from the bedside table and hurled it at her, striking her squarely on the forehead.

Evelyn staggered momentarily before steadying herself.

Richard turned away. "You know what you've done. You knew Vivian was with Nathan, yet you— I'm so disappointed."

"When have you ever not been disappointed in me?" The physical pain barely registered through her numbness. "I'm accustomed to your disappointment. One more time makes no difference."

"Evelyn, can't you show even a shred of remorse?"

"Who here truly deserves to feel remorse?" Her pointed words were aimed at Laura. A truly remorseful woman wouldn't have entangled herself with a married man.

"At least I didn't climb into Nathan's bed."

"Mr. Vanderbilt, I fail to see how my actions were wrong. When someone frames me, I return the favor tenfold. Today's events were nothing." Evelyn's icy gaze shifted to Vivian, who flinched.

Vivian lowered her head, jaw clenched. No, she wouldn't surrender so easily.

"Zoe, Father just wants you to return to Viana."

"You've forfeited the right to speak."

Vivian blanched at Evelyn's sharp retort.

Richard took a steadying breath. "Zoe, if you want Viana's shares, I'll give them to you. Enough games."

Evelyn burst into bitter laughter. "You choose to return Viana when it's become an empty shell? So I can clean up after your bastard daughter's mess?"

"Evelyn! Have you lost all decency? Vivian is your sister!"

"My mother only bore one daughter." Evelyn turned to leave but paused at the doorway. "Remember what I said—I'm no longer a Vanderbilt. Since you adore this daughter of yours, cherish her well."
###Chapter 71

Evelyn walked out of the hospital room without a backward glance.

Vivian rushed after her, catching up at the elevator bank. "Evelyn Vanderbilt! Stop right there!"

Turning sharply, Evelyn's eyes burned crimson. "Why should I? Because your pathetic attempt to manipulate me failed, you dragged our father to Goldmann Group to beg me to return to Viana?"

'And now he's lying unconscious in that hospital bed. This is all her fault.'

Vivian's jaw clenched with barely contained rage. "Father insisted on coming to reason with you himself. You're the one who provoked him into collapsing!"

"Evelyn, to Father, Nathan and I belong together. Do the smart thing and resign from Goldmann Group. Or I'll make sure those two little bastards of yours—Ugh!"

Evelyn's hand shot out, slamming Vivian against the wall by her throat. Her gaze turned arctic. "Try it. I dare you."

"You think I won't? Go ahead—strangle me right here!" Vivian's lips twisted into a vicious smirk.

"Death would be too merciful." Evelyn leaned in until their noses almost touched, her smile chilling. "I want to watch you drown in despair. Six years ago. My children. You'll pay for everything. And I won't make you wait long."

She flung Vivian to the floor, looking down at her with icy contempt. "Pray Viana Jewelry survives bankruptcy. Let's see how long Father protects his useless bastard daughter then."

The elevator doors closed behind Evelyn's retreating figure.

Vivian trembled with impotent rage, her hatred for Evelyn burning like acid in her veins.

'How dare she act so superior! Those brats are her only leverage. Once they're gone, she'll crawl at my feet!'

Outside the hospital, Evelyn pressed fingers to her throbbing temple. Only now did the pain register.

Spotting Nathan emerging from his car, she immediately turned away.

He caught her wrist in one swift motion. "Running away?"

"Mr. Goldmann, didn't you get exactly what you wanted today?" Evelyn tried wrenching free. "The performance is over."

"Over?" Nathan spun her around, gripping her chin. "You came to my office for the DNA results. Shall I tell you what they say?"

Evelyn's expression flickered briefly before smoothing into indifference. "Irrelevant. Even if they're biologically yours, they'll never—"

"You were that woman six years ago." Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

'My children bear the Vanderbilt name. The woman that night wasn't Vivian. Only one possibility remains—Evelyn Vanderbilt.'

'Her words about being the victim that night... they align perfectly with my investigation.'

Evelyn met his scorching stare for a long moment before finally speaking. "No."

Nathan's jaw tightened, storm clouds gathering in his eyes. "Do you know the consequences of lying to me?"

"Deny it now if you wish. But when I have proof, you'll answer for these lies." His thumb brushed her lower lip. "Never forget—those children are mine too."

Evelyn's fists clenched at her sides. "Is this a threat, Nathan?"

His silence was answer enough.

'Would threats even work? This woman yields to nothing. Except perhaps... for those children.'
###Chapter 72

Nathan let out a derisive snort. "Consider that a threat if you must. Do you honestly believe you can slip away from me right under my nose?"

Evelyn found herself at a loss for words.

The following morning...

Evelyn entered the company building at her usual punctual hour when she spotted Nathan and Oliver rounding the corner toward her.

The faint bite marks on Nathan's lips still showed traces of yesterday's encounter, with a small scab forming where she'd reacted most fiercely.

She considered turning away, but it was too late.

Avoiding eye contact, Evelyn forced an indifferent smile. "Good morning, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan studied her for a prolonged moment before speaking through perfect teeth. "I expected you'd try to avoid me."

"We work in the same building. Occasional encounters are inevitable." Evelyn maintained her practiced smile. "Besides, I've done nothing shameful that would warrant avoidance."

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. 'That smile is completely fake. She's always wearing masks around me. I've seen her genuine smiles before - just never directed at me.'

His mind flashed to the mysterious "man" she'd been speaking with during those phone calls.

"I have work to attend to. Excuse me." Evelyn turned abruptly, entering the elevator before he could respond.

To her astonishment, Nathan followed her inside. Even Oliver stood dumbfounded as his boss abandoned his private elevator to squeeze into the crowded staff lift.

Evelyn shot him a questioning look. "Mr. Goldmann, isn't this elevator beneath your usual standards?"

"I enjoy experiencing different perspectives occasionally," Nathan replied casually, pressing the door close button before Oliver could join them.

Evelyn remained silent, subtly shifting away from him.

Noticing her movement, Nathan's expression darkened. "Do you find my proximity so distasteful?"

"You misunderstand, Mr. Goldmann." Evelyn kept her tone light. "I simply wish to avoid office gossip. As an engaged man, you should be equally mindful of appearances."

Nathan's jaw tightened. 'Is she mocking my arrangement with Vivian?'

Yet her apparent concern about Vivian pleased him, and his lips curved slightly. "I've never publicly acknowledged Vivian as my fiancée. If it troubles you, I could easily announce that you—"

The elevator doors slid open, revealing several shocked employees who froze at the sight of their CEO.

Nathan's expression immediately darkened. "Are you boarding or not?"

The employees scrambled inside nervously.

'Dear God, why is Mr. Goldmann riding the staff elevator?!' The atmosphere grew suffocatingly tense.

No one dared speak or even breathe too loudly. Being trapped in an elevator with their intimidating CEO was everyone's worst nightmare - they collectively willed the elevator to move faster.

Evelyn found herself pressed against the wall as everyone instinctively crowded away from Nathan's side.

'Damn it! Why is everyone crushing toward me?!'

Without warning, Nathan reached out and pulled Evelyn to his side. When she tried to pull away, his grip tightened.

Since no one dared look directly at their CEO, the interaction went unnoticed.

Evelyn's arm stiffened in his grasp. Under different circumstances, she would have slapped him.

'First the office yesterday, now this? He's becoming completely shameless!'

Her pulse suddenly quickened as Nathan loosened his grip slightly, only to slide his hand down and interlace their fingers. Evelyn turned sharply to glare at him, but Nathan kept his gaze forward, though she caught the faintest smirk playing at his lips.
###Chapter 73

The moment the last staff member disappeared through the elevator doors, Evelyn let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Nathan still had her wrist in his grip, his fingers warm and unyielding.

She tilted her head, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "Mr. Goldmann? Do you have a thing for public spectacles?"

His gaze darkened, the intensity in his eyes sending a shiver down her spine. "Would you like to find out just how exciting things can get?"

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered.

This man wouldn’t dare—

Before she could react, Nathan spun her around, pinning her against the wall with one arm braced beside her head. His body caged her in, leaving no room to escape.

"Let me go, Goldmann," she hissed, lifting her knee in warning.

But he was faster. His hand clamped around her thigh, pressing it back down with effortless strength. The position was beyond compromising—it was downright scandalous.

"Nathan Goldmann," she growled, fury flashing in her eyes.

The elevator dinged.

The doors slid open to reveal two wide-eyed employees, their jaws dropping at the sight before them. Papers fluttered to the floor as they scrambled backward, abandoning all thought of stepping inside.

Evelyn’s face burned.

Nathan, however, merely straightened his tie and stepped back, his expression infuriatingly calm.

"Exciting enough for you?" he drawled before strolling out as if nothing had happened.

Evelyn stormed into her office and hurled her bag onto the couch. "That arrogant, insufferable—!"

Gregory walked in just as her foot connected with the desk. He blinked. "Bad day?"

She exhaled sharply, forcing her hands to her sides. "Just someone testing my patience."

"Vivian?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Vivian doesn’t have the power to get under my skin like this." She dropped into her chair, fingers drumming against the armrest.

Gregory hesitated before speaking. "I gave your designs to our contact. He should be meeting Vivian today."

A slow smirk curved her lips. "Perfect. Father’s desperate to fix Viana’s financial mess. Right now, any lifeline looks like salvation."

She leaned back, satisfaction curling in her chest.

Let Vivian play the queen a little longer.

Viana Jewelry

Glass shattered as Vivian swept everything off her desk in one furious motion.

She hadn’t slept since Nathan had thrown her out of the Goldmann mansion.

And that scene in his office—Evelyn in his arms, his mouth on hers—it played on loop in her mind, each repetition fueling her rage.

Six years. Six years by his side, and he’d never so much as touched her.

But Evelyn? One look, and he was consumed.

Her nails dug into her palms.

If the board found out Nathan had withdrawn his support, she’d lose everything.

Viana was already drowning in debt. Without him, she’d be nothing.

I won’t let Evelyn win.

A knock interrupted her spiral.

"Ms. Vanderbilt," an assistant murmured. "A designer from Hailey & Co. is here to see you."

Vivian forced her breathing to steady. "Send him in."

Moments later, a flamboyantly dressed man sauntered in, his assistant trailing behind. He flashed a dazzling smile. "Ms. Vanderbilt, what an honor."

Vivian blinked. "You… know me?"

He handed her a business card with a flourish. "Who doesn’t know the woman favored by Nathan Goldmann?"

Her fingers tightened around the card.

This could be exactly what she needed.
###Chapter 74

Frederick Fuller, the senior designer at Hailey & Co. Jewelry, stood before Vivian Vanderbilt with a confident smile. Knowing that Vivian was Nathan Goldmann's girlfriend made this meeting even more satisfying.

The entire city of Bassburgh knew about Nathan's relationship status. Hailey & Co. was a prestigious name in the industry, and Vivian couldn't help but imagine her father's impressed expression when Viana Jewelry secured this collaboration.

After ten minutes of discussion, Frederick slid several sketches across the table. "These represent my latest collection - 'The Radiance of Eternity.' It's my first attempt at blending retro Gothic elements with contemporary design language."

Vivian's eyes widened as she examined the intricate drawings.

'If only Viana had designs like these earlier, we wouldn't be struggling so much! Evelyn could never produce anything this exquisite. Frederick's talent completely overshadows hers!'

Later that afternoon, Vivian presented the signed contract to her father, Richard Vanderbilt.

Richard's face lit up with pride when he realized his daughter had secured Hailey & Co.'s top designer. "Vivian, my dear, you never cease to amaze me. I knew I could count on you."

Vivian wrapped her arms around her father's arm affectionately. "It's nothing special, Father. I'm just doing my part for the Vanderbilts and Viana."

"You've always been the responsible one." Richard sighed, his thoughts drifting to his other daughter, Evelyn.

It wasn't that he didn't love Evelyn. But her continuous disappointments had worn him down. Six years ago, he'd hoped sending her away would teach her humility. Instead, she'd returned more cunning than ever.

"Speaking of which," Richard hesitated, "how are things progressing with Mr. Goldmann?"

Vivian's smile faltered. "Father... I'm afraid I've failed you in this matter. Nathan seems to prefer Evelyn's company."

Richard's expression darkened. "Are you telling me Mr. Goldmann chose Evelyn over you?"

Vivian lowered her eyes dramatically. "They've been... involved for quite some time. Evelyn made me promise not to tell anyone. She... she's even borne his children."

"What?!" Richard's voice thundered through the study.

'How could my own daughter sink to such disgraceful behavior!'

"Father, please don't blame Zoe," Vivian whispered, using Evelyn's childhood nickname. "Perhaps it's my fault for being the illegitimate one."

"Don't say that!" Richard grasped her shoulders firmly. "There's no such thing as illegitimate in this household. You're a Vanderbilt as much as anyone, and I won't have you thinking otherwise!"

His mind raced with anger. 'If Evelyn truly bore Mr. Goldmann's children behind Vivian's back, this betrayal is unforgivable!'

Meanwhile, at ckgold Group headquarters...

Oliver Lawson approached Nathan's desk with a sealed envelope. "Mr. Goldmann, we've recovered the surveillance footage from Empyrean Hotel that night."

Nathan examined the documents carefully. The timestamp showed that fateful evening six years ago. The woman clinging to Vivian looked hauntingly familiar.

Flipping to the next page, Nathan froze. The profile shot clearly showed Evelyn Vanderbilt's features.

The final image captured Vivian leaving the room alone.

Now everything made sense. Evelyn had been the one in that hotel room all along.

This explained why he'd only encountered Vivian when he went searching later - Evelyn had already been banished from the Vanderbilt estate by then.
###Chapter 75

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she adjusted the Gothic-style gown on the mannequin. The intricate lace and dark velvet fabric contrasted sharply with the sterile white walls of her office at "Soul" Jewelry Studio.

Nathan Goldmann leaned against the doorframe, his piercing gaze tracing the curve of her spine.

She has no idea how captivating she is when she's focused.

Even in a modest dress, the memory of her in that crimson gown at the gala burned in his mind—the way the fabric clung to her curves, the way every man in the room had watched her. His jaw clenched.

Evelyn turned, expecting to see Gregory with the measuring tape. Instead, she froze.

Him. Again.

She forced a polite smile. "Mr. Goldmann. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

His lips curved, but his eyes remained unreadable. "What do you think?"

Her pulse spiked. She could step back—but that would only provoke him.

Fine. If he wants to play, I’ll play.

With deliberate slowness, she closed the distance between them. Her fingers lifted, brushing his chin. His eyes darkened.

"Tell me," she murmured, tilting her head. "Are you really this obsessed with me?"

His expression didn’t waver. "You flatter yourself."

She laughed, low and throaty. "Oh, please. A woman like me? Gorgeous, intelligent, dangerous—of course you’re tempted." Her fingers trailed down to the first button of his suit. "If you want me so badly, I could always—"

His hand snapped around her wrist. "Careful, Evelyn. You’re treading on thin ice."

She smirked. "I don’t know the meaning of caution. Maybe you should teach me."

His grip tightened. Then, without warning, he guided her hand lower—to his belt buckle.

Her breath hitched.

"Isn’t this more efficient?" His voice was a dark whisper.

Earlier that day, Nathan had stood in his office, staring at the damning report Oliver had handed him.

Victor Baldwin.

The name alone made his blood run cold.

"Sir," Oliver said carefully, "there’s more. The night Evelyn was drugged at the lounge—Vivian was the one who took her there. And the man waiting for her? Victor Baldwin."

Nathan’s fingers curled into fists.

Victor wasn’t just some minor player. He was a predator—one who had set his sights on Evelyn years ago.

"From today," Nathan said icily, "Baldwin’s Imperial Real Estate ceases to exist in Bassburgh."

Now, in her studio, Evelyn’s bravado faltered.

Nathan’s thumb traced her pulse point, feeling the rapid flutter beneath her skin.

"Nervous?" he taunted.

She swallowed. Damn it.

She had meant to disgust him, to push him away—but he wasn’t backing down.

And worse?

She wasn’t sure she wanted him to.
###Chapter 76

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. She'd been completely played!

She jerked her wrist free from his grasp. "That wasn't funny at all."

Turning on her heel, she tried to storm out, but Nathan's strong arms caught her, spinning her back and pressing her firmly against the wall.

Her struggling hands were effortlessly pinned above her head. She glared up at him, breath coming in short gasps. "Nathan Goldmann, if you dare—"

"Weren't you the one begging for lessons?" Nathan murmured, his breath hot against her ear as his wandering hand found the clasp of her dress.

The cool metal gave way with a quiet click.

His fingers traced icy paths across her exposed skin, making her shiver violently. "Nathan!" she hissed through clenched teeth.

He captured her lips in a searing kiss, swallowing her protests.

No! Evelyn writhed in his grasp. Her dress hung precariously off one shoulder, but worse than her compromised clothing was her traitorous body's response.

Anticipating her bite, he pulled back just in time, leaving her teeth snapping at empty air. In that split second of freedom, her hand flew up—

Only to be caught mid-swing.

Nathan crushed her against him, his voice a dangerous growl. "Still want those lessons, princess?"

Realization dawned on Evelyn as she glanced down. Her lips trembled. "N-no. I'm sorry. Please let me go."

Seeing genuine surrender in her eyes, Nathan released her, carefully adjusting her dress back into place. "Never use that tone with a man again," he warned. "You're not ready for where that leads."

When the door clicked shut behind him, Evelyn slid down the wall, knees giving out. Fear coiled in her stomach—not just of him, but of her own reactions.

'Belonging'? The word echoed mockingly in her mind.

'Does he do this with Vivian too?'

She wasn't some purity-obsessed prude, but the thought of her stepsister being part of this twisted game turned her stomach.

Meanwhile, under the icy spray of his shower...

Nathan braced one forearm against the tiles, letting freezing water cascade over his sculpted frame. Droplets clung to his dark lashes as he fought for control.

That damnable taste from six years ago still haunted him. No matter how hard he tried, Vivian couldn't erase Evelyn from his senses.

Wrapping a towel around his waist, Nathan emerged to find his phone vibrating. The screen illuminated Vivian's name, and his expression darkened.

Across town at The Grand Imperial...

Sophia struggled to manage three excited children at the lobster buffet. "Caleb, stop poking your sister with the crab fork!"

"Godmother," Caleb announced suddenly, "we need to kidnap Daddy!"

Sophia choked on her champagne. "Your... Daddy?"

Daisy nodded enthusiastically. "It's a secret! Uncle Goldmann is really our daddy!"

Sophia's fork clattered to her plate. All of Zoe's sacrifices... for nothing?

"How... how did you figure this out so quickly?" Sophia managed.

Liam calmly wiped his mouth. "Simple DNA test. But you can't tell Mommy. She probably doesn't know yet."

Even if she did know, Sophia doubted Zoe would be celebrating.

Sophia sighed, pushing her plate away. "Kids... your mom already knows."

Three pairs of wide eyes locked onto her.

"Godmother!" Caleb gasped. "Why didn't you tell us?"
###Chapter 77

Daisy crossed her arms with an exaggerated pout. "How could you keep secrets from us? Hmph!"

Liam stood frozen, at a loss for words.

Sophia raised a finger to her lips, glancing around nervously. "It wasn't intentional! If your mother found out, do you think she'd go easy on me?"

Caleb nodded slowly. 'Mom would definitely make her life difficult.'

"Don't worry," Daisy chirped, bouncing on her toes. "You've been super nice to us. We won't let Mommy hurt you."

"Did Mother specifically forbid us from knowing?" Liam's voice remained calm but carried an edge of curiosity.

Sophia gave a tight nod. "Your mother had her reasons. You know about Mr. Goldmann and Vivian." She lowered her voice further. "Truth is, your mother's pushing Nathan away because of that woman."

Three heads bobbed in understanding. They'd suspected as much.

'Mom can't accept Dad because of her.'

Which meant they needed to bring their father home before their mother officially kicked him out.

Caleb's smartwatch buzzed against his wrist. He rolled up his sleeve to check the screen. The coordinates flashed brightly - their target was dangerously close!

When they'd first obtained their father's number, Caleb had secretly activated a tracker. Now it showed Nathan was in this very restaurant!

"Daddy's here," Caleb whispered urgently to Liam. "I'm going to check it out." He stood abruptly. "I need to use the restroom."

"Don't wander off!" Liam warned.

Caleb slipped away, following the blinking dot on his watch.

In the VIP lounge...

"I'm sorry, Nathan, but it wasn't my idea! You know how my mother always pushed us together. She just... made a mistake."

"Still blaming others?" Nathan's voice could have frozen hell. "This isn't your first lie, Vivian. I think you've made it a habit."

Vivian paled, her lips trembling.

"The woman from six years ago was Evelyn, not you, correct?" Nathan's accusation turned her blood to ice. He knew.

That bitch must have told him!

"Nathan, I—"

Nathan stood, cutting her off. "I've heard enough. Vivian, I've given you more than you deserved these past six years. Be grateful. Don't contact me again."

Vivian's grip tightened around her silverware until her knuckles turned white.

As Nathan moved to leave, sudden dizziness overwhelmed him. His vision swam as he braced against the table. The half-finished coffee... the waiter had brought it specially.

"Nathan, what's wrong?"

Vivian knew the drugs were taking effect. She rose to steady him, but Nathan shoved her away violently.

"You dare drug me?!"

"Because I love you!" Vivian's voice broke. "Six years by your side and you've never touched me!"

She couldn't hold back anymore. She would have him tonight.

Watching Nathan collapse onto the couch, a thrill ran through her. The specially imported aphrodisiac worked faster than expected.

With trembling fingers, she peeled off her dress and climbed atop him. "Nathan, if you want children, I'll give you a dozen. Once I'm carrying your heir, you'll have to marry me!" Her lips descended toward his.
###Chapter 78

Click!

The sharp sound of a camera shutter echoed from beyond the door, sending Vivian into instant panic. Her head snapped up.

The door stood slightly ajar.

No. She'd been photographed.

Vivian gritted her teeth, hastily straightened her dress, and stormed outside. Who dared take pictures of her?

She'd finally managed to slip something into Nathan's drink. She'd been so close to claiming him when someone ruined everything!

A faint rustling came from the stairwell. Got you now.

She burst through the emergency exit but found the corridor empty. Then—thwack—something hard struck the back of her neck. She crumpled to the floor.

Caleb lowered the wooden rod, dusting off his hands. "You're not worthy of Daddy."

A wicked grin spread across his face as he recalled how this woman had framed his mother years ago. Spotting a waiter with a tray, he sprinted over. "Sir! My aunt fainted from low blood sugar. Could you help me get her to a room?"

The server assisted Caleb in carrying Vivian to a guest suite. "Thank you," Caleb said sweetly as the man left.

Alone, Caleb rifled through Vivian's purse, extracting a stack of business cards. Using her phone, he dialed a number and deepened his voice: "Grand Imperial Room V3033. Hurry."

Caleb smirked. Payback time—this was exactly how she'd set up his mother six years ago.

Next, he called Liam about their father's situation. When Liam hung up, his gaze locked onto Sophia, who was happily devouring dessert.

Sophia froze under his intense stare. "Liam...why are you looking at me like that?"

Liam's smile turned devious. "We need your help." Sophia's fork clattered onto her plate. That smile never meant anything good.

At Beach Villa—

Sophia directed two bodyguards to haul the unconscious Nathan into the house.

Oh God. Zoe would murder her for this.

She'd become an accomplice to kidnapping! These three little demons had roped her into abducting their father!

Daisy swayed cheerfully. "Don't worry, we won't rat you out!"

Sophia laughed nervously. "What have I gotten myself into?"

She should never have crossed Zoe.

Checking her watch, Sophia bolted up. "Your mom's due home soon. I'm out."

"Bye!" the children chorused.

"Don't you dare snitch!" Sophia hissed while backing toward the door.

"Scout's honor!" Caleb gave a thumbs-up.

Nathan lay in the ice-filled bathtub, his skin frighteningly hot. Liam added more ice while Daisy pressed a small hand to his forehead. "He's still burning up. What now?"

"That witch did this to him," Caleb growled.

Liam stood abruptly. "Take Daisy out. I'll help Dad change."

"Hey! Why can't I watch?" Daisy pouted.

Caleb facepalmed. "Good girls don't stare at naked men. Out!" He herded her out the door.

Together, the brothers stripped their father down to his boxers, the icy water lapping at his feverish skin.
###Chapter 79

The moment the last piece came off, Caleb and Liam's eyes widened in shock.

"Why are ours so tiny?" Caleb pouted, comparing the sizes.

Liam shrugged. "Maybe we'll grow into them."

Nathan's eyelids fluttered as consciousness returned. The world came into focus with disjointed sounds - splashing water, childish giggles, and the squeak of rubber ducks. He found himself submerged in a bubble-filled bathtub, surrounded by floating yellow ducks.

Blinking against the light, he saw two identical boys arguing by the tub's edge.

"Caleb?" Nathan's voice came out hoarse.

The twins turned simultaneously, their matching blue eyes widening. Nathan's breath caught. The resemblance was uncanny - same tousled brown hair, same stubborn chin. Only the faint mole beneath Liam's left eye distinguished them.

"They're triplets," Nathan realized aloud. A wry smile touched his lips. "That woman's been playing quite the game."

"You're awake!" Caleb beamed.

Outside the bathroom door, Daisy's excited shout echoed through the house. "He's up!"

Liam quickly shoved her back. "No peeking!"

Nathan glanced down at his bare torso, grateful the children had been the ones to undress him. The memory of Vivian's betrayal still burned fresh. He'd underestimated her cunning.

"Where am I?" he asked, rubbing his temples.

"Our home!" Caleb announced proudly.

Nathan froze. Their home meant... His thoughts raced as Caleb produced a plush navy bathrobe. "We had Aunt Sophia's bodyguards get this for you. We don't keep men's clothes here."

"No men's clothes?" Nathan arched a brow, slipping into the robe.

Liam crossed his arms. "Just Caleb and me. We're Mommy's only men."

The confirmation struck Nathan like a physical blow. That night he'd overheard Evelyn on the phone - she'd been talking to her children. The realization sent equal parts fury and admiration through him.

Stepping into the living room, Nathan took in the cozy space. A grand piano dominated one corner, its shelves overflowing with trophies all engraved "Caleb Vanderbilt."

"Why did you bring me here?" Nathan studied the three expectant faces.

The children exchanged glances. Liam stepped forward boldly. "To see if you could be our dad."

Nathan's lips twitched. "What if I already am?"

Three mouths fell open in perfect synchrony. "You knew?!" Daisy gasped.

Nathan's jaw tightened. So Evelyn had kept this from him deliberately. His fingers curled into fists before small hands tugged at his sleeve.

"Please don't be mad at Mommy," Daisy whispered, eyes shimmering. "She stayed away because you were with that mean Vivian lady."

The plea deflated Nathan's anger. Kneeling, he smoothed Daisy's hair. "I won't be mad," he promised, though his mind already raced with plans. Evelyn Vanderbilt had some explaining to do.
###Chapter 80

Nathan wasn't planning to meet her, but he certainly wasn't going to let her escape either.

Evelyn stormed out of the studio in frustration. When she checked her phone, she discovered the message Daisy had sent her an hour earlier.

Her breath hitched as she opened the text.

'Mommy, we've kidnapped Daddy and brought him home. See you soon!'

Evelyn sped home like a woman possessed. Finding the living room empty, she rushed straight to the children's bedroom.

The door was firmly locked.

"Open this door right now!" Evelyn pounded on the wood. The three little traitors had barricaded themselves inside, refusing to budge.

Their mother clearly wasn't willing to accept their father. Today, they were determined to make him convince her.

"Fine! Stay in there! I'm getting the spare key." Evelyn scoffed.

Unbelievable. Her own children had chosen to hide that man in their room!

She returned with the key, fury radiating from every pore, but froze when she saw the man sitting casually on the bed.

Nathan Goldmann.

Evelyn turned to leave, but a small hand shoved her forward and the door clicked shut behind her.

She twisted the knob violently. "Open this door immediately!"

Warm breath tickled her ear as a muscular arm caged her against the door. "Evelyn," Nathan murmured, "I warned you there would be consequences for lying to me."

A shiver ran down her spine. "I'll sue you for trespassing!"

Nathan's lips curved. "Your children invited me. As their father, that hardly qualifies as trespassing."

He stepped closer, his voice dropping to that dangerous register she knew too well. "They've clearly chosen sides. Gave us this lovely private space to... reconcile."

"There's nothing to reconcile!"

Evelyn swung at him, but he caught her wrist effortlessly. In one fluid motion, he lifted her and tossed her onto the bed.

"Nathan, don't you dare—mmph!" His mouth crashed down on hers, stealing both her protest and her breath.

She fought against him, but his scorching chest pressed against hers, igniting fires she'd tried so hard to extinguish. His breathing grew ragged as his wandering hands threatened to unravel her completely.

No. This couldn't happen.

With a desperate shove, Evelyn broke free. "Stop it, Nathan—"

Her voice cracked. Hot tears spilled over as she finally deployed her most effective weapon.

Nathan stilled at the sight.

She pounded her fists against his chest like a wild thing. "You destroyed me six years ago! Why won't you leave me alone? You're just as vile as Vivian! Partners in crime! I hate you!"

Nathan's expression darkened.

Gently, he wiped her tears away. "I was never her partner."

But how could he possibly explain?

Evelyn turned her face away, eyes red-rimmed. "Just get it over with. You've broken me once. What's two or three more times?"

To her shock, Nathan simply gathered her into his arms. "Sleep."

Evelyn went rigid. He was... letting her go? All this time, tears were the key?

A realization struck her. Nathan Goldmann responded to vulnerability.

The next morning...

Three small figures pressed their ears against the bedroom door, listening for any sign their plan had succeeded.

The door swung open abruptly, sending them tumbling at Evelyn's feet.
###Chapter 81

Evelyn sighed as she looked at the three little troublemakers sprawled on the floor. A tired chuckle escaped her lips. "You three really know how to test my patience."

Daisy was the first to pipe up, her big eyes wide with innocence. "Mommy, we just want you and Daddy to be happy together!"

Caleb quickly jumped in, nodding vigorously. "Yeah, Mommy! Look at us—we don’t have a daddy, and it’s so sad!"

Liam, ever the quiet one, simply nodded in agreement, though his expression was just as earnest.

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I need to wash my face." She turned and headed straight for the bathroom.

Daisy tilted her head, watching her mother’s retreating figure. "Mommy didn’t sleep well last night."

Caleb frowned. "She has dark circles under her eyes."

The three children exchanged glances before creeping toward Nathan, who was still fast asleep on the couch.

Caleb poked his father’s arm. "Why isn’t Daddy waking up?"

Daisy and Liam studied him closely. After a moment, Liam reached out and pressed a small hand to Nathan’s forehead. His eyes widened. "Daddy’s burning up!"

Caleb gasped. "Was it because we made him sit in that ice bath last night…?"

Guilt flashed across the boys’ faces. They had definitely caused this.

Evelyn returned with a thermometer and checked Nathan’s temperature. Her breath hitched. 102°F.

Daisy clutched her mother’s sleeve, her voice trembling. "Mommy, will Daddy die from this fever?"

Liam quickly reassured her. "No, it’s just like when we get sick. He needs medicine."

Caleb dashed off and returned moments later with a bottle of fever reducer. "Here, Mommy!"

Evelyn took the medicine and the glass of water Daisy handed her, then hesitated.

How am I supposed to get him to take this?

Liam tapped his chin thoughtfully. "In dramas, they always do mouth-to-mouth."

Evelyn nearly choked. "Liam Vanderbilt, no more dramas for you!"

What kind of children did I raise?

She pried Nathan’s mouth open, shoved the pill in, and poured water down his throat. Nathan sputtered, coughed, and jolted awake, glaring at her through bleary eyes.

The triplets winced in sympathy. That looked painful.

Now that he was conscious, Evelyn crossed her arms. "You have a fever. Take your medicine and go home."

Nathan blinked slowly, then flopped back onto the couch. "I’m sick. I need rest."

"You—!"

Daisy pouted. "Mommy, Daddy’s sick! You can’t just kick him out!"

Caleb nodded. "Yeah! What if he faints on the street and gets robbed?"

Evelyn was speechless.

Nathan smirked inwardly, eyes still closed. The kids were defending him. He wasn’t going anywhere.

Dignity can wait.

After Evelyn left for work, Nathan woke an hour later. The medicine had dulled the pounding in his head. He wandered into the living room and paused.

Liam stood on a stool in the kitchen, expertly stirring something in a pot.

Daisy trotted over, peering up at him. "Daddy, is your fever gone?"

Nathan ruffled her hair. "Much better." He glanced at Liam. "He can cook?"

Daisy beamed. "Liam can do everything! When Mommy’s busy, he takes care of us!"

Nathan’s expression darkened. Too busy to take care of her own kids?

Liam carried a plate of scrambled eggs to the table. "Mommy works hard to support us. If she stayed home all the time, we wouldn’t have food."

Nathan’s chest tightened. He had a lot to make up for.
###Chapter 82

Evelyn's eyelids felt heavy as she struggled to stay awake.

"So this is why my two little troublemakers went into show business?" she mused sleepily.

Seeing Liam about to attempt another culinary creation, Evelyn reached out and ruffled his hair. "That's enough, sweetheart. Let Mommy handle the rest."

Liam eyed her skeptically. "Mommy, do you even know how to cook?"

The thought made Evelyn chuckle. The once-privileged Vanderbilt heiress turned single mother hadn't exactly grown up learning domestic skills.

"Watch and learn," she declared, tying on an apron with dramatic flair. Daisy and Liam exchanged glances as they watched her march into the kitchen, their young faces alight with anticipation.

Caleb came bounding downstairs, his stuffed dinosaur slippers slapping against the hardwood. "Liam! Are you making pancakes again?"

When he saw his siblings seated expectantly at the table, his gaze darted to the kitchen. His eyes widened comically.

"Mommy's cooking? For real?"

Evelyn emerged with plates balanced precariously on her arms. "Ta-da!" The children's synchronized "Wow!" made her grin.

Caleb blinked rapidly. "Mommy, you can actually cook?"

She winked. "What, you thought I'd poison you?"

"It's amazing!" Daisy declared through a mouthful of food, already digging in without waiting for the others. "Best breakfast ever!"

Evelyn checked her watch surreptitiously. 'Nathan should be arriving any minute now.'

Right on cue, the doorbell chimed. She smoothed her hair unconsciously before answering.

Oliver stood there with two overflowing shopping bags, his eyebrows nearly disappearing into his hairline when he saw Nathan standing casually in the foyer. "Mr. Goldmann, you're still... here?"

Then his gaze landed on the children. The bags slipped from his fingers. "What in the— there's two Liams now?"

"Triplets," Nathan supplied dryly.

Oliver's mouth fell open. 'Three? She had three at once? Holy—'

Recovering slightly, he cleared his throat. "Mr. Goldmann Sr. requested that you bring all three children to visit soon. He hasn't stopped talking about them since the gala."

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava. "You told him?"

Oliver shrunk back. "He called me directly! What was I supposed to do?"

"Leave," Nathan commanded, shutting the door in his assistant's bewildered face.

Oliver's muffled voice came through the wood. "Are you planning to live here now or—"

The door clicked shut.

"Zoe, you look exhausted." Gregory handed her a steaming mug. "Drink this. You'll need the caffeine."

"Thanks, Uncle Greg." Evelyn accepted the coffee gratefully, taking a long sip.

'If I hadn't spent the entire night making sure Nathan didn't try anything, maybe I wouldn't be this tired. Those little traitors set this whole thing up!'

Her thoughts were interrupted by raised voices outside. The door burst open before her assistant could stop the intruder.

Richard Vanderbilt stormed in, his expression thunderous. "So it's true." His gaze flicked to Gregory before returning to Evelyn. "I'll ask you once—are Nathan Goldmann's children yours?"
###Chapter 83

Evelyn froze, her expression darkening instantly.

Nathan's words had clearly caught Gregory off guard. He glanced between Evelyn and the employee still hovering awkwardly at the door.

"Zoe," Richard began, his voice dripping with condescension, "I pitied you because of your mother's mistakes. That's why I wanted you to inherit Viana Jewelry. But clearly, what you did six years ago wasn't enough. Now you're entangled with Mr. Goldmann? Do you even know the meaning of shame? He's your sister Vivian's boyfriend!"

Richard's disappointment was palpable. After witnessing their intimate moment in the office himself, how could he believe his daughter was innocent?

Evelyn's fists clenched. "You're lecturing me about shame? Then why didn't you call Laura out when she climbed into your bed?"

"Enough!" Richard snapped. "What happened between your mother and me has nothing to do with Laura."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn. "Nothing to do with her? You really know how to defend her, don't you?"

"You don’t understand anything about your mother and me!" Richard hissed through gritted teeth.

"Maybe not," Evelyn shot back, rising to her feet, her hands trembling. "But have you ever tried to understand me? You think I stole Vivian's man? Fine. Let me make it clear—those children are Nathan's!"

"Evelyn Vanderbilt, you—"

"They're five now. Add the year I was pregnant, and that makes six years ago, doesn’t it?"

Shock flashed across Richard’s face, his words dying in his throat.

Evelyn smirked coldly. "You’ve always believed Laura and Vivian. Every word from their mouths is gospel, but mine? Worthless. Sometimes I wonder if I’m even your real daughter."

Richard’s expression twisted. "That’s ridiculous!"

"Am I wrong?" Evelyn challenged. "You favor Vivian over me. I’ve always been the outsider—the Vanderbilt bastard. No, wait. I don’t even deserve that title."

Richard’s shoulders tensed, his eyes shadowed.

"If anything, I should thank Vivian. If she hadn’t set me up six years ago, I wouldn’t have lost my virginity to the illustrious Mr. Goldmann of Zlokova."

Watching Richard’s conflicted expression, Evelyn pressed on. "So, by your logic—who stole whose man? Me, now? Or Vivian, six years ago?"

The employee outside the door felt his brain short-circuit from the sheer volume of revelations.

Then, footsteps.

The man turned, paling when he saw who approached. "M-Mr. Goldmann!"

Nathan’s timing couldn’t have been more perfect—he’d heard every word.

'Her man, huh?'

Evelyn’s bravado shattered the second she spotted him.

'Oh, for god’s sake!'

Richard stiffened, his emotions spiraling further into chaos.

"Mr. Vanderbilt," Nathan said smoothly, stepping past him, "I don’t recall ever confirming Vivian as my girlfriend. Have I?"

Richard faltered. "Well—that is—"

Because he hadn’t. He’d only ever heard it from Laura and Vivian.
###Chapter 84

"Vivian has nothing to do with me." Nathan's voice was icy. "She lied to me for six years and even dared to drug me last night. Mr. Vanderbilt, how do you plan to settle this account for your daughter?"

Evelyn froze.

Did Vivian drug him last night? No wonder he was so aggressive. I almost became collateral damage in her scheme.

Richard's expression darkened. "How could Vivian—"

"It doesn't matter if you refuse to handle it yourself," Nathan interrupted, his tone laced with warning. "But remember, the outcome will be far worse if I deal with her personally."

Richard paled, his lips pressing into a thin line. "If it was truly Vivian's doing, I'll discipline her when we return home."

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "I don't want to hear the word if."

Richard swallowed hard. He knew Nathan wasn't a man to be trifled with. If he didn't give a satisfactory answer, Vivian wouldn't escape unscathed.

"Fine," Richard relented, his voice strained. "I'll give you an explanation later. Please, just... show her some mercy this once."

Evelyn's lips curled bitterly.

If it were me in Vivian's place, would he beg for my sake too?

Once Richard left, the others followed, leaving only Evelyn and Nathan in the office.

Evelyn crossed her arms, feigning indifference. "How ruthless, Mr. Goldmann. Not even sparing your ex-girlfriend. People might think you're the type to discard old lovers the moment you find a new one."

Nathan stepped closer, tilting her chin up with his fingers. "Aren’t you partly responsible for this mess?"

Evelyn blinked. "Me?"

His voice was low. "If you hadn’t run away six years ago, Vivian wouldn’t have gotten the chance to deceive me. None of this would’ve happened."

Had he known Evelyn was the woman from that night, Vivian would never have entered the picture.

Evelyn scoffed, pushing his hand away. "So now it's my fault? Weren’t you perfectly content defending her before?"

Nathan’s eyes darkened. Does she resent me for siding with Vivian?

A smirk tugged at his lips. "I can defend you too, you know."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Hard pass." She turned to leave, but Nathan wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, pulling her flush against him.

"Nathan Goldmann!" She struggled, but his grip was unyielding.

His lips brushed her ear. "Move in with me. Bring the children."

"Never." Her voice was sharp.

He actually expects me to live with him? Delusional.

Nathan traced her lower lip with his thumb. "If persuasion doesn’t work, I’ll just have to try another method."

Before she could react, his cold lips pressed against her neck. Evelyn shivered. "Wait—fine! Give me a few days to think about it!"

Nathan released her, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes. "Three days. No more."

Once he was gone, Evelyn clenched her fists, her expression icy.

Aside from that night six years ago and the fact that the children were his, she felt nothing for this man.

Yes, Nathan is devastatingly handsome, powerful, and influential—the epitome of every socialite’s dream. But my father’s betrayal left scars too deep to ignore.
###Chapter 85

The thought gnawed at me.

A man like Nathan Goldmann—wealthy, powerful, and dangerously magnetic—could never settle for an ordinary life.

Even if he believed Vivian was the woman from six years ago, something must have gone terribly wrong between them.

I refused to be tangled with a man Vivian had already touched. Never.

At the Vanderbilt Manor

The sharp crack of skin against skin echoed through the grand hall.

Richard Vanderbilt’s palm struck Vivian’s cheek with brutal force.

Laura gasped, rushing forward to pull him back. "Richard! What are you doing?!"

His face twisted in fury. "Ask her yourself! She dared to drug Nathan Goldmann! Do you think I can just let this slide without consequences?"

Laura paled, turning to Vivian. "Vivian… you didn’t—"

Vivian clutched her stinging cheek, lips pressed into a thin, defiant line.

Damn it. I was so close! Who ruined everything?

This can’t be happening!

"Vivian—"

"Don’t touch me!" Vivian shoved Laura away, eyes blazing. "This is all Evelyn’s fault! That bitch stole Nathan from me! He was supposed to be mine!"

Laura’s face drained of color. She tried to stop Richard, but it was too late.

Another slap landed, sending Vivian crashing to the floor.

"Say that again!" Richard snarled.

Tears welled in Vivian’s eyes, her voice trembling with rage. "I won’t take it back! Evelyn took what was rightfully mine!"

Richard raised his hand again, but Vivian screamed, "Go ahead! Beat me to death! I’m just the illegitimate daughter, right? Everyone can step on me as they please!"

She scrambled to her feet and bolted upstairs, slamming her bedroom door shut.

"Vivian!" Laura pounded on the door, panic rising.

No response.

With a desperate shove, she forced the door open.

The bedroom was empty.

Her heart stopped.

Then—the bathroom.

Laura’s scream pierced the air.

Vivian had slit her wrists.

At the Goldmann Offices

The screen flickered with the furious face of Nathan’s father.

"You little rascal! If not for Oliver, how long would you have kept this from me?" Mr. Goldmann Sr. roared, gripping his cane.

Nathan lounged on the couch, unfazed. "I planned to tell you when the time was right."

"Right? I’d be dead by then!" His father huffed. "But I don’t need you anymore. I have grandsons and a granddaughter now. That’s enough."

"Two grandsons and a granddaughter," Nathan corrected casually.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. blinked, then burst into laughter. "Hah! You’re something else, boy!"

Then, his expression turned serious. "Who’s their mother? Bring her to me. I don’t ask for much—just good breeding and manners."

After all, she had given the Goldmanns heirs. That alone was worth celebrating.

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "We’ll visit soon."

"‘Soon’? I’ll be waiting forever!" His father scoffed. "Fine. I’ll come to Bassburgh myself!"

The screen went black.

Nathan closed the laptop.

Oliver smirked. "He’s thrilled."
###Chapter 86

Nathan ignored Oliver, acting as though he'd been bewitched by Evelyn and couldn't resist seeing her again.

It had only been half a day, and already, he was itching to be near her.

I did give her three days to consider my proposal, but even that feels like an eternity.

At Beach Villa—

Evelyn pushed the spaghetti around her plate, appetite nonexistent. She kept glancing up, feeling as if her children had been stolen from her.

Tsk. Nathan is shameless beyond belief. He claims he’s giving me time to think, yet here he is, barging into my home for dinner.

Daisy sat perched on her father’s lap, thoroughly enjoying being fed by him.

Of course, Nathan didn’t just spoil Daisy. He occasionally served Liam and Caleb too. Liam remained stoic, while Caleb’s enthusiasm at least gave Evelyn some small comfort.

"Daddy, you should eat more! Try Mommy’s buffalo wings!" Daisy placed a wing on Nathan’s plate.

Evelyn’s eye twitched. "Daisy, he has hands. He can serve himself."

"Are you jealous, Mommy?"

Daisy’s gleeful expression nearly made Evelyn snap her fork in half.

Nathan smirked, ruffling Daisy’s hair. "Your mother might indeed be jealous."

Evelyn lowered her head, focusing on her food.

Nathan slid a wing onto her plate. "Don’t worry. I’ll spoil you too."

I shouldn’t neglect my beautiful wife just because of the kids. And yes, "beautiful wife" suits her perfectly.

She’s stunning, young, talented—she’d pass any audition for a woman worthy of my status. But this wife of mine is infuriating. She’s all looks and no touch. What am I supposed to do about that?

If Evelyn knew what Nathan was thinking, the bowl in her hands would’ve ended up on his face.

She eyed the chicken wing he’d given her, then immediately transferred it to Liam’s plate. "Your father says he’ll spoil you too. Eat up."

Liam glanced at Nathan, whose expression darkened, then calmly moved the wing to Caleb’s bowl. "He’ll spoil you. Have another."

Caleb was speechless.

Daisy, sensing the tension, knew she had to intervene. "Daddy, will you stay the night?"

Evelyn gritted her teeth. "Daisy, our house isn’t big enough for someone of his status!"

"But he’s not just someone—he’s Daddy!" Daisy pouted.

Nathan looked down at the little girl in his arms, lips curving.

Definitely my daughter.

Evelyn pointed out the obvious. "We don’t have an extra bed!"

Caleb looked up. "Your bed is huge. You could share with Daddy tonight!"

Evelyn slammed her fork down and stood.

The three children flinched.

She stormed to her room, grabbed a quilt and pillow, hurled them onto the couch, then marched back without another word.

SLAM! The door shut behind her.

Daisy looked up at Nathan. "Daddy, we tried our best..."

Then Liam pulled out a key and handed it to him. "I made a spare for Mommy’s room."

Nathan’s brows lifted. Now that’s what I call an assist.

Even Caleb and Daisy were impressed.

Liam was the undisputed MVP.

Back in her room, Evelyn locked the door, clutching the spare keys she’d taken from the kids’ rooms.

She leaned against the door, rubbing her temples.

This man is going to be the death of me.
###Chapter 87

Sophia's text message buzzed on Evelyn's phone. Clearly, the three little troublemakers had spilled the beans - that's how she knew Nathan was staying overnight!

Reading the suggestive tone in Sophia's message, Evelyn typed back, "Get your mind out of the gutter! That arrogant jerk gets the couch, nothing more." She powered off her phone before any reply could come.

*If I can just avoid him until morning...

The bedroom door creaked open in the dead of night. A tall silhouette moved silently toward the bed where Evelyn slept peacefully. Nathan lowered himself onto the mattress, bracing his arms on either side of her sleeping form. His lips brushed against hers in a featherlight kiss.

"Mmm..." Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she swatted weakly at the air. "Stop it..." Her drowsy murmur carried a hint of petulance, her nose scrunching in protest against the disturbance.

Nathan's gaze softened as he traced the curve of her bottom lip with his thumb. "Evelyn," he whispered, "I'll make you want me properly."

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn awoke, stretching luxuriously in her cocoon of blankets.

*Best sleep I've had in ages. Probably because that insufferable man wasn't hogging the bed.

Padding to the door in her silk nightgown, she confirmed the lock remained securely engaged. *Good thing I confiscated all the spare keys.

The scent of breakfast drew her toward the kitchen, where she froze mid-yawn. Three pairs of bright eyes stared at her from the dining table.

Nathan emerged from the kitchen bearing a platter of pancakes, his gaze locking onto hers. "Sleep well?"

Evelyn's brain short-circuited.

She'd completely forgotten about her unwanted houseguest!

"Mommy! Daddy made chocolate chip pancakes!" Caleb waved syrup-coated fingers at her.

Evelyn blinked rapidly.

*This feels disturbingly familiar. Am I dreaming?

Without a word, she turned on her heel and marched back to her room.

Once the door closed, Daisy leaned toward Nathan conspiratorially. "Daddy, did you sneak into Mommy's bed last night?"

Nathan pressed a finger to his lips with a wink. Daisy responded with an exaggerated nod, eyes sparkling.

Truthfully, Nathan had only managed five hours curled around his wife before his vibrating watch alarm prompted his return to the couch. He'd relocked her door with the spare key he'd... acquired.

When Evelyn emerged freshly showered and dressed, reality confirmed this wasn't some bizarre dream.

"Daddy and I are going to the office with Liam. Miss Angela's here already. Bye!" Daisy grabbed her backpack, dragging Liam toward the door. Caleb slid off his chair, approaching Evelyn with hopeful eyes. "Mommy, can you and Daddy take me to music academy?"

"Of course. We'll leave as soon as Oliver arrives." Nathan answered before Evelyn could protest, ruffling Caleb's hair as the boy scampered upstairs for his violin case.

Evelyn turned sharply - directly into Nathan's chest. She tilted her head back with a glare. "You-"

"Eat first," he interrupted smoothly. "We'll wait in the car." True to his word, Nathan ushered Caleb outside the moment he returned.

Evelyn eyed the breakfast spread warily.

*He actually made my favorite - caramelized banana pancakes. Since when does Nathan Goldmann cook? The man who orders five-star catering for business lunches?

Fifteen minutes later, Evelyn stepped onto the porch to find Nathan's luxury sedan idling at the curb. Caleb hung out the passenger window, waving frantically. "Mommy! Hurry up before the pancakes get cold!"
###Chapter 88

Evelyn had intended to claim the front passenger seat, but found herself at a loss for words when Nathan's piercing gaze stopped her mid-motion. Reluctantly sliding into the backseat, she barely had time to settle before Oliver turned with that infuriating grin.

"Good morning, Mrs. Goldmann."

Her fingers curled into fists. "Mrs. Goldmann my— Just drive!" The rest of her retort died on her lips as Caleb's innocent eyes met hers in the rearview mirror.

Oliver's lips formed an exaggerated pout.

'Ms. Vanderbilt's temper matches her fiery hair. Mr. Goldmann certainly has his hands full.'

Nathan's heated stare swept over her ensemble. Even in professional attire, Evelyn carried an effortless chic. The sleek black blouse paired with her asymmetrically split skirt created a striking contrast against her burgundy heels. Matching statement earrings completed the look with understated elegance.

Under his intense scrutiny, Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. The moment their conspicuous Maybach pulled up at Zlokova Royal Music Academy's entrance, dozens of heads turned. Several parents immediately recognized the legendary 9999 license plate.

"Isn't that Mr. Goldmann's car?"

"The one worth more than my house!"

Bassburgh's most exclusive license plate belonged to only one man. The same man whose silver Rolls-Royce and limited Pagani hypercar carried equally obscenely priced plates.

'We're witnessing royalty today.'

Evelyn massaged her temples as curious onlookers pressed closer. "Being seen with you is like walking through a paparazzi gauntlet."

Caleb bounded out, turning back with a wave. "Mommy! Daddy! I'm going in now!"

Her forced smile barely concealed her discomfort when her phone buzzed. Before she could check the notification, Nathan snatched it from her grasp.

"Give that back!" She lunged across the seat just as Oliver slammed the brakes at a red light. Momentum sent her tumbling into Nathan's lap.

Scrambling back to her seat, she glared at Oliver. "Are you trying to kill us?"

"Traffic laws exist for a reason, Ms. Vanderbilt," Oliver replied smoothly. "Unless you'd prefer I run the light?"

Nathan's smirk burned hotter than his grip on her phone. "Enjoying the view?"

Her face flamed when she realized where her hand had landed. "Hardly impressive," she lied, smoothing her skirt with trembling fingers.

The knowing glint in Nathan's eyes said he didn't believe her for a second. Then his expression darkened as he read her screen. "Care to explain who this 'dbag' is?"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Sophia's ill-timed reply to last night's venting session glared back at her. Under Nathan's murderous gaze, inspiration struck.

She leaned in, fingers playing with his collar. "It's internet slang, darling. When women call someone 'dbag,' it's actually a term of endearment." Her saccharine smile didn't reach her eyes.

Oliver's shoulders shook with suppressed laughter until Nathan's glacial stare silenced him. The distraction gave Evelyn just enough time to wrench open the door and sprint down the sidewalk without looking back.
###Chapter 89

Nathan tugged at his silk tie impatiently, his fingers tightening around the fabric.

"Closeness?" He scoffed under his breath. "She made it perfectly clear she wants nothing to do with me."

But it didn’t matter. Soon enough, she would have no choice. Tomorrow, Evelyn and the children would move into the Goldmann estate, and he would make sure she understood exactly what "closeness" meant.

Since Evelyn had been admitted to the hospital for her injury, Richard had stopped harassing her—at least openly. But the two slaps she had endured from her father still burned in her memory, and she directed all that resentment toward Vivian.

"Evie! Evie!" Laura burst into the hospital room, her face alight with excitement. "It's happening—it's trending everywhere!"

"What's trending?" Evelyn nibbled at her thumbnail, her mood sour.

"Frederick Fuller's designs for Viana Jewelry—they've gone viral online!"

"What?" Evelyn froze, her nail halfway to her teeth.

"Gone viral?"

"Yes! Your father has already received multiple calls about collaborations!"

Laura smirked triumphantly. "Evelyn isn’t the only talented designer in the world. Now that Frederick’s work is getting attention, we have nothing to worry about. Oh, and your father told Madam Victoria about it. That old woman always looked down on us, but now she wants to visit you!"

"Visit me?"

"Exactly." Laura leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Before this, our standing in the Vanderbilts was nothing compared to that little witch’s. But if you can ride Frederick’s success, you could elevate our position even further."

Evelyn’s lips curled. She wanted more than just status in the Vanderbilts—she wanted to be Mrs. Goldmann.

A thought struck her.

If Frederick’s designs took the jewelry world by storm, and if she could secure him as her ghost designer…

Wouldn’t that give her the upper hand against Evelyn?

Nathan would have to notice her then.

Viana Jewelry’s latest collection had exploded online, thanks to its striking Gothic-inspired designs. The dark, vintage snake-shaped diamond necklace and earrings exuded an enigmatic elegance, while the ring—crafted to look like two hands cradling a heart-shaped diamond—was nothing short of breathtaking.

#MenInLove: Never thought I’d like Gothic designs, but these pieces are stunning.

#LadyWithin: Viana needs to drop more collections like this ASAP!

Evelyn glanced at the tablet in her hands, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

Gregory strode into the office, grinning. "Zoe, your designs for Viana are setting the internet on fire. After years of silence, Viana Jewelry is finally back in the spotlight."

His phone buzzed before Evelyn could respond. He glanced at the screen, eyebrows lifting in surprise.

"What is it, Uncle Gregory?"

"Vivian is offering Frederick $1.5 million to be her ghost designer. She’s trying to buy her way into fame."

Evelyn laughed softly. "Let her take the bait."

If she’s so desperate to break into the jewelry world, I’ll gladly give her a little push.

Meanwhile, at the Vanderbilt estate…

Laura had brought Vivian home, where Richard sat chatting with Madam Victoria.

Richard stood immediately, beckoning Vivian forward. "Your grandmother came to see you. Don’t just stand there."

Vivian smiled sweetly and approached. "Grandmother."

Madam Victoria studied her with sharp eyes. "It’s been years. You’ve grown more beautiful. Your father tells me Viana’s new collection is a sensation—and that you were behind it. It seems I underestimated you."
###Chapter 90

"Mother, Vivian is doing this for the Vanderbilts." Laura smiled, trying to make Madam Victoria feel satisfied with herself and her daughter.

Everyone knew Madam Victoria had always valued a grandson more. If it weren’t for Richard not having a son, she wouldn’t have bothered with the mother-daughter pair at all.

Madam Victoria had two sons—Richard and York.

York, Richard’s elder brother, lived in the Vanderbilt ancestral mansion because he had given the family a grandson, Henry.

Madam Victoria had always favored her eldest son. If it weren’t for Viana Jewelry’s recent success, she wouldn’t have come to Bassburgh in person.

"Hmph, this might benefit the Vanderbilts, but she’s still not a man. Son, no matter what, the family business must be inherited by a man. A daughter will just marry into another family someday."

Richard and Laura’s expressions turned stiff at Madam Victoria’s words.

"It’s better to hand Viana over to your nephew, Henry. He’s 23 now and the only heir to the Vanderbilts."

Laura clenched her fists. Handing Viana over to that arrogant brat? Never.

"Mother, you might not know this, but Vivian was the one who convinced designer Frederick Fuller to collaborate with Viana. In other words, Frederick only agreed because of Vivian’s connection to Mr. Goldmann."

Richard frowned. "What does this have to do with Mr. Goldmann?"

Laura smiled. "Darling, didn’t you hear? When Frederick came to discuss the collaboration, he told Vivian he only knew about her because of Mr. Goldmann."

"The person you’re talking about… Which Mr. Goldmann?" Madam Victoria’s eyes sharpened.

Laura met her gaze. "Nathan Goldmann of Blackgold Group, of course."

Madam Victoria’s lips parted in shock. She turned to Vivian. "Well, well, young lady, you’re quite impressive. You’ve caught the attention of the Goldmann heir. Tell me more about him. I’ve heard he’s incredibly influential. A marriage alliance with the Goldmanns would elevate the Vanderbilts!"

Laura smirked. Mentioning Nathan had worked like a charm. The tension between her and her mother-in-law had eased instantly.

Richard stood abruptly and left, his expression dark.

Madam Victoria barely spared him a glance. She turned back to Vivian. "Since you’re close to Mr. Goldmann, you must know the elite circles he moves in. Introduce one of those powerful men to your cousin Lydia."

Vivian smiled sweetly, pleased by the sudden change in address. "Of course, Grandmother."

Hmph. Compared to Evelyn, Lydia is just a spoiled, brainless girl.

But that’s exactly what I need. If I can use her to deal with Evelyn, even better.

Madam Victoria beamed. "Excellent. You truly are a Vanderbilt. I’ll have Lydia visit tomorrow."

At noon, Evelyn flipped through the inventory list.

Xavier sighed. "Ms. Vanderbilt, Jade Mountain Co. is facing a shortage of rare rough stones. We can’t source aquamarine, tanzanite, golden emerald, black opal, or topaz from them."

Evelyn closed the file. "We can order aquamarine and golden emerald from Millennial Gemstone Inc.—their prices are comparable. As for black opal and tanzanite, only Taylor Jewelry has them in stock."
###Chapter 91

"Taylor Jewelry controls the entire supply chain for ck opal and tanzanite, so we have no choice but to source from them."

Xavier sighed. "But their prices are notoriously steep."

Evelyn handed him the list with a smirk. "Don’t worry. Money isn’t an issue for our CEO."

Xavier’s eyes widened. "You’re making Mr. Goldmann pay for this?"

Though they operated under the ckgold Group umbrella, their studio was technically independent.

Evelyn shrugged. "I’m broke."

Xavier forwarded the list to Oliver, who scanned it and nearly choked. "For these two raw gemstones, we’ll need Mr. Goldmann to—"

His words trailed off as he stared at the supplier’s quote.

"Taylor Jewelry’s prices are double the market rate, but they’re not bluffing. 'ck opal is the rarest and most valuable of all opals, far surpassing white and fire opals in price. And tanzanite? It’s even more precious than sapphire.'"

Beaumont, the largest tanzanite supplier, sold eighty percent of its annual yield to Ampleforth for a staggering $300 million. Taylor Jewelry was the sole distributor authorized to sell to Zlokova.

The cost of these two materials alone was beyond any ordinary company’s reach.

Oliver chuckled, tucking the list away. "Ms. Vanderbilt certainly knows how to spend Mr. Goldmann’s money."

Xavier grinned. "Our boss has no money."

Oliver rolled his eyes.

He carried the list to the outdoor balcony where Nathan was swimming.

Nathan emerged from the water, slicking back his wet hair, droplets scattering across the tiles.

Oliver approached the pool’s edge. "Mr. Goldmann, your wife is about to bankrupt you."

And it’s going to be a fortune.

Nathan stepped out, his dark lashes glistening, softening the usual sharpness of his gaze. He wrapped himself in a robe, lips curling. "How much does she want?"

Oliver exhaled. "Two raw gemstones from Taylor Jewelry. Total cost? Twelve million."

Nathan took the list, scanning it. "What else did she say?"

Oliver smirked. "Your lovely wife said she’s broke."

Evelyn was deep in sketching when the light dimmed. A heavy presence loomed over her.

Nathan perched on the edge of her desk, sliding the signed list toward her. "If you need money, just ask me directly."

His voice was low, smooth.

Evelyn met his gaze. "It’s not for nothing. I’ll earn it back."

"Move in tonight," Nathan said casually, standing.

"Tonight?" Her pulse spiked.

He turned, arching a brow. "Problem?"

Evelyn hesitated, then realization struck. "Today’s the third day."

Nathan studied her before looking away. "Move in. I’ll give you time to adjust. I won’t push you."

Then he left.

Evelyn frowned, lost in thought, until her phone buzzed—Laura calling.

She answered, only to hear Harriet Heath’s voice instead.

By late afternoon, Evelyn stood at the Vanderbilt manor. She’d scoffed at the idea of returning for dinner, but Harriet’s summons left her no choice.
###Chapter 92

Evelyn stepped through the grand entrance of the Vanderbilt manor, her heels clicking against the marble floor. The sound of cheerful chatter drifted from the living room, making her pause mid-step.

Vivian sat perched beside Madam Victoria, her expression freezing momentarily when she spotted Evelyn. She recovered quickly, flashing a practiced smile as she rose. "Zoe's back?"

Madam Victoria's sharp eyes raked over Evelyn from head to toe. "After all these years, you've started looking more like your mother Isabella."

Laura emerged from the dining room with several servants in tow, announcing, "Mother, dinner is served."

With Vivian's assistance, Madam Victoria stood slowly. As she passed Evelyn, she commanded, "Stay. We'll dine as a family tonight."

'A family?' Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered, her lips curling into a cold smirk.

The dining table held only three place settings - for the grandmother, stepmother, and stepsister. Evelyn's gaze lingered on the empty chair at the head of the table. "Where's Father?"

"He's not joining us. Let's begin." Madam Victoria piled food onto Vivian's plate without looking up. "You're too thin, dear. A woman needs some curves to stay healthy."

Vivian ducked her head demurely. "Thank you, Grandmother."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her unused silverware. 'Grandmother never showed me this kind of attention, let alone Vivian.'

Noticing Evelyn's untouched plate, Madam Victoria began casually, "Evelyn, I heard you've been causing trouble over Viana Jewelry's shares?"

Evelyn's eyebrows arched as she shot Laura a pointed look.

Laura suddenly became very interested in her salad.

With a practiced smile, Evelyn replied, "Why would I quarrel over Viana Jewelry? You must have heard wrong."

"Is that so?" Madam Victoria barely glanced at Laura before continuing, "Good to hear. Viana belongs to the Vanderbilts. Women shouldn't meddle in family business - that's men's work."

Evelyn's smile didn't waver.

Everyone knew Madam Victoria's archaic views. Evelyn remembered how her grandmother had dismissed Richard for producing no male heir, while spoiling her only grandson into uselessness.

'Now that the Vanderbilt hot springs are failing, she suddenly remembers her son in Bassburgh - and sets her sights on Viana Jewelry.'

'Viana's recent success must have caught her attention.'

Evelyn met her grandmother's gaze directly. "Viana is Father's company. Shouldn't he decide its future?"

Though Laura disliked Evelyn, she secretly agreed with the statement - not that she'd ever voice it.

Madam Victoria sniffed. "Your father is a Vanderbilt, making Viana Vanderbilt property. But with Vivian successfully managing the company during its growth, her contributions can't be ignored."

As Madam Victoria praised Vivian, the younger woman shot Evelyn a triumphant look.

"I've heard Viana's new designer is quite popular these days," Evelyn sighed dramatically. "Seems my chances of making a comeback are slim."

"You should learn from your elder sister. Speaking of which—" Madam Victoria turned to Vivian. "Didn't you say you're close with Mr. Goldmann? Invite him for dinner so we can meet properly."

Vivian's face paled. Even Laura looked uncomfortable.

"Grandmother, Nathan is... very busy." Vivian bit her lip. 'Damn it, inviting him would just give this bitch the perfect opportunity.'

Noticing their reactions, Evelyn lowered her eyes to hide her amusement. "Surely if you're that close, he'd come when you ask? Hasn't he visited before?"
###Chapter 93

"Oh? Mr. Goldmann has been here for dinner before?" Madam Victoria couldn't hide her delight.

Nathan Goldmann of Bassburgh—everyone in Cornelia knew his name.

Rumors claimed that whoever gained the favor of the Goldmanns would be blessed with endless prosperity and fortune in this lifetime.

Laura forced a tight smile. "Mother, that was ages ago. Mr. Goldmann has been swamped with work lately. There's no way he'd have time to visit."

"How would you know if you don’t even bother to call him?" Evelyn smirked.

Laura shot her a venomous glare. "Zoe, stop causing trouble."

'I can't let this little witch ruin everything!'

Seeing how tense Laura and Vivian were, Evelyn was certain—they feared she’d actually summon Nathan and expose their lies, leaving them humiliated in front of Madam Victoria.

Just as Evelyn was about to speak, her phone buzzed with a message.

The tone and content made it unmistakably clear—it was from Nathan.

"I have urgent matters to attend to. I’ll have to leave early." Evelyn rose gracefully from her seat.

Madam Victoria frowned at her abrupt departure. "You just arrived. You haven’t even touched your food, and you’re leaving already?"

"I don’t have a choice. Someone’s waiting for me outside, and things might get… complicated if I delay." Her gaze lingered pointedly on Laura and Vivian.

At the word "him," their expressions twisted with panic.

'Who else could it be but that man?'

After Evelyn left, Vivian stormed into the courtyard. Through the gates, she spotted the unmistakable McLaren idling outside.

Her nails dug into her palms. "That should’ve been mine! That witch stole everything from me!"

Inside the car, Nathan studied her. "I thought you despised the Vanderbilts. Why go back?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, feigning indifference. "Madam Victoria returned. Basic courtesy demanded I show my face."

Nathan rested his hands on his lap, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Your family seems rather interested in Viana Jewelry."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "You know the Vanderbilts well, don’t you?"

"If I didn’t understand the Vanderbilts—" He leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. "—how else would I understand you?"

She turned away, lips curling coldly. "Understanding them has nothing to do with understanding me."

Nathan’s lashes lowered. "Ah, but there’s Viana Jewelry."

Her jaw tightened.

His fingers brushed aside a loose strand of her hair, tucking it behind her ear. "The new jewelry line Viana just launched—those were your designs, weren’t they?"

Evelyn stiffened before meeting his gaze. "What if they were?"

Nathan chuckled, tracing the edge of her ear. "As I thought. You never truly gave up on Viana."

"So, do you still plan to stop me?" Her voice was icy.

'He’s figured it out. And he was the one who forced me to surrender my shares.'

Nathan watched her silently for a long moment before speaking. "If I hadn’t made you give up Viana Jewelry, how else would you have willingly come to me?"

'And if she hadn’t come to me then, how would I have discovered the woman from six years ago was her?'

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "So this was his plan all along. The cunning bastard!"

Noticing her furious expression, Nathan laughed. "Were you just cursing me in your head?"

She refused to answer.

The car glided smoothly toward the Goldmann estate.

When they arrived, Evelyn followed Nathan into the castle-like mansion, where the butler approached them—followed closely by three little troublemakers.
###Chapter 94

"Mommy!"

Daisy came bounding toward Evelyn, her golden curls bouncing with each step. She tilted her head up with sparkling eyes. "Mommy, does this mean we get to live with Daddy forever now?"

Evelyn glanced sideways at Nathan standing beside her, lips pressed together. 'This wasn't exactly my choice!'

Nathan effortlessly scooped Daisy into his arms. "That's right, princess. We're all going to be one big happy family from now on."

The triplets erupted in cheers, their laughter filling the grand foyer. Evelyn crossed her arms, turning away with a huff - though she couldn't deny this was the happiest she'd ever seen her children.

Mr. Chester, the Goldmann family butler, stood beside Oliver with his mouth slightly agape. 'The young master not only has three heirs but has brought their mother home too! I always assumed Vivian Vanderbilt would become mistress of this household.'

Leaning toward Oliver, he whispered, "Is this truly to be our new lady of the house?"

Oliver gave a knowing smile. "She bore the Goldmann heirs. That makes her position quite unshakable, don't you think?"

"Ms. Vanderbilt?" Mr. Chester's eyebrows shot up. "But I thought—"

"The illegitimate one is Vivian," Oliver clarified. "Evelyn is the true Vanderbilt heiress."

Understanding dawned on the butler's face. 'Ah, so that explains everything!'

A maid escorted Evelyn to what she assumed would be her private quarters. As she stepped inside, something immediately felt off about the lavish bedroom.

"Mr. Goldmann," the maids chorused as Nathan entered behind her, quickly making themselves scarce.

"Wait—" Evelyn spun around to call them back.

Nathan blocked her path, towering over her. "What's the matter? Isn't my room good enough for you?"

"I don't want to share a room with you," Evelyn stated flatly, attempting to push past him.

In one fluid motion, Nathan wrapped an arm around her waist, spun her around, and pinned her against the wall. His gaze was intense yet playful. "I said I wouldn't force you into anything. I never said we wouldn't be sharing a bed."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "How is that any different?"

"Simple." He leaned in closer, his breath warm against her skin. "Sleeping together builds intimacy. I won't cross any lines without your consent... unless you beg me to someday."

Evelyn let out an incredulous laugh and shoved at his chest. "Then back off!"

"I said I wouldn't touch you," Nathan murmured, his lips hovering dangerously close to hers. "I never said I wouldn't be tempted."

"Nathan Goldmann, you—"

His mouth captured hers in a searing kiss before she could finish. The space between them evaporated as their breaths mingled.

Evelyn clawed at his arms and stomped on his foot, but his grip was unyielding. The kiss was all-consuming, leaving her dizzy and breathless.

Three small heads peeked through the doorway. Liam quickly covered Daisy's eyes with his hand.

"Hey! I can't see!" Daisy whined, squirming.

Evelyn finally managed to shove Nathan away and turned to see her children watching with varying degrees of amusement.

Caleb giggled. "Are you and Daddy making us a new baby sister?"

Daisy gasped, finally freeing herself from Liam's grasp. "Really? A baby?"

Liam rolled his eyes. "You don't get pregnant from kissing, dummy."

Flushing crimson, Evelyn wiped her mouth and stormed out of the room.

Nathan touched his lips, unable to suppress a satisfied smirk. 'Even better than I remembered.'

That night...

Evelyn took extreme precautions, wearing multiple layers of pajamas and curling into the farthest corner of the massive bed. She was already feigning sleep when Nathan entered.

He paused in the doorway, shaking his head at the sight of his wife cocooned in blankets like a defensive burrito. The corner of his mouth twitched in amusement as he approached the bed.
###Chapter 95

Evelyn felt the mattress dip behind her as she cracked one eye open cautiously.

The movement stopped abruptly when Nathan settled in. After several tense moments, she dared to turn her head.

He lay with his back to her, a respectable distance between them on the expansive king-sized bed.

Her grip on the sheets loosened slightly, but sleep remained elusive. The standoff lasted until exhaustion finally claimed her in the wee hours.

Nathan stirred at the unexpected weight pressing against him. His brow furrowed as he turned to find Evelyn sprawled like a starfish, the duvet barely covering half her body.

He pinched the bridge of his nose.

"Who would've guessed she sleeps like a hurricane?"

As he moved her wandering arm, realization dawned. He studied her peaceful face intently.

Dawn's first light triggered the automated curtains, flooding the room with golden sunshine.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she instinctively reached for the covers, nuzzling into what she thought was her pillow.

Something felt... wrong.

Her eyes flew open, body freezing when she registered the man beside her.

Nathan lay perfectly still in a military-straight position, hands folded neatly over his abdomen.

Meanwhile, she'd wrapped herself around him like cling wrap.

Evelyn inhaled sharply, carefully extracting her limbs before snatching the duvet and making a strategic retreat.

Nathan's lips curved as he watched her flee through half-lidded eyes.

At Goldmann Group

Evelyn and Gregory stepped off the elevator, her gaze deliberately skirting Nathan when they crossed paths in the lobby.

She breathed easier thinking he couldn't possibly know about this morning's incident.

"Going out?" Nathan's voice stopped her, one eyebrow arched.

Evelyn forced a smile. "To Taylor Jewelry. We can't let your investment go to waste."

As she passed him, Nathan murmured just loud enough for her to hear, "You've already gotten your money's worth."

Evelyn stiffened, whirling to see the elevator doors closing on his smirk.

"Zoe?" Gregory studied her curiously.

"Let's go," Evelyn muttered, striding toward the exit.

In the car, Evelyn rested her forehead against the cool window, frustration evident in her tense shoulders.

"That arrogant jerk knew everything! I should've duct-taped myself to the bed!"

Gregory chuckled. "Are you and Mr. Goldmann...?"

"No." Evelyn's frown deepened. "The kids have a relationship with him. That's where it ends."

Even living under the same roof didn't mean anything.

"Zoe, I don't know your history, but children need both parents."

Evelyn watched the city blur past. "I know, but I can't promise—"

She couldn't promise Nathan wouldn't shatter their children's hearts like her father had.

The thought of illegitimate siblings appearing someday made her stomach churn. Her children wouldn't relive her childhood trauma.

Gregory recognized her fears. "Not all men are like your father, Zoe. Time reveals true character. Why not give him—and yourself—a chance?"

Evelyn remained silent, the weight of past betrayals pressing against her ribs.
###Chapter 96

The sleek black car came to a smooth halt in front of Taylor Jewelry’s grand entrance. Evelyn Vanderbilt and Gregory Fannon stepped out together, their polished shoes clicking against the marble steps as they approached the towering glass doors.

Taylor Jewelry was the undisputed titan of the industry in Zlokova, its subsidiaries dominating the top ten rankings nationwide. Any brand aspiring to reach the pinnacle of the jewelry world had no choice but to seek a partnership with them.

Their materials were legendary—exclusive rough diamonds and opals sourced from mines no one else could access. But supplying to Taylor wasn’t just about having the stones; it was about meeting their exacting standards in both quality and price.

Gregory approached the reception desk, confirming their appointment. After a brief verification, they were ushered into the VIP lounge.

Inside, two other individuals—clearly representatives from rival companies—were already waiting.

"Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly," the receptionist said before exiting.

Evelyn and Gregory settled onto the plush couch across the room.

A woman sitting opposite them was meticulously reapplying her lipstick, her gaze flicking toward them for a brief, assessing moment. With a self-satisfied smirk, she snapped her compact shut and leaned forward.

"Here to pitch to Taylor as well? Which company are you from?"

Gregory offered a polite nod. "Soul Jewelry Studio."

"Soul Jewelry Studio?"

The woman exchanged an amused glance with the man beside her before letting out a derisive laugh. "Never heard of it."

Evelyn lifted her teacup, her lashes lowering slightly as she took a sip.

The woman stood, sauntering over with an air of superiority. "Taylor is the crown jewel of Zlokova’s industry. How could a no-name studio like yours even dream of working with them?"

"La Pe Group certainly hasn’t heard of you," the man added with a smirk. "Are you sure you didn’t sneak in?"

La Pe?

Evelyn’s fingers tightened imperceptibly around her cup. La Pe—meaning "pearl"—was a powerhouse in the jewelry world, rivaling even Hailey & Co. She hadn’t expected them to be vying for Taylor’s favor.

"Just because you’re unaware of us doesn’t mean we don’t exist," Evelyn replied coolly. "But tell me—are you truly representing La Pe?"

The woman crossed her arms. "You don’t recognize me? I’m Penelope Santiago. La Pe belongs to my family."

Gregory’s brow furrowed. "You’re Alexander Santiago’s daughter?"

Penelope’s eyes sharpened. "You know my father?"

"No." Even if he had, he wouldn’t admit it now.

She scoffed. "Of course not. My father is a legend in this industry. Someone like you wouldn’t have the privilege."

Before the tension could escalate further, a poised woman in a tailored suit entered, reviewing a clipboard. "Ms. Santiago, please follow me."

Penelope shot them a triumphant smirk. "Pity. La Pe’s reputation speaks for itself. Good luck competing with that."

With a flick of her hair, she strutted out.

Evelyn turned to Gregory, her lips curving into a knowing smile. "Uncle Gregory, I have a feeling that woman isn’t her father’s favorite."

Though Evelyn wasn’t deeply entrenched in Zlokova’s jewelry scene, she knew enough.

Alexander Santiago, chairman of La Pe, was renowned for his humility and charm—a man who commanded respect effortlessly. His daughter’s arrogance? That was entirely her own.
###Chapter 97

Compared to his daughter, Alexander Santiago was far more approachable.

Gregory chuckled wryly. "Seems La Pe had the same idea as us—sending Penelope Santiago to negotiate a partnership."

"They're after the tanzanite source too?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Gregory's voice carried concern. "I wonder what terms La Pe will offer. Twelve million might not be enough."

Just securing access to the tanzanite mines would cost around twelve million. Since Taylor Jewelry was the only company with exclusive rights to Beaumont's supply, monopolizing the import channels alone would demand an astronomical sum.

They waited nearly an hour before a staff member reappeared. "Apologies, but Madam Nora stated that since your studio is newly established and not yet listed, she can't assess your credibility. She suggests you return once you've built a stronger reputation."

Gregory stood abruptly. "Did she really say that?"

The staff member hesitated. "Mr. Fannon, those were her exact words. I'm merely relaying the message."

Evelyn remained seated, her back straight. "What conditions did Madam Nora propose?"

The staff member paused. "It's not about conditions. Your studio lacks stability. Our chairwoman is considering long-term partnerships only."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, then rose gracefully. "Very well. I hope Madam Nora honors her word and doesn't keep us waiting too long."

With a faint smile, she left the VIP lounge with Gregory—only to collide with Penelope Santiago.

Penelope smirked at their rejection. "Told you. You should be grateful Taylor even granted an appointment to some no-name startup, let alone a partnership."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "Which channel did La Pe secure?"

Penelope scoffed. "Black Opal, obviously. Not that you'd know what that means." She brushed past them, chin lifted.

Gregory clenched his fists, barely restraining himself.

"I thought they'd gotten the tanzanite source," Evelyn mused as they walked away. Gregory exhaled sharply, frustration darkening his expression. "Our company's new. Madam Nora probably wants to evaluate our long-term potential."

"Uncle Gregory," Evelyn said, amusement lacing her voice, "have a little more pride."

He blinked. "What are you planning?"

She grinned. "We're not leaving until Madam Nora sees us."

Madam Nora sipped her coffee as the staff member returned. Her sharp eyes lifted. "They're still here?"

"Yes, waiting downstairs."

She set her cup down with a clink. "An unlisted startup, bold enough to demand a tanzanite partnership? Confidence is one thing—arrogance is another."

"Shall I have them escorted out?"

Madam Nora waved a hand. "Forcing them out would reflect poorly on us."
###Chapter 98

They didn't make any fuss or cause trouble. If Taylor Jewelry threw them out simply because Soul was newly established, people would say Madam Nora discriminated against startups.

"Let them wait if that's what they want."

Another hour passed when the staff returned to report, but Madam Nora paid no attention. By afternoon, the same employee came back looking defeated. "They're still here. They even ordered food delivery. I think they intend to stay overnight."

Madam Nora couldn't ignore this any longer. She turned her wheelchair. "Take me to them."

She had underestimated the persistence of this small company's employees. Perhaps that was why she felt intrigued. She wanted to see just how much confidence this fledgling jewelry business possessed.

"How shameless. Refusing to leave when Madam clearly doesn't want to see them."

"I'd be too embarrassed to stay."

"Ordering takeout like this is their home?"

Several employees snickered as they passed the VIP room.

Evelyn didn't mind the gossip. She slipped on plastic gloves and began cracking into a lobster. The rich aroma filled the entire space. She popped open a can of cola.

Lobster and soda - perfection!

When staff wheeled Madam Nora to the door, the scent of seafood greeted them. They peeked inside.

A young woman was thoroughly enjoying her meal.

Gregory looked up, pausing mid-bite before slowly standing without removing his gloves.

Evelyn turned calmly and peeled off her gloves. "Good afternoon, Madam."

Madam Nora opened her mouth but remained silent, studying Gregory instead. "Soul is your new venture?"

Gregory smiled. "No."

"It's mine," Evelyn stated plainly.

Madam Nora's eyebrows lifted. "Yours?"

Evelyn nodded.

The older woman eyed Gregory skeptically. "You're working for this young woman at a jewelry startup?"

"Madam, in all my years in this industry, I've rarely encountered such raw talent. I joined willingly," Gregory replied with conviction.

Madam Nora glanced at the feast before them. "Making yourselves comfortable in my offices, I see. Would you have slept here if I never came?"

Evelyn smiled. "We planned to leave after finishing lunch, but you arrived first."

A little pride never hurt.

"My position was clear. What exactly are you after?" Madam Nora looked exasperated.

"Honestly? We're desperate for this opportunity." Evelyn met her gaze. "I understand your concerns about our unproven company, but we genuinely need this tanzanite partnership. It's the missing element in several key designs."

Madam Nora frowned. "Sapphires would suffice. Why insist on tanzanite?"

Evelyn's smile turned knowing. "For international markets, sapphires hold value, but tanzanite's unique color saturation and brilliance surpass them entirely."
###Chapter 99

With those words, Evelyn approached Madam Nora, her lips curving into a confident smile. "Taylor Jewelry uses tanzanite as its signature gemstone. This proves we share the same vision about its untapped potential."

She gestured gracefully toward the display case. "Zlokova's market is saturated with predictable designs. Most younger consumers have never experienced tanzanite's true allure." Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "When beauty remains hidden, it loses all market relevance."

Madam Nora studied the determined young woman before her. Countless business partners had approached Taylor about tanzanite distribution channels before. None had appreciated the gem's intrinsic beauty - they only coveted its scarcity.

The tanzanite mines were nearly depleted. Within decades, these stones would become rarer than sapphires. Most investors saw only dollar signs, not artistry.

That's why she'd always set impossible terms.

Yet this girl... Evelyn understood tanzanite's soul. She spoke truth - the younger generation dismissed tanzanites as inferior sapphire imitations. Without proper exposure, the gem would fade into obscurity.

Madam Nora exhaled sharply. "You argue persuasively. But one critical point remains unconvinced."

Evelyn tilted her head.

"Suppose I grant you access," Madam Nora challenged. "How would you give tanzanite meaning?"

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Would elevating it to the industry's most coveted gem within twelve months suffice?"

"Bold words." Madam Nora's eyebrows climbed. "I wouldn't dare make such claims myself."

"Then give me thirty days." Evelyn leaned forward. "If my design commands the highest bid at Summerton's next auction, will you reconsider our contract?"

"You're an unknown designer. Why would Summerton feature your work?"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with secrets. "You'll see when the time comes."

Madam Nora observed this cheeky, cunning girl who somehow remained... oddly charming.

As they exited Taylor Jewelry, Gregory studied Evelyn's triumphant expression over their one-month contract. Something nagged at him.

"Why not reveal you're Zara?" he finally asked. Her reputation as an internationally acclaimed designer would open every door.

Evelyn carefully tucked away the agreement. "Madam Nora would assume I'm an imposter." She shrugged. "The world knows Zara's name, but who's actually seen her face?"

Back at ckgold headquarters, Evelyn practically floated into her office - until she saw the unexpected visitor.

Nathan Goldmann lounged in her chair, his tailored peacock blue tie catching the filtered sunlight. Even in shadow, his sharp features looked carved from marble.
###Chapter 100

That face was so breathtaking it couldn’t possibly be real.

Nathan’s piercing gaze locked onto her. "You’re back?"

Evelyn avoided his eyes, striding in with the contract in hand. "You seem to have an abundance of free time, Mr. Goldmann."

"I heard you wasted half the day at Taylor Jewelry before meeting Madam Nora?"

"Do you have me under surveillance or something?" Evelyn glanced down at her outfit, half-convinced he did.

Nathan’s lips curved into a smirk as he slowly rose from his chair and closed the distance between them. "Why didn’t you mention you’re affiliated with the ckgold Group?"

A fledgling company negotiating with Taylor might be dismissed outright—no reputation, no leverage. But under the ckgold banner? That carried weight.

Nathan wouldn’t even blink at Taylor’s outrageous demands.

Evelyn tossed the contract onto the desk and leaned against it. "Why should I drop your name?"

Nathan braced a hand on the desk, caging her in. "Why can’t you just flaunt me for once?"

Was she embarrassed to be associated with Nathan Goldmann?

She pressed a finger to his shoulder, pushing him back. "It’s not about flaunting you. You’re just… distracting."

Nathan caught her wrist. A shiver ran down her spine as she tried to pull away, but his grip was unyielding.

When his gaze dropped to her lips, Evelyn reacted instantly, slapping a hand over his mouth as he leaned in.

"We’re in the office!"

His eyes darkened, amusement flickering in their depths.

The heat of his breath against her palm sent another jolt through her. She yanked her hand back, glaring. "You’re impossible!"

This infuriating man—

"Say that again?" Nathan’s smirk widened as her cheeks flushed.

Evelyn snatched a stack of documents from the desk and swatted him with them. "Arrogant, insufferable, shameless!"

The papers barely fazed him. He chuckled, watching her like an amused predator cornering a furious kitten.

"Mr. Goldmann—"

Oliver stepped in, narrowly dodging a flying document.

He caught it midair, bewildered. "Did I interrupt something?"

Nathan shot him a look. "What is it?"

"Your father has returned from Bassburgh. He expects you to be prepared."

Evelyn froze, the contract slipping from her fingers. Nathan’s father—the patriarch of the Goldmann family?

"Understood," Nathan replied.

Once Oliver left, he turned back to Evelyn. "Dinner with my father tonight."

"No." The refusal was instant. Meeting his father would solidify everything—no turning back.

"No?" His voice dropped dangerously.

"Absolutely not."

Nathan seized her wrist, yanking her against him. His mouth crashed onto hers before she could protest.

"Mm—you—!"

She shoved at his chest, but he only deepened the kiss, stealing her breath.

"Ask me again?" He nipped her lower lip, a silent threat.

Evelyn stayed stubbornly silent.

That evening, at the Grand Imperial’s exclusive restaurant.

Luxury dripped from every corner—crystal chandeliers, gold-trimmed walls, the finest in Bassburgh.

From 650 feet above the city, the skyline glittered like scattered diamonds. A view reserved for the elite.
###Chapter 101

Evelyn slipped into a tailored office ensemble that exuded quiet sophistication.

She selected a crisp white V-neck blouse with delicate cap sleeves, pairing it with taupe high-waisted trousers that flared elegantly at the ankle. A satin ribbon detail at the waist added a touch of feminine refinement to the otherwise sharp silhouette.

The outfit was minimalist yet undeniably chic.

A waiter guided them to the private dining area while two broad-shouldered bodyguards in dark suits took positions outside.

"Mr. Goldmann." The guards dipped their chins in deference to Nathan before opening the double doors.

Inside the opulent private room sat a distinguished silver-haired gentleman in his late fifties.

The air around him crackled with the kind of authority that could only come from decades of wielding power - exactly what one would expect from Nathan's formidable father.

Given the Goldmann dynasty's centuries-old legacy, Evelyn had anticipated their standards for potential daughters-in-law would be astronomical.

She'd assumed they'd demand at least royalty or perhaps a Fortune 500 heiress.

Nathan's arm encircled Evelyn's waist as he guided her forward. "Father, meet your future daughter-in-law."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

'Did he just-?'

Mr. Goldmann Sr.'s piercing gaze swept over Evelyn from head to toe. Her fingers tightened around her clutch, though her expression remained perfectly composed. "A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Goldmann."

'Frankly, I couldn't care less about his approval. I never planned to become Mrs. Goldmann anyway.'

'Honestly? I'm hoping he hates me. A nice fat check to disappear would solve all my problems right now.'

The elder Goldmann gestured magnanimously. "Sit, sit. No need for formalities."

Evelyn took the indicated seat with practiced grace.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. studied her over steepled fingers. "I must say, I'm impressed someone so young has already given Nathan three heirs."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line as her brows drew together.

'Is he only interested in the children? Is this about custody?'

"Tch." The older man shook his head. "Must've put up with this rascal's nonsense to raise those babies alone. My son doesn't deserve a woman of your caliber."

Evelyn's eyes widened fractionally.

'Wait - what?'

She blinked at Mr. Goldmann Sr. in stunned silence.

'Where's the classic "here's a blank check to disappear" speech? This isn't following the script at all.'

Nathan's mouth curved dangerously. "Now now, Father. Like it or not, I am your flesh and blood."

"If I'd known I was raising such a delinquent who'd wait until his thirties to settle down, I might've reconsidered paternal instincts," the older man grumbled.

Evelyn's gaze flickered between them before settling on Mr. Goldmann Sr. "Sir, I-"

He waved off her protest. "No need for explanations, my dear. If this scoundrel ever mistreats you, you've got my full support." His expression softened. "Three healthy heirs? You've single-handedly secured the Goldmann lineage. Without you, this fool might've let our family name die out."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, momentarily speechless.

'He carries himself exactly as I imagined - every inch the patrician aristocrat. But this warmth? This genuine approval? That I didn't see coming.'

"Nathan's mother passed when he was young," the older man continued, his voice tinged with nostalgia. "He's been rebelliously ignoring my advice for decades. Frankly, I'm relieved someone finally has him on a shorter leash."

Mr. Goldmann Sr. chuckled suddenly, eyes twinkling. "I've met Liam and Daisy. The moment I saw them, I knew they had to be Nathan's. They grow more delightful each time I visit."

Evelyn studied the undisguised affection in his expression.

'He genuinely adores them.'

The realization left her unexpectedly disoriented.

"Your name is Evelyn Vanderbilt, correct?"

She nodded. "Yes, sir."

"Then Zoe it shall be." He smiled benevolently. "Ah, before I forget - I brought you a little something."
###Chapter 102

"Mr. Goldmann, that's really unnecessary. You shouldn't have gone to such trouble," Evelyn stammered, flustered.

How can I possibly accept a gift from an elder?

Mr. Goldmann Sr. had already retrieved a velvet box and slowly opened it. "I hope this suits your taste."

Inside lay an exquisite imperial jade bracelet. Evelyn leaned in, her breath catching. "Is this... imperial jade?"

Mr. Goldmann Sr.'s eyes brightened. "Oh? You recognize it?"

Nathan's lips curved slightly. "Father, Zoe is a jewelry designer. She knows her gems."

"Ah, no wonder she has such a discerning eye." Mr. Goldmann Sr. nodded approvingly. "This imperial jade is one of a kind—a family heirloom. It was left by Nathan’s mother as a dowry for his future wife."

Evelyn’s fingers twitched. "Mr. Goldmann, this is far too precious. I can't possibly accept it."

Nathan smoothly intercepted the box before she could refuse. "Once a gift is given, it’s impolite to return it. I’ll hold onto it for now."

Evelyn shot him a glare. "You—"

Mr. Goldmann Sr. chuckled, watching their exchange. "You’re both still young. There’s plenty of time to figure things out."

He winked. "Besides, I know my son. Not just any woman can handle him."

Evelyn nearly groaned. I don’t want to handle him!

By the time they arrived at the Goldmann mansion after dinner, the night had deepened.

Mr. Chester greeted them warmly. "Mr. Goldmann, welcome home!"

"I’ve returned to see my grandchildren," the elder man replied with a grin.

"Grandpa!" Daisy came bounding down the stairs, Liam and Caleb trailing behind her.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. knelt, arms wide. "My, my, this little one has grown!"

Daisy pouted. "No, I haven’t!"

When Caleb approached, Mr. Goldmann Sr. studied him with amusement. "You and Liam could be twins. No wonder your father was fooled."

Caleb hesitated before murmuring, "Hi, Grandpa."

The three children swarmed around him, their laughter filling the hall.

Evelyn watched from the sidelines, a bittersweet ache in her chest.

This is what a real family feels like. Warmth I never knew in the Vanderbilt manor.

Nathan glanced at her, his expression unreadable.

Later, after her shower, Evelyn stepped out of the bathroom, reaching for the light switch.

Nathan caught her wrist, spun her around, and pinned her to the bed.

"Nathan Goldmann, what are you doing?" She struggled against his weight.

He smirked, lifting her hand to brush his lips against her knuckles. "My father adores you."

Evelyn turned her face away. "So?"

"Not just him. The children too." His fingertips traced her cheek. "Zoe, the Goldmanns will never hurt you. Neither will I."

Her lashes fluttered. The words tugged at her, but she couldn’t let herself believe them.

"Nathan," she whispered, "would you even care about me if it weren’t for the children?"

His gaze darkened.

She met his stormy eyes. "What happened six years ago was just a—"
###Chapter 103

"Perhaps that night six years ago was just a fleeting moment for you," Nathan murmured, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "But for me, it was everything."

His thumb traced the curve of her lower lip with deliberate slowness.

"I wouldn't have searched every corner of this city if it had been merely a one-night stand."

The air between them grew thick with tension.

"That anonymous woman who slipped me the drug... she led me to an unforgettable encounter."

His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Your scent, your touch - every detail is burned into my memory."

Evelyn's breath hitched as his fingers trailed down her neck.

"In all my years navigating high society, I've never met anyone who could make me lose control like you did that night. Not even Vivian could compare."

The admission hung between them like a challenge.

Nathan's grip tightened slightly as he leaned closer. "For six years, I kept Vivian by my side yet never touched her. Because only one woman has ever made me forget myself completely."

Evelyn's pulse raced dangerously fast.

'Is he... seducing me right now? This man is utterly shameless!'

"Nathan, you— Mmph!"

His kiss crashed down like a storm - wild, possessive, and impossible to resist once unleashed.

"Can't you feel it?" Nathan broke away just enough to whisper against her swollen lips, his warm breath fanning across her flushed cheeks.

"Nathan, let me go first." Evelyn pushed against his chest in vain, her hands trembling against the hard planes of his torso.

Her mind whirled in chaotic circles from the intensity of their kiss.

Fingers clutching his shirt desperately, she noticed with alarm how his body heat seemed to seep into her very bones.

This terrifying loss of control sent panic coursing through her veins. "Nathan Goldmann! You promised not to touch me!"

"Stay still." His voice emerged rough with restraint, eyes burning like smoldering coals. "I won't take what isn't offered... but I'll claim what's mine to taste."

His mouth captured hers again in a searing kiss.

The quiet room filled with sounds more intimate than words.

Evelyn's initial struggles gradually weakened, until she hovered dangerously close to surrender.

"Keep that bracelet my father gave you safe," Nathan growled against her skin when they finally parted, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He straightened his clothes with practiced efficiency and strode from the room without another word.

Left alone on the rumpled sheets, Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling, her fingers rising to touch her tingling lips.

'I almost gave in completely...'

Meanwhile, Mr. Goldmann Sr. had been entertaining the three children during his stay at the mansion - the little ones adored their grandfather's company.

Evelyn threw herself into designing new jewelry collections after securing Taylor Jewelry's supply chain, though she kept careful tabs on Viana Jewelry's movements.

Viana had enjoyed temporary popularity with their gothic collection, but limited production quantities sparked customer complaints across social media.

The mounting pressure drove Vivian to demand impossible deadlines from Frederick.

When Gregory entered the design studio with updates, Evelyn was peering through her jeweler's loupe, meticulously carving floral details into a sapphire.

"Zoe, Viana's pre-order list has surpassed three hundred customers," Gregory reported. "At this rate, we won't meet our own production deadlines."

Evelyn didn't glance up from her work. "What's their current profit margin?"

"Including deposits? Nearly a million already."

Viana had auctioned Evelyn's stolen designs for six million, with pre-orders adding another half million to their coffers.

They'd recouped most of their nine-and-a-half million loss - only three million shy of breaking even.

A knowing smile curved Evelyn's lips. "So she's tasting hope at last."

"Vivian's pushing Frederick for an entire new collection within the week," Gregory added.

Evelyn set down her tools with deliberate calm. "Then let's make sure their hope turns to ashes."
###Chapter 104

"Give him every single design sketch on that desk."

"Should we really provide her with more?"

"Absolutely." Evelyn lifted her gaze, her emerald eyes glinting with calculation. "The moment she tastes success, ambition will consume her. To fuel that fire, we must feed her greed."

Following Evelyn's instructions, Gregory discreetly delivered all the designs to Frederick, who then brought them to Viana Jewelry for Vivian.

Vivian's hands trembled as she clutched the sketches, her heart pounding with exhilaration. These designs would become Viana's lifeline - the key to restoring its profits and prestige.

'And soon, everyone will believe I created them.' Vivian nearly laughed aloud at Frederick's willingness to be her ghost designer. Immediately, she uploaded every design to her Instagram and Facebook accounts.

Within hours, the posts amassed hundreds of thousands of engagements.

When Evelyn saw Vivian's social media explosion, she handed her phone to Gregory. "Let's ensure she trends on Google. We'll make those posts go viral."

#VianaJewelryDesigner
#VivianVanderbilt

Overnight, Vivian became the talk of Bassburgh.

The comment sections overflowed with praise, each glowing compliment making Vivian's head spin. This was beyond her wildest dreams.

Madam Victoria beamed with pride - the Vanderbilts finally had a celebrity in their midst, one bringing tangible benefits to their family business.

Yet Richard remained uneasy. He knew the truth behind those dazzling designs.

"Viv, you're incredible!" Lydia gushed, her eyes shining with envy.

Madam Victoria patted Lydia's hand. "Darling, you should accompany your cousin more often. Let her introduce you to Bassburgh's elite circles."

Lydia ducked her head shyly. "Of course, Grandmother."

'Grandmother's right. Bassburgh teems with tycoons and aristocrats.' Lydia's pulse quickened. 'If I could attract one of those powerful men, even Henry wouldn't dare bully me anymore. Grandmother would finally value me!'

Vivian barely concealed her disdain. 'This provincial girl actually thinks she can climb the social ladder? I only tolerate her because she's useful against Evelyn.'

A notification chimed on Vivian's phone. Her breath caught as she read the email.

"Mother!" Vivian gasped. "I've been invited to tomorrow's Bassburgh Debutante Ball!"

The annual event gathered daughters from every prominent family in the city, along with eligible bachelors from the highest echelons of society.

Madam Victoria's eyes widened. "You'll take Lydia with you, won't you?"

'If both girls make advantageous matches, the Vanderbilts' future would be secured.'

Vivian's smile tightened. "Grandmother, each invitation is strictly personal. I only received one."

Madam Victoria's expression darkened.

Laura quickly intervened. "Mother, these galas have rigid entry protocols. Even Evelyn couldn't attend without proper credentials."

'The Vanderbilts may be wealthy, but we're not old money.' Laura swallowed bitterly. 'Vivian's always been seen as the illegitimate one. This is her first real society invitation.'
###Chapter 105

The tension in the Vanderbilt mansion was thick enough to cut with a knife.

"Perhaps it's because Vivian has become popular now and was invited as an exception!" Laura Scott said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "At any rate, her invitation to such an event has restored my standing in this family."

Richard Vanderbilt stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the hardwood floor. Without a word, he turned and stalked upstairs, leaving behind a room that suddenly felt lighter in his absence.

Laura sighed dramatically before flashing a practiced smile. "I should go check on your father."

She followed him to their bedroom, where Richard stood by the window, his expression stormy. Laura approached him cautiously, resting a manicured hand on his arm. "Darling, what's troubling you?"

He shook her off with a sharp jerk. "How could you, as her mother, let Vivian behave like this?"

Laura blinked, feigning innocence. "What exactly has Vivian done wrong?"

"Those jewelry designs aren't hers," Richard snapped. "You can fool everyone else—even Mother—but not me."

He knew his daughter too well.

If Evelyn had been credited with the designs, he might have believed it. Her talent and skill were undeniable.

But Vivian? No. He couldn’t force himself to accept that lie.

Laura stepped closer, wrapping her arms around him. "Darling, you're misunderstanding her. Vivian has been studying jewelry design—she just never mentioned it to you."

Richard remained silent, his jaw clenched.

Laura pressed on, her voice laced with manufactured hurt. "Vivian is doing this for Viana Jewelry. Yes, she may not be as naturally gifted as Zoe, but she’s working hard. If you refuse to believe in her, fine. But can’t you at least acknowledge her effort?"

"It's not about effort," Richard muttered. "How could she produce such flawless designs in such a short time?"

Something about those pieces unsettled him.

They feel familiar. Too familiar.

Laura softened her voice, trailing her fingers down his chest. "Darling, let’s not dwell on Vivian’s affairs. We have our own matters to discuss."

She leaned in, her lips brushing his ear. "Your mother is fixated on Viana now. If we were to have a son… she’d undoubtedly favor us more."

Laura kissed him, slow and deliberate.

Though in her forties, she had aged like fine wine—confident, alluring, and devastatingly skilled in the art of seduction. Within minutes, Richard’s resistance crumbled.

The next evening, the Regal Ballroom glittered under the glow of crystal chandeliers.

A red carpet stretched before the entrance, flanked by security in crisp black suits. Luxury cars rolled up one after another—Ferraris, Bentleys, Rolls-Royces—each disgorging elegantly dressed socialites dripping in diamonds and designer gowns.

Inside, the grand hall was a spectacle of opulence. Towering trays of hors d'oeuvres, decadent desserts, and rare wines lined the center tables. Celebrities and elites mingled, their laughter ringing through the air as they exchanged gossip about the city’s most powerful figures.

The crème de la crème, however, entered through private passages. Their invitations were black—symbolizing wealth and influence—while the white cards were reserved for lesser elites.

Evelyn Vanderbilt moved through the crowd with effortless grace, a champagne flute in hand. Her snow-white evening gown hugged her curves, the off-shoulder neckline accentuating her delicate collarbones. Her jet-black hair was swept into an elegant chignon, and the asymmetrical crystal earrings dangling from her ears caught the light with every step.

The gown’s hem swayed like petals as she walked, making her resemble a lily in full bloom.

"Zoe." Gregory Fannon appeared beside her, his voice low. "This crowd is unpredictable. Stay close."

Evelyn smiled. "Understood."

Attending these parties has never been my idea of fun… but since Vivian is here, why not enjoy the show?

Right on cue, Vivian made her entrance.

Her strapless black gown clung to her frame, the high slit revealing toned legs. Her hair cascaded in loose curls, her makeup heavy and theatrical.

The game had begun.
###Chapter 106

Evelyn couldn't help but burst into laughter. "Has Vivian finally dropped her innocent act?"

Had she switched to a more provocative persona?

When Vivian spotted Evelyn, her expression darkened. What was this woman doing here? Though... this could work to her advantage.

"Look who's here," Vivian sauntered toward her with false sweetness. "Even you received an invitation?"

Evelyn feigned surprise. "I could say the same about you." Vivian probably had no idea how she'd gotten her own invitation.

Vivian tossed her hair arrogantly. "I'm trending right now. Soon, Evelyn, I'll be dominating the fashion jewelry scene."

"Is that so?" Evelyn remained composed. "The industry isn't kind to those who can't deliver. One misstep and your reputation is ruined."

Vivian's jaw tightened. "Sounds like you're scared. I would be too, considering you've done nothing noteworthy since leaving Viana. Meanwhile, Viana Jewelry is thriving without you."

She leaned closer, venom dripping from her words. "Don't get too comfortable with Nathan's support. When I surpass you, I'll take him back too."

"By all means, try." Evelyn's smile never wavered. Vivian's threats meant nothing to her.

Seeing Evelyn's indifference only fueled Vivian's rage. How dare she remain so calm! It was only because of Nathan's backing.

Just wait. When Vivian turned the tables, she'd crush Evelyn beneath her designer heels until there was nothing left of her career.

"Are you the new jewelry designer everyone's talking about?"

"Your pieces are absolutely stunning! Could you share your inspiration?"

Two socialites approached Vivian, drawn by her sudden fame in jewelry design. Though not yet at the top, she'd gained recognition.

Vivian's smile froze momentarily before she forced her sweetest expression. "Those were just my early attempts. Nothing special."

The perfect picture of humility. The socialites ate it up.

"Nonsense! Your aesthetic is impeccable!"

"Honestly, I used to think only D could master gothic jewelry, but your work has completely changed my mind about dark themes."

The women chatted excitedly. Everyone in this circle knew their gemstones.

"Who's D?" Vivian asked, trying to join the conversation.

Both socialites blinked in shock.

Evelyn chuckled, swirling her wine glass. "How curious. If you don't know D, where did your designs truly come from?"

Vivian's face flushed crimson. "Zoe, that's not what I— Of course I know him. It just slipped my mind."

The innocent act returned full force.

The socialites exchanged glances. It was understandable—one couldn't possibly know every designer.

Evelyn lowered her gaze with a knowing smile. "D revolutionized gothic jewelry. His work mirrored his rebellious soul—cold, untamed beauty."

She continued softly, "A true maverick whose pieces were controversial before gaining recognition. Tragic really... he died at sixteen, and his dark aesthetic only became iconic decades later."
###Chapter 107

"Most young designers today wouldn't recognize his name. It's perfectly understandable."

Evelyn remembered her mother's words from childhood. Her mother had become a designer because she admired the legendary D's work. She'd wanted to prove that gothic jewelry could possess the same timeless elegance as vintage pieces.

Vivian bit her lip in frustration.

'Damn Evelyn, bringing up some dead designer? She's just jealous my collection is going viral.'

"Yes, Mr. D passed away quite young. I'm relatively new to the industry, so the connection didn't immediately occur to me." Vivian forced an apologetic expression.

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "How curious then. If you're unfamiliar with Mr. D's work, where exactly did you find inspiration for your gothic collection?"

Vivian's smile froze in place.

All eyes in their circle turned toward Vivian, waiting for her response. The two socialites exchanged meaningful glances.

Vivian's nails dug into her palms as she fantasized about silencing Evelyn's mocking lips permanently.

This was the burden Evelyn intended her to bear - the consequence of stealing another's legacy. She would make Vivian regret every stolen design, one excruciating moment at a time.

The carefully orchestrated humiliation had only just begun.

"What's all this commotion about?"

A sharp voice cut through the tension as the crowd parted respectfully.

Penelope Santiago approached in a cloud of expensive perfume, her stiletto heels clicking like a countdown. "Ladies, this is a society event, not some jewelry trade show." She cast a dismissive glance at Vivian. "Honestly, who cares about some upstart designer?"

Penelope's gaze swept over Vivian with undisguised contempt.

Such was the privilege of being a Santiago.

As the heiress to La Pe Group, second only to Taylor Jewelry and rivaling Hailey & Co., Penelope moved through elite circles with effortless superiority. The Vanderbilts' Viana Jewelry barely registered on her radar - let alone some newly "discovered" talent like Vivian.

"Penelope darling, there you are!"

The two socialites immediately abandoned Vivian to flock around Penelope. Talent meant nothing compared to the power and connections of La Pe's princess.

Left standing alone, Vivian clenched her fists until her manicure threatened to crack. That spoiled heiress would learn what it felt like to be crushed beneath someone's designer heels.

Penelope's attention suddenly shifted to Evelyn and Gregory. With deliberate arrogance, she sauntered toward Evelyn. "Well, well. Have society parties become so desperate they'll let anyone in these days?"

Evelyn had been enjoying the unfolding drama when Penelope redirected the spotlight onto her.

Irritation flickered across her features.

The Santiago heiress clearly hadn't inherited her father's intelligence.

Evelyn met Penelope's gaze with an amused smile. "Ms. Santiago, your comment insults every guest here. We were all properly invited - unless you're suggesting this is your family's private function?"
###Chapter 108

Evelyn's words carried a clear message - Penelope held no real influence here as a mere guest.

Penelope's gaze swept across the murmuring crowd, realization dawning on her.

She folded her arms defiantly. "Which family do you represent?"

Evelyn merely shrugged, offering no response.

Vivian stepped forward, chin lifted. "We're the Vanderbilts. She's my sister."

The Vanderbilt name carried its own weight in certain circles.

Evelyn massaged her temples. While the Vanderbilts had wealth, they weren't considered true elites. Why would Vivian announce it so boldly?

"Vanderbilts?" Penelope's laughter rang hollow. "Which Vanderbilts? I've never heard of you."

Perfect. Vivian had walked straight into a trap.

The whispers grew louder. "Vanderbilts? The Viana Jewelry Vanderbilts?"

Penelope covered her mouth in mock surprise. "Viana Jewelry? That insignificant boutique? You're nothing compared to La Pe."

Vivian's lips trembled as she bit down hard.

Then her expression shifted, adopting a wounded dignity. "Ms. Santiago, Viana was founded by Evelyn's mother. Your insults dishonor her late parent."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Was Vivian trying to redirect the spotlight onto her? Not happening.

Evelyn feigned shock. "That was years ago. Viana belongs entirely to you now. If the company's reputation suffers, shouldn't you, as current owner, take responsibility?"

She continued smoothly, "Besides, you're the celebrated designer now - the prodigy who mastered complex techniques overnight. Truly remarkable."

Gregory nearly choked on his drink at Evelyn's words.

He approached Penelope. "Ms. Santiago, surely none of La Pe's designers could produce such... innovative work with so little training?"

Penelope gave Vivian a sidelong glance.

Vivian's hands clenched into fists. How dare they mock her!

"I-I never claimed..." Her voice quivered with manufactured tears, painting Penelope as the bully.

Penelope's expression darkened further. She glared at Evelyn. "Are you trying to provoke me?"

She laughed sharply. "Honestly, I couldn't care less about Viana or your little jewelry venture. You couldn't even secure a collaboration with Taylor. Why bother staying in this industry?"

"The host must have lowered their standards considerably to invite you. Did you sneak in through the service entrance?"

Gregory stepped forward. "Ms. Santiago, mind your words. We entered through the main doors like everyone else."

"Prove it," Penelope demanded. "Show me your invitations. I want to see why they'd bother with you."

Gregory remained unimpressed. "Such pettiness. What would your father think of this behavior?"

Evelyn added dryly, "She's never concerned about consequences. Daddy always cleans up her messes."

The taunts finally broke Penelope's composure. She lunged at Evelyn, shoving her violently. "Shut your mouth!"

The sudden attack caught Evelyn off-balance. The crowd gasped collectively.

Vivian hid a triumphant smile.

Evelyn stumbled backward toward the precarious tower of champagne glasses and crystal decanters.
###Chapter 109

Crash!

The elegant gala descended into chaos.

"Zoe!"

Gregory immediately rushed forward to catch her, but Evelyn had already knocked over the crystal wine glasses and champagne bottles. Her ivory gown was now stained crimson, and shards of broken glass left thin cuts along her delicate arm.

All eyes turned to Penelope.

Penelope stood frozen, her face ghostly pale. "No... I didn't... I barely touched her!"

Her push had been feather-light!

"Zoe, you're bleeding!" Gregory examined her arm with growing panic.

Vivian barely concealed her smirk.

Though the fall wasn't serious, causing such a scene would surely get Evelyn thrown out.

"I'm fine, Uncle Gregory." Evelyn rose gracefully despite her disheveled appearance. Her cool gaze locked onto Penelope's ashen face.

"Ms. Santiago, I was merely offering advice. I never expected such a violent reaction. La Pe's reputation has certainly... diminished in my eyes."

"You planned this!" Penelope snapped out of her daze, finger trembling as she pointed accusingly. "That was barely a nudge! You're setting me up!"

Setting her up?

Evelyn couldn't deny she'd exaggerated the fall. But sometimes, dramatic lessons were the most effective.

Security arrived swiftly. Seeing them, Penelope shrieked, "She's causing a disturbance! Look at this mess! Remove her immediately!"

The guards hesitated, recognizing the Santiago heiress. Not wanting to offend powerful guests, they moved toward Evelyn.

Vivian nearly vibrated with excitement. Perfect! Public humiliation would destroy Evelyn's social standing forever.

"You have no authority to remove me." Evelyn produced a black embossed invitation just as the guards approached.

They froze mid-step.

Penelope's face twisted. "Impossible! How did you—" Even she couldn't obtain black-level invitations. Who was this woman?

"Would you like to verify its authenticity?" Evelyn's voice dripped ice.

The arriving PR manager cleared his throat. "May I see your invitation and identification, madam?"

When Evelyn remained motionless, Penelope crowed triumphantly. "See? She can't produce it! That invitation's stolen!"

"Madam, without proper verification, we must ask you to—"

"I'd like to see you try."

Nathan emerged from the crowd like a panther stalking into spotlight. His tailored suit accentuated his powerful frame, amber eyes glinting with dangerous frost. The press of his lips betrayed barely contained fury.

"Mr. Goldmann?" Murmurs rippled through the crowd. "Why is he here?"

The atmosphere crackled with sudden tension as the billionaire positioned himself protectively beside Evelyn, his presence rewriting the entire power dynamic in the room.
###Chapter 110

Evelyn's heart leapt when she spotted Nathan approaching through the crowd.

"Nathan-" Her greeting died on her lips as he strode past without so much as glancing her way.

All eyes followed him as he moved straight toward Vivian.

Penelope froze in shock.

Mr. Goldmann? Here? How was this possible?

"Mr-Mr. Goldmann, who is this woman? Why are you-"

Nathan's icy gaze cut her off. "Since you dared lay hands on my woman, I assume you no longer wish to remain in this industry."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

His woman?

Nathan Goldmann had never publicly acknowledged any romantic relationship before today.

A dozen socialites' hearts shattered simultaneously.

Vivian's face drained of color. Her nails bit into her palms as she glared daggers at Evelyn.

Why? How could Evelyn enchant Nathan into publicly claiming her?

After six years by his side, Vivian had never received such recognition. The injustice burned like acid.

The PR manager stammered, "Mr. Goldmann, please forgive us, we didn't realize-"

Nathan swept Evelyn into his arms and leveled a glare at the organizers. "Send your director to see me immediately." Then he carried her away.

Penelope's knees buckled. She would have collapsed if bystanders hadn't caught her.

As the crowd dispersed, whispers swirled like autumn leaves.

"Ms. Santiago just signed her professional death warrant."

"La Pe Group has gravely offended Mr. Goldmann this time."

"I doubt we'll see Penelope at any society events next season."

Nathan carried Evelyn into the VIP lounge.

She kept her eyes downcast, squirming slightly. "You can put me down now."

He deposited her gently on the sofa. The sight of the cut on her arm darkened his expression. "Stay here."

When he returned with a first aid kit, she murmured, "It's just a scratch. Don't make a fuss."

"Quiet." Nathan knelt before her. "Give me your arm."

She extended it gingerly.

His grip tightened slightly, pulling at the wound. A soft whimper escaped her lips.

Nathan's gaze snapped up. "Does it hurt?"

"Do I look like a robot to you?" She studied him suspiciously. "Why are you here anyway?"

He applied antiseptic with surprising gentleness. "If I hadn't arrived, they'd have thrown you out by now."

Evelyn chuckled. "You don't know that."

His fingers stilled. "Since when do you tolerate bullies? Why were you playing along with those vipers?"

"I wasn't playing along." She withdrew her bandaged arm. "If I had been, there wouldn't have been a scene."

Originally she'd only intended to provoke Vivian, but when Penelope inserted herself so eagerly into the drama... well, Evelyn couldn't resist teaching the spoiled heiress a lesson.

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "So you let yourself get hurt on purpose?"

"Penelope is La Pe's pampered princess. Someone needed to remind her the world doesn't revolve around her." Evelyn's casual tone made Nathan's jaw tighten.

The dangerous glint in his eyes betrayed his disapproval of her reckless methods.
###Chapter 111

Nathan's hands slid to the back of Evelyn's neck, gripping firmly as he yanked her forward. His lips crashed against hers in a punishing kiss, rough and unrelenting.

"Mm—Nathan Goldmann, let me go—!" Evelyn barely managed to gasp for air before he claimed her mouth again.

This time, he pressed his entire body against hers, pinning her in place. The intensity of his assault left her mind blank, her thoughts scattering like leaves in a storm. His dominating presence surrounded her, overwhelming.

Her hands, which had been pushing against his chest in weak resistance, now clutched the fabric of his shirt, her fingers trembling.

"It hurts. You're crushing me—" Evelyn whimpered, her voice muffled against his lips as his weight pressed her arms painfully into the mattress.

Nathan shifted slightly, easing the pressure but not releasing her. Instead, he nipped at her lower lip, his voice a dark whisper. "Do you dare hurt yourself again?"

Evelyn remained silent.

His hand, which had been resting on her waist, slid lower, fingers tracing dangerous patterns.

She shivered violently, her grip tightening on his wrist to stop him. "I—I was wrong! I know I was wrong!"

Seeing her surrender, Nathan pulled back slightly, his gaze sharp. "If you ever do this again, I won't let you off so easily."

"Okay, I won’t let myself get hurt anymore," Evelyn promised quickly, nodding with wide, earnest eyes.

Nathan exhaled, his expression unreadable.

A knock at the door interrupted them. Nathan turned his head. "Enter."

Two staff members stepped inside, carrying two elegant boxes—one containing a new evening gown, the other a pair of designer heels.

They bowed respectfully. "Our deepest apologies, Mr. Goldmann and Ms. Vanderbilt. This incident was due to our negligence. Our boss has sent this haute couture gown as a gesture of apology. We sincerely hope Ms. Vanderbilt will accept it."

The box was opened, revealing a breathtaking gown—hand-stitched with intricate golden embroidery, the silk brocade shimmering under the light.

Evelyn smiled politely. "Please thank your boss for me."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed, his gaze locked onto Evelyn’s indifferent expression. "You know Edmund Lincoln?"

Edmund was the one who gave her that exclusive invitation, wasn’t he?

"Yes," Evelyn admitted without hesitation.

Edmund Lincoln wasn’t just a name in the fashion industry—he was a powerhouse in every elite circle, hosting high-profile events from charity galas to masquerade balls.

"How did you meet?" Nathan demanded, his voice edged with suspicion.

Evelyn frowned. "Why does it matter?"

Nathan leaned closer, his presence suffocating. "I want to know."

There was always something she wasn’t telling him.

"I’m Zara, a renowned jewelry designer. Is it really so strange that I’d know someone like Edmund Lincoln?" She shrugged, as if the answer were obvious.

Nathan studied her, silent.

Evelyn grabbed the gown and stood. "I’m going to change."

Nathan watched her retreat into the adjoining room, his expression darkening.

Edmund Lincoln was a Morwich native—a man who thrived in the shadows of high society, weaving connections with everyone from business moguls to underground syndicates. He wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

If Evelyn only met him as Zara, and she only became Zara after leaving Zlokova six years ago… while Edmund has been in Zlokova all this time…

His jaw tightened.

There was more to this story. And he would uncover it.
###Chapter 112

The realization struck Nathan like lightning - Evelyn must have known Edmund long before their supposed first meeting six years ago.

Lost in thought, his gaze suddenly caught a breathtaking vision entering the room.

The delicate crane embroidery on her evening gown shimmered under the lights, each stitch perfectly placed. The fitted bodice accentuated her slender waist, the flowing fabric hugging her curves in a way that commanded attention.

Evelyn moved like a living masterpiece, every step radiating grace that made it impossible to look away. She was elegance personified, a vision that stole the breath from his lungs.

Nathan's eyes darkened with primal hunger.

This enchanting siren. I want to strip away that polished exterior and devour every inch of her.

Sensing the predatory shift in his energy, Evelyn instinctively turned toward the exit.

Her hand barely touched the doorknob when his arm snaked around her waist, pinning her against the solid wood. His hot breath fanned across her neck. "Zoe, you're breathtaking..."

His lips traced the delicate column of her throat. "Nathan Goldmann, stop—" Evelyn could feel the barely restrained desire radiating from him, scorching her skin without even touching her.

Why is this man always so insatiable?

Nathan turned her face toward him, claiming her lips in a searing kiss.

Resistance was futile against his strength. When he held her like this, his body became an immovable force.

His hands roamed possessively.

"My wrist—it hurts."

The pained whisper snapped Nathan back to reality.

Damn it! Her injury—I completely forgot.

"I'm sorry." The apology came instantly, laced with genuine remorse.

Never in his life had he apologized to a woman like this.

Evelyn smirked inwardly. Would he have stopped if I hadn't played the injury card? All that talk about not forcing me—what hypocrisy!

"Do that again and I'll really be angry," she warned, turning her face away.

She was still learning Nathan's temperament. One thing was clear—reason worked better than resistance with this man.

Force would only provoke him further. But she'd discovered his surprising vulnerability to her softer side.

Nathan turned her to face him. The way she scolded him sent heat pooling low in his gut.

At least she's not freezing me out anymore. Progress.

"Then when will you be ready?" The question came out strained, like a child begging for sweets. He wasn't sure how much longer he could restrain himself.

Evelyn fixed him with an unimpressed stare. "Do all men think with their libido instead of their brain?"

"Can't speak for all men." Nathan tilted her chin up. "But you're the only one who makes me lose control."

In other words, only she had this effect on him.

Evelyn had no retort.

Nathan traced her lower lip with his thumb, voice dropping an octave. "You should know... I've been... restraining myself for six years."

His control had an expiration date.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Didn't Vivian throw herself at you repeatedly?"

She'd bet her fortune that woman had tried every trick in the book. No way he'd remained celibate all these years.

Nathan's expression darkened. "I never wanted her."

"Oh really?" Evelyn pushed against his chest. "Then feel free to take care of yourself. I'm leaving."

"You'd really abandon me?" The mighty wolf had transformed into a pleading puppy. "Zoe..."

The pathetic whine almost made her laugh. Nathan Goldmann, reduced to begging. Evelyn had no words for this unexpected vulnerability.
###Chapter 113

Evelyn slipped into the elegant evening gown and emerged from the restroom, joining Nathan at the banquet entrance.

The moment they stepped into the glittering hall together, all eyes turned toward them. Nathan remained as composed as ever, his expression unreadable, while Evelyn avoided his gaze entirely after what had transpired earlier.

'I did nothing wrong. Ugh, can I just erase that memory completely?'

"Zoe." Gregory approached, concern etched across his features. "How's your injury?"

"It's nothing serious. Just a minor scratch—already taken care of." Evelyn offered a reassuring smile.

Nathan's arm slid possessively around her waist as he gave Gregory a faint, knowing smirk. "No need to worry, Mr. Fannon. I'll be looking after her now."

Across the room, Vivian tightened her grip on her wine glass until her knuckles turned white.

'All the attention is on Evelyn and Nathan.'

She ground her teeth as whispers of admiration floated around her.

'That should be me standing beside him. Evelyn shouldn't have come back. Better yet—she shouldn’t exist at all.'

A cold glint flashed in her eyes before she turned and melted into the crowd.

Evelyn noticed Vivian's abrupt departure and immediately tensed. She pushed Nathan’s hand away. "I need to use the restroom."

"Should I accompany you?" Nathan arched a brow.

Evelyn shot him a look that screamed 'pervert' before striding off.

Nathan chuckled under his breath.

Meanwhile, Vivian found Penelope in the corridor, speaking heatedly into her phone. She approached with a calculated smile. "Ms. Santiago."

Penelope, still fuming from her earlier humiliation, scowled. "What do you want? Here to mock me?"

"Quite the opposite. I'm here to help you."

"Help me?" Penelope scoffed. "Aren’t you her sister? Why would you?"

Vivian bit her lip, feigning distress. "We’re only half-sisters. Truthfully, I despise her just as much as you do."

Penelope narrowed her eyes. "What’s your plan?"

'If it weren’t for Mr. Goldmann, I wouldn’t have been humiliated like this. That woman—how dare she!'

"Without Nathan’s protection, what does she have left? If her reputation is ruined, do you think he’d still want her?" Vivian’s lips curled into a venomous smile.

Penelope hesitated, then leaned in. "What do you propose?"

Vivian’s voice dropped to a whisper. "If we work together tonight, she won’t escape unscathed. Imagine the headlines tomorrow."

Hidden behind a pillar, Evelyn listened, her expression darkening.

'I knew Vivian wouldn’t give up. Teaming up with Penelope? Predictable.'

She pulled out her phone and sent a quick message.

'Looks like there’s going to be a show tonight.'

Back in the banquet hall, Vivian spotted Evelyn alone—Nathan nowhere in sight.

'Perfect. Without him, this will be easy.'

Her phone buzzed—a text from Penelope.

Just then, a bartender approached Evelyn with a tray. After a brief exchange, Evelyn set down her glass and followed him out.

Vivian smirked.

'Everything is falling into place.'
###Chapter 114

After finalizing her plans, Penelope deliberately sought out Vivian to share the news. She then gathered a team to hunt down Evelyn.

"I can't wait to see Evelyn Vanderbilt become the laughingstock of high society when we find her," Vivian sneered, barely containing her excitement.

"After tonight, Evelyn will be completely ruined! What does it matter if her children are Nathan's? The Goldmann family would never accept such a disgraceful woman!"

Evelyn followed the bartender to the private lounge where Penelope waited with false sincerity.

As the bartender exited, Penelope rose with practiced grace. "Ms. Vanderbilt, I must apologize for earlier. I requested this meeting to make amends properly. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?"

She grasped Evelyn's hands with theatrical remorse.

'Her performance is almost convincing,' Evelyn thought. 'If I didn't know better, I might actually believe her.'

Evelyn withdrew her hands slowly, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "Ms. Santiago, is this apology truly genuine?"

"O-Of course it is!" Penelope's voice wavered slightly, her eyes darting away for a fraction of a second. "I admit my behavior was unacceptable. Please, accept my sincere apology."

"Here's the problem, Ms. Santiago," Evelyn said, twisting the serpent ring on her finger absently. "You never intended to apologize, did you?"

Penelope's mask slipped momentarily. "What nonsense! I'm here specifically to make amends!"

"Then I'll give you one final chance," Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "What exactly do you want from me?"

Penelope's breath hitched.

'She couldn't possibly know... could she?'

'No, I can't let this opportunity slip away. If this fails, I'll be the laughingstock of Cornelia's elite circles!'

"If you have nothing else to say, I'll take my leave." Evelyn turned toward the door.

"Do you really think you can walk away?" Penelope suddenly shrieked, grabbing Evelyn's arm. "Now!"

Several muscular men emerged from a hidden side room, surrounding them.

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Ms. Santiago, are you absolutely certain about this path?"

"What does it matter? No one's coming to save you tonight," Penelope spat, shoving Evelyn toward the men. "You thought being Nathan Goldmann's plaything made you special? Let me show you what happens when you cross me!"

One thug pressed a chloroform-soaked cloth against Evelyn's face. She struggled briefly before going limp.

Penelope loomed over Evelyn's unconscious form. "After tonight, you'll be nothing." She turned to the men with a cruel smile. "Gentlemen, enjoy your prize."

The men leered eagerly. "Yes, ma'am!"

'$80,000 to defile this beauty? Best paycheck ever,' one thought greedily.

As Penelope stepped outside, a shadowy figure struck her temple. She collapsed without a sound.

The men spun around at the noise, finding a black-clad man with neck tattoos dragging Penelope's unconscious body back inside.

The intruder calmly drew a pistol. "Don't move."

Simultaneously, Evelyn - now very much awake - pressed her serpent ring's hidden blade against the nearest thug's throat. "Cooperate if you value your lives."

Caught between gunpoint and cold steel, the men raised their hands in surrender. "W-We were just hired help! We don't know anything!"
###Chapter 115

Evelyn strode toward the unconscious woman in black, swiftly retrieving a cell phone from her limp body.

With practiced ease, she pressed the woman's thumb against the sensor, unlocking the device in seconds.

Her fingers danced across the screen as she composed a message to Vivian: "Bring her to the east wing in twenty minutes."

After sending it, she tucked the phone into her pocket and rose gracefully. "Mr. Kane, I'll leave the rest to you."

The imposing figure in black gave a curt nod.

Evelyn exited the lounge, her heels clicking against the marble floor as she approached the balcony.

A distinguished middle-aged man stood with his back to her, his platinum blonde hair tied in an elegant low ponytail. As he turned, the moonlight caught the delicate silver chain of his vintage spectacles.

"Uncle Edmund," Evelyn greeted with a playful curtsy, her emerald eyes sparkling with mischief.

The refined gentleman before her was Edmund Lincoln. His aristocratic features and impeccable tailoring made him appear at least a decade younger than his forty-five years.

Only those who knew him well understood this was no mere illusion of youth.

He reached out to tousle her hair affectionately. "You reckless child. What if I hadn't been able to send Kane in time?"

"I never doubt you," she replied without hesitation.

'Even if the world turns against me, I'll always trust Uncle Edmund.'

While Sophia had helped her escape abroad six years ago, it was Edmund who had protected her throughout her exile in Stoslo.

Without his influence, she would have been devoured alive in that ruthless foreign land.

She'd known Edmund since childhood through her mother. Though their exact connection remained unclear, one truth stood undeniable - he alone knew her mother's true identity.

"Such blind faith is dangerous, little one." Though his words carried reprimand, his warm gaze betrayed paternal affection.

He'd known of Evelyn's return to Zlokova for months. Their prolonged silence was by design - she refused to use their connection for vengeance.

'This stubborn girl insists on doing everything alone.'

Edmund rested a hand on her shoulder. "You should return before Nathan grows suspicious."

"Now? But I'd miss all the fun." A wicked grin played on her lips.

Recognizing that glint in her eyes, Edmund chuckled. "Do as you please. Leave the Santiagos to me - just enjoy your evening."

Meanwhile, the event coordinator scrambled to contain the earlier disturbance, knowing full well they couldn't afford to anger the Goldmann heir.

Nathan's gaze kept sweeping the crowd, his champagne flute forgotten. The absence of one particular guest made his expression darken.

"Handle this yourselves," he dismissed the staff abruptly.

Just as he turned to search, Vivian came rushing toward him in apparent distress. "Nathan! Something terrible has happened!"

She clutched his arm with trembling hands. "Zoe's disappeared! I've looked everywhere!"

His entire body tensed. "Are you certain?"

"I know you don't trust me," Vivian said with tear-filled eyes, "but we need to find her immediately!"

Inwardly, she sneered. 'If only I knew which man's bed she's warming tonight.'
###Chapter 116

"Mr. Goldmann," Gregory approached abruptly, his brow furrowed with concern. "Have you seen Zoe? Her phone keeps going to voicemail."

Vivian feigned shock at his words. "What? She's not answering? Oh no... could something terrible have happened to Zoe?"

Gregory studied Vivian's face suspiciously. Since when did she care about Zoe's wellbeing?

"Impossible," he muttered. "Who would dare cause trouble in the VIP lounge?"

Just then, a group of passing women caught Nathan's attention with their hushed whispers.

"Did you hear? There's some... activity in the private lounge. They're not even trying to be discreet about it!"

Vivian hid a smirk as she saw Nathan's expression darken. Playing innocent, she added, "The lounge? That's odd... when I asked about Zoe earlier, the waiter mentioned seeing her head that way..."

Nathan's eyes turned glacial as he strode toward the lounge without a word.

Vivian watched his retreating figure with vicious satisfaction. 'Evelyn Vanderbilt, after tonight, you'll never dare show your face in high society again!'

When Nathan arrived, several flustered staff members were knocking frantically on the locked door. The unmistakable sounds coming from inside left no doubt about what was happening.

Vivian had orchestrated quite the audience, now gathered behind them with phones at the ready. She put on her best concerned expression. "Oh dear... that couldn't possibly be Zoe in there, could it?"

Nathan's piercing gaze made her shrink back. "What makes you so certain it's her?"

"I-I'm not!" Vivian stammered. "The waiter just mentioned seeing her come this way..."

At that moment, the very waiter who'd escorted Evelyn earlier pushed through the crowd. "I did see Ms. Vanderbilt enter this lounge, sir. And..." he hesitated, "...several gentlemen followed shortly after."

"Ms. Vanderbilt? The CEO's girlfriend?"

"My God, is she really... with multiple men?"

The murmurs spread like wildfire through the gathering crowd.

Gregory clenched his fists. "This is absurd! Zoe would never—"

Nathan silenced him with a look as the manager arrived with the master key.

Vivian could barely contain her excitement as the door swung open, dozens of phones raised to capture the scandalous scene.

The sight that greeted them was indeed shocking—a disheveled woman surrounded by equally ragged men, her dress torn, cheeks flushed, completely lost in passion despite the audience.

Vivian's triumphant smile froze when she recognized the woman's face.

'Penelope?! How—'

"Oh my God, it's Ms. Santiago!"

"Start recording! This is front-page material!"

The staff quickly intervened, pulling the dazed participants apart. As consciousness returned, Penelope took in the flashing cameras, the stains on her skin, the men around her—

"No! This isn't right!" she shrieked, collapsing to her knees as reality set in. The perfect trap had sprung on the wrong prey.
###Chapter 117

"What the hell! Why is she here?!"

Evelyn emerged casually from behind the crowd, her expression the picture of innocence. "What's going on?" she asked, blinking those wide doe eyes that could fool even the most skeptical observer.

Gregory rushed forward. "Zoe, where were you? They were saying you were—"

"I stepped out to take a phone call." Evelyn tilted her head slightly, feigning confusion. "Did something happen?"

Nathan's piercing gaze never left her face. The moment he'd heard that woman's voice outside the door, he'd known this wasn't Evelyn's doing.

Vivian's manicured nails dug into her palms until crescent marks appeared. Her entire body trembled with suppressed rage when she saw Evelyn standing there, unscathed.

'Damn it! That bitch was supposed to be ruined! How did Penelope end up in that situation? This is disastrous!'

Penelope Santiago's face twisted into something grotesque when her eyes landed on Evelyn. "You! This was your doing!" she shrieked, launching herself forward like a feral cat.

Security guards materialized just in time to restrain the hysterical socialite.

"You scheming whore! You set me up! I'll destroy you for this!" Penelope's screams echoed through the hallway, her designer dress torn, makeup streaked down her face.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "I set you up? Ms. Santiago, whatever do you mean?" Her voice dripped with feigned concern.

'This is what happens when you play with fire, darling. I gave you every chance to walk away.'

"It was supposed to be you in there! You ruined everything!" Penelope had completely lost her composure, her carefully constructed image shattered beyond repair.

Evelyn's expression shifted to mock realization. "Wait... are you saying you intended to harm me?" She turned dramatically to the crowd. "That explains why a waiter told me you were waiting for me in the lounge."

Her sharp eyes immediately found the guilty-looking staff member. She pulled him forward. "You're the one who delivered that message, aren't you?"

"I—I just—" The waiter stammered, sweat beading on his forehead. He'd only been following Ms. Santiago's orders—how was he supposed to know things would go so horribly wrong?

"I was on my way to meet her when I got that phone call." Evelyn's gaze returned to Penelope, her voice taking on a wounded tone. "Ms. Santiago, I didn't realize we had any issues between us. Why would you want to hurt me?"

Penelope's face turned ashen under the weight of everyone's judgmental stares and whispered condemnations.

'Not a single person here pities me.'

Once the queen bee of Bassburgh's elite circles, Penelope had made too many enemies with her arrogance. That no one was openly laughing at her downfall was mercy enough.

Vivian tried to slink away unnoticed, but Penelope's gaze snapped to her like a heat-seeking missile.

'That's right! This was all her idea!'

"You!" Penelope broke free from the guards and lunged at Vivian. "Don't you dare run away now, you lying bitch! This was all your scheme!"

The sudden attack caught everyone off guard. Vivian's expensive gown nearly ripped as Penelope yanked her hair violently.

"Aah! This has nothing to do with me!" Vivian shrieked, desperately trying to preserve what little dignity she had left.

It took three security guards to finally restrain the fuming Penelope.

Vivian stood there, disheveled and humiliated, shaking her head frantically at the accusing stares. "No, I didn't—it wasn't me—"

"Nathan, please believe me!" Her voice cracked when she saw the ice in Nathan's expression.

In that moment, Vivian realized she'd become the punchline of this entire farce. Overwhelmed by the mounting pressure, her eyes rolled back dramatically as she collapsed to the floor in a dead faint.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll at the theatrics.

'Her performance skills improve with every crisis. How convenient to escape accountability by playing the delicate fainting flower.'
###Chapter 118

"What a shame she couldn't escape the chaos she created with Penelope."

Inside the car—

Nathan drove back to the Goldmann mansion. Evelyn, seated in the passenger seat, kept her gaze fixed out the window.

"He hasn’t said a word. Is that good or bad?"

When the car stopped at a red light, Nathan turned to look at her, his gaze burning with intensity.

Evelyn felt it immediately. She met his eyes. "Mr. Goldmann, is there a reason you're staring at me like that?"

He arched a brow. "Do I need a reason to look at my woman?"

A smirk tugged at her lips. "Being your woman is a dangerous job. I doubt you'd say the same if I were the one in that lounge last night."

Nathan’s expression darkened, his eyes turning icy.

"What would I have done if it had been her? I might have killed every man who laid a hand on her."

He looked away, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Seems I underestimated you."

"To escape those men, she either has skills I don’t know about… or someone helped her. I need to look into this."

#Penelope Santiago’s Scandal at the Party#

#Nathan Goldmann’s First Public Girlfriend#

By the next morning, Penelope had skyrocketed to the top of Google Trends, surpassing even Nathan’s announcement about Evelyn. It was the most explosive news of the year.

Shortly after, the host of the elite socialite party issued a statement—Penelope was permanently banned from all future events.

Effectively, she had been erased from Bassburgh’s high society.

Though her father, Alexander Santiago, wanted to defend her, the public backlash forced him to issue a public apology instead.

Evelyn sat in her office, scrolling through the headlines with an unreadable expression.

"If I hadn’t prepared last night, I would be the one trending right now. The one being humiliated."

"Vivian wanted to set me up. How could I let her walk away unscathed? She deserves to taste her own medicine."

"Now that Penelope is ruined, the person she’ll hate most is Vivian—the mastermind behind this disaster."

Gregory walked in, grinning. "Zoe, big news."

Evelyn glanced up. "What is it?"

"Alexander Santiago seems to have figured out his daughter’s downfall is linked to Vivian. He’s retaliating—Viana Jewelry’s stocks dropped 15% today."

"That’s at least a three-million-dollar loss overnight."

Evelyn rested her chin on her hand, amused.

"Penelope wasn’t even part of my plan. Vivian dragged her into this mess. Now, they’ve saved me the trouble."

Gregory hesitated. "Zoe, now that Nathan has publicly claimed you, the Santiagos won’t dare touch you. But I’m worried Vivian will shift all the blame onto you."

He had pieced it together—last night’s incident was Vivian’s doing. Penelope was just an unlucky pawn.

And Vivian? She’d never admit it was her scheme.

Evelyn leaned back. "Uncle Gregory, arrange a meeting for me with Mrs. Santiago."

At the Santiago manor—

"Get out!" Penelope hurled objects across the room, keeping the servants at bay.

Mrs. Santiago entered, heartbroken at the sight of her daughter’s devastation.

"Penelope, you need to eat something—"

"I won’t!" Penelope screamed, her eyes bloodshot. "I’m Bassburgh’s biggest joke! How can I face anyone now?!"
###Chapter 119

Penelope Santiago's sobs echoed through the lavish bedroom as her mother, Mrs. Santiago, held her tightly. "It's just the Vanderbilts, darling," she murmured, stroking her daughter's hair. "Your father won't let them get away with this. But you need to eat something first."

The moment Penelope's tears subsided, the butler appeared at the door. "Madam, Evelyn Vanderbilt is here to see the young lady."

At the mention of that name, Penelope's face twisted in fury. "I don't want to see her! That witch ruined everything! It's all her fault!"

Mrs. Santiago's expression darkened. "After what she did to my daughter, she dares show her face here?"

The butler hesitated. "She claims she's here to talk. And... she's Nathan Goldmann's girlfriend."

Mrs. Santiago's breath hitched. 'The same woman Goldmann publicly claimed last night?'

Her mind raced. The Santiagos couldn't afford to cross the Goldmanns, but Penelope was broken—her reputation in tatters. Was this woman here to gloat?

She glanced at her distraught daughter and stood. "I'll handle this."

Evelyn Vanderbilt was led into the grand sitting room, where Mrs. Santiago waited, her posture rigid.

"My daughter is in this state because of your family," she spat. "And yet you have the audacity to come here? To humiliate us further?"

Evelyn remained composed. "Mrs. Santiago, I'm not here to mock your family. What happened last night wasn't my doing—I was the intended victim."

Mrs. Santiago scoffed. "My daughter is the one suffering, not you. Don't speak as if you understand."

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "If I had been the one on that news broadcast, would my mother not grieve for me? Though she's no longer here to do so."

The words struck a nerve. Mrs. Santiago fell silent.

Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Listen to this."

The recording played—Penelope's voice, clear as day, plotting with Vivian Vanderbilt.

Mrs. Santiago paled.

"I knew about their scheme," Evelyn continued. "I gave your daughter a chance to back out. Instead, she hired men to carry it out. If I hadn't escaped, I would be the one destroyed today. So tell me—is your daughter truly innocent?"

Mrs. Santiago's throat tightened.

This was her child. Her flesh and blood. Of course she was devastated.

But the truth was undeniable.

"The Santiagos are known for their integrity," Evelyn pressed. "Your daughter wouldn't have done this if she hadn't been manipulated."

A calculated compliment. If Mrs. Santiago still blames me, she’s admitting she can’t see reason.

And if she loved her daughter as much as she claimed—what would she do when she realized Penelope had been used?

Mrs. Santiago's voice was barely a whisper. "Who... who manipulated her?"
###Chapter 120

"She's also a Vanderbilt. My half-sister, and the daughter of my stepmother."

Mrs. Santiago's gaze sharpened as she studied Evelyn. "What exactly do you hope to accomplish by coming here to see my daughter?"

"I'm offering Penelope a chance at redemption," Evelyn replied smoothly, crossing her legs. "That is, if she's willing to show genuine remorse. Given how viral this scandal has gone, I imagine it'll keep trending for weeks. The world believes your daughter willingly debased herself, but I suspect you'd prefer them to think she was framed. Am I correct?"

Mrs. Santiago's fingers tightened around her teacup.

'Penelope's name is being dragged through the mud. How will she ever show her face in society again if this continues?'

'Better the public believes she was victimized than see her as some wanton party girl. At least sympathy could salvage her reputation.'

'There's a world of difference between being drugged and choosing to disgrace oneself. The incident can't be erased, but preserving her dignity matters more than anything.'

Just then, Evelyn's phone buzzed with notifications from Twitter and Instagram. She swiped open the alerts, lips curving when she saw Vivian's latest posts. Right on schedule, Vivian had thrown Penelope under the bus.

Though the scandal hadn't touched Vivian yet, her rapid response clearly showed the Santiagos' pressure was getting to the Vanderbilts.

"Mrs. Santiago, you'll want to see this." Evelyn handed over her phone.

The color drained from Mrs. Santiago's face as she read Vivian's posts. "That shameless witch dares to blame my daughter again?!"

Vivian had amassed a considerable following from her recent design successes, and her comment section overflowed with supportive fans.

"Don't distress yourself," Evelyn said, retrieving her phone. "Just wait for the moment when she slaps her own face."

Mrs. Santiago gripped the armrests. "Miss Vanderbilt, if you can truly help Penelope, I'll be eternally grateful. She's... not well. Please."

Evelyn's smile remained cool. "I keep my promises. But your daughter must sincerely repent. If she crosses me again..." She let the threat hang.

Mrs. Santiago understood perfectly.

'She's offering help today but warning there won't be mercy next time.'

Her daughter had been caught red-handed in this scheme—an unbearable humiliation. What could she do but agree? "I'll make certain Penelope learns her lesson."

Meanwhile, Vivian's posts had exploded across social media—thousands of likes, hundreds of shares, comments piling up by the minute.

Just as public opinion reached its peak condemning Penelope, something unexpected happened.

Confession videos from the detained suspects went viral. Within hours, #PenelopeSantiagoFramed trended globally with millions of hits.

The suspects clearly stated on camera: "Ms. Vivian Vanderbilt hired us to drug and frame Ms. Santiago. None of us were in our right minds that night."

@DiamondDiva: "What a monster!"

@JusticeSeeker: "Ruining someone's life like this? Disgusting!"
###Chapter 121

#GraceGreen#: That's the new designer, isn't she? Never imagined she'd stoop so low.

Guess masterpieces don't reveal the artist's true colors. I'm officially boycotting Viana Jewelry now.

A digital mob swarmed Vivian's social media accounts, flooding her mentions with venomous comments and creating trending hashtags to shame her.

#ZacharyOnion#: No excuses left. The evidence is overwhelming - just delete your accounts already.

#ScarlettFox#: You dare call yourself a designer? You're an embarrassment to the craft!

#VeronicaStyles#: The irony! A "designer" who created Gothic-inspired pieces yet never studied under D. Rumor has it she produced those "masterpieces" after just one month of training. Suspicious much? Those works clearly aren't hers.

At the Vanderbilt estate...

The online assault left Vivian trembling, her phone burning like hot coal in her hands. She felt her sanity fraying at the edges.

Laura rushed to her daughter's side, snatching the device to scan the hateful comments. "How did this happen? Didn't you verify everything first?"

"That bitch Penelope actually turned her thugs against me!" Vivian gnawed at her thumbnail until it threatened to split. "Damn Evelyn Vanderbilt! She's the one who should be suffering this humiliation! Last night's spotlight was meant for her!"

'The Santiagos are pressuring the Vanderbilts now. I had to go public before Father suspected me. Now Penelope's flipped the script completely!'

'This is all Evelyn's fault. If she didn't have Nathan protecting her, would Penelope have targeted me instead?'

Laura's eyes gleamed with cold calculation. "If that little witch wants war, we'll play our ace."

Vivian blinked. "What ace?"

"Pin everything on Evelyn," Laura smirked. "Since she set you up to take the fall, let's return the favor tenfold."

"Remember how Ms. Santiago ended up in that lounge last night? Evelyn orchestrated everything. Once we expose her, Ms. Santiago will make her life hell."

'That scheming bitch thinks she can watch my daughter and Ms. Santiago destroy each other while she walks away unscathed? Not happening.'

Evening fell...

Nathan arrived on the sixteenth floor where only Evelyn's office light still glowed.

He found her slumped over her desk, pencil still clutched in limp fingers, half-finished sketches scattered beneath her cheek.

Gently removing the pencil, Nathan studied her peaceful expression.

'Only in sleep does she look this innocent.'

Scooping her up bridal-style, Evelyn instinctively nuzzled against his chest without waking.

"You really can sleep through anything," Nathan murmured, equal parts amused and exasperated.

Back at the Goldmann mansion...

Nathan carried Evelyn through the doorway where three wide-eyed children sat with Mr. Goldmann Sr. at dinner.

Caleb sprang up to follow, but the elder Goldmann caught his collar. "Where do you think you're going, young man?"

"To see Mommy and Daddy!" Caleb protested.

"You'd be a third wheel," Mr. Goldmann Sr. chuckled. "Your parents need alone time. How else will your father win her back?"

Daisy nodded sagely. "Mommy still hasn't forgiven Daddy yet."
###Chapter 122

Mr. Goldmann Sr. studied the three mischievous children before him. "Then why won't your mother accept your father?"

The triplets exchanged glances before launching into an animated explanation about their mother's past. As the story unfolded, the old man's expression darkened considerably.

"I never cared about Evelyn's background," he muttered. "Even when I learned she was a Vanderbilt from Bassburgh, our family would have welcomed her."

His grip tightened on his cane. "But that fool son of mine let himself be deceived by that stepsister of hers for six years! No wonder Zoe refuses to accept him now."

"Serves him right," he concluded with a huff.

"Grandpa," Caleb piped up, tugging at the elder's sleeve. "You do want Mommy and Daddy together, right?"

Mr. Goldmann Sr. snorted. "Naturally."

'My stubborn son has finally found a woman who makes him human. I'll be damned if I let this opportunity slip away. Those children might just be the key to fixing this mess.'

Meanwhile, Nathan carefully deposited Evelyn onto the plush bed. She murmured something unintelligible, rolling onto his arm with a contented sigh.

Nathan's jaw tightened. The warmth of her body against his skin sent electric currents through him, his dark eyes smoldering with restrained desire.

'This woman will be the death of me.'

He leaned in, lips hovering inches from hers when his phone shattered the moment.

Glancing at the still-sleeping Evelyn, he extracted himself and answered the call. "Report."

"We've uncovered information regarding your inquiry, Mr. Goldmann," came the crisp response.

Nathan stepped into the study, casting one last look at Evelyn's peaceful form. "What did you find?"

"The connection between Ms. Vanderbilt and Morwich remains unclear. However, we've discovered her mother had significant... connections."

Nathan's brows drew together. "Her mother?"

"Yes. After cross-referencing records, we believe Ms. Vanderbilt's mother was Miranda de Arma."

Documents flashed across Nathan's screen moments later - fingerprint comparisons showing an exact match between Richard Vanderbilt's deceased wife and the missing de Arma heiress.

Nathan's expression turned grave.

'The de Armas... This complicates things.'

The de Armas were Stoslo nobility - descendants of royal advisors granted dukedoms. Though they'd withdrawn from court politics after the eldest princess incident, their influence remained formidable.

Harrison de Arma currently headed the family. His eldest daughter Lillian was mistress of the Laurent household, while youngest daughter Miranda had vanished over two decades ago.

Nathan never imagined Evelyn's mother would be nobility.

Another email notification pinged. The attached photograph showed a young woman in a black trench coat disembarking from a cruise ship - unmistakably Miranda de Arma. But the blonde man shadowing her made Nathan's blood run cold.

'Edmund Lincoln...'

Later that night...

Evelyn awoke with a gasp.

'What the hell?!'

Nathan had her pinned in a vice-like embrace, his muscular arms rendering her immobile. She wriggled carefully, managing to create enough space to sit up.

The movement roused Nathan. In one fluid motion, he flipped her onto her back, looming over her with predatory intensity. "Awake?" His voice was rough with sleep.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Um... Could you... move?" Her body tensed, bracing for whatever might come next.
###Chapter 123

Evelyn's stomach growled loudly in the silent bedroom.

Nathan, who was hovering above her, suddenly smirked. "Finally hungry? I thought you'd sleep straight through till morning."

She squinted up at him. "Since you've noticed, get off me already."

He rolled away, ruffling her hair as he stood. "I'll make you a midnight snack."

Evelyn blinked in shock.

'Did I hear that right?'

Descending the stairs, she checked the clock - only 2:17 AM. She'd been so exhausted from the afternoon's events that she barely remembered getting home.

The sight in the kitchen stopped her in her tracks.

There stood Nathan Goldmann - billionaire CEO - in rumpled pajamas that softened his usual sharp edges. The domestic image was so surreal she almost pinched herself.

He placed a steaming bowl of ramen on the table, followed by a mug of warm milk.

Evelyn approached cautiously, examining the dish. The broth shimmered perfectly, topped with diced tomatoes, ham slices, two golden fried eggs, and a sprinkle of green onions.

'This can't be his first attempt.'

The noodles held their shape perfectly when she twirled them with her fork - al dente to perfection.

She glanced up to find him watching intently, chin resting on interlaced fingers. "Impressive skills, Mr. Goldmann."

'Honestly, I couldn't have made it look this perfect.'

His lips quirked. "Glad you approve." After she took the first bite, he leaned forward. "Well?"

"Not bad," she admitted between mouthfuls. "Who knew the hands that sign million-dollar contracts could also cook?"

"Speaking of hidden talents," his tone shifted, "shouldn't that be your specialty?"

Her fork froze mid-air. "Excuse me?"

Nathan propped his chin on one hand, studying her. "Your mother knew Edmund Lincoln years ago, didn't she?"

Evelyn's eyes darkened. "You've been investigating me?"

"When you refuse to talk, I find other ways." He shrugged.

"Nathan Goldmann, you utter snake!" She nearly choked on her rage.

'This bastard's been digging into my past without permission!'

He chuckled. "Snake? I'm just trying to understand the mother of my children."

She gripped her bowl, tempted to throw it at his smug face.

'The word 'audacity' was invented for men like him.'

"Tell me what you want to know," he offered, "and I'll share anything you're curious about."

"I'm not curious about you!" The words escaped too quickly. His expression darkened as he suddenly advanced.

"Wha- Ah! Hahaha stop!" He attacked her ribs with tickling fingers. Evelyn squirmed across the couch, but his arms trapped her effortlessly.
###Chapter 124

Nathan pulled Evelyn into his lap as he settled into the armchair. "Start talking," he commanded, his voice low but firm.

Exhausted from struggling, Evelyn finally surrendered to his relentless tactics.

'He's resorting to childish methods just to make me talk!'

Catching her breath, she gripped his wrist tightly, fearing another sudden tickle attack. "I've known Uncle Edmund for years, but I don't understand his connection to my mother."

'How would I know the very thing I'm trying to discover myself?'

Nathan studied her expression, finding no traces of deception this time. His stern lips finally relaxed. "You're unaware of his true identity?"

"His status doesn't matter to me. Uncle Edmund has been my greatest supporter after my mother." Though not related by blood, she considered him family—the only person who truly remembered her mother's existence.

Nathan's gaze lowered. Evelyn clearly knew nothing about Metropolis or her mother's de Arma lineage.

"I've told you everything. May I finish my ramen now?"

A faint smile touched Nathan's lips as he released her.

Evelyn waited until he stood before reclaiming her seat and resuming her meal.

"Get some rest after you eat," Nathan instructed before heading upstairs.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, a thought nagging at her. 'Has he discovered something?'

The next morning...

Entering Soul Jewelry's headquarters, Evelyn noticed employees huddled together, their whispers ceasing abruptly when they spotted her. One woman quickly pocketed her phone. "Ms. Zara—"

"Is something wrong?" Evelyn maintained her professional smile.

"Ms. Zara... it's about Ms. Santiago. Social media is exploding with posts blaming you," the employee admitted awkwardly.

Evelyn checked her phone, confirming Vivian had successfully redirected all blame onto her.

"Zoe." Gregory approached, scattering the gossiping staff back to their workstations.

"Uncle Gregory." She turned with practiced calm.

"Have you seen the trending posts?"

"Just did. Vivian's pinned everything on me." Her voice remained steady.

Gregory frowned deeply. "Vivian's backed into a corner and lashing out. While you promised Mrs. Santiago to help Penelope, releasing that recording now would destroy her credibility."

"Alternatively, we could abandon the Santiagos and end this immediately." He sighed, unable to comprehend why Evelyn insisted on helping them.

Evelyn's smile held strategic calculation. "Uncle Gregory, assisting the Santiagos serves our long-term interests. They're key players in jewelry—making enemies would be unwise."

"Moreover, if Laura recruits them as allies again, we'd face significant disadvantages."

Gregory paused, then chuckled self-deprecatingly. "My perspective was too narrow. I hadn't considered those angles."

'Building goodwill with the Santiagos ensures smoother future interactions. Antagonizing them would hinder Soul Jewelry's growth.'

"Not narrow-minded—just concerned. Don't worry, Vivian should have sought my permission before targeting me."

Returning to her office, Evelyn opened her laptop and logged into her social accounts. Vivian had masterfully manipulated public opinion, using the viral photo of Penelope pushing Evelyn as definitive "proof" of her narrative.
###Chapter 125

The world was convinced that Penelope's downfall marked the start of Evelyn's ruthless retaliation.

A smirk played on Evelyn's lips as she dialed Mrs. Santiago's number.

By 10 a.m., Mrs. Santiago had uploaded a video using Penelope's social media accounts.

In the footage, Penelope looked utterly broken—her eyes hollow, her face gaunt.

The vibrant, glamorous socialite from her Instagram and Twitter posts was unrecognizable.

This was her first public appearance since the scandal.

"I had a disagreement with Ms. Vanderbilt, but she wasn't the one who hurt me."

"That night, I was manipulated. I trusted the wrong people."

"I won't hide anymore. This is my apology to everyone."

#BiancaChase: The real victim just confirmed everything.

Wake up, haters.

Stop letting that designer fool you.

#SimonBlake: She looks devastated.

Honestly, a young girl's life is ruined, and she's still being mocked.

If she were my daughter, I'd hunt down whoever did this.

#VeronicaStyles: You idiots still defending that woman?

The evidence is right in your face.

At the Vanderbilt estate...

Richard slammed the tablet onto the table, glaring at Vivian.

"Look at what you've done!"

Laura, standing nearby, flinched. She stepped forward cautiously.

"Darling, calm down—"

"You—get out." He shoved her hand away.

"Look at the daughter you raised."

"The Santiagos... Do you think they're some small-time family you can mess with?"

Laura bit her lip, resentment simmering beneath her trembling facade.

'This is all Evelyn's fault.'

Vivian never expected Penelope to turn on her and side with Evelyn.

'She must have planned this.'

"What does this have to do with Vivian?" Laura blurted.

"Ms. Santiago chose to believe her. Vivian only shared a little information."

"Besides, Ms. Santiago was the one who wanted to hurt Evelyn. She just failed—"

Realizing her slip, Laura froze.

Richard's expression darkened.

Before she could backtrack, his palm struck her cheek with brutal force.

Laura crashed onto the sofa, stunned.

"So Evelyn was your target all along?"

Richard couldn't believe it.

Laura always played the perfect stepmother. Vivian acted the obedient daughter.

Yet here she was, admitting to scheming against his own flesh and blood.

"Darling, I didn't mean—"

Ignoring her, Richard turned to Vivian, whose face had gone pale.

"Did you frame Evelyn six years ago?"

"Dad, no! You have to believe me!"

Panic clawed at Vivian’s throat.

'I can't be cast out. I'll lose everything.'

"Richard!"

A sharp voice cut through the tension.

Madam Victoria descended the stairs, Lydia at her side.

"What is this commotion?"

"Mother, stay out of this."

"How can I?"

Madam Victoria’s gaze flickered to Laura, then to Vivian.

"This is the woman you insisted on marrying. The daughter you brought into this family."

"And now you're regretting them?"

Vivian rushed to her grandmother, eyes brimming with tears.

"Grandmother..."

Madam Victoria sighed, turning back to Richard.

"No matter what, Vivian is still a Vanderbilt. My granddaughter."

"This family still needs her."

"You already exiled one daughter. Will you throw out another?"
###Chapter 126

To Madam Victoria, benefits always came first.

The men would inherit the family business, and the women would marry into power and status to strengthen the family's influence.

That was why she would protect Vivian—because she had value.

Richard clenched his fists.

"Mother, isn't Evelyn your granddaughter too?"

"Evelyn?" Madam Victoria's temper flared.

"She's just like her mother—always an outsider in this family. Why should I rely on her?"

"Didn't you marry Isabella because of her capabilities? Your position in Bassburgh was secured because of her, but did she ever respect me? She was immoral, pining for another man while married to you. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

"Enough!" Richard's sudden outburst silenced the room.

Even Madam Victoria stared at him, shocked. Her son had never raised his voice at her before.

"You have no right to speak about Isabella like that."

With that, Richard stormed upstairs.

Laura, still clutching her stinging cheek, paled as she watched Richard defend Isabella even years after her death.

He hadn't let go.

That was why he wanted to revise his will.

He was clearly planning to leave Viana to Evelyn.

No. She wouldn't let that wretched girl take anything from her.

"Mother, we need to talk..."

Laura turned to Madam Victoria, knowing she would never agree to hand Viana over to Evelyn.

When Penelope's confession video went viral, public sympathy shifted dramatically.

From her crude behavior to being manipulated, and with testimonies from those involved, all evidence pointed to one culprit—Vivian.

Even Bassburgh Daily issued a statement supporting Penelope, indirectly condemning Vivian's actions and calling for her removal as a renowned jewelry designer.

The backlash was devastating for Viana.

Clients who had pre-ordered pieces demanded refunds to distance themselves from the scandal.

Vivian's rising fame had barely begun before she became the most despised figure in the city.

The Vanderbilts would not take this lightly.

"I didn’t expect Mrs. Santiago to convince Penelope to come forward. This might be the final nail in Vivian’s coffin."

Unless Vivian could produce proof.

Evelyn leaned back in her chair.

"Mrs. Santiago wants to clear her daughter’s name, and I have evidence of her collusion with Vivian. Of course, she’d choose to help me."

As for Vivian...

She probably never expected to be outmaneuvered.

If she was smart, she’d stay silent and wait for the storm to pass.

But if she retaliated against Penelope, she’d earn the Santiagos' wrath.

She had no proof.

The public would only see her as desperate.

However, Evelyn didn’t anticipate Vivian’s Twitter being suspended.

Clearly, Mrs. Santiago’s doing.

Then, her phone rang.

Laura.

Was this about Vivian?
###Chapter 127

Evelyn placed the phone on the desk and switched it to speaker mode.

Laura’s voice drifted through the air.

"Evelyn, your grandmother wants to see you..."

When the call ended, Gregory looked concerned.

"Do you think Madam Victoria has ulterior motives? Should I accompany you?"

Evelyn smiled faintly.

"No, Uncle Gregory. The studio has too much work right now. Madam Victoria and Laura won’t be a problem."

Evelyn arrived at Sunrise Restaurant.

It was strange. Instead of summoning her to the Vanderbilt manor, they had chosen this place.

What were they planning?

As she stepped inside, she saw Madam Victoria and Laura seated at a table.

"Grandmother, you wanted to see me?"

Madam Victoria’s expression darkened at Evelyn’s indifferent tone.

"I heard your father transferred ownership of Viana Jewelry to you."

Evelyn paused, surprised.

"I wasn’t aware of that. Doesn’t Viana belong to Vivian now?"

She glanced at Laura, who remained silent, her gaze complicated.

Was that… resentment?

Madam Victoria scoffed.

"Even though Viana was founded by your mother, it’s now under the Vanderbilt name. It belongs to us."

She leaned forward, her voice sharp.

"You’re just a woman. One day, you’ll marry, and Viana will no longer be your concern. I won’t allow your father to leave it to you in his will."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

What was she implying? Had her father really changed his will?

"Evelyn, I want you to relinquish your claim to Viana."

Madam Victoria’s tone was a command, not a request.

Evelyn’s expression turned icy.

"Grandmother, I respect you, but don’t forget—Viana belongs to my father. He decides its fate, not you."

Madam Victoria’s grip tightened on the table.

"I am the Vanderbilt matriarch!"

"That doesn’t give you the right."

Evelyn’s voice was firm, her refusal clear.

Madam Victoria slammed her palm down.

"You’ll only get Viana over my dead body!"

Laura stiffened. The old woman’s outburst revealed her true intentions.

She didn’t want Evelyn or Vivian to have Viana.

She wanted it for herself.

Laura had been using her to pressure Evelyn, but now she saw the trap.

Evelyn and Madam Victoria locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

"Are you threatening me with your death? Why would I care if you died?"

"You’re just like your mother!" Madam Victoria spat, her tone dripping with disdain.

Evelyn’s face darkened.

"Too bad she died too soon. She would’ve destroyed you."

"Evelyn! How dare you speak to me like that?"

Madam Victoria’s rage peaked. She nearly hurled a bowl across the table but stopped herself—this wasn’t home.
###Chapter 128

"I'll treat my elders exactly how they've treated me."

Evelyn's voice was icy, her gaze unwavering.

Madam Victoria had never once held her as a granddaughter—not since the day she was born.

All because she was a girl.

Back then, Evelyn had been too young to understand.

She had still gone home for Thanksgiving with her parents, oblivious to the disdain.

But she remembered.

She remembered how Madam Victoria had treated her mother, Isabella.

Isabella had always remained composed, never reacting to the old woman’s cruelty.

Perhaps that was why Madam Victoria thought Evelyn was just like her.

For years, Evelyn had believed her mother’s coldness toward the Vanderbilts was solely because of Richard’s betrayal with Laura.

"Zoe, how dare you speak to your grandmother like that?" Laura, ever the dutiful daughter-in-law, tried to smooth things over.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I’m just stating facts."

Her tone was sharp, unyielding. "I won’t give up Viana Jewelry. Not now, not ever."

She met Madam Victoria’s glare head-on. "Even if Dad hadn’t left it to me, I would have taken it back myself."

No one could stop her.

No one.

Madam Victoria’s face twisted in fury. "You insolent little—"

"Why wouldn’t I dare?" Evelyn cut her off, spinning on her heel and walking out before the old woman could finish.

The moment the door slammed behind her, the sound of shattering porcelain erupted from the dining room.

Laura’s frantic attempts to calm Madam Victoria were drowned out by the old woman’s rage.

Evelyn didn’t look back.

She strode through the restaurant, her heels clicking against the marble floor.

But then she stopped.

Her eyes locked onto a familiar car in the parking lot—a flashy Porsche in an obnoxiously bright shade of purple.

The license plate confirmed it.

Sophia’s car.

Sophia had a thing for eye-searing colors—red, neon green, and now this monstrosity.

Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed.

Sophia answered on the second ring.

"What’s up?" Her voice was hushed, almost nervous.

Evelyn smirked. "Are you at Sunrise?"

A pause. Then, a hesitant, "How did you know?"

"I saw your car." Evelyn leaned against the hood of her own vehicle. "Why are you whispering? On a date?"

"No, I—"

"Ms. Hill, we can reschedule if you’re busy." A man’s voice cut in, smooth and polite.

Sophia let out an awkward laugh. "No, no need. I’ll explain later."

The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn stared at her phone.

A man’s voice?

This girl.

Was William forcing her into another blind date?

Shaking her head, Evelyn turned and headed toward the elevator at Goldmann Group.

She wasn’t paying attention.

Her mind was still on Sophia’s strange behavior.

Which was why she didn’t see him until it was too late.

She collided with a solid chest.

Strong hands steadied her before she could stumble back.

Evelyn looked up—and immediately wished she hadn’t.

Nathan Goldmann.

Of course.

She stepped back, brushing off his touch.

His brow arched. "Are we strangers now?"

Evelyn gritted her teeth. "Mr. Goldmann, this is the main lobby."

She gestured to the bustling crowd around them. "People are watching."

And they were.

Nathan’s presence alone was enough to draw attention.

Now, standing this close to him in the middle of the elevator bank?

They might as well have been under a spotlight.

Nathan didn’t seem to care.

He blocked her path, his expression unreadable. "You’re avoiding me."

Evelyn scoffed. "I’m busy."

She tried to sidestep him, but he moved with her.

His voice dropped, low enough that only she could hear. "We need to talk."

Evelyn’s pulse jumped.

She forced herself to meet his gaze. "About what?"

Nathan’s lips curved, just slightly. "You know exactly what."
###Chapter 129

Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn.

"What's there to fear? The entire world knows you're mine." His declaration had been public - there was no way anyone remained unaware.

Evelyn brushed his hand away with an air of defiance. "A little respect, please?" The last thing she wanted was to be paraded around as 'Mr. Goldmann's property.'

Dark clouds gathered in Nathan's eyes.

It wasn't about public perception.

She simply refused to display affection where others could see.

Was she ashamed of him? Evelyn felt the weight of his possessive arm and saw the dangerous glint in his stare. Her pulse quickened.

This man might just kiss her right here to stake his claim. That would be disastrous.

Her demeanor shifted from proud to coy. "We're in public," she murmured demurely. "Could you let me maintain some dignity?"

Nathan stilled.

He'd mistaken her reluctance for rejection, when in truth she sought propriety.

A scoff escaped him.

"Fine. I'll indulge you." His grip loosened.

Oliver stood dumbfounded.

Since when did Mr. Goldmann yield so easily?

Evelyn exhaled.

As she turned to leave, a thought struck her.

"Wait," she pivoted back. "That investigation about my mother's connection to Edmund - did you uncover anything?" The question had haunted her since last night.

Edmund claimed it wasn't the right time for answers, but Evelyn needed to understand her mother's past.

If Nathan had been digging, he might have found something.

Seeing her desperate curiosity, Nathan's tight lips parted.

"Come to my office this afternoon."

When the appointed hour arrived, Evelyn stood outside Nathan's office door. A knock, permission granted, and she entered to find him lounging on the sofa, closing a file.

Those striking eyes lifted to meet hers.

That sculpted face - his perfect lips pressed into a severe line.

Evelyn averted her gaze.

The man was unfairly attractive.

Not just handsome, but a dangerous predator in a tailored suit.

Memories of what she'd witnessed made her cheeks burn.

Meeting his gaze again, Evelyn feigned a cough and approached with forced composure.

"Did you find anything?"

Nathan extended the file.

Evelyn took it and sat to examine the contents.

Isabella de Arma.

Her mother came from the de Armas? Why the name change?

Nathan studied her reaction. Clearly, she'd known nothing about her mother's origins.

"Meaning no one in the Vanderbilt family - including you - was aware." Had they known Richard's wife was Isabella de Arma, the Vanderbilts would have broadcast it to the heavens.

They worshipped nobility, after all.

"I... I didn't know," Evelyn admitted slowly. "But what significance does the surname hold?"

Nathan opened his laptop, displaying an image.

Evelyn gasped at the photograph.

There stood her youthful mother disembarking a yacht with Edmund, surrounded by black-clad guards.

"Uncle Edmund and Mom—" 'No! Were they involved?!'

Nathan moved beside her unexpectedly. "Look closer," he murmured.
###Chapter 130

Evelyn studied the photograph carefully, noticing how Edmund stood slightly behind her mother rather than beside her. The angle made it appear they were walking together, but the distance between them told a different story.

If they had been lovers, there would have been intimacy in their posture. Instead, Edmund's stance radiated deference, almost reverence.

What had her mother been to him?

The laptop snapped shut abruptly.

She turned to Nathan beside her, eyebrows raised. "That's all you found?"

Just this?

His arm rested casually along the back of the couch behind her as he leaned closer. "One kiss, and I'll tell you more."

"Forget it. I'll figure it out myself."

As Evelyn moved to stand, Nathan's arms encircled her waist, pulling her down onto his lap. The position made her pulse quicken.

"Nathan Goldmann, this may be your office but you can't just—" Her protest died as his grip tightened, holding her flush against his chest with no intention of releasing her.

Watching her cheeks flush with indignation, he arched an eyebrow. "Hmm? What exactly were you planning to do?"

"Let. Me. Go." She gritted her teeth.

His lips curved. "One kiss."

"You're impossible—"

"Then I'll kiss you instead."

Before she could react, his cool lips captured hers. One hand cradled the back of her head as if he meant to consume her whole. The hunger in his gaze burned through her defenses.

Evelyn's hands pressed against his chest, but the kiss unraveled her resistance. Breathless and overwhelmed, she stopped struggling, surrendering to the intoxicating pressure of his mouth.

When he finally released her, she gasped for air, her heart pounding like war drums in her chest. If this continued, she'd be devoured completely.

"Will you tell me now?" She hastily changed the subject.

Nathan traced the curve of her swollen lips with his thumb, his gaze darkening before he spoke. "Your mother came from Stoslo's nobility."

The revelation left Evelyn dazed as she returned to her office.

Stoslo nobility. Her mother had been someone of importance.

If true, the Gonzalez surname must have been a disguise to conceal her identity from the Vanderbilts. It made sense—had Grandmother Victoria known, she never would have treated Isabella so cruelly.

'But why did Mother leave Stoslo for Zlokova? Does Uncle Edmund know more?'

That evening found Evelyn at Edmund Lincoln's sprawling villa, its infinity pool glittering under moonlight. They played chess in the parlor while his security detail observed discreetly.

"Uncle Edmund, when will you tell me about my mother?" Evelyn studied his expression as she moved a pawn.

He paused mid-move with an amused smile. "Are you truly so eager to uncover your mother's past?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her captured knight. "Is there something I shouldn't know? Does it concern her status?"

Edmund lifted his gaze slowly. "Your mother only ever wanted you to live happily, free from burdens. She dreamed of an ordinary life."

The words struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

"Your mother," he continued, "was born into one of Stoslo's most influential families. They served directly in the royal court—inner circle confidants. But when the palace fractured during the succession crisis, her family withdrew from politics to protect their lineage."
###Chapter 131

"You're referring to the de Armas family, aren't you?"

Seeing Evelyn already knew, Edmund nodded without hesitation. "I planned to wait until you'd accomplished more in life before telling you about her."

"Zoe, even if you discover the truth about her someday, don't blame your mother. She adored you. Knowing the Vanderbilts would mistreat you after her passing was why I stepped in." Edmund walked Evelyn to the door.

After saying goodbye, Evelyn entered her car and drove off.

Nearby, Vivian Vanderbilt had been tailing Evelyn all day. Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel as she pulled out her phone the moment Evelyn exited the mysterious man's residence.

Scrolling through the photos, a malicious grin twisted her lips.

'Got you now, you little bitch!'

At Vanderbilt Manor...

Laura Scott emerged from the bathroom in a silk nightgown, only to find Richard already asleep. Resentment burned in her chest.

'He hasn't touched me since that night when Mother mentioned Isabella Gonzalez. But I won't give up.'

She slithered into bed, pressing against Richard. "Darling..."

Richard jerked awake, shoving her away. "Must you be so desperate at your age? I'll sleep in the study."

Watching him leave without a backward glance, Laura's face flushed with rage.

'How can a dead woman compete with me? If Richard truly loved Isabella, why did he choose me? Are all men such faithless creatures? Now that he's tired of me, he's reminiscing about his ex-wife?'

Days of this treatment had worn her patience thin. A vicious glint flashed in her eyes.

'Richard Vanderbilt, if you won't touch me, don't blame me for what comes next.'

Vivian stormed into Goldmann Group headquarters, marching straight to the 16th floor. Gregory's expression darkened at her approach. "Ms. Vanderbilt, what brings you here?"

"Can't I visit my dear sister?" Vivian crossed her arms defiantly.

Gregory chuckled coldly. "You're not welcome here. Leave."

"You're just Evelyn's lapdog! Who are you to order me around? Tell Evelyn to come out here!" Vivian's voice rose shrilly.

Evelyn stepped off the elevator just in time to hear the commotion. Her eyes turned glacial. "Shouldn't you be hiding in shame? Bold of you to cause a scene here."

Vivian's smirk turned predatory. She opened her mouth to speak, then spotted Nathan exiting another elevator.

Her face lit up. "Nathan!"

Nathan's gaze remained indifferent. "What are you doing here?"

His coldness stung. Biting her lip, Vivian blurted, "I came to show you the truth! Don't let Evelyn deceive you any longer!"

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, raising an eyebrow. "Oh? And what truth is that?"

Vivian pointed an accusing finger. "She spent an hour at some man's house last night! I have proof!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

'That was Uncle Edmund's place. She's been following me? And she actually came here to make a scene over this?'

Noticing Nathan's intense stare, Vivian pressed her advantage. Adopting a wounded expression, she sighed dramatically. "Nathan... I couldn't bear seeing her play with your feelings like this."

The air grew thick with tension as Evelyn met Nathan's unreadable gaze. Behind them, Gregory discreetly signaled security.
###Chapter 132

Vivian hadn't forgotten to add one last jab. "Don't let her lies fool you again!"

Fool him?

In her eyes, Nathan had clearly been ensnared by Evelyn. And Evelyn was nothing but a conniving seductress who had stolen his heart.

Evelyn crossed her arms, her expression cool and detached, as if Vivian's accusations had nothing to do with her.

Nathan tilted Evelyn's chin up, his lips quirking slightly. "Is it true?"

Evelyn remained silent.

But to everyone watching, Mr. Goldmann didn’t seem angry at all.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Yes, I was at that man’s place for an hour last night."

Vivian hadn’t expected her to admit it so easily. She seized the opportunity to fan the flames. "Nathan, you heard her! I wasn’t lying. She’s—"

"What did you do in that hour?" His voice was dangerously calm.

"Everything that needed to be done." Evelyn smirked.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Is she trying to get herself killed?

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Without warning, he scooped her up into his arms.

"Ah! What are you—Nathan Goldmann, put me down right now, you jerk!" Evelyn thrashed, her face burning.

He’s carrying me in front of everyone like some damsel!

Nathan ignored her protests and strode straight to her office.

Left behind, Vivian stood frozen, humiliation creeping up her neck.

Why isn’t he furious? He should be livid!

"It doesn’t look like Mr. Goldmann is angry at Ms. Vanderbilt at all," someone murmured.

"More like jealous, if you ask me. Someone’s little scheme backfired."

"Shut your mouths! You know nothing!" Vivian snapped.

The staff exchanged glances before dispersing, leaving her alone, trembling with rage.

Damn it! The Goldmanns can’t possibly accept a shameless woman like her after what’s been exposed!

Inside the office—

Nathan dropped Evelyn onto the desk. She swung at him, furious. "Have you lost your mind? You know where I was last night. If you actually believe her, then you should just—Mmph!"

He silenced her with a searing kiss, biting her lower lip. "Then why did you answer like that on purpose?"

He knew exactly where she’d been—Edmund Lincoln’s place. Vivian’s words meant nothing to him.

She just wanted to provoke me.

"Let me go!"

"No."

Evelyn tried to kick him, but he caught her leg, sending her off-balance. She fell back onto the desk, dragging him down with her.

Her breath hitched.

Her hair fanned out beneath her, messy and wild. Nathan’s gaze darkened, desire flaring in his eyes.

"Do you know what I want to do right now?" His voice was rough.

Evelyn shivered, suddenly aware of the heat between them. She pushed against his chest. "You promised you wouldn’t force me!"

"I changed my mind."

The hunger in his eyes was unmistakable—predatory, possessive.

Evelyn realized too late that she’d played with fire. She should never have provoked him.

"Zoe..." He dipped his head, capturing her lips again.

A shudder ran through her.

If this continues, I’m done for.

"N-Not here—Nathan, wait! I can... help you." The words tumbled out in a rush, her cheeks burning.

She wasn’t ready—couldn’t imagine crossing that line yet. But right now, she’d say anything to escape.

Nathan’s smirk was wicked. "Are you sure?"

Evelyn refused to meet his eyes, nodding stiffly.

Outside, no one could guess what was happening behind closed doors. But for Evelyn, every second was torture—shameful, electrifying, and utterly inescapable.
###Chapter 133

"How could I have fallen this low?"

Evelyn walked back to her office with forced composure.

"Thank goodness that jerk is gone."

"Zoe!" The moment Evelyn turned around, Sophia nearly tackled her in a crushing hug. "How could you not tell me you left Viana Jewelry?!"

Sophia froze for a split second before abruptly pulling away, sniffing the air around Evelyn. "Why do you smell like men's cologne?"

Evelyn's pulse jumped, but she kept her expression neutral. "Do I?"

"Yes!" Sophia leaned in again, wrinkling her nose. "It's one of those high-end Gi scents—and it's weirdly familiar. Wait, isn't this Nathan Goldmann's—"

Evelyn shoved her face away. "Are you a bloodhound? What are you doing here, anyway?"

"We haven't seen each other in ages, and you don’t even miss me? Ugh, you really are the type to ditch your best friend for a man." Sophia crossed her arms with a dramatic huff.

Evelyn sank into her chair. "Oh please, like you're not dating someone too."

"That doesn’t count! My dad forced me into that dinner. You know how he is—obsessed with marrying me off yesterday."

Sophia flopped onto the desk, batting her lashes. "Zoe, you have to help me."

"How?"

"I can’t go home right now. Speaking of—did you sell that beach villa yet? If not, can I hide out there for a while?" She clasped Evelyn’s hands, eyes pleading.

"You can stay. I never sold it."

Sophia nearly teared up. "Zoe, you’re a lifesaver. I love you!"

She planted an exaggerated kiss on Evelyn’s hand.

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Days later, a single photo ignited a firestorm online.

The hashtag #EdmundLincolnSeenWithMysteryWoman exploded across social media, with netizens tagging Edmund relentlessly.

Just as speculation peaked, Edmund himself tweeted:

@EdmundLincoln: What’s wrong with playing chess with my niece for an hour?

Evelyn burst out laughing and retweeted:

@EvelynVanderbilt: Uncle @EdmundLincoln, should we make it two hours next time?

@NathanGoldmann: ???

@MelonLover: @NathanGoldmann Sir, do you have questions?

@UnderTheLemonTree: Someone’s jealous.

@LilFishxoxoBigFish: Mr. Goldmann is sweating. So many questions, so little time!

@AdrianBoucher: @NathanGoldmann Since when do old-money CEOs lurk on Twitter?

The internet imploded.

A titan of entertainment clashing with a business mogul? Twitter’s servers barely survived the traffic.

Within an hour, their exchange topped Google Trends, racking up a billion clicks and burying Edmund and Evelyn’s scandal under an avalanche of memes.

Vivian had hoped to watch Evelyn get torn apart online. Instead, she nearly shattered her phone in frustration.

Most comments were chaotic—but weirdly supportive.

Laura sighed, rubbing her daughter’s back. "Vivi, don’t let this upset you."

"Mom, how does that witch keep slipping away? Nothing I do sticks!"

Laura frowned. "It is strange. She’s thrived since returning to Zlokova. Almost like someone’s pulling strings for her."

She couldn’t fathom how that nobody had become a celebrated designer abroad—and now waltzed back home with three brats in tow, untouched.
###Chapter 134

"Even Mr. Goldmann fell under her spell, while Vivian suffered terribly after multiple encounters with that witch!"

Laura Scott pondered deeply, sensing an invisible hand guiding Evelyn Vanderbilt's every move.

How else could the girl be so fearless?

"Mr. Goldmann himself has been deceived."

What shocked Laura more was Edmund Lincoln - a powerhouse in high society - publicly acknowledging Evelyn as his niece!

"Could Edmund be her secret benefactor? But he's in his forties, nearly my age. If Evelyn is his niece... then that woman, Isabella Gonzalez!"

Though Laura had never met Isabella, the rumors about her were legendary.

"Isabella helped Richard establish Viana Jewelry in Bassburgh. She must have been extraordinary."

Regrettably, Laura knew little about Isabella's true background.

"Isabella died young, right after Evelyn's seventh birthday. Had she lived, Vivian and I would never have entered the Vanderbilt mansion."

"I must uncover Isabella's secrets. If Evelyn truly has Edmund's backing, she'll become untouchable."

At the Royal Academy of Music...

Caleb Vanderbilt performed a piano duet of "Bohemian Rhapsody" with a classmate during the academy's ranking competition. The professors gasped as the young prodigy's fingers danced across the keys with astonishing precision.

His performance outshone even his older partner.

Unsurprisingly, Caleb received an S-grade, securing his place in the finals.

Backstage, several older boys cornered him. "Hey bastard, where's your daddy? Cheating your way through?"

Caleb's face darkened at the taunt.

"Who told you I don't have a father?"

The ringleader shoved him repeatedly. "Everyone knows! You're just a fatherless brat!"

Caleb clenched his small fists. Then, spotting someone approaching, he dramatically collapsed to the floor.

The bully's outstretched hand made it appear he'd been pushed.

"Scared, little bastard?" The boy sneered at Caleb's "cowardice."

"What's happening here?"

The bullies froze at the icy voice. Turning slowly, their faces paled.

Of all people, it had to be Professor Lucas Laurent - the academy's most feared instructor with a legendary temper!

"W-we were just..."

Lucas's sharp gaze flickered between Caleb on the floor and the trembling boys. "Bullying becomes you?"

The boys hung their heads. "Sorry, Professor Laurent."

Lucas helped Caleb up.

Everyone knew Lucas - the academy's prized violinist, son of Zlokova's most celebrated musician. Despite his youth, his reputation made students quake.

"Get out of my sight!" The bullies scattered instantly.

Only Caleb remained, calmly brushing off his pants.

Lucas studied him with amusement. "Quite the performance. Clever boy."
###Chapter 135

Caleb raised his head, his bright eyes locking onto the professor. "Then why did you still choose to help me?"

Lucas Laurent frowned, crossing his arms. "Who said I helped you? You're just a child. And you dare to speak to a professor like that?"

"I'm not just a child," Caleb shot back, his tiny fists clenching.

Lucas smirked, gesturing toward Caleb’s height. "You’re barely taller than my knee. What else would you call yourself?"

Caleb huffed. "I will grow taller!"

Lucas chuckled. "But right now, you’re still a tiny troublemaker."

His gaze lingered on the boy.

Sharp-witted. Fearless. And he aced the academy’s recent evaluation. Interesting.

But why does he look so familiar?

"I have piano practice now. Goodbye, Professor Laurent." Caleb propped his hands on his hips and marched off with all the dignity a five-year-old could muster.

Lucas watched him go, amused.

Whose child is this? He’s… intriguing.

After school, Liam and Daisy waited in the car while Angela drove them to pick up Caleb.

"Is the head of the Royal Academy of Music really that scary?" Daisy asked, swinging her legs. "Uncle Adrian says he yells a lot."

Caleb climbed in, buckling his seatbelt. "He’s not that bad. Just… blunt."

Liam leaned forward. "But the Laurent family isn’t one to mess with. His mother is a noblewoman from Stoslo."

Daisy gasped. "Like the princesses in fairy tales? With big dresses and carriages?"

Liam hesitated. "Uh… probably?"

Angela sighed, gripping the wheel.

Whenever these three got together, trouble followed.

At the Goldmann mansion, dinner was unusually tense.

With Mr. Goldmann Sr. away, only Nathan and Evelyn sat at the table with the kids. The air between them was thick with unspoken words.

Caleb glanced between them before piping up. "Mommy, did you and Daddy fight?"

Evelyn’s fork slipped, clattering against her plate. She shot Nathan a look.

Nathan, calmly deboning fish for Daisy, didn’t even glance up. "Why would I fight with your mother? I adore her too much."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Daisy blinked up at him. "Daddy, does that mean we’ll get a baby brother or sister soon?"

Nathan paused, tilting his head. "Do you want one?"

"Yes!"

"Absolutely not!" Evelyn stabbed her fork into her food. "Three of you are already a handful!"

Caleb pouted. "But Liam always gets to take care of Daisy. I want a sister too!"

Evelyn nearly choked.

Nathan smirked, leaning back. "We can have as many as you want, darling. Money isn’t an issue."

Evelyn set her napkin down with a sharp smile. "I’ll consider it when you’re the one carrying them."

With that, she stood and strode upstairs.

Caleb whispered, "Is Mommy mad?"

Nathan ruffled his hair. "She’ll be fine. Eat your dinner." His lips curved. "I’ll handle her later."

Evelyn exhaled as she reached the bedroom.

Those little traitors.

And if Nathan thought she’d cave so easily, he had another thing coming.
###Chapter 136

"Why would I ever want more children with a man like him? Absolutely not!"

Evelyn muttered under her breath as she folded her clothes, determined to sleep in Daisy's room tonight.

She didn't notice Nathan leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, watching her with narrowed eyes.

He wasn’t offended by her grumbling—after all, she wasn’t wrong. He did want her in his bed.

When Evelyn turned around, arms full of clothes, she froze mid-step.

Damn it. She’d been careless.

"Finished insulting me?" Nathan’s gaze locked onto hers. She was always so fiery when she was annoyed—adorably so.

Evelyn said nothing, simply walking past him with her chin raised. "I’m sleeping with Daisy tonight."

Nathan didn’t stop her, only shaking his head with a faint smile as she disappeared down the hall.

Evelyn had expected him to follow, to argue—but he didn’t.

She thought she’d finally get a peaceful night’s sleep.

She was wrong.

By midnight, she was wide awake, Daisy’s tiny limbs sprawled across her face.

Evelyn sat up, hair a mess, staring at the little girl’s foot resting on her ribs.

How does someone so small take up the entire bed?

She adjusted Daisy back into a normal position and lay down again—only for the child to kick her in the stomach moments later.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, rubbing her forehead before giving up and slipping out of the room.

She tiptoed back to Nathan’s bedroom, sliding onto the very edge of the mattress.

At least he didn’t move.

The next morning, Evelyn descended the stairs, dressed and ready for the day.

Nathan and the kids were already at the breakfast table.

She avoided eye contact. She hadn’t expected him to be up this early.

"Mommy, did you sneak back to Daddy’s room last night?" Daisy pouted. "You promised to sleep with me!"

Evelyn stayed silent.

Nathan smirked. "Your mother must prefer familiar beds."

Caleb nodded sagely. "Oh, so she only likes your bed, Daddy. Got it."

Evelyn wished the floor would swallow her whole.

Meanwhile, Laura had discreetly looked into Isabella’s past but found nothing useful.

Richard had been sleeping in his study for three nights now, and Laura didn’t care—as long as she got pregnant before he changed his mind.

When he walked past her without a word that morning, she didn’t bother asking where he was going.

Vivian came downstairs, scowling. "What’s Dad’s problem? Why is he ignoring us?"

"Who knows?" Laura frowned. Ever since Isabella’s name came up, Richard had been different. He’d never reacted this strongly before.

"Mom, I saw Dad cleaning out the study this morning. He spent hours going through old stuff."

Laura’s instincts flared. "Cleaning?"

Was that old fool hiding something from her?

"Yeah. Looked like really old things. I didn’t recognize any of it." Vivian wouldn’t dare ask—not after the way he’d hit Laura and questioned Evelyn.
###Chapter 137

Laura used to get whatever she wanted with just a tantrum. But now, Richard wouldn't even glance her way.

All because of Evelyn!

She remained silent, but her mind churned with dark thoughts.

After Vivian finished breakfast, Laura slipped into Richard's study.

She needed to discover what that old fool had been hiding.

What she uncovered left her breathless. Every item belonged to Isabella!

Laura's vision blurred with angry tears. All these days locked away, he'd been organizing a dead woman's belongings!

That wretched man still pined for his deceased wife!

Scanning the collection, Laura noticed something peculiar - not a single photograph of Isabella. Just worthless trinkets she couldn't fathom why he'd kept.

Then her fingers brushed against a red wooden box buried beneath the clutter.

The delicate vintage bracelet inside caught the light - blue agate stones set in gold filigree.

Cheap costume jewelry, really.

"Mother? What's caught your attention?"

Vivian's sudden appearance made Laura jump. She hastily set the bracelet aside. "Your father's shrine to Isabella."

Vivian's gaze immediately locked onto the glittering bracelet.

"That's exquisite." She reached to try it on.

Laura grabbed her wrist. "Don't! That's bad luck!"

"It's just jewelry, Mother." Vivian slipped it onto her slender wrist anyway.

Laura relented. If the girl wanted some dead woman's bauble, let her keep it.

Meanwhile, at Vanderbilt Tower's sixteenth floor...

"Viana Jewelry has slashed prices," Gregory reported. "The Santiago Group's pressure must be crushing them."

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

Viana was clearly desperate. The Vanderbilts couldn't possibly cover such massive losses.

Soul Studio's launch approached in seven days. Evelyn had planned to use Vivian's designs as bait before delivering the final blow, but Penelope Santiago's interference ruined everything.

Still, she'd honor her commitment to Madam Nora's auction.

The door swung open unexpectedly. Richard stood there, and Evelyn's expression darkened.

She hadn't seen him since his accusatory visit.

"To what do I owe this visit, Father?"

The formal address created palpable distance.

Richard recalled Laura's confession about framing Evelyn. Days of reflection brought him here.

"Let's talk."

Evelyn froze. No interrogation? Just conversation?

Gregory discreetly exited. As silence stretched, Richard sighed deeply. "You wanted to know about your mother's past, didn't you?"
###Chapter 138

Evelyn paused, her gaze dropping to the floor.

"Why tell me this now?"

Richard had always avoided speaking about her mother, and Evelyn had assumed he'd erased all memory of Isabella. Every time she saw Vivian and Laura together, a sharp pang of loneliness pierced her chest.

Richard noticed the sorrow in her eyes, and his own heart grew heavy. "I stayed silent because I couldn't bear to revisit it."

"Did you truly despise her that much?"

She had given him a daughter—was that still not enough to earn his affection?

Richard clenched his jaw. "You don’t know what happened between us, yet you assume I hated her?"

Evelyn turned away, silent.

"Zoe, you probably never knew—when your mother married me, she came to me first. It wasn’t love that brought us together."

Not love?

Evelyn stiffened in shock.

Richard’s expression darkened with old pain. "I was young, ambitious, desperate to make a name for myself in Bassburgh after leaving Cornelia. But every door was slammed in my face—until I met Isabella."

His voice grew distant. "She shocked me with her proposal. She said we should marry, and in exchange, she’d help me build an empire in Bassburgh. All she wanted was a place to belong."

At the time, Richard had thought it a joke. They’d only known each other a few days. But the woman before him was elegant, brilliant—irresistible.

He needed stability. A foothold in Bassburgh. So he agreed—on one condition. Their marriage would be a contract. No interference in each other’s lives. If he found love elsewhere, they’d divorce without hesitation.

They signed the papers. No ceremony. No celebration. Just a legal transaction that bound them in name only.

Yet Isabella was extraordinary. Within two years, she built Viana Jewelry from nothing, every piece crafted by her own hands.

Day after day, they worked side by side. Her brilliance matched her beauty. Against his will, Richard fell for her. He longed for more than their hollow arrangement.

He exhaled sharply, bitterness coating his words. "But your mother never loved me. I still don’t know why she chose me—only that her heart belonged to someone else."

Evelyn’s face paled.

The truth was a blade twisting in her chest.

"She was always distant. No matter how I tried to cross that line, she refused me. I would have given her everything—if only she’d let me."

His voice cracked. "So I turned to Laura, hoping to provoke a reaction. I told Isabella, praying she’d finally fight for me."

A hollow laugh escaped him. "She didn’t. She just... let me go."

For a moment, silence stretched between them. Then Richard whispered, "Two years later, she agreed to have you. Those were the happiest days of my life."

Because for a fleeting moment, he’d believed she might love him. That their family could be real.

But even then, he’d known—her heart was never truly his.
###Chapter 139

Richard had spent two agonizing years hoping Isabella would eventually return his love, but beyond gifting him a daughter, she never showed him any affection.

As Evelyn grew older and Isabella's health declined, the painful truth dawned on him - she'd only conceived a child knowing her time was limited.

This was her twisted way of making amends. She'd deceived him completely, making him fall desperately in love, only to resent her even in death.

She took her secrets to the grave.

With each passing year, Evelyn's resemblance to Isabella intensified, reopening Richard's wounds.

Though Richard had brought Laura and Vivian into their home, showering attention on Vivian, he still cared for Evelyn. He simply couldn't bear the constant reminder of Isabella.

Evelyn sat slumped on the sofa, face buried in trembling hands, her complexion ghostly pale.

All these years, she'd believed her father had destroyed their family through infidelity. Her mother's kindness had only deepened the mystery of her unhappiness.

She'd assumed her mother's illness and eventual death stemmed from heartbreak over her father's betrayal.

But why? Why would two people without love create a family together?

She'd never truly belonged to a happy family. Without Laura and Vivian's intrusion, without Isabella's untimely death, she might have known parental love.

Why did everything shatter?

"Zoe, whatever you learn about the past, don't resent your mother. She adored you." Edmund's words echoed, but Evelyn spiraled into darkness. The perfect family she'd imagined was nothing but illusion.

Meanwhile, Sophia treated Liam and Daisy to dinner at an exclusive Michelin-starred restaurant, wanting to celebrate their rising fame before their schedules became overwhelming.

"Keep your heads down," Sophia fretted, eyes darting around the dining room. "You're public figures now."

The children wore oversized sunglasses obscuring half their faces.

"Relax, we're just having dinner," Daisy chirped, happily devouring her meal.

Liam sipped his juice quietly, then froze as a familiar figure approached their table.

His expression darkened instantly.

Vivian had arrived at the restaurant in poor spirits, which plummeted further when she spotted the two children.

Those distinctive sunglasses couldn't hide their identities - the very brats responsible for her expulsion from the Goldmann estate.

Finally, her chance for revenge had come.

"Such riffraff shouldn't be allowed in fine establishments," Vivian sneered.

Sophia's head snapped up at the venomous voice.

Recognizing Vivian, she rose with a mocking smile. "If it isn't the Vanderbilt family's disappointing spare."

Vivian's face contorted with rage. "Who are you calling a spare?"

"Whoever answered the question," Sophia shrugged, feigning innocence.
###Chapter 140

Daisy giggled uncontrollably.

"You little troublemaker! What's so funny?" Vivian's face twisted in anger as she heard her daughter's laughter.

She hadn't even begun her confrontation yet.

Sophia stepped protectively in front of Vivian. "What exactly are you trying to accomplish here, Vivian? This is a public establishment. If you want to cause a scene, take it outside - don't disturb these paying customers."

A businessman wearing noise-canceling headphones at a nearby table frowned as the commotion interrupted his lunch.

This wasn't his problem, and he had no intention of getting involved.

Other diners shot disapproving glances their way, clearly annoyed by the disturbance.

A waiter attempted to intervene but was immediately shouted down by Vivian. No one could have predicted what happened next - Vivian suddenly hurled a full cup of piping hot coffee directly at Sophia.

The entire restaurant gasped in shock.

"Godmother!" Liam sprang to his feet, removing his sunglasses before throwing his glass of ice water at Vivian.

The cold water caused Vivian's heavy makeup to streak down her face. "You wretched little brats! How dare you-"

Vivian raised her hand to strike Liam, but just as Sophia moved to block her, another figure intercepted and caught Vivian's wrist mid-swing.

The businessman removed his headphones, his handsome face dark with irritation. "Have you lost your mind? What kind of adult picks fights with children?"

Vivian froze. Only now did she notice the disapproving murmurs from surrounding tables. She bit her lip hard, realizing she'd let her temper override her judgment in public.

Liam studied the stranger curiously. The man's gaze shifted between Liam and Sophia, who was now blotting coffee stains from her blouse with napkins. "Shouldn't this boy be in school right now? What kind of mother lets her child skip classes?"

Liam's brow furrowed.

Skip school? Was this man confusing him with Caleb? Did he think Liam was his brother?

Sophia paused her cleanup to look up at Lucas Laurent. The man's dreamy, hooded eyes were breathtakingly attractive - pale complexion perfectly complementing his sharp nose and full lips. He looked like he'd stepped right out of a romance novel cover.

"Are you... talking to me?" Sophia pointed at herself uncertainly.

Lucas gave her an unimpressed look. "Are you hard of hearing? Who else would I be addressing?"

Sophia's hand stilled. First coffee thrown at her, now being called deaf?

"You're the one who needs help," she snapped back.

Daisy tugged at Sophia's sleeve. "Don't be mad. Let's just go home - I don't want to eat here anymore."

"Come on," Liam took Daisy's hand, shooting Vivian a warning glare as they headed for the exit. "This isn't over."

An involuntary shiver ran down Vivian's spine.

That look... it was identical to Nathan's infamous icy glare when angered. The resemblance terrified her.

Lucas remained rooted in place, watching Liam's retreating figure with confusion.

What was wrong with that child? Didn't he recognize him?

Not only did the boy show no recognition, but his entire demeanor differed completely from the student he knew from school.

"Mr. Laurent, your takeout is ready." The waiter presented a neatly packed meal. Lucas accepted it and turned to leave when Vivian suddenly addressed him.

"Are you... Mr. Laurent?"

Could it really be him?

Everyone in Bassburgh knew of Lucas Laurent - the musical prodigy. The Laurent family ranked among the wealthiest dynasties in the city!
###Chapter 141

The sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone path as Lucas Laurent's gaze hardened.

Vivian Vanderbilt clutched her wrist, the delicate silver bracelet glinting under the afternoon light.

His fingers wrapped around her arm with sudden urgency. "Where did you get this?"

Her pulse spiked.

Why is he asking about this?

"Answer me!" His voice was sharp, cutting through the quiet of the garden.

Vivian swallowed. "It—it was a gift from my mother."

Lucas's eyes darkened. "Is your mother Miranda de Arma?"

Her breath hitched.

Miranda? His aunt? That means Evelyn is—

Her stomach twisted.

"Do you know her?" she asked carefully.

A cold laugh escaped him. "So my aunt's daughter is you?"

The realization struck like lightning.

Miranda was nobility. Which makes Evelyn—

Her face drained of color.

That wretched girl is a noblewoman?!

"Your name," he demanded.

"V-Vivian."

"Give me your number."

He typed it into his phone without another word and strode away, leaving her frozen in place.

If not for that bracelet—identical to the one his mother, Lillian de Arma, wore—he would never have believed this woman was his cousin.

Her?

Disgusting.

Vivian stumbled back into the Vanderbilt manor, her mind racing.

Laura Scott rushed to her side. "Vivian! What's wrong?"

"Mother—" Her voice trembled. "Evelyn's mother was a de Arma."

Laura's face paled. "What?"

Vivian clutched her arm, recounting the encounter. Laura's grip tightened around the bracelet.

Lucas thinks Vivian is Miranda's daughter because of this.

Damn it. That means Evelyn is nobility—connected to the royal family of Stoslo!

The Lucas family had risen to prominence through Lillian's marriage.

And now, Evelyn—that bastard—was one of them.

"What do we do?" Vivian whispered.

Laura's eyes gleamed with ruthless calculation. "Your father can never know. Neither can your grandmother."

She leaned closer. "And Evelyn must never find out."

Vivian's breath caught.

A slow, cruel smile curved Laura's lips.

"If Lucas believes you're Miranda's daughter..."

Her fingers dug into Vivian's shoulders.

"Then we take Evelyn's identity for ourselves."

Vivian's heart pounded.

Steal Evelyn's birthright?

The thought sent a thrill through her.

And for the first time, she and her mother were thinking the same thing.
###Chapter 142

"This bracelet belonged to Evelyn's mother, but how could I have known her mother was nobility?" Laura's fingers trembled around the delicate jewelry. "If I return it to Evelyn, wouldn't that give them the perfect chance to recognize her?"

The thought made her blood run cold. 'I can't let that wretched girl reclaim her noble birthright. Not when she could use it to crush us beneath her designer heels.'

Vivian bit her lip. "But what about Dad—"

Laura cut her off with a sharp gesture. "Your father likely knows nothing about this. Keep it from him and your grandmother." Her eyes gleamed with sudden inspiration. "Vivian, take this bracelet to Madam Nora. We'll fabricate your past until you can infiltrate the de Armas family."

She gripped her daughter's shoulders. "When you replace that bitch as the heiress, everything we've ever wanted will be ours!"

Laura knew poverty intimately. Before Richard rescued her from that crumbling tenement, she'd survived on scraps and stolen dignity. She'd be damned before letting Vivian endure such humiliation.

The Vanderbilts' wealth provided safety, but nobility? That was true power. Once Vivian secured her position among the elite, Laura would reap the benefits as her mother.

'Richard and the old hag won't suspect a thing,' she thought viciously. 'And how many winters does that fossil have left? When she dies, everything will belong to my son—if I can finally give Richard one.'

She pictured the future with grim satisfaction. 'Vivian as a noblewoman securing her brother's inheritance. That's when I'll finally have won.'

Vivian's nails dug into her palms. 'Evelyn always had everything—looks, talent, that damned Vanderbilt name. If not for her return to Cornelia with those bastard children, I'd already be Mrs. Goldmann!'

Her lips curled into a sneer. 'Since she stole Nathan from me, I'll take her birthright. Fair's fair.'

Meanwhile, Lucas Laurent returned to the academy, drawn by unanswered questions. Through the classroom door, he observed Caleb Vanderbilt playing piano for his music class. The boy's fingers danced across the keys with effortless grace.

Lucas studied him intently. At first glance, the child resembled the fierce-eyed boy from the Michelin restaurant. But closer inspection revealed striking differences.

'The restaurant boy had wolf's eyes—cold and calculating. This one?' He watched Caleb flash a dimpled smile at a classmate. 'This one moves like a fox playing harmless.'

"Professor Laurent?" The music teacher approached in surprise.

The interruption made several students falter mid-song. Caleb's hands stilled on the piano keys, his bright gaze swinging toward the doorway.

Lucas offered a dismissive wave. "Just observing. Carry on."

After class, Caleb appeared at Lucas's office, peering around the doorframe like a curious kitten. "You wanted to see me, Professor?"

"Stop lurking." Lucas set down his coffee mug. "Come in."

The boy sauntered in with deceptive nonchalance. "What's this about?"

Lucas pulled out a chair, studying the child who now sat swinging his legs. "Do you have any identical siblings?"

Caleb blinked owlishly. "Just an older brother and little sister."

'I see.' Lucas leaned back. The pieces clicked into place—two boys with matching faces but opposing natures. One all sharp edges, the other polished charm.

Caleb tilted his head. "Why do you ask?"

'Why indeed?' Lucas rubbed his temple. The resemblance was uncanny, yet the differences... "No reason. You may go."

As the door clicked shut, Lucas stared at the piano music still open on his desk. Some mysteries, it seemed, refused to be solved so easily.
###Chapter 143

Caleb responded, "Oh, okay."

He then dashed out of the room like a whirlwind.

Nathan picked up the documents on his desk and skimmed through them.

Caleb... This boy's last name is Vanderbilt too?

Nathan had heard that Richard had come to see Evelyn. No one knew what he had said to her, but it was clear that Evelyn had been withdrawn ever since, holed up in her office.

Did Richard come to stir up trouble again?

Without hesitation, Nathan headed straight to the 16th floor.

He pushed open her office door and found her curled up on the couch, her expression unusually somber.

She didn’t even react when she saw him.

The woman who usually lashed out like a feisty kitten sat there quietly, looking like a lost, abandoned stray. It unsettled him.

Nathan approached her, gazing down for a moment before reaching out to ruffle her hair gently.

Her eyes flickered up to meet his before she turned her face away. "Don’t look at me like that... I don’t need your pity."

His gaze made her feel like some helpless creature.

Nathan sat beside her. "Did he scold you again?"

"No."

"Then why did he come?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

When she didn’t answer, Nathan wrapped an arm around her shoulders and guided her head onto his lap.

Evelyn stiffened. "What are you doing?"

"Sleep. A nap will make everything better." His voice was low, soothing, almost hypnotic.

His hand rested lightly on her shoulder, nothing more. He was simply offering his lap as a pillow.

Slowly, the tension in Evelyn’s body eased, her eyelids growing heavy.

After a long pause, she murmured, "Nathan... Are you only with me because of the kids?"

Nathan glanced down at her. "Why would you ask that?"

Evelyn sighed. "If we’re together just for them, isn’t that unfair? A marriage built on obligation instead of love... They’ll sense it, won’t they?"

"It’s not just because of them," Nathan replied smoothly.

When she turned to look at him, he was already watching her. "Do you really have so little faith in yourself?"

She froze.

Is it me I doubt? Or marriage itself?

"Or is it me you don’t trust?" His tone was calm, but the question struck her like a slap.

The confusion left by her father’s earlier words still clouded her mind. She didn’t know what to believe anymore.

Nathan studied the woman resting on his lap and smiled faintly. "Seems I still have a long way to go before making you my official wife."

Evelyn bolted upright. "How can you be so shameless?"

He pulled her into his arms, chuckling. "Because I want you more than I care about dignity."

Her cheeks burned, and she shoved him away. "Go to hell! Don’t you dare get any twisted ideas. Let me go—!"

Seeing her fiery spirit return, Nathan merely smirked, saying nothing.

Twisted ideas? All I want is to marry her properly. Is that so wrong?

If Evelyn knew his thoughts, she’d probably throw a shoe at him. But before she could, a knock interrupted them.

She wriggled free, shooting him a glare before stomping to the door.

Oliver stood outside, scanning the office. "Is Mr. Goldmann here?"

Nathan rose, his expression cooling as he stepped behind Evelyn, his gaze icy on the intruder.
###Chapter 144

This idiot always knows how to kill the mood.

Nathan didn’t even flinch at the murderous glare Oliver was giving him. "Mr. Goldmann," Oliver reported stiffly, "your father has requested an urgent video call. He says it’s important."

Nathan strode back to his office, where the screen flickered to life, revealing his father’s stern face. The elder Goldmann had clearly been waiting. The moment Nathan settled into his chair, the question came sharp and direct.

"Evelyn’s mother was a de Arma?"

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable. "Did Harrison tell you that?"

I only tasked Harrison with this investigation. Not even Oliver knows.

His father’s face darkened. "Your grandfather is returning to Zlokova in mid-June."

Nathan’s fingers stilled. "Grandfather is coming back?"

A scoff. "Did you really think he wouldn’t, after hearing about his great-grandchildren? You can’t hide this from him forever."

Nathan said nothing.

His great-grandfather’s bitter history with the Stoslo royal family had left deep scars—scars that bled into the Goldmanns’ relationship with the de Armas. His father might be indifferent, but his grandfather? Theodore Goldmann carried the old grudges like armor.

That was why Nathan hadn’t breathed a word about Evelyn’s lineage.

His father exhaled, rubbing his temple. "I’ll keep the de Arma connection quiet for now. But when your grandfather arrives next month, we’ll have to address it."

For all his faults, he’s still my father.

And after thirty years of watching me alone, he’s not about to let me scare off the mother of his grandchildren.

Nathan’s lips curved faintly. "Understood."

Oliver hovered nervously. "Mr. Goldmann… is the elder master truly coming back in June?"

"Most likely." Nathan leaned back, massaging his temples.

Compared to his father, Theodore Goldmann was a force of nature—stubborn, sharp-tongued, and impossible to please. The old man’s disdain for Stoslo’s nobility ran deep, his temper even worse than his son’s.

At this point, I’ll have to rely on the three little troublemakers to soften him up.

That same evening, Vivian Vanderbilt stepped into the private room of the Tipsy-Turvy Bistro, her dress immaculate, her smile practiced.

The moment the door closed behind her, she froze.

Lucas Laurent stood near the window, flanked by stone-faced bodyguards. But it was the woman seated at the head of the table who stole Vivian’s breath.

Lillian de Arma.

Elegant. Regal. A vision in an evening gown, her dark curls cascading over her shoulders. Her face, untouched by time, could have belonged to a woman in her twenties.

Vivian’s pulse quickened.

This is what true nobility looks like.

Lillian set down her coffee cup, the delicate clink echoing in the silence. She dabbed her lips with a napkin, then lifted her gaze. "Show me the bracelet."

Vivian snapped back to reality. With practiced grace, she slid the bracelet from her wrist and offered it.

Lillian examined the intricate gold pattern, her fingers tracing the design. A perfect match to the one she wore.

These bracelets had been a gift—one for her, the other for her sister.

"Where has your mother been all these years?" Lillian’s voice was cool, direct.

Vivian bit her lip. "She… passed away."

A beat. Then, quickly: "But she left behind a jewelry company. Viana Jewelry."

Lillian’s brow arched. "A jewelry company?"

"Yes." Vivian feigned sorrow, lowering her eyes. "But I… I lack the skill to lead it properly."

Lillian’s fingers tightened around the bracelet. Though she rarely left the estate, she kept abreast of the world’s whispers.

And Viana Jewelry was a name she knew.
###Chapter 145

The sun cast long shadows across the polished mahogany table as Lillian de Arma set down her coffee cup with deliberate precision. Her sharp gaze never left Vivian Vanderbilt’s face.

"Viana Jewelry was the talk of the town not long ago," Lillian remarked, her tone deceptively light. "And you, young lady, were at the center of the scandal that framed Penelope Santiago."

Vivian’s fingers twitched imperceptibly. "That wasn’t my doing," she insisted, her voice laced with feigned distress. "I was framed. I don’t even know Ms. Santiago—why would I target her?"

Lillian’s lips curved slightly. "How curious. You and your mother, Miranda, are nothing alike."

The words struck Vivian like a physical blow. Her pulse spiked.

Is she onto me?

A thin sheen of sweat formed on her brow, though she kept her expression carefully composed. "My mother passed away when I was young. I was raised by a nanny."

"Really?" Lillian’s gaze was unrelenting.

She’s too cautious, too calculated. Miranda was bold, reckless. They couldn’t be more different.

Miranda vanished decades ago without a trace. If not for that bracelet… I wouldn’t have dared to assume…

"Since you’re Miranda’s daughter," Lillian finally said, her tone softening, "you may call me Aunt Lillian. Lucas is your cousin. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything."

Vivian dipped her head, masking the triumph in her eyes. "Understood, Aunt Lillian."

Before this meeting, her mother’s warning had echoed in her mind: Evelyn must never get her hands on Viana Jewelry.

But now, with Viana’s stock inexplicably surging by 60% overnight, the game had changed.

I don’t care about Viana. But if that bitch wants it, I’ll make sure she never gets it.

The next morning, Gregory Fannon sat across from Evelyn Vanderbilt in the conference room, his expression grim. The screen displayed Viana Jewelry’s financial rebound—an impossible recovery.

"Where did they get the capital to cover this?" Evelyn murmured, her fingers steepled under her chin.

Gregory shook his head. "No idea. This isn’t just covering losses—it’s a full revival. There’s no way Richard could’ve pulled this off."

Evelyn’s lips curled. "The Vanderbilts don’t have that kind of money. Not even close."

So who’s backing them? Vivian? Laura? Where would they get fifteen million?

Gregory’s eyes narrowed. "Someone’s pulling strings behind the scenes."

Evelyn exhaled slowly, a spark of amusement in her gaze. "Things just got interesting."

Gregory frowned. "Zoe—"

She cut him off with a smirk. "Time to call Frederick again."

Let’s see who’s hiding in the shadows.

Meanwhile, Madam Victoria Vanderbilt beamed at Vivian as if she were the family’s newfound savior.

"Vivian, darling! To think you had such influential connections! Fifteen million—was it Mr. Goldmann who helped you?"

Vivian smiled demurely, offering no clear answer.

I can’t tell her the money came from the Laurents. If she ever visits them, the truth will unravel.

Madam Victoria’s admiration was palpable. After all, Vivian had single-handedly salvaged Viana Jewelry.

And that was all that mattered.
###Chapter 146

"Grandmother, you can finally relax now that Viana is thriving again."

"How could I not? Viana is in your capable hands now." Madam Victoria beamed as she clasped Vivian's fingers.

Laura seized the moment to add, "Indeed. Vivian has become our family's lucky charm. Once she establishes her reputation, you'll be able to retire in comfort."

Madam Victoria basked in the praise. What grandmother wouldn't wish for her family's success and her own peaceful retirement?

The business had been struggling, forcing her to pin hopes on her grandson - only to face disappointment. Hadn't she come to Bassburgh solely for Viana's sake?

Yet coming to Bassburgh hadn't disappointed her. Even if it was her granddaughter rather than grandson achieving success, the journey proved worthwhile.

"If only Lydia possessed half of Vivian's talents," Madam Victoria remarked, shifting attention to the silent figure on the sofa.

Lydia had been staying in the city for weeks, yet Vivian never introduced her to high society. This neglect stung, and now being compared unfavorably to Vivian deepened her resentment.

But surely she couldn't possibly be worse than that disgraced cousin Evelyn, could she?

That wretched cousin hadn't shown her face since their first meeting after being cast out. Lydia might not match Vivian's brilliance, but she'd always outshine Evelyn.

"Grandmother, must you always compare me? I may not equal Vivian, but I'm certainly superior to Evelyn, aren't I?"

Lydia's careless words made Laura and Vivian stiffen. Though unintentional, the barb struck deep.

Mocking Evelyn alone would have been tolerable, but using her as a measuring stick implied Vivian's accomplishments stemmed solely from borrowed status and jewelry - not genuine ability.

Madam Victoria remained silent. Given the choice, she'd take the obedient if mediocre Lydia over troublesome Evelyn any day.

The ringing phone provided Vivian an escape to the balcony.

Frederick's news sparked delight. "You're certain?"

Evelyn planned to auction designs at Summerton in three days - and boasted she'd command the highest bid?

Vivian's eyes glittered as Frederick confirmed the details.

She'd invested $1.6 million in Frederick's designs. Without Penelope and Evelyn conspiring against her, she'd have dominated the jewelry world by now.

But fortune smiled differently - while jewelry eluded her grasp, nobility beckoned.

Evelyn aiming for record auction prices? Vivian wouldn't let this chance slip through her fingers.

The time for retaliation had come.

"Frederick," she commanded, "discover what she's auctioning and commission identical replicas."

She'd present the copies before Evelyn's items reached the block, then expose the "original" as plagiarism when Evelyn presented hers.

Vivian trembled with anticipation - how would the celebrated international designer survive that scandal?
###Chapter 147

The Summerton Auction commenced precisely at seven in the evening.

Guests entered the grand hall wearing elaborate masquerade masks provided by the ushers.

Beyond its renowned jewelry collection, Summerton also specialized in rare antiques, all transactions conducted with impeccable legality.

The circular auction hall boasted traditional wooden architecture, exuding vintage elegance. The space comprised both the main floor and exclusive VIP suites on the upper level.

Eight luxurious VIP rooms overlooked the proceedings through floor-to-ceiling windows, offering privileged guests complete visibility of both the auction stage and general attendees.

Access to these private suites required not only exceptional social standing but a minimum net worth of $150 million. Summerton's clientele represented the crème de la crème of high society.

Evelyn Vanderbilt arrived with Gregory Fannon, her delicate features partially concealed behind an ornate mask. She wore an ivory gown with a daring high neckline, her hair swept into an elegant chignon.

Sequined tassel earrings complemented her graceful neckline, while the dress's fitted bodice accentuated her slender waist.

As they took their assigned seats in the main hall, Gregory scanned the masked crowd. "Are you certain Vivian will appear tonight?"

"Without doubt."

Evelyn had deliberately leaked information through Frederick Fuller, even providing him with the design specifications of her auction piece. Tonight would mark Vivian's final humiliation.

If anyone deserved to be exposed as a fraud, it would be Vivian Vanderbilt.

Right on cue, Vivian made her entrance.

Despite the masks, mutual recognition was instantaneous.

Vivian approached with feline grace. "I knew you'd be here." Frederick hadn't deceived her after all.

"Here for entertainment?" Evelyn maintained her serene smile.

Vivian crossed her arms with a derisive snort. "For the auction, naturally. Though I should warn you - there's still time to withdraw if you wish to avoid public embarrassment."

Evelyn's laughter tinkled like crystal. "The evening's outcome remains uncertain." She'd indulged Vivian's arrogance long enough.

"Don't overestimate yourself, Evelyn." Vivian's jaw tightened.

How dare this woman remain so composed? The night would end with Evelyn in tears!

A black-suited bodyguard materialized beside Vivian. "Ms. Vanderbilt, Mr. and Mrs. Laurent await you in the VIP suite."

Vivian tossed her hair triumphantly. "You'll have to excuse me. The upper levels beckon. Do enjoy the... commoner's view."

She strutted away, heels clicking rhythmically against marble.

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

Gregory whirled toward her. "The Laurent family? How is this possible? Since when do they associate with the Vanderbilts?"

What connection could the prestigious Laurents possibly have with Vivian?

Though perplexed, Evelyn remained undeterred. Tonight, she would reclaim everything Vivian had stolen - regardless of who stood behind her.

A hostess in flowing silk approached. "Pardon the interruption, but you've received an invitation to join a VIP party."

Evelyn exchanged glances with Gregory.

"From whom?" she inquired.

The hostess offered a practiced smile. "My apologies, but the host requested anonymity. All will be revealed if you'd kindly follow me."
###Chapter 148

Evelyn and Gregory rose from their seats, following the hostess toward the private viewing area.

Vivian's face darkened as she watched them ascend to the first floor.

Rumors said the first floor was reserved for Bassburgh's elite. Could it mean...?

Nathan?

Vivian bit her lip until it nearly bled. She would humiliate Evelyn publicly tonight!

The hostess led them to the Swan Room, where four imposing bodyguards stood sentry.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Was Nathan waiting inside? But the shadow behind the frosted glass didn't match his silhouette.

Her breath caught when the figure turned.

No mask obscured his striking features. His warm smile crinkled the corners of mesmerizing eyes. "My instincts never fail me."

Evelyn's lips curved. Adrian Boucher in the flesh!

She moved to the panoramic window overlooking the auction floor. "I never took you for a jewelry enthusiast."

The reclusive superstar rarely appeared at public events beyond film premieres. His presence at Summerton Auction House sent shockwaves through high society.

Adrian leaned against the railing. "Research for a new role. When I heard Bassburgh's rising star designer would be here, I couldn't resist." His gaze held hers. "Call me Adrian."

Evelyn maintained her professional smile. Up close, his charisma was almost overwhelming - that rare magnetism shared only by Nathan Goldmann in this city.

She'd studied his filmography. Whether portraying heroes or villains, he disappeared into every role with breathtaking authenticity.

Not a single scandal had tarnished his decade-long career - only glowing reviews of his craft.

"Are you bidding tonight?" Adrian's voice pulled her from her thoughts.

"Actually, I'm the seller." Evelyn gestured toward the display cases being wheeled onto the stage.

Adrian's eyebrows lifted. "Then I'll be watching with particular interest."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. They'd shared one dance at the gala - hardly enough to warrant this attention. His devoted fans would riot if they knew.

A chime signaled the auction's commencement.

The first lot: Taylor Jewelry's pigeon blood ruby fan earrings.

Bids flashed across the digital display as attendees competed via handheld devices.

True pigeon blood rubies were rarer than diamonds, their crimson depths unmatched in the gemstone world.

The numbers climbed rapidly - $70 million... $85 million... finally settling at $97 million.

The auctioneer's gavel fell. "Sold to our distinguished guest in the Marble Room!"
###Chapter 149

The auction hall erupted in murmurs.

The next piece up for bidding was yet another from Taylor Jewelry. After several rounds, their highest-priced item had already soared to a staggering $263,000,000—far surpassing any other lot.

The screen flickered, revealing a dazzling peacock blue necklace.

Gregory Fannon’s gaze darted nervously toward Evelyn. Adrian Boucher, noticing his reaction, also glanced at Evelyn from the corner of his eye.

Seller: Vivian Vanderbilt

A ripple of confusion spread through the crowd. Most sellers here were either renowned corporations or celebrated designers. Vivian’s name, however, drew blank stares.

Only a handful recognized her from the Twitter drama involving Penelope Santiago.

Yet, the necklace on display was undeniably striking.

The peacock blue piece featured a teardrop-shaped sapphire at its center, surrounded by a cascade of melee blue diamonds forming the peacock’s tail.

This was Peacock’s Pride—Evelyn’s original design.

Too bad Vivian had copied the sketch without realizing the main stone should have been tanzanite. That one change would have elevated it to another level entirely.

In the Blossom Room, Vivian barely contained her glee. Her heart raced as the numbers on the screen climbed higher.

Lillian de Arma turned to her. "This is your design?"

Vivian smiled sweetly. "Yes."

She was lucky she’d rushed to submit it before Evelyn could. So what if Evelyn had sketched it first? It was hers now.

Lillian said nothing, but her brows furrowed as she studied the piece.

It was beautiful—but incomplete.

The bidding finally stalled at $42,000,000—nearly $50,000,000 less than Taylor’s pigeon blood rubies.

Vivian was still thrilled. She hadn’t expected such a high price.

Evelyn crossed her arms, her crimson lips curling. "$42,000,000 is generous for that."

Adrian smirked. "You seem familiar with this piece?"

She met his gaze. "It’s mine."

His eyes flickered with surprise. "Then why is someone else auctioning it?"

Her own design, stolen and sold before her own version could debut—yet she remained composed.

Adrian was impressed.

Then chaos erupted.

The next item flashed on screen, and the crowd erupted in confusion.

"Isn’t this the same necklace?"

"What’s going on? Are they selling duplicates now?"

Lillian turned to Vivian, her expression unreadable. "Explain this."

Vivian feigned innocence. "I have no idea. Someone must have plagiarized me."

This was it—Evelyn’s downfall.

But then the seller’s name appeared.

Zara.

Gasps filled the room.

Zara—the legendary international jewelry designer—had created an identical piece to Vivian Vanderbilt’s?

Staff scrambled to check the system for errors.

None were found.
###Chapter 150

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

There were two identical "Peacock's Pride" necklaces.

This was unprecedented in Summerton's history.

"Would an international designer stoop to copying?"

"With their reputation? Impossible. It must be that newcomer, Vivian Vanderbilt, who plagiarized."

The murmurs grew louder, buzzing like angry bees.

Lillian de Arma signaled a bodyguard, whispering urgent instructions. He strode off, and moments later, an announcement crackled through the speakers.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you of a technical delay. A potential case of plagiarism has been identified, and an investigation will commence immediately."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Plagiarism? At an auction like this?"

The two necklaces were placed side by side on the stage, an appraiser stepping forward to scrutinize them. If proven, this scandal would be catastrophic.

Adrian Boucher leaned toward Evelyn, studying her serene expression. "Aren’t you worried?"

Evelyn’s lips curved. "Truth is on my side."

The appraiser conferred with the crew, then turned to the audience. "Both pieces are genuine jewels."

A stunned silence followed.

But how?

Then, a voice cut through the tension—clear, confident.

"Sir."

All eyes lifted to the first-floor balcony, where a woman in a white gown and a masquerade mask stood. "Perhaps you could examine the gemstones more closely?"

Vivian’s nails dug into her palms. What was Evelyn playing at?

The appraiser adjusted his loupe, then stiffened. "They’re different. The first uses sapphire, but this one—" His voice trembled. "This is tanzanite!"

In the Peach Room, Madam Nora’s teacup clattered against its saucer. She exchanged a glance with her bodyguard, who stepped forward.

"Madam requests both pieces displayed on the screen."

No one dared refuse.

The twin peacock necklaces magnified on the giant screen, their differences now undeniable.

The second piece shimmered with a regal violet-blue hue, its gradient aquamarine diamonds enhancing the tanzanite’s depth. The craftsmanship was exquisite—each feather alive with light.

The crowd erupted. Bidding numbers skyrocketed.

Vivian’s breath hitched. Sapphire was supposed to work!

Her gaze darted to Lucas Laurent, whose confusion had hardened into suspicion.

She opened her mouth, but he spoke first.

"Frankly, if you claimed Zara copied you, I wouldn’t believe it."

Something in his tone made her blood run cold.
###Chapter 151

"Could it be related to what happened at the Michelin-starred restaurant?"

Adrian's words made Vivian's expression shift.

Thankfully, Lillian remained silent, allowing her to regain some composure.

The bidding screen froze at $266,000,000!

The final bidder was Madam Nora from the Peach Room.

Evelyn gasped, her curious gaze darting toward the VIP seated by the Peach Room's window. That elegant figure was none other than Madam Nora herself!

Suddenly, the price jumped to $282,000,000.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

The auctioneer blinked in surprise before announcing, "Congratulations to our distinguished guests in the Stork Room on the second floor—"

Evelyn turned sharply toward Adrian. "Mr. Boucher, you—"

A lazy smile played on his lips. "Masterpieces deserve their weight in gold."

Madam Nora's brows knitted as she studied the occupants of the Stork Room.

'So it's that Boucher brat.'

"The price is climbing again!"

At the excited shouts from below, Evelyn's attention snapped back to the screen.

$282,000,000 had transformed into $313,000,000.

'Who in heaven's name has that kind of money to burn?'

"Congratulations to our Peach Room guests—"

"Congratulations to the Stork Room—"

"Congratulations—"

The auctioneer's voice faltered as numbers skyrocketed beyond comprehension. She eventually gave up announcing, simply gaping at the digital display.

$470,000,000.

The audience stopped pretending to care. Competing with second-floor tycoons was a fool's errand.

Evelyn gripped Adrian's sleeve, her palm damp. "Please stop bidding, Mr. Boucher. It's not worth it."

She already suspected the Bamboo Room's occupant.

'There's only one person it could be.'

Adrian recognized the bidder too. Noticing Evelyn's tension, he smirked. "Relax. I'm just having fun. Money means nothing to him anyway."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. 'Some best friend—throwing his buddy under the bus. Nathan's friendship circle is terrifying.'

In the Bamboo Room, Nathan's lips thinned until the auctioneer's gavel fell. "Sold to our Bamboo Room VIP for $470,000,000!"

Thunderous applause filled the hall.

Evelyn had broken records tonight—yet celebration was the furthest thing from her mind.

A knock sounded at the Stork Room.

The bodyguard opened to reveal Oliver. His gaze flickered between Adrian and Evelyn before settling on the latter. "Ms. Vanderbilt, Mr. Goldmann requests your presence."

Following Oliver to the Bamboo Room, Evelyn found Nathan lounging on silk cushions, his piercing stare locking onto her.

His jaw tightened. "Are you and Adrian an item now?"

'Not only did this woman attend an auction without telling me, but she holed up in Adrian's private suite. One meeting, and that playboy's already sniffing around!'

"An item? What kind of phrasing is that?" Evelyn scoffed. "Mr. Goldmann, your concern is touching. Though I'd prefer not being torn apart by a certain actor's fanbase."

Nathan yanked her onto his lap, one hand possessive on her waist, the other tilting her chin. "No need to wait for his fans. I'll dismantle you myself."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Nathan studied her face. "Mission accomplished tonight?"
"Thanks to your extravagant $470 million gesture," she retorted, pushing against his chest.

His grip tightened, pulling her closer. "Where's my gratitude?"

His breath warmed her lips as his palm grew hotter against her waist. She scrambled backward like a startled cat. "I never asked you to bid. Why should I thank you?"
###Chapter 152

"Honestly, the words that come out of your mouth annoy me sometimes."

"Then stop kissing me."

Nathan hadn't anticipated that response. His brows furrowed as he gripped Evelyn's chin. "You started this."

His lips crashed onto hers before she could protest.

Evelyn squirmed in his embrace, but he only tightened his hold. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, eyes burning with desire. "Keep struggling and this will escalate. Your choice."

She froze instantly.

"Mr. Goldmann." Oliver's voice interrupted from beyond the door.

Evelyn scrambled away from him, cheeks flaming.

This man was utterly shameless!

Oliver entered, clearing his throat. "Madam Nora requests your presence in the Peach Room with Ms. Vanderbilt."

As they exited the Bamboo Room, they encountered the Laurent family and Vivian in the hallway.

Vivian's expression darkened seeing Nathan's fingers intertwined with Evelyn's.

'Damn it! That bitch keeps slipping through my traps!'

Evelyn stood at 5'4" in flats, her petite frame contrasting sharply with Nathan's 6'1" stature. The masquerade mask couldn't conceal her discomfort.

"Mrs. Laurent, Mr. Laurent." Nathan acknowledged them coolly.

Lillian's gaze lingered on Evelyn. "This must be your girlfriend."

Nathan's grip tightened when Evelyn tried to pull away. "Fiancée."

Evelyn's eyes widened.

"We have prior engagements." Nathan flashed a polite smile and steered Evelyn away.

Lucas watched them go, fists clenched in his pockets. Something about the children's resemblance to Nathan nagged at him.

Oliver shot Vivian a disapproving glance. 'Switching targets to Mr. Laurent so quickly?'

The Peach Room housed Madam Nora and Gregory. The older woman set down her teacup, studying Evelyn. "I've been curious about our last conversation. Never imagined you were Zara."

"Why didn't you reveal your identity?"

'Wouldn't have known without Gregory's tip-off.'

Evelyn removed her mask with a practiced smile. "Would you have believed me then?"

Madam Nora chuckled. "True enough. Actions speak louder than words."

Nathan's lips quirked. "I see my fiancée's Peacock's Pride impressed you."

Evelyn shot him a glare.

'Fiancée? We haven't even discussed marriage!'

"You're quite the enigma," Madam Nora mused. "Hiding your talents and relationship with Mr. Goldmann. No wonder Gregory supports you."

"You won," Madam Nora declared.

Evelyn sighed. "My associate made the purchase. That hardly counts."

'Her associate?' Nathan's eyes gleamed. 'So she acknowledges me now.'

Madam Nora shook her head. "Even without Mr. Goldmann's bid, I would have purchased it myself. The price mattered less than your sincerity. You've showcased tanzanite's true brilliance."
###Chapter 153

Madam Nora had clearly underestimated Evelyn Vanderbilt before. The realization made the older woman flush with embarrassment at her near miscalculation.

Yet pride demanded she maintain her dignity. "Have Gregory come tomorrow to renew the contract," she declared imperiously. "I'll grant you access to my tanzanite supply chain - but don't disappoint me."

Evelyn's lips curved. "Of course, Madam Nora."

Nathan watched Evelyn with quiet admiration.

'She plays her games well,' he thought. 'To earn Madam Nora's approval without anyone's help... Her fierce independence is impossible to dislike.'

Yet beneath his admiration simmered frustration. Why wouldn't this woman let him protect her?

#Zara Outshines New Designer Vivian Vanderbilt#

The Summerton Auction Hall's revelation of identical pieces last night had catapulted both Zara and Vivian to trending status.

The comparison spoke for itself. Social media erupted with accusations of Vivian plagiarizing Zara's designs, the evidence undeniable.

Netizens even dug up Vivian's previous gothic-style collections, pointing out striking similarities to Zara's vintage-inspired works.

@SavannahWood: Did Vivian really think she could plagiarize her way to fame?
@PeterHammer: Zara's designs have always maintained visual comfort through balanced simplicity. Her embellishments serve as perfect accents rather than overwhelming statements.
@SamuelNorton: Every designer has their own style. Just because Zara's more famous doesn't automatically mean plagiarism.

Reporters swarmed Viana Jewelry's entrance, forcing Vivian to barricade herself in her office.

She trembled with rage reading the online accusations.

Laura peered through the blinds at the persistent reporters before rushing to Vivian's side. "Sweetheart, we have Frederick's original sketches. We'll post a statement on all platforms immediately."

'With the sketches and enough money to buy Frederick's silence, we can turn this around,' Laura thought confidently.

Vivian agreed, though with her personal accounts suspended, she had to use Viana's official channels.

The statement denied all plagiarism allegations, presenting the sketches as proof of originality. It subtly implied Zara might be the actual plagiarist.

Meanwhile at ckgold Group's 16th floor...

Evelyn watched Viana's statement unfold across social media with calm certainty.

Timed perfectly with Soul Studio's official launch, she released their entire retro-gothic collection online.

@SoulJewelryStudioOfficial: @VianaJewelryOfficial Upon our studio's launch, we discovered unauthorized use of our original manuscripts to create "new" designs. While we initially chose silence, plagiarism cannot be tolerated. Attached are our registration documents and manuscript creation dates.

The post detonated across social media like a bomb. Debates raged - was this legitimate accusation or clever marketing? Some defended Vivian, others questioned Soul Studio's motives, while conspiracy theorists speculated about coordinated PR stunts.

Vivian stared at her screen in shock.

'Soul Jewelry Studio? What the hell is this?'
###Chapter 154

"How could these designs be identical to Frederick's?" Evelyn's fingers trembled as she examined the dated manuscripts. "These were created before the ones Frederick gave us!"

"Vivian, explain this mess!" Laura grabbed her daughter's arm, her manicured nails digging into flesh.

Vivian fumbled for her phone, dialing Frederick's number repeatedly. Each attempt met with the same automated voicemail. The line was dead.

Her stomach dropped like a stone.

'That bastard set me up!'

Within minutes, Vivian issued a desperate statement blaming Frederick Fuller, claiming he was a rogue designer from Hailey & Co. Jewelry.

But Hailey & Co. struck back faster than a viper.

#HaileyOfficial: We have no designer named Frederick Fuller and never collaborated with @VianaJewelry. Pro tip: verify your partners before signing contracts. #DueDiligence

The tweet exploded across social media like wildfire. Viana Jewelry became the laughingstock of the industry overnight.

Netizens roasted Vivian mercilessly. Memes of her selfies flooded timelines with captions like "Talent Thief" and "Fake It Till You Make It Fail." By noon, #ViviansStolenTalent trended globally.

Vivian hurled a paperweight at her office window, shattering glass across her designer heels. "Those idiots don't understand anything!"

Richard Vanderbilt stormed into the chaos, his tailored suit straining over clenched muscles. Laura rushed to intercept him. "Darling, don't believe those internet trolls—"

The slap echoed through the office. Laura stumbled sideways, clutching her cheek in shock.

"Look what you've raised." Richard's voice dripped with disgust. "You've both become an embarrassment."

Seeing her mother struck, Vivian fell to her knees with practiced dramatics. "Punish me, Father! I was blinded by ambition. That conman manipulated me!" Tears streaked her contoured cheeks. "But please, don't take it out on Mother."

Richard's jaw twitched. Despite his fury, the sight of his weeping daughter stirred old instincts. 'I spoiled her too much. This is my fault too.'

"Effective immediately," he said coldly, "you're barred from Viana operations. Clearly, leadership isn't your forte."

Vivian's nails bit into her palms. 'Who needs Viana? I'm still a de Armas heiress.'

Later, watching her father's televised apology on behalf of Viana Jewelry, Evelyn's chest constricted. Though she now understood her parents' fractured history, the public dismissal still stung.

'At least Father won't trust Vivian with the company again.' Her fingers tightened around her coffee mug. 'But Laura and Grandmother won't surrender control so easily.'

"Brooding again?" A familiar baritone whispered against her ear.

Evelyn startled, turning abruptly—only for her lips to brush against Nathan's. He'd leaned over her desk, close enough to steal the oxygen from her lungs. The smirk playing on his mouth confirmed this was exactly the outcome he'd engineered.

"Taking liberties, Mr. Goldmann?"

Her eyelashes fluttered as she put space between them. Nathan merely arched a brow. "Says the woman who just kissed me."
###Chapter 155

Evelyn's eyes remained fixed on her computer screen, where Richard's public apology video played on loop.

Nathan frowned, then placed his hands on her slender shoulders.

The moment his fingers made contact, an electric jolt shot through her body, making her shiver violently.

Standing behind her, the powerful CEO began massaging her tense muscles with surprising gentleness. Anyone witnessing this scene would have gasped in disbelief.

The untouchable Mr. Goldmann was actually giving someone a shoulder rub?

"Would you like me to accompany you to the Vanderbilt estate for dinner?" Evelyn asked coolly.

A dark chuckle escaped Nathan's lips. "Sorry to disappoint, but the Vanderbilts don't welcome me. If you want free food, you should ask Vivian—Ouch!"

"That hurts! Are you trying to break my shoulders?"

Nathan leaned down, his breath warm against her ear. "I know you're jealous of Vivian, but I've never voluntarily gone to the Vanderbilt mansion with her before. By that measure alone, you've already won."

Evelyn scoffed. "Really? Then who was the man who abandoned me on the roadside that night?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. He suddenly spun her chair around, caging her between his arms on the armrests. "How about I let you strand me on the road for an hour so you can get your revenge? Fair trade?"

Evelyn looked up into his piercing gaze.

'Is this really happening? Since when does Nathan Goldmann lower himself to appease anyone? And now he's practically begging for forgiveness?'

The usually domineering tycoon seemed to be melting before her eyes.

Just as she lost herself in thought, his lips descended upon hers in a sudden, searing kiss.

Evelyn gasped against his mouth, hands flying up to push against his chest—but her resistance quickly weakened.

Surrounded by his familiar scent, her body responded instinctively, returning the kiss with equal fervor.

Nathan deepened the kiss, one hand cradling the back of her head as his other arm pulled her closer. He wanted more—needed more—

"Zoe!" Gregory burst through the door unannounced.

Evelyn jerked away, spinning her chair around so quickly she nearly toppled over.

Gregory froze, realizing his terrible timing. "I'll...come back later."

He backed out hastily, closing the door behind him.

Nathan showed no concern about being caught. His lips curled as he noticed Evelyn's flushed ears. Brushing his thumb across his own lips, a victorious gleam appeared in his eyes. "Call me anytime you want to visit your father at the Vanderbilt estate."

Watching Nathan's retreating figure, Evelyn's confusion grew.

'What just possessed me? Not only didn't I resist, but I actively participated...'

Her expression darkened.

'This is dangerous. I can't afford to get accustomed to his touch...'

Meanwhile, at the Laurent residence...

Lillian de Arma sat stroking her Persian cat's silky fur when the butler announced Vivian's arrival.

The older woman didn't bother looking up as Vivian entered carrying an expensive gift box. "No need for gifts next time."

Vivian forced a smile. "It wouldn't feel right coming empty-handed."

Lillian finally glanced up, her expression unreadable. "The internet seems quite...entertained by your recent scandals."

"Aunt Lillian, those rumors are lies! I was framed!" Vivian had come specifically to clear her name.

'Father has completely turned against me—even stripped me of Viana Jewelry's management rights. My only hope now is to win Madam Laurent's favor!'

Lillian handed the cat to her butler before picking up her coffee cup. "You're so different from your mother...sometimes I wonder if you're truly her daughter."
###Chapter 156

A flicker of resentment flashed through Vivian's eyes.

Her face had gone pale. "Aunty, I know I'm nothing compared to my mother. You must remember she died when I was just a child. I—"

"Enough." Lillian's gaze turned dismissive. "Just conduct yourself properly from now on and don't disgrace your mother's memory. Your grandfather would despise this weak-willed nature of yours."

"The women of de Arma bloodline are born warriors. But you? You'll never measure up."

Vivian's fists clenched so tight her nails dug into her palms. "Understood."

'How dare she speak to me like this?'

"You may leave now. I require rest." Lillian rose from the sofa and ascended the staircase without another glance.

Emerging from the Laurent estate, Vivian's expression darkened. The matriarch's contempt had struck deeper than expected.

'Blood ties mean nothing without proof. I must eliminate Lillian's suspicions once and for all.'

A cruel smile twisted Vivian's lips.

'All I need is that bitch's hair sample. Once the DNA test confirms our relation, my position will be unshakable.'

That evening...

Nathan's luxury car idled outside the Vanderbilt gates as he studied Evelyn's conflicted expression. "Still having second thoughts?"

"I never agreed to come here." She glared at him. He'd driven straight to the manor after work without consulting her.

Nathan's lips quirked. "You watched Richard's apology video three times today. Deny it all you want - you still care."

Evelyn remained silent.

Her father's betrayal had cut deep. His infidelity, his distrust - she'd resented him for years.

Yet his recent words haunted her.

'Do I truly hate him?'

Perhaps not. Beneath the anger, he remained the only family she had left besides her children.

"Come on. You're still a Vanderbilt. With me here, no one dares mistreat you."

Evelyn shot him a withering look. "I don't need your protection to handle my own family."

She stepped out before he could respond.

Nathan sighed. 'Must she always be so stubborn? Just once, I wish she'd let me be the knight in shining armor.' He shook his head. 'Then again, I did threaten her when we first met. Guess I deserve this.'

The moment Evelyn crossed the threshold, stunned silence fell over the Vanderbilt living room.

Laura's face twisted in shock.

'Why is this wretch back?'

Madam Victoria and Lydia stared openly, the former's expression souring. "Well, look who finally remembers where she belongs."

Lydia gasped.

'Is that really Evelyn? She's become stunning!'

Evelyn crossed her arms, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Problem with me visiting home?"

Then Nathan entered.

Laura's face went sheet-white.

'Mr. Goldmann?!'

Madam Victoria's outrage doubled. "You bring some random man into—"

"Mother!" Laura hissed. "That's Nathan Goldmann."

The old woman's demeanor transformed instantly. "Oh Zoe darling, you should've warned us you were bringing Mr. Goldmann!" She rose with sudden enthusiasm.

Evelyn smirked. "Grandmother, weren't you just calling him 'some random man'?"
###Chapter 157

Madam Victoria felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment. "Isn't it rather presumptuous of me to jump to conclusions so quickly?" she murmured.

The elderly matriarch found herself genuinely perplexed.

How could this insignificant girl possibly invite Mr. Goldmann to our home? Everyone said Vivian was the one closest to him!

Lydia's nervousness stemmed from an entirely different source than Madam Victoria or Laura. From the moment Nathan Goldmann entered the room, she hadn't been able to tear her gaze away from him.

"He's breathtakingly handsome," she thought, her pulse quickening. "He makes every other man I've ever met look like peasants in comparison."

"Zoe." Richard Vanderbilt paused mid-step on the staircase, clearly startled by his daughter's unexpected appearance. After their last confrontation, he'd assumed she'd never set foot in this house again.

"I've brought Mr. Goldmann for dinner. I hope that's acceptable?" Evelyn's tone was carefully neutral as she studied her father's face. The deep lines of exhaustion and the newly prominent gray streaks in his hair shocked her.

Madam Victoria practically leaped forward before Richard could respond. "But of course! Having Mr. Goldmann grace our home is an honor for the Vanderbilt family." She immediately signaled Laura to instruct the kitchen staff to prepare additional dishes.

"Evelyn." A delicate-looking girl approached with calculated shyness, reaching for Evelyn's hand while stealing glances at Nathan. "It's been so many years. Do you still remember me?"

Evelyn remained silent, her expression blank. She genuinely didn't recognize this stranger.

Madam Victoria rushed to explain. "Lydia, your cousin hasn't visited in over a decade. How could she possibly remember you?" Turning to Evelyn, she added, "Zoe, this is your cousin Lydia. You met when you were children."

'Lydia?' Evelyn vaguely recalled a baby cousin from her childhood visits. 'She's grown into this?'

"Oh, Lydia." Evelyn's acknowledgment was cool and detached. Having experienced the Vanderbilt family's true colors firsthand, she felt no warmth toward any of them.

Throughout dinner, Madam Victoria fawned over Nathan while Lydia kept stealing glances at him, as if she'd discovered her fairy tale prince.

Laura could barely contain her agitation. She'd led Madam Victoria to believe Vivian was the one with connections to Mr. Goldmann.

"Zoe," Richard began hesitantly, his voice barely above a whisper, "I'm... glad you came home for dinner."

Evelyn's fork hesitated for just a second before she continued eating. "Since the Vanderbilts made it clear I'm unwelcome, I couldn't very well keep imposing myself."

"Oh, Zoe, what nonsense!" Madam Victoria's sudden effusiveness made Evelyn's skin crawl. "You're a Vanderbilt by blood! Why would we ever turn you away?"

The blatant hypocrisy was almost too much to bear.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, meeting her grandmother's eyes directly. "Would you be saying that if Mr. Goldmann weren't sitting beside me right now?"

Madam Victoria choked on her wine. Though publicly humiliated, she couldn't risk an outburst with Nathan present.

In previous years, Richard would have slammed the table and reprimanded Evelyn for disrespect. Tonight, he remained silent.

Nathan placed a slice of prime rib on Evelyn's plate, his gaze tender. "Don't just eat pasta. You need protein too."

Watching Nathan's attentive care and the loving looks he gave Evelyn, Lydia bit her lip hard enough to leave marks. Envy and jealousy twisted in her gut. 'Why does she get someone like him?'

Madam Victoria hadn't anticipated this level of intimacy between Evelyn and Nathan. She shot Laura a venomous look, silently blaming her for the misinformation. Laura seethed internally but dared not react in front of their distinguished guest.
###Chapter 158

Madam Victoria's sharp gaze pierced through the tense air. "Mr. Goldmann, what exactly is your relationship with Zoe?"

Nathan's fingers tightened around his wine glass. "Zoe is my fiancée." His deep voice carried finality. "Is there a problem?"

'Fiancée?!' Madam Victoria's manicured nails dug into the tablecloth. 'That conniving little gold-digger actually landed the Goldmann heir!'

"Zoe," she forced a smile, "why haven't you informed your family about your engagement?"

Evelyn's lips curled in amusement. "I prefer keeping my personal life private."

'If Nathan weren't the Goldmann heir,' Madam Victoria seethed internally, 'this ungrateful wretch wouldn't dare speak to me like this!'

Nathan's sudden declaration made Evelyn choke on her wine. "When are you marrying me, darling?"

Evelyn shot him a warning glare. 'Are you trying to get yourself killed? This was supposed to be temporary!'

"Zoe," Madam Victoria interjected sweetly, "you're not getting any younger. With Mr. Goldmann's devotion, why delay?"

'If this marriage happens,' she calculated, 'my standing among Cornelia's elite would skyrocket overnight.'

"My marital plans," Evelyn said icily, "are none of your concern."

Madam Victoria's smile turned brittle. "I'm still your grandmother, child. Such disrespect—"

"Mother," Richard interrupted, "Zoe is an adult. Her decisions are her own."

The quiet support stunned Evelyn. Her father hadn't defended her in over a decade.

Nathan's warm hand covered her clenched fist beneath the table. His touch startled her.

"Zoe's suffered enough in this house," Nathan stated coldly. "Her future is hers to decide."

The declaration left Madam Victoria and Laura seething while Richard looked ashamed.

Dinner progressed in strained silence. Nathan ignored everyone except Evelyn, filling her plate with meticulous care.

Richard observed them with quiet relief. After years of believing Laura and Vivian's lies about his daughter, seeing Nathan's genuine care eased his conscience.

"Father," Evelyn broke the silence, "where's Vivian tonight?"

The rare term of endearment startled Richard. Though pleased, his expression darkened at Vivian's mention. "She's been leaving early and returning late these days. I've stopped keeping track."

Laura's knuckles turned white around her fork.

'Of course he's given up on Vivian,' she thought bitterly. 'If only I could reveal that pregnancy...'

The unspoken tension thickened as dessert arrived, each participant lost in their private calculations while maintaining perfect social masks.
###Chapter 159

After dinner, Madam Victoria suggested that Evelyn and Nathan should spend the night at the Vanderbilt manor.

Evelyn wanted to refuse, but Nathan accepted without hesitation.

Madam Victoria's face lit up with delight. "Mr. Goldmann, please don't hesitate to ask for anything you need. Consider this your home."

Nathan barely acknowledged her, leaving the old woman with an awkward smile.

Home? Evelyn scoffed internally.

She opened her mouth to protest, but Nathan cut her off with a glance. "I'd like to see your old room."

My old room?

Evelyn stiffened. It had been six years since she last stepped foot in this house, let alone the room she once occupied.

Richard cleared his throat. "Zoe's room hasn’t been touched. I’ll have it cleaned immediately."

Later, Evelyn stood in the doorway of her childhood bedroom. The layout was exactly as she remembered—same furniture, same decorations, frozen in time.

Only the bed seemed smaller now, dwarfed by the massive one in Nathan’s suite.

Nathan prowled the space, his sharp eyes landing on the framed photos displayed on the cabinet.

All of them were of Evelyn as a child.

She had been adorable—round cheeks, bright eyes, looking so much like Daisy.

"Don’t look!" Evelyn snatched the photo from his hands and clutched it to her chest, shielding the rest with her body.

Nathan arched a brow. "What’s wrong with me seeing my woman as a child?"

"I said don’t."

"Are you embarrassed?"

Evelyn gritted her teeth. The photos were hideous, and she’d rather die than let him see them.

Nathan didn’t push. Instead, he surveyed the room before sinking onto the bed. "Cozy."

Evelyn shoved the photos back into the cabinet and turned to glare at him. "Mr. Goldmann, this bed is tiny. You should—"

He ignored her and stretched out fully.

Evelyn gaped.

This arrogant bastard has no shame!

That night…

Evelyn rummaged through her closet for something to wear. The only clothes left were from her high school days, long forgotten.

Thankfully, her old pajamas still fit.

But what about him?

Nathan had already shed his jacket, unbuttoning his shirt as if preparing to shower.

A sudden realization struck her. She lunged forward, grabbing his arms and shoving him back onto the bed.

Nathan blinked, caught off guard.

Evelyn glowered. "I’ll ask my father for spare pajamas. Stay put."

She had almost forgotten—there was nothing here that would fit him, and she refused to let him sleep naked.

The corner of Nathan’s mouth twitched as she stormed out.

Evelyn reached Richard’s door and froze when she heard Laura’s voice from inside.

"What’s wrong with me wanting a son? The Vanderbilts need an heir, Richard. Do you hate me now?"

A son?

Evelyn’s frown deepened.

Laura’s over forty. Is she seriously trying to get pregnant at this age?

Richard’s voice was sharp. "That’s not something we can control. Zoe and Nathan are here. Have you lost your mind?"

Laura sniffled. "You’ve changed."

"Instead of obsessing over this, discipline your daughter properly."

"Fine. I’ll sleep in Vivian’s room tonight."

Laura flung the door open—only to collide with Evelyn standing there. Her glare turned venomous.

Evelyn smirked.

Richard ignored Laura but stiffened when he saw Evelyn. "Zoe? What are you—"
###Chapter 160

Evelyn hesitated at the doorway. "Nathan doesn't have pajamas, so I came to ask if you had any that might fit him."

Richard's expression softened. "I actually bought a new set recently—haven't even worn them yet. Let me get them for you."

He disappeared into his room and returned with a neatly folded pair of silk pajamas.

As Evelyn turned to leave, Richard stepped forward. "Zoe."

She paused, glancing back. "Yes?"

His voice was heavy with regret. "I was the one who wronged you."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "It's fine, Dad." Without another word, she walked away, refusing to meet his eyes.

Richard exhaled, his chest tight. Even if she hadn’t fully forgiven him, hearing her call him Dad again was enough—for now.

As Evelyn approached her room, she froze.

Lydia stood outside her door, speaking to Nathan with an unmistakable blush on her cheeks. The way she fidgeted, the way her eyes sparkled—it was obvious.

She likes him.

Nathan noticed Evelyn’s return and arched a brow. "You're back."

Evelyn scoffed internally. If I hadn’t come back, I wouldn’t have seen you two chatting so happily.

She shoved the pajamas into his hands. "Here. They’re new."

Lydia quickly interjected, "Evelyn, don’t misunderstand. We were just talking about you."

Evelyn smirked. "I’m not misunderstanding anything."

With that, she nudged Nathan aside and strode into the room.

Nathan watched her, amused.

That reaction? Definitely jealous.

Lydia hesitated. "Mr. Goldmann, I—"

"My wife and I are going to rest now." His tone turned icy as he shut the door in her face.

Lydia clenched her fists, stunned.

What just happened? He was perfectly pleasant before Evelyn showed up!

A sly smile curled her lips.

I made sure to mention Evelyn to get closer to him, and he didn’t push me away. Maybe… I still have a chance.

Inside the room, Nathan changed into the pajamas and emerged from the bathroom.

Evelyn was already on the bed, her back to him.

He smirked, lying beside her and propping his head on his hand. "Jealous?"

She turned, frowning. "What are you talking about?"

Jealous? Please. He can flirt with whoever he wants.

Nathan chuckled. "If not jealous, then definitely angry."

Evelyn sat up, glaring. "Nathan, stop being so full of yourself. I’m just irritated about something else. It has nothing to do with you."

She flopped back down, but a sharp pang twisted in her chest.

Nathan hadn’t moved.

She peeked over her shoulder. "It’s about my father."

His eyes lit up at her attempt to explain. He reached out, twirling a strand of her hair around his finger. "I know. But just so we’re clear—no other woman interests me. Only you."

He’d only entertained Lydia to see Evelyn’s reaction.

And though she’d acted indifferent, he knew better.

She cared.

Evelyn stayed silent, facing away again.

Nathan wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

She stiffened but didn’t pull away.
###Chapter 161

Nathan had no intention of making any advances. He simply wanted to hold Evelyn close as they drifted off to sleep.

"Sleep."

Feeling Nathan's steady breathing against her back, Evelyn gradually relaxed, letting drowsiness claim her.

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn and Nathan descended the stairs together.

Richard had personally prepared breakfast. His smile widened at their arrival. "You're awake. Eat something before you leave."

Evelyn took her seat just as Lydia and Madam Victoria made their grand entrance, both dressed to impress.

"Zoe, did you sleep well last night?" Madam Victoria's voice dripped with false sweetness.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Yes, quite well."

Madam Victoria nudged Lydia forward with a meaningful glance. The younger woman approached Evelyn with practiced grace. "Evelyn, may I sit here?"

"Be my guest."

Lydia settled beside her, adopting a demure tone. "I'm still new to Bassburgh. Grandmother suggested you show me around the city. You wouldn't mind, would you?"

Lydia had initially pinned her hopes on Vivian, but that plan had crumbled. Now, she saw Evelyn as her golden ticket to Nathan's attention.

A man like Nathan—wealthy, powerful, and devastatingly handsome—was rare. Even Madam Victoria approved of him.

Lydia was certain her beauty could steal Nathan away from Evelyn.

Her grandmother's words echoed in her mind: Men don't want equals. They want delicate flowers who know their place.

Hadn't her own uncle proven that? He'd abandoned his strong-willed wife for a docile mistress.

Lydia was confident she could be exactly what Nathan desired.

Richard's expression darkened when Evelyn remained silent. "Evelyn and Nathan have responsibilities. They don't have time for sightseeing."

Madam Victoria interjected, "Nonsense! Surely they can spare a moment for family. Lydia could even accompany Evelyn to work."

The old woman knew exactly what she was doing. Controlling Evelyn was impossible, but Lydia? Lydia was pliable.

If she could orchestrate a romance between Lydia and Nathan, her future would be secure.

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. She saw right through the scheme.

Hypocrisy runs in the family.

"Of course," Evelyn said smoothly. "Though not just anyone can enter Goldmann Corp. If you're truly interested, I have an intern position available."

Nathan's gaze turned glacial. What was she playing at?

Madam Victoria gasped. "How could you demean your cousin like that?"

Evelyn cut her off with a dismissive wave. "She's not a child. Shouldn't she learn to stand on her own? After all, even gold diggers need credentials these days."

Her words were a direct slap to Madam Victoria's outdated beliefs.

The old matriarch had raised her grandson to be useless and her granddaughter to be a trophy wife.

Bringing Lydia to Bassburgh?

It was nothing more than a hunt for wealth.
###Chapter 162

Madam Victoria flushed crimson with embarrassment, her fingers tightening around her purse as she nearly lashed out at Evelyn on the spot.

Meanwhile, Lydia's stomach twisted into knots at the suggestion. Yet she forced a saccharine smile, desperate to ingratiate herself with Nathan. "Evelyn... I'm truly inexperienced. I hope you and your fiancé won't reject me when the time comes."

If Vivian was the picture of hypocrisy, Lydia embodied pure seduction in silk gloves.

Evelyn's lips curved into a feline smile. "I'll be very... thorough."

Lydia's smile froze.

Nathan barely suppressed a chuckle watching his feisty fiancée verbally spar with her cousin. There was something irresistibly charming about his little wildcat sharpening her claws.

As planned, Lydia arrived at Luxe Group headquarters. Her pulse quickened at the sight of the gleaming corporate tower buzzing with activity.

She'd never imagined Nathan's empire would be this vast. The rumors about Bassburgh's most powerful tycoon hadn't been exaggerated.

'Just wait,' she thought, adjusting her blouse. 'Once I'm inside, it's only a matter of time before Mr. Goldmann notices me.'

Evelyn led her to the sixteenth floor. Lydia's eyes darted around the open-plan office. "Evelyn, is your fiancé here today?"

"Not presently." Evelyn arched a brow. "Eager to meet him already?"

Lydia adopted a wounded expression. "No! Please don't misunderstand—"

Evelyn merely smiled.

Gregory emerged from his office, eyeing the newcomer trailing Evelyn. "Who's this?"

"My cousin. Our new intern."

With a wave, Evelyn summoned a female staffer. "Take her to Director Xavier for onboarding."

"Of course, Ms. Vanderbilt." The assistant turned to Lydia. "Right this way, miss."

As Lydia disappeared down the hall, Gregory blinked. "You assigned her to inventory?"

"Should I have her shadow the board instead?" Evelyn's eyes glinted. "If she wants this internship, she'll learn the meaning of hard work."

Gregory scratched his head as Evelyn swept into her office. Something felt deliberately... punitive about this arrangement.

In the executive suite...

Oliver reported the sixteenth floor developments to Nathan, who suddenly burst into laughter mid-sip of coffee.

"Sir...?" Oliver hesitated. 'Did Mr. Goldmann and Ms. Vanderbilt finally...?'

"Problem?" Nathan shot him an amused glance.

"You seem... cheerful today."

Cheerful?

Nathan didn't deny it.

His little wildcat had actually sentenced her scheming cousin to warehouse duty. Clearly, she'd overheard last night's conversation with Lydia.

His phone vibrated—Theodore Goldmann calling.

Meanwhile, on sixteen...

Soul Jewelry Studio's official launch had triggered an avalanche of custom orders. With Zara as the featured designer and limited-time promotional pricing, Evelyn's appointment book overflowed with twenty clients before noon.

Evelyn emerged from a consultation, exchanging pleasantries as she escorted the client to the elevator.

When she returned to her office, she found Nathan lounging in her chair, his tailored suit stretching across broad shoulders as he spun a pen between his fingers.

She paused mid-step. "How industrious of Mr. Goldmann to conduct his business in my office."

"I hear you've condemned your cousin to the stockroom?" His lips twitched.
###Chapter 163

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "If you're feeling sorry for her, perhaps I should assign Lydia to your care."

Nathan's gaze dropped as an amused smirk played on his lips. In one fluid motion, he rose and closed the distance between them. His arm snaked around her waist with practiced ease, spinning her until her back met the solid wood of the office door. "And here I thought you claimed not to be jealous."

Ice flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

She couldn't stomach Lydia's pathetic performance - that exaggerated fragility compared to Vivian's calculated cruelty. Was it truly so wrong to toughen up the spoiled Vanderbilt princess?

With a sharp twist, she broke free from his grasp. "Keep your hands to yourself. Someone might see."

"Let them." His mouth descended toward hers.

Evelyn retaliated with a sharp bite to his lower lip. "Control yourself, Nathan Goldmann!"

Undeterred, Nathan cradled the back of her head, his kiss turning demanding. His tongue traced the seam of her lips until they parted, and Evelyn hated how her body responded - the way her fingers instinctively curled into the fabric of his sleeves.

A low hum escaped her throat as his arms encircled her completely.

It was becoming frighteningly familiar.

His technique had grown alarmingly proficient.

Evelyn felt herself drowning in sensation until his mouth abandoned hers to trail fire down her neck. The sudden chill of exposed skin shocked her back to reality. "You absolute bastard!"

Her knee connected with its target before he could react.

Nathan doubled over with a pained hiss, teeth clenched against the agony radiating through his body. A sheen of sweat broke across his forehead.

"I'm sorry!" Panic laced Evelyn's voice as she reached for him. "I just wanted to— Are you—"

"Trying to castrate me?" Nathan ground out between labored breaths, equal parts furious and impressed.

"You started it!"

"If I truly wanted to force you," he said through gritted teeth, "you wouldn't stand a chance." The sharp inhale through his nose did little to ease the throbbing pain. He'd only meant to tease her, never expecting such violent resistance.

Did his touch truly repulse her so?

Evelyn studied the carpet. She knew avoidance wasn't a permanent solution, no matter how fiercely she resisted.

"I need time," she whispered, teeth worrying her bottom lip.

Nathan straightened with visible effort. "Fine. Consent matters." A muscle twitched in his jaw. "Daisy and the others are accompanying me to the estate tomorrow. Father requested their presence."

He left without another word.

Evelyn collapsed into her chair, limbs suddenly leaden.

Nathan's feelings remained an enigma, as did her own chaotic emotions. Had prolonged exposure to his dangerous charm eroded her defenses?

Perhaps his anger was for the best.

Her fists clenched. Until the Vanderbilt mess was resolved and her mother's company reclaimed, she couldn't afford to drown in Nathan Goldmann's dangerous allure.

Vivian returned home to unsettling news from her mother's frantic whispers—that scheming bitch Evelyn had spent the night with Nathan under their roof.

Her manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms. Thank God she'd stayed elsewhere last night.

If Evelyn had breathed a word about her mother's scandal to Nathan...

The Vanderbilt name couldn't withstand another blow.

"Viv, darling," Laura murmured, "I think Lydia's developed feelings for Nathan." The way the younger Vanderbilt had gazed at him last night—all starry-eyed and breathless—had been painfully obvious.

Vivian's face twisted in disgust. "Lydia? That vapid little social climber? She's delusional if she thinks she's in his league."
###Chapter 164

Laura knew her daughter Vivian was still obsessed with Nathan, so she quickly intervened. "Forget about Nathan for now. Do you really think his opinion matters when you're the rightful heiress of the de Armas?"

Vivian squeezed her mother's hand, a sly smile curving her lips. "You're right, Mom. We need the Lucas family to believe I'm Miranda's daughter without a doubt. But first, I need that little witch Evelyn's hair for the DNA test."

Laura smirked. "That's simple. Lydia is working at ckgold now. We'll use her to get it—Evelyn won’t suspect a thing."

Lydia, who had never done manual labor in her life, was fuming after being assigned to the warehouse as an intern.

This has to be Evelyn’s doing!

Just then, her phone buzzed—Aunt Laura was calling. Without hesitation, she launched into a dramatic rant.

Laura feigned sympathy. "Calm down, Lydia. A little hardship now will pay off later."

Then, with calculated precision, she added, "Besides, if you stay there, you’ll have more chances to run into Nathan."

That was all Lydia needed to hear. "You’re right, Aunt Laura! I’ll prove myself!"

She imagined pouring her heart out to Nathan about how Evelyn had bullied her. Surely, he’d pity her.

Little did she know, Laura was silently mocking her.

Pathetic. As if Nathan would ever fall for a clueless brat like her.

But Lydia’s foolishness was useful. With a few sweet words, Laura convinced her to help.

Getting Evelyn’s hair would be child’s play for her.

Meanwhile, Gregory handed Evelyn a report. "This week’s bookings have exceeded our projections. At this rate, Soul will dominate the industry in under a year."

Evelyn closed the file, her eyes gleaming. "Which means we’ll reclaim Viana Jewelry even sooner."

The space was perfect for expansion. Instead of buying new property, she planned to merge Viana with Soul.

Not only was Viana her mother’s legacy, but its prime location in the commercial golden triangle guaranteed foot traffic—saving them a fortune.

Gregory chuckled at her shrewdness. "The Peacock’s Pride auction alone could buy you multiple floors in the golden triangle."

"That’s not how we spend money," Evelyn countered firmly.

She had three little mouths to feed at home, after all.

Gregory’s expression turned serious. "Zoe, even if your father agrees, the rest of the Vanderbilts won’t surrender Viana easily."

"I know. Madam Victoria is already circling, and Laura..."

Evelyn’s lips thinned. "Laura’s still trying to conceive a son for my father—securing her place in the family."

Outside the door, Lydia froze, her ear pressed against the wood.

A man’s voice echoed faintly. "Laura’s trying for a son?"
###Chapter 165

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "If Laura truly delivers a male heir this time, her position within the Vanderbilt dynasty might shift dramatically."

Lydia's eyes widened in shock. "Aunt Laura is attempting to conceive a son?"

She knew all too well about her grandmother Madam Victoria's blatant preference for grandsons over granddaughters.

Back in Cornelia, her useless brother had always been the golden child while she'd been treated like an afterthought. She'd been forced into household chores since childhood while her brother lounged about.

Only when marriageable age approached had Madam Victoria shown her slight favor - solely because she hoped Lydia would marry into wealth to support her brother.

What her grandmother never realized was that Lydia sought a wealthy match not to fund her brother's lifestyle, but to escape his tyranny.

If Aunt Laura succeeded in bearing a son, perhaps the family's obsessive focus would shift from her brother.

This thought sparked a dangerous hope in Lydia's heart.

The office door swung open abruptly, catching Lydia eavesdropping. She tumbled to the floor at Gregory's feet.

Gregory's brow furrowed as he stared down at her.

Evelyn glanced up from her desk, immediately noticing the intruder. "Lydia? What are you doing outside my door?"

Lydia scrambled up, cheeks flaming. "E-Evelyn! I was just coming to see you. I swear I wasn't eavesdropping intentionally!"

Tears welled in her eyes as Gregory shot Evelyn a questioning look.

With Evelyn's subtle nod, Gregory exited.

Evelyn set down her documents. "What did you need?"

"I...I wanted to ask for guidance. There's so much I don't understand as a first-day intern." Lydia bit her lip. "You don't think I'm bothering you, do you?"

Though Evelyn held no love for the Vanderbilts, she recognized Lydia as another victim of Madam Victoria's indoctrination.

Compared to Vivian, Lydia merely came across as slightly affected rather than genuinely repulsive.

Most importantly, Lydia hadn't yet crossed any lines.

Evelyn rose gracefully. "Why would I think that? You're welcome to seek my guidance - or Director Xavier's - whenever needed."

"Thank you, Evelyn." Lydia hesitated. "May I ask one more thing?"

"Go ahead."

"Do you...hate me?" The question came out barely above a whisper.

Evelyn offered a small smile. "No."

Lydia's face lit up. "That's wonderful—"

Before Evelyn could react, Lydia suddenly embraced her. "I truly want to learn from you, Evelyn. I know I'm foolish, but please don't hold it against me. My family never valued me because I'm female, and I'm terrified of being despised."

As she spoke, Lydia deftly plucked a strand of hair from Evelyn's shoulder, concealing it in her palm.

Evelyn remained silent.

Lydia released her, stepping back with downcast eyes. "Forgive me. I obey Grandmother because I crave her approval. But knowing you don't hate me...it means everything."

With a fragile smile, she added, "I should return to work now."

Evelyn watched Lydia's retreating figure with growing puzzlement.

Had she been too quick to judge all Vanderbilts by the same measure?

Was Lydia truly different from the rest?

Had her own prejudice blinded her?

Meanwhile, at the Laurent estate...

Lucas leaned casually against his study wall, hands in pockets. His mother Lillian had summoned him regarding Vivian.

His expression remained impassive. "Do you honestly believe Vivian is my cousin?"
###Chapter 166

"She's agreed to take a DNA test." Lillian turned to face him. "Once the results come in, you'll have no choice but to accept them."

Lucas shrugged indifferently. Ever since Vivian had publicly berated those children at the Michelin-starred restaurant and thrown coffee in someone's face, his instincts had warned him about her.

His mother had often spoken of his aunt Miranda. Given Miranda's aristocratic upbringing, her daughter wouldn't possibly behave so crudely. But if the DNA results confirmed their relation, he'd have to acknowledge her as his cousin - though that didn't mean he had to like her.

"What did you discover about the designer Zara?"

Lucas's eyes flickered. "She's actually Evelyn Vanderbilt, a luxury jewelry designer. Apparently involved with Mr. Goldmann."

Lillian's expression darkened instantly. "That woman?"

Vivian had mentioned having a stepsister named Evelyn who conspired with Penelope Santiago to frame her. So this was the mastermind behind the online scandal, and she was Nathan Goldmann's woman?

Lillian's face shifted through several emotions as she processed this. Not even the Goldmann family could intimidate the de Armas.

The children woke up unusually early, buzzing with excitement about visiting their grandfather at the Goldmann estate. Caleb even arranged for two days' absence from school with Oliver's help.

Nathan carried Daisy to the car while Liam followed closely behind, carefully carrying both his and Daisy's bags.

After settling Daisy in the backseat, Nathan turned to see Evelyn and Caleb approaching.

Caleb was practically bouncing with excitement - this would be his first visit to the family estate, unlike Liam and Daisy who'd been there before.

Noticing Evelyn's slow pace, Caleb grabbed her hand. "Mommy, hurry up!"

Evelyn resisted internally but couldn't refuse when her children were so eager.

Caleb scrambled into the first car to join Liam and Daisy.

All three children stuck their heads out the window, giggling. "Mommy, you ride with Daddy in the other car!"

Evelyn sighed but complied, sliding into the second car. She put on her sunglasses and shoved both hands deep into her coat pockets.

Nathan sat beside her in silence, his demeanor as unreadable as it had been since last night - that familiar, impenetrable mask back in place.

Evelyn stared out the window, suddenly uncomfortable with this new dynamic between them. But wasn't this arrangement ideal?

They were only together for the children's sake, with no expectations beyond that. In a year, she could...

Her thoughts trailed off as she remembered how naturally the children had bonded with Nathan. The realization gave her pause.

Upon arriving at the estate, the cars stopped before the grand entrance where the butler awaited them.

"Hello, Mr. Chester," Daisy and Liam greeted politely.

The elderly butler smiled warmly, about to respond when he noticed Nathan approaching with a woman and another child.

He did a double take at Liam and Daisy, then realized they were triplets. "Young Master Goldmann," Mr. Chester acknowledged with a respectful nod.

Nathan returned the nod and ushered the children inside.

Evelyn entered the mansion with hands still buried in her pockets, her breath catching at the sight before her. It felt like stepping into another world entirely.

The sheer scale of the mansion, its antique architecture - this was how Bassburgh's elite truly lived.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. stood waiting in the grand hall, his face lighting up as his three grandchildren came running toward him. He crouched with open arms. "There they are - my precious grandchildren!"
###Chapter 167

"Grandpa, did you miss us?" Daisy grinned, her bright eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Every single day," Mr. Goldmann Sr. replied, tapping her nose affectionately. His gaze softened as he looked at the three children before him, warmth radiating from his expression.

For Caleb, it was his first time stepping into the grand estate. His eyes widened as he took in the opulent surroundings. "Grandpa, your house is amazing!"

Mr. Goldmann Sr. chuckled deeply. "This is your home now too, my boy."

A maid escorted Evelyn to her room—a spacious, elegantly decorated space with floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked a breathtaking view. Beyond the glass, a serene man-made pond shimmered under the sunlight, framed by lush woods.

Her phone buzzed. Richard's name flashed on the screen.

She hesitated before answering, stepping closer to the window. "Dad?"

"Evelyn, I was going through some of your mother's belongings recently. I thought you might want to have them. Come by whenever you're free."

Mom’s things?

She had always assumed he'd discarded everything after her passing.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her voice tight. "Okay."

The call ended, and she clutched the phone to her chest, lost in thought. When she turned to leave, she froze.

Nathan stood in the courtyard below, engaged in conversation with a woman.

Who was that?

The woman—short-haired, confident—laughed at something he said, and to Evelyn's surprise, Nathan actually smiled back.

Unlike his usual cold demeanor, he looked... relaxed.

A sharp pang twisted in her chest.

She shouldn’t have believed him when he said there was no one else.

The woman suddenly looked up, spotting Evelyn in the window. She waved cheerfully.

Panicked, Evelyn ducked away before Nathan could follow her gaze.

But he had already seen her.

His lips thinned.

"Mr. Goldmann Sr. wasn’t kidding—you really did bring your lover home!" The woman grinned, nudging Nathan playfully.

"Chloe Lawson," Nathan warned.

Oliver rushed over, pulling his sister back. "Don’t push your luck. If Evelyn gets mad, I’m not saving you."

Chloe rolled her eyes. "Relax, it’s just how we are in the military. No big deal."

Oliver groaned. His sister had spent too much time surrounded by men—she had no sense of boundaries. If she ever got married, her poor husband would probably just become another one of her "buddies."

But Evelyn wasn’t like that.

When they turned back, Nathan was already gone.

Evelyn wandered downstairs, pausing outside the study. Inside, the children’s laughter echoed as Mr. Goldmann Sr. entertained them with a story.

Her heart ached.

They loved the Goldmanns. And Mr. Goldmann Sr. adored them.

If she left after the year was up... it would break their hearts.

But staying meant accepting Nathan—and after what she just saw, could she really trust him?

Lost in thought, she turned—and collided with a solid chest.

Nathan.

Dressed in a simple knitted sweater, he still managed to look effortlessly striking.

No wonder women flocked to him everywhere.

"You saw?" he asked, his voice low.

"Saw what?" she countered, then realized what he meant.

Did he know she’d seen him with that woman?
###Chapter 168

"Even if I did see something, why should I care?" Evelyn shrugged with a forced smile.

Belonging? That word stung more than she expected.

Nathan narrowed his eyes as he walked past her. "Clearly it doesn't bother you." There was no point discussing it further.

Evelyn stood frozen. His words pierced her heart like tiny needles, leaving an uncomfortable ache spreading through her chest.

She clenched her fists. No, she shouldn't care. There was nothing between them anyway.

What she didn't know was that three little pairs of eyes had witnessed everything. The children had officially put their parents' relationship on high alert!

Mr. Goldmann Sr. stood behind them, gently patting their heads.

After Evelyn walked away, Caleb whispered, "Grandpa, what if Mommy never accepts Daddy?"

The elder Goldmann understood the situation perfectly. "Then that's your mother's issue to resolve. She's probably just uncertain."

She was still unsure whether Nathan could be her anchor - insecure about love, marriage, and building a life together.

He didn't know what storms this young woman had weathered.

"I saw Daddy talking to that woman earlier," Liam interjected. "Do you think Mommy saw them and got the wrong idea?"

Mr. Goldmann Sr. paused, then chuckled. "Possibly. But don't worry - Aunt Chloe would never be interested in someone like your father."

The elder Goldmann knew the Lawson siblings well after decades in business. He could read people like open books.

The three Lawson children had grown up in military barracks alongside Nathan. Each possessed unique strengths.

Harrison was impulsive but fiercely loyal - earning the elder Goldmann's trust. Oliver noticed every detail, which was why Nathan had placed him at ckgold.

Chloe, the youngest, was bold and unrestrained. Not even Elder Goldmann could control her, which explained why she remained in special forces.

The children gaped. A woman who wasn't interested in their father? Unheard of!

"I have a plan." Liam's declaration made the others turn.

He stroked his chin thoughtfully. "If this works, Mommy will see how serious Daddy really is."

Mr. Goldmann Sr. raised an eyebrow at the child's grown-up mannerisms. "What brilliant scheme could a little boy devise?"

Caleb frowned. "But it might hurt Daddy."

The next morning...

Evelyn descended the stairs bleary-eyed after a restless night. She found Mr. Goldmann Sr., Daisy and Caleb already at breakfast.

"Sorry I overslept." She flushed at the breach of etiquette.

The elder Goldmann waved it off. "New environments disrupt sleep patterns. Join us."

As she sat, Evelyn noticed two absences. "Where's Liam?"

"Mommy, he left early with Daddy and Aunt Chloe," Caleb answered.

At Chloe's name, Evelyn's expression flickered.

Daisy shot a glance at Mr. Goldmann Sr.

The patriarch smiled reassuringly. "Evelyn, you needn't worry about Nathan. Chloe is Oliver's sister - they have an older brother Harrison. All three grew up with Nathan in the special forces."
###Chapter 169

Evelyn hesitated but forced a polite smile. "I wasn't concerned."

"I just wanted to reassure you. Chloe has no interest in Nathan. You'll understand once you spend time with her."

Caleb chimed in, "Mommy, Aunt Chloe is really kind. She's just... energetic and speaks her mind."

Evelyn maintained her smile. Any further comment would reveal unnecessary jealousy. She refused to feel jealous over Nathan!

Though she might feel slighted that another woman had already won over her three children.

Daisy leaned close to Caleb and whispered, "Does Mommy look upset to you?"

Caleb gave a subtle nod.

Suddenly, Chloe burst through the door, breathless. "Oh no, this is bad!"

She leaned heavily against the doorframe, panting.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. stood immediately. "What happened? Weren't you out with Nathan and Liam?"

Chloe waved her hands frantically. "Liam wanted to buy gifts for his siblings, so we went shopping. But now he's disappeared! Nathan and I split up to search, and now I can't find either of them!"

Evelyn shot to her feet, face pale. "Liam is missing?"

Chloe stumbled forward, nearly collapsing. "I'm so sorry! This is all my fault!"

Mr. Goldmann Sr. cleared his throat sternly. "Enough. Mobilize everyone to search. This town may be small, but with limited surveillance, it's more challenging than the city."

"Sir, I'll find them. If I fail, you can have my head!" Chloe, genuinely terrified of the consequences, rushed out immediately.

Evelyn clenched her fists. 'Liam!'

She left without breakfast, her stomach in knots.

Caleb and Daisy exchanged knowing looks. They understood their brother's plan, but neither their parents nor Aunt Chloe did.

"Don't panic," Mr. Goldmann Sr. said calmly. "Given Liam's scheme and with my assistance, he won't truly be lost."

His expression darkened as he spoke.

He hadn't anticipated his five-year-old grandson concocting such a dangerous plan.

Though risky, the boy's cunning reminded him of Theodore Goldmann. In temperament, Liam resembled the Goldmann patriarch more than Nathan ever had. The bloodline showed true.

Evelyn and Chloe combed the marketplace separately following Chloe's directions.

Evelyn questioned a shopkeeper who recognized Chloe. He confirmed seeing Nathan and Liam but couldn't recall their direction.

Evelyn's composure shattered. The thought of losing Liam terrified her. This was her fault for oversleeping. What if something happened to him? He held half her heart.

"Stay calm," Chloe said between phone calls. "I've alerted my brother. We'll find them." Evelyn knew she could only rely on herself now.
###Chapter 170

Evelyn's phone!

She had almost forgotten about that. Grabbing her device, she immediately dialed Nathan's number, but the call failed to connect.

Waylon was probably wearing his smartwatch. With trembling fingers, she tried his contact next, but again - nothing.

Panic clawed at her throat. Had something terrible happened to them?

"Oliver's here!" Chloe's voice cut through her thoughts just as the personal assistant and several security personnel appeared.

"Where are Mr. Goldmann and Liam?" Evelyn demanded, her voice sharper than intended.

"I take full responsibility," Chloe admitted, her military-trained posture rigid with tension. "Liam vanished suddenly. Mr. Goldmann and I split up to search, but then I lost contact with both of them."

This marked Chloe's first major failure. Despite her extensive knowledge of the area's terrain, she'd managed to lose a child right under her nose - an unforgivable lapse for someone of her training.

"If Nathan went searching for Liam, they might be in the wilderness," Evelyn reasoned aloud, her mind racing. Kidnappers wouldn't stay in crowded areas; they'd head somewhere isolated.

"Then what are we waiting for? Move out!" Chloe didn't wait for Oliver's orders before sprinting toward the tree line.

If she failed this mission, she might as well say goodbye to her military career.

At the forest's edge...

Liam darted between the trees, peeking out from behind a massive oak. He knew his grandfather's security detail was tracking him, so safety wasn't his primary concern.

Guilt twisted in his stomach about worrying his father, but this was the only way to test whether his mother truly cared about Nathan!

"Liam!"

Hearing Nathan's voice, Liam pressed himself against the rough bark, holding his breath.

Nathan had followed suspicious figures heading this direction - he needed to investigate.

Who were these people?

If they meant harm to his son, they'd regret ever being born.

Just as Liam prepared to spring his trap, a terrifying sound froze him in place.

Slowly turning, his blood ran cold at the sight of a coiled viper mere feet away, its forked tongue flicking the air.

He edged backward, but the snake reared up, ready to strike.

"Ah!" Liam's foot caught on a gnarled root as he tried to flee. The world tilted as he fell, his terrified eyes watching the serpent launch toward him.

Snatching up a fallen branch, he saw a blur of movement as Nathan threw himself between them. The viper's fangs sank deep into his forearm.

With a snarl, Nathan grabbed the snake and hurled it into the underbrush. Drawing a knife from his boot, he made quick work of the reptile, its death throes stilling within seconds.

"Daddy?" Liam stared in shock from the forest floor.

Attempting to stand, his legs buckled from fear. The sudden movement sent him tumbling down the steep incline - yet he felt no impact.

Opening his eyes, he realized Nathan had wrapped himself around Liam like a human shield.

Nathan's head had struck a tree during their fall. Blood oozed from the snakebite on his arm, and thorny vines had shredded his once-pristine shirt.

Despite his injuries, he managed a weak smile at seeing Liam unharmed. "Thank... God... you're... safe..."

"DADDY!"

"Mr. Goldmann! Liam!"

At the town hospital...

When Oliver's call came through, Evelyn raced to find Liam sitting on a waiting room bench. The boy looked utterly wrecked - clothes torn, face smeared with dirt, his small frame shaking with residual fear.
###Chapter 171

Evelyn rushed to Liam's side, her knees buckling as she collapsed before him. A storm of emotions swirled in her chest—fear, confusion, something deeper she couldn't name. "Where were you, Liam? How did this happen?"

"I'm sorry, Mommy." Liam's voice was eerily calm, sending chills down Evelyn's spine. "It's my fault Daddy got hurt."

Evelyn froze, her breath catching. "What... what happened to him?"

Just then, the doctor emerged from the private ward. "Family of Nathan Goldmann?"

Evelyn rose on unsteady legs.

Oliver stepped forward smoothly. "We're his family. Could you update us on his condition?"

The doctor adjusted his glasses, expression grave. "We've treated his wounds and administered antivenom. Fortunately, the snake's venom wasn't lethal. Two days of observation should suffice."

'A snake bite?'

Evelyn's knuckles whitened as she clenched her fists, her complexion turning ashen.

"Daddy got bitten protecting me." Liam's small voice trembled. "He pushed me away and took the bite himself. Then we... we fell down the hill together."

Though Liam had orchestrated the dangerous situation, he never expected his father to shield him so completely—throwing himself between his son and danger without hesitation.

Liam lifted tear-filled eyes to Evelyn. The defiance usually present had melted away. "Mommy, I didn't like Daddy before... but he saved me. Is he going to die because of me?"

Evelyn pulled him into a tight embrace. The boy who rarely cried now shook silently against her shoulder.

The hospital doors burst open as Mr. Goldmann Sr. arrived with Caleb and Daisy in tow. The patriarch's face drained of color upon hearing the news.

"I'm sorry, Grandpa..." Liam whispered.

The elder Goldmann placed a weathered hand on Liam's head. "Accidents happen. What matters is you're safe."

Nathan drifted in and out of consciousness until full darkness fell. When he finally awoke, he found Evelyn slumped asleep beside his bed.

He shifted carefully, wincing at the movement. The rustling sheets startled Evelyn awake.

"You're awake." Her voice was rough with sleep.

"Hmm. Where's Liam?" Nathan's first concern was for his son.

Evelyn looked down. "He's fine. Thank you... for saving him."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Thank me? Am I just some stranger to you? Or his father?"

"I—"

"Never mind." Nathan cut her off sharply. "I won't hear anything pleasant from you anyway. Save your breath."

Evelyn bit her lip, then said quietly, "I know you're his father. And I see now... how much you care for him."

"And have you noticed how I feel about you?" Nathan countered.

Evelyn clenched her jaw at his provoking tone. "I'm being serious. Don't change the subject."

"Then don't talk about anything else." Nathan turned away, presenting his back to her.

Evelyn gaped at his audacity.

'Since when did Nathan become so infuriatingly arrogant?'

She stood abruptly. "Nathan Goldmann, you—"

"I'm hungry."

The non sequitur caught her off guard. Remembering he hadn't eaten, she moved to the bedside tray. Picking it up, she approached the stubborn man's turned back. "Here. Eat."
###Chapter 172

Nathan sat up slowly, his piercing gaze locking onto hers as he demanded, "Feed me."

In the past, Evelyn would have slammed the tray down and snapped, "Do it yourself!"

But this time was different.

She sat beside the bed without protest, lifting the spoon to his lips. His intense stare made her cheeks burn, so she muttered, "Don't get the wrong idea. I'm only doing this for Liam."

Nathan swallowed obediently, his lips curling into a smug smirk as he studied her.

For the first time, he thought being injured wasn’t so bad.

Once he finished, Evelyn set the tray aside. Nathan lounged against the pillows, watching her linger. "Staying to keep me company?"

She scoffed. "Do I look like I want to be here?" If he hadn’t gotten hurt saving Liam, she’d have been long gone.

Nathan’s smirk deepened. He tugged the blanket aside, patting the empty space next to him. "I’ll reluctantly lend you half the bed tonight."

Evelyn gaped at him.

He feigned innocence. "I’m injured. Helpless. You could do anything to me, and I couldn’t stop you."

She clenched her fists.

Why didn’t that damn snake finish him off?

Refusing to humor him, she stayed planted in her seat. Nathan didn’t push it, rolling onto his side to sleep.

Evelyn leaned against the wall, staring out the window. It looked like she’d be spending the night here. The chill made her shiver, so she curled up on the nearby sofa instead.

Exhaustion from the previous sleepless night dragged her under quickly.

Nathan cracked an eye open, turning to study her.

She looked small, vulnerable.

He sighed.

Was he really this bad at winning her over? Or was she just stubborn?

Maybe he needed to try harder.

Seeing her shiver again, he pushed himself up, crossed the room, and lifted her effortlessly.

She didn’t stir as he tucked her into the bed beside him, wrapping the blanket snugly around her.

Nathan settled beside her, only to freeze when she instinctively curled into his chest, her warmth seeping into him.

His jaw tightened.

This woman was going to be the death of him.

—

The next morning, Evelyn woke to the sound of hushed whispers.

She blinked open her eyes—only to find Mr. Goldmann Sr., Oliver, and the triplets staring at her with wide, curious eyes.

Her heart stopped.

She was in Nathan’s bed.

And his arm was draped possessively over her.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. chuckled. "Sleep in, dear. We’ll take the kids out."

"Bye, Mommy!" the triplets chimed before scampering off.

Oliver followed, barely suppressing a grin.

Evelyn’s face burned.

Then—

"NATHAN GOLDMANN, YOU BASTARD!"

—

Lunch was a grand affair the day Nathan was discharged.

Oliver and his sister, Chloe, joined the celebration.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. smiled warmly at Evelyn. "Thank you for taking care of Nathan, Zoe."

She stiffened before forcing a polite smile. "It was nothing, sir."

Chloe, mouth full, grinned. "Evelyn, shouldn’t you call him 'Dad' by now?"

Oliver pinched her. "Can’t even food shut you up?"

Evelyn’s ears turned red.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. waved it off. "It’ll happen when it happens."

Chloe burst out laughing. "Wow, the great Nathan Goldmann can’t even win over his own wife? Pathetic."

Nathan shot her a glare.

If Mr. Goldmann Sr. hadn’t treated Chloe like family, she’d have been thrown out right then.
###Chapter 173

Nathan's expression was grave.

Oliver gave Chloe another sharp pinch and hissed through clenched teeth, "Eat."

Chloe suddenly remembered something and turned to Evelyn with excitement. "Madam, allow me to introduce myself properly. I'm Chloe Lawson, this idiot's younger sister. Mr. Goldmann has always been like an older brother to us—our families are very close. Please don’t misunderstand our relationship!"

Evelyn smiled faintly.

Chloe’s personality was undeniably fiery, and she certainly didn’t hold back her words.

Evelyn glanced at Oliver. "So, you have a sister too?"

Oliver sighed in exasperation. "She’s been stationed with the military all this time. The moment she heard Nathan had brought you home, she sneaked out just to see you."

Chloe scowled. "Excuse me? I had official leave approved by my commanding officer!"

Oliver shot her a look. "Only because of his friendship with our eldest brother."

Daisy giggled. "Aunt Chloe, why are your and Uncle Oliver’s names so unusual?"

Chloe threw an arm around Oliver’s shoulders and grinned. "Blame our parents. Our eldest brother got the dignified name—Harrison. I’m just grateful they didn’t name me 'Sugar' or 'Sweetie' for being so adorable."

Caleb and Daisy stifled their laughter.

Evelyn raised a brow at Oliver. "So, does that mean Oliver is—"

Nathan cut in smoothly, "Because he was an odd child."

A burst of laughter erupted around the table.

Oliver shoved Chloe’s arm away, his face flushed with embarrassment. "Fine, you win. You’re clearly the better conversationalist. At least show some respect in front of Mr. Goldmann Sr., will you?"

Can’t you spare me some dignity? Must you always expose my past like this?

Mr. Goldmann Sr. didn’t mind the playful banter. The lively atmosphere only made the gathering more enjoyable.

After the meal, they returned to the royal capital of Bassburgh.

Evelyn gazed out the car window. They had originally planned to stay only two days, but Nathan’s injury had extended their visit by another day.

Yet, in those three days, she had discovered something unexpected—despite not being blood-related, this family had welcomed her with warmth and laughter. Meanwhile, her own flesh and blood schemed against one another.

"What’s on your mind?" Nathan reached out, his fingers threading through her silken hair. The soft strands slipped through his grasp, sending a faint tingle across his skin.

Evelyn turned to meet his gaze but quickly averted her eyes. "Nothing. It’s just… your family seems very close with Oliver and Chloe."

Nathan’s lips curved slightly. "Their parents worked for my grandfather. After they passed away in an accident, he took them in and raised them."

Evelyn stiffened, startled by the revelation. She hadn’t known Oliver and Chloe carried such a history.

Nathan leaned back, his tone matter-of-fact. "Harrison, the eldest, serves as my grandfather’s personal guard. Oliver is meticulous—annoyingly talkative, but efficient. That’s why I keep him around."

He smirked. "As for Chloe, she’s too restless for desk work. Prefers running wild with the troops."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Nathan… I’ve always wondered. What kind of family are the Goldmanns?"

Many assumed the Goldmanns rivaled the Bouchers in status and influence. But unlike the Bouchers—a noble lineage—the Goldmanns had risen from obscurity.

How had they achieved such power through mere business dealings?

Nathan studied her briefly before speaking. "You’ll learn in time. For now, know this—I’ll always ensure your safety and the children’s."

Evelyn fell silent, absorbing his words without further comment.
###Chapter 174

The peaceful atmosphere in the car was abruptly shattered by the ringing of Evelyn's phone. The caller ID flashed Gregory Fannon's name.

Evelyn's expression darkened the moment she answered.

"Uncle Gregory..."

She stepped off the elevator on the 16th floor and found Gregory deep in discussion with several staff members.

He paused mid-sentence when he heard her voice, excusing himself to approach her. "You're back."

"What's going on?" Evelyn's tone was sharp. How had things escalated so quickly in just three days?

Gregory's face was grim. "I don't know the full details either. It's the Laurent family. Aside from Taylor Jewelry, they've pressured all our suppliers into cutting off our mineral raw material shipments."

"The Laurent family?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened.

Was this because of Vivian?

She had assumed Vivian would stay quiet after everything that had happened. But now, with the backing of the Laurents, she was stirring up trouble again?

"Zoe, our current stock of raw materials won't last more than a week. If we don't secure new suppliers, our custom orders will be delayed."

Gregory hadn't expected the Laurents to retaliate so harshly over Vivian. The only reason they dared to disregard Nova was because of Madam Lillian de Arma.

"Our clients won't face delays."

Evelyn crossed her arms, her voice icy. "We still have a week. If our suppliers are breaching contracts under pressure from the Laurents, then we'll demand compensation for their breach."

Soul Jewelry Studio might be new, but that didn’t mean they would bow to intimidation.

Meanwhile, at the Goldmann mansion...

Nathan’s eyes turned glacial at Oliver’s report. "The Laurents are targeting Soul Jewelry Studio?"

Oliver nodded. "It’s because of Vivian. She’s dating Lucas Laurent now, isn’t she?"

Nathan’s expression darkened at the mention of her name.

The memory of how she had deceived him and stolen Evelyn’s identity six years ago still made his blood boil.

His fingers clenched, knuckles cracking under the pressure. "If the Laurents want to play dirty with Zoe, then let’s see how Lillian reacts when she finds out Zoe is her niece."

Even if the de Armas didn’t value Evelyn, the Goldmanns did.

His woman didn’t need their approval.

Since Lillian dared to target Evelyn, he wouldn’t hesitate to retaliate.

At Millennial Gemstone Inc....

"You must be joking! Double the compensation for breach of contract?"

A furious voice erupted from the chairman’s office. The middle-aged man slammed the contract onto the table. "A small company like yours dares to make such demands? We agreed to work with you out of goodwill, and now you have the audacity to demand penalties?"

Gregory’s eyes burned with anger. "What do you mean, Mr. Peterson? The contract clearly states that breach of contract results in double compensation. You were the ones who violated it first!"

Mr. Peterson scoffed. "That’s not our problem. You offended the Laurents. Take it up with them if you dare."

"You—"

Gregory was about to snap back when Evelyn, lounging on the sofa with her sunglasses perched on her nose, finally spoke.

Her lips curled into a dangerous smile. "It seems I overestimated Millennial Gemstone’s professionalism, Mr. Peterson. If you refuse to honor the contract terms, then we’ll settle this in court."

She rose gracefully, arms crossed. "Shall we?"
###Chapter 175

"Since we're already here, let's expose Millennial Gemstone for the frauds they are - a company that shamelessly breaches contracts and refuses to pay compensation."

Seeing Evelyn's determination to escalate the situation, Mr. Peterson paled. He scrambled to placate her. "Now, now, Miss Vanderbilt. We're all professionals here. Surely we can settle this amicably? Double compensation is quite—"

"I said double compensation," Evelyn cut in icily, adjusting her designer sunglasses. "Not a penny less."

Millennial Gemstone had dared renege on their agreement because they had the Laurent family's backing. Mr. Peterson had assumed Soul Jewelry, being a new market entrant, would be easy to intimidate.

He never expected this immaculately dressed woman to be his undoing.

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he blustered, "Taking us to court won't guarantee you victory. Cross our company, and you'll regret it."

"Is that so?" Evelyn's red lips curved into a dangerous smile. She twirled her sunglasses between manicured fingers. "We'll see who regrets this, Mr. Peterson."

With that, she strode out with Gregory in tow.

The moment the door closed, Mr. Peterson collapsed into his leather chair, mopping his brow. "Just some upstart jewelry studio," he muttered. "What can they possibly do?"

His answer came sooner than expected.

Within the hour, his secretary burst in, face ashen. "Sir! There's—"

She was shoved aside by black-suited security. Kyle entered with a sharply dressed lawyer in tow.

Mr. Peterson shot to his feet, knocking over his coffee.

The lawyer adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and placed a business card on the mahogany desk. Donovan Golding, Esq. of Royal Legal Firm.

Mr. Peterson's hands trembled. Royal Legal Firm? The same firm that represented Edmund Lincoln?

Donovan slapped down a summons. "My client, Soul Jewelry Studio, has instructed me to handle this breach of contract. I suggest you reconsider your position carefully, Mr. Peterson."

The unspoken message was clear: fight this, and Millennial Gemstone would lose spectacularly in court.

No one won against Royal Legal Firm's attorneys.

Mr. Peterson slumped into his chair, sweat soaking his collar. How had a small jewelry studio secured Edmund Lincoln's lawyer?

He was utterly screwed.

Meanwhile, in a sleek black Bentley...

"I can't believe their audacity!" Gregory gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white. "Without Edmund Lincoln's intervention, they'd have walked all over us."

Evelyn examined her flawless manicure. "The Laurent family promised to cover their losses, didn't they? That's the only reason Millennial Gemstone dared breach contract."

No established company would risk their reputation otherwise. The Laurents had clearly bankrolled this move, betting Soul Jewelry wouldn't challenge them.

Her phone rang.

Evelyn smirked at the caller ID. "Mr. Peterson. What a surprise."

"Ms. Vanderbilt," came the strained voice. "Perhaps we can...renegotiate the compensation? No need for unpleasant courtroom drama."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as cut glass. "Oh, but we're quite looking forward to our day in court. You made your choice when you breached contract. Now face the consequences."

She ended the call with a satisfied click. Let them squirm. Soul Jewelry wasn't some helpless startup they could bully.

Not when Evelyn Vanderbilt played to win.
###Chapter 176

"Ms. Vanderbilt, Ms.—"

Evelyn ended the call without hesitation.

Gregory chuckled. "You're becoming more like your mother every day."

She refused to be anyone's pawn.

At the Laurent Family Mansion

"Goldmann, have you lost your mind?!"

Lillian's sharp gaze locked onto Nathan. He had just used Evelyn to threaten her. Was this an open challenge to the Laurents—and the de Armas?

Nathan crossed his legs, leaning back with effortless arrogance. "If you insist on targeting my fiancée, the Goldmanns will gladly play along."

Lillian's expression darkened. "For a woman? Have the Goldmanns gone mad?"

"She is a Goldmann now," Nathan countered, lifting his teacup with deliberate calm. "And we protect what's ours. Surely your father remembers how... reasonable we can be?"

A shadow flickered across Lillian's face.

The Goldmanns were anything but reasonable. Especially Theodore—Nathan's grandfather—whose hands were stained with the blood of nobles who'd dared oppose him. To the aristocracy, the Goldmanns were ruthless.

Nathan set down his cup, adjusting his cufflinks as he stood. "Mrs. Laurent, if you continue this vendetta against Evelyn, I hope you won’t regret it when the truth surfaces."

He strode out without another word.

Lillian frowned. What truth?

Her thoughts shattered when Mr. Peterson called. His panicked voice delivered a bombshell.

"What did you say? Edmund has been helping her?"

"Mrs. Laurent, you have to intervene! I breached my contract on your orders, but Ms. Vanderbilt won’t let this slide—and neither will Mr. Lincoln! I’m trapped!"

Lillian’s grip tightened on her phone. Edmund Lincoln... Why would a man like him side with that girl?

Nathan exited the mansion, his bodyguards flanking him, just as Vivian returned. Spotting him, her pulse quickened.

"Nathan!" She flashed a hopeful smile. "Did you come to see me?"

Oliver barely suppressed an eye-roll. Delusional.

Nathan’s silence made Vivian’s heart flutter. He still cared.

Then she remembered the auction—how he’d seen her with Lucas. "Nathan, don’t misunderstand. I’m just reconnecting with family. Lucas is only my cousin."

She gazed up, earnest. "I know I’m not worthy of you yet, but I’ll prove myself. One day—"

"Do you truly believe you’re a de Arma?" Nathan’s icy tone sliced through her words.

Vivian paled. "Nathan, I—"

His lips curled in derision. "Lucas’s cousin is merely Lillian’s niece. You’re nothing to the de Armas."
###Chapter 177

Vivian gasped.

"Evelyn is a de Arma? Shouldn't that be Miranda?"

"That's why the Laurent family is helping Vivian. She pretended to be Miranda and went to them. That woman has no shame."

"Nathan, I—"

"Your mother was Miranda de Armas?" Nathan's icy stare cut through her like a blade, sending chills down her spine.

Vivian's legs nearly buckled beneath her.

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "I distinctly recall Miranda being Evelyn's mother. Isn't yours Laura? Pathetic. You’re still grasping for things that aren’t yours."

Hadn’t she already stolen Evelyn’s identity once before?

Now she was trying the same trick again. Nathan was disgusted—relieved he had seen through her deception before it was too late. The thought of being fooled by her made his skin crawl.

Vivian reached out, desperate. "Nathan, please—"

He stepped back as if she were poison. "Don’t touch me with those filthy hands. You’ll never measure up to Evelyn. Not in this lifetime."

Humiliation burned through Vivian. She trembled violently, teeth sinking into her lip hard enough to draw blood.

"Stealing what isn’t yours won’t change anything. Sooner or later, you’ll lose it all."

Nathan turned and walked away without a second glance.

Vivian collapsed to the floor, her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

Hatred burned in her eyes. "Evelyn… I’ll make sure you disappear for good."

That afternoon…

Soul Studio was locked in a legal battle with Millennial Gemstone.

Twitter exploded with outrage after Millennial Gemstone refused to pay the penalty fees for breaching their contract.

Netizens mocked them relentlessly, branding them as arrogant corporate bullies who underestimated a rising competitor.

A lawyer’s letter arrived swiftly—demanding double the compensation outlined in the contract, payable within three days.

The contract was posted online, undeniable proof of their breach. Every signature, every stamp—authentic.

Millennial Gemstone had agreed to the terms, yet now they were trying to weasel out. The internet crowned their CEO "Debtor Peterson" overnight.

The backlash forced Millennial Gemstone to issue a public apology.

Though the Laurents had pressured suppliers to cut ties with Soul Studio, none dared follow Millennial Gemstone’s lead—not after seeing the consequences.

Hiring the elite attorneys from Royal Legal Firm proved one thing: Soul Studio had powerful backing.

Gregory entered the office with a satisfied smile. "Zoe, the other suppliers are back on board. Using Millennial Gemstone as an example worked perfectly."

No need to chase them down one by one. A single demonstration was enough to make them fall in line.

Evelyn smiled but couldn’t shake her curiosity. "Uncle Gregory… who exactly is Uncle Edmund?"

She had asked him for legal help, but the connections he provided were far beyond what she expected—heavyweights in the legal world.
###Chapter 178

Evelyn wasn't intimidated by the Laurent family. Someone had to be held accountable, but she never anticipated...

That Edmund would involve the royal lawyer.

Still, Mr. Peterson would likely notify the Laurent family. Would Lucas become their next target?

Gregory hesitated before answering slowly. "I'm not certain either. I only know he has a complicated background."

Evelyn suddenly asked, "Do you know my mother's identity then?"

Gregory and Edmund both knew her mother. Edmund was aware her mother was a de Arma, but what about Gregory?

Gregory lowered his gaze and shook his head. "I don't know your mother's past. She never spoke of her family."

Evelyn wanted to say more when her phone buzzed with a text.

It was from Nathan!

She headed to his office. Just as she reached for the door handle, a woman's voice stopped her cold.

Was that... Lydia?

"Nathan, Evelyn clearly dislikes me. She makes me do all the heavy lifting. Can I transfer here instead?"

Evelyn's fingers froze on the door handle, every word crystal clear.

She'd overestimated Lydia. The girl was just like all the others.

Nathan's voice cut through the silence. "Why would Evelyn dislike you?"

"I don't know! Grandmother says she's temperamental and lacks proper manners. Grandmother worries she'll anger you too. She probably doesn't obey your every word, does she? But I would—"

The office door swung open.

Lydia whirled around, her face draining of color when she saw Evelyn. Guilt made her unable to meet Evelyn's piercing gaze.

Evelyn strode to the desk, planting her palms firmly on its surface. "You summoned me here to witness this performance?"

Nathan's lips curved. "What do you think of the show?"

Lydia stammered, "Evelyn, that's not what I meant! Nathan, please—"

"Why should I help you?" Nathan's voice turned glacial. "Who exactly do you think you are to me?"

Lydia trembled but maintained her innocent facade.

"Besides," Nathan continued smoothly, "Evelyn and I are deeply in love."

He pulled Evelyn into his arms before she could react, pressing her head against his shoulder.

To any observer, they appeared the picture of perfect devotion!

Lydia bit her lip, tears welling in her eyes.

"I adore this fiery temperament of hers. It's utterly captivating." Nathan tightened his embrace.

Evelyn found herself speechless.

Watching Lydia flee in tears, she looked like nothing more than a pathetic clown.

"Mr. Goldmann," Evelyn gritted out, "release me now."

The man seemed deaf to her demand, tilting her chin up instead. "You heard. Your cousin was being rather... dishonest."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she pushed away slightly. "Don't men prefer demure women?"

"Who told you that?" Nathan's eyes narrowed as he pulled her closer. "I prefer women exactly like you."

"Nathan, let me go!"

"No."
###Chapter 179

Evelyn shoved Nathan's face away as he leaned in closer, his body pressed against hers like adhesive.

Oliver swung the door open and froze at the intimate scene before him.

Both Evelyn and Nathan turned their heads toward the interruption.

The atmosphere turned glacial.

Oliver immediately retreated, slamming the door shut behind him.

Evelyn pushed Nathan away with practiced ease. "Enough of this show. I'm leaving."

"Wait." Nathan caught her wrist.

She turned back, eyebrows raised, only to see his knowing smirk.

"Don't you want to know about the Laurent family?" he purred.

Evelyn stiffened. The Laurents? Was this why he'd summoned her?

"You've discovered it already?" Her gaze dropped to the floor. She could never hide anything from him.

"Mrs. Laurent is your aunt - Lillian de Arma, of the prestigious de Arma lineage," Nathan revealed.

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Lillian de Arma. Her mother's sister.

She'd only recently learned about her mother's noble heritage, but this familial connection shocked her.

All this time, Mrs. Laurent had been her blood relative!

Yet she'd been helping Vivian all along.

Nathan rose and stalked toward her, caging her against the desk. "Vivian stole your identity. She's been pretending to be Miranda de Arma's daughter."

Evelyn's head snapped up in shock. "How could the Laurents not see through her lies until now?"

A storm of emotions raged within her.

Nathan traced her lips with his thumb. "Zoe, if it bothers you, I can help reclaim what's rightfully yours."

Evelyn hesitated, then gave a small smile at his serious expression. "Thank you, Nathan, but Vivian is my problem to handle."

His eyes narrowed dangerously. "You think I'm incapable?"

"I never said that."

Nathan's expression turned wounded. "Then why won't you lean on me, just this once?"

He buried his face in the crook of her neck.

Evelyn froze. The ruthless CEO was showing vulnerability? No woman could resist that.

Clearing her throat, she averted her gaze. "Fine. Help if you must."

The next afternoon, at the Siberian Prince Hotel's exclusive tearoom...

Madam Nora and Evelyn enjoyed an elegant high tea service in a private salon.

"I heard the Laurents are targeting your jewelry studio. What did you do to provoke them?" Madam Nora inquired.

Evelyn set down her bone china cup gracefully. "Provoke is too strong a word. Our designs coincidentally matched at the auction. Since the Laurents back Vivian, they're trying to eliminate competition."

Madam Nora's interest visibly piqued. "Do tell me more about these identical designs."

Seeing no reason for secrecy, Evelyn recounted the entire story.

Madam Nora's teacup clattered against its saucer. "Vivian's design was yours too?"

"I gave it to her, yes."

The older woman frowned in confusion. "What's between you two?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "She's my stepsister. She and her mother tried framing me. I'm simply returning the favor."

She traced the rim of her cup. "I was meant to be their victim, not Penelope Santiago. Had I not been careful, it would be my reputation in ruins instead."
###Chapter 180

Madam Nora nodded thoughtfully. She had heard rumors about Penelope's scandal, but never imagined it was orchestrated by Vivian.

"Tsk," Madam Nora clicked her tongue disapprovingly. "The Laurent family has truly lost their senses, protecting a thief who bullies you. Lillian's judgment worsens with age!"

Evelyn remained silent.

The Laurents were aiding Vivian because she'd fabricated her identity.

Never had Evelyn anticipated Vivian would dare claim to be Miranda's daughter. Clearly, she believed Richard remained unaware of her true parentage.

"But fret not," Madam Nora assured, patting Evelyn's hand. "Taylor Jewelry values true talent above all. Even if the Laurents demanded it, I wouldn't comply."

Relief washed over Evelyn. Other jewelry houses might cower before the Laurent family's influence, but Taylor stood firm.

Evelyn's lips curved into a grateful smile. "Madam, your integrity sets you apart from the rest."

After their afternoon tea, they departed the private suite together.

Evelyn guided Madam Nora's wheelchair through the elegant corridors, engaged in pleasant conversation, trailed by discreet attendants and security.

Then Evelyn's expression darkened as Vivian came into view.

Vivian halted abruptly, shock flashing across her features. "You?" Her gaze darted to the elderly woman in the wheelchair. The same woman who'd once ejected her from Taylor's flagship store.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "This establishment doesn't belong to you. My presence here is none of your concern."

Vivian trembled with suppressed rage before remembering her advantage. She crossed her arms with a venomous smirk. "Desperate, aren't you? Clinging to Taylor now that your pathetic little company crumbles."

She turned to Madam Nora with false sweetness. "Old woman, aren't you afraid of Laurent retaliation for harboring this trash?"

Vivian's eyes glittered maliciously, already envisioning Evelyn's complete social annihilation when no one dared associate with her.

A female bodyguard stepped forward, voice icy. "Mind your tongue."

Madam Nora raised a restraining hand, studying Vivian with amused disdain. "Ah, I recognize you. The uncouth creature who caused that disgraceful scene at our Fifth Avenue location."

"Uncouth?!" Vivian's face flushed crimson. How dare this relic insult her!

"The Laurents must be blind indeed," Madam Nora continued conversationally, "to champion such an ill-mannered gutter rat."

Evelyn couldn't suppress a laugh.

"Pay her no mind, Madam," Evelyn said lightly. "Poor upbringing explains the vulgar display."

Vivian's nails dug into her palms. "You'll regret this! Neither Nathan nor this decrepit hag can protect you forever!"

Before Evelyn could respond, Madam Nora chuckled. "Ten Laurents couldn't make me blink, child. Fetch Lillian yourself—let's see what she dares do to me."

Vivian gaped. Was this senile woman truly so fearless?

"Madam speaks truth," Evelyn purred, crimson lips curling. "I'm curious what threats the Laurents have prepared. Why not take me to them now?"

Vivian paled, fists clenched so tightly her knuckles whitened.
###Chapter 181

"What the hell? Who is this old hag?"

A man approached leisurely. "What's going on here?"

Vivian turned and saw Lucas Laurent standing there. She rushed toward him, her voice trembling with feigned distress. "Lucas, I don’t know what’s happening! They’re deliberately targeting me!"

Madam Nora let out a dry chuckle. "Oh? Mr. Laurent, is she related to you? I wasn’t aware."

Vivian bit her lip, avoiding Evelyn’s piercing gaze. She was gambling on the fact that Evelyn didn’t know about the de Armas family.

Lucas stepped forward, his tone measured. "Madam Nora, my apologies. If my cousin has offended you, I hope you can forgive her."

Madam Nora smirked. "Interesting. She just swore the Laurent family would make me regret crossing her. Should I be worried?"

Lucas’s expression darkened as he turned his icy stare toward Vivian.

She lowered her head, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip.

'How did this happen? If Lucas is treating this old woman with such respect, doesn’t that mean I just dug my own grave?'

Lucas had no intention of getting involved—especially not for Vivian’s sake. But this concerned the Laurent family’s reputation. If Madam Nora took offense, the consequences wouldn’t be light.

"Rest assured, I’ll ensure this matter is properly addressed."

His cold gaze locked onto Vivian. "You. Apologize to Madam Nora."

"Lucas, I—"

"Spare me." Madam Nora waved a dismissive hand. "I’m too old to entertain empty apologies. Tell your mother, Lillian, to come see me personally." She turned to Evelyn with a softer expression. "Zoe, let’s go."

"Of course." Evelyn smiled and guided the wheelchair away.

Lucas watched them leave, his expression unreadable. He knew Madam Nora wasn’t the type to stir trouble—unless provoked.

"Lucas, I’m sorry, it’s all my fault—"

"You know it’s your fault?" His voice was sharp as he shoved his hands into his pockets. "Don’t think being my cousin grants you immunity. If the Laurent family suffers because of your idiocy, I won’t hesitate to cut you loose."

Before walking away, he paused. "You’d better come up with a convincing explanation for my mother."

"You dared offend Madam Nora?" Lillian de Arma’s voice was razor-sharp, her glare pinning Vivian in place.

Vivian trembled, her lips quivering. "I didn’t mean to! I was only talking to Evelyn. She’s the one who provoked me first, and Madam Nora took her side!"

Lucas stood silently nearby, arms crossed, his silence more damning than any words.

Lillian’s frown deepened.

'First Edmund and Nathan. Now even Madam Nora is backing Evelyn? How is she this well-connected? And what was Nathan hinting at before he left?'

'If I find out there’s more to this…'

"Aunt Lillian, I’ll go apologize—"

"An apology from you is worthless." Lillian’s tone was frigid. "I’ll ask you one more time. Was everything you told me before the truth?"

'If Evelyn has been tormenting her all this time, why would someone like Madam Nora defend her?'

"Setting Nathan and Edmund aside, Madam Nora is different. She despises scheming women. The fact that she openly supports Evelyn means only one thing—Evelyn earned her respect through merit."
###Chapter 182

"If it's as she claimed—that she was merely speaking to Evelyn but got attacked—then there's absolutely no reason why Madam Nora, who was just an observer at the time, would stand up for someone so unreasonable. Looking at it this way, it's far more plausible that Vivian was the one who provoked them first."

"Aunt, I—I wouldn't lie to you."

"Hmph, I'll find out soon enough whether you're lying, Vivian. If you dare hide anything from me, or worse, deceive me, I won't let you off easily—not even if you're Miranda's daughter."

If my sister truly gave birth to such a conniving girl, I'd rather not take her in at all!

Vivian's panic surged, her heart twisting with resentment.

How did things spiral out of control like this?!

Meanwhile, Evelyn escorted Madam Nora to the lobby of Nora Tower.

Madam Nora clasped Evelyn's hand warmly. "I truly enjoyed having you accompany me for tea today, dear."

Since Madam Nora had no children of her own, she found herself growing increasingly fond of Evelyn—a kindred spirit who shared her passion for exquisite jewelry.

Evelyn smiled softly. "If you'd like tea in the future, I'd be happy to brew it for you myself. No need to spend a fortune at a hotel."

"My dear, if you weren't so determined to build your own empire, I would’ve insisted you join Taylor Jewelry."

"Where's the challenge in that?" Evelyn countered playfully.

If I wanted my designs to dominate the global stage, aligning with Taylor Jewelry would be the fastest route. With their prestige, my work would gain international acclaim effortlessly.

Madam Nora admired the young woman’s humility.

She never flaunted her identity as Zara, nor did she exploit her connection to Mr. Goldmann to secure a partnership. She stands on her own—that’s what I respect most about her.

Just then, Madam Nora’s assistant hurried over, whispering urgently in her ear. After a brief exchange, Madam Nora nodded. "Understood."

"Madam Nora, it seems you have pressing matters. I’ll take my leave now."

"Of course, dear." Madam Nora smiled warmly.

Back in her office, Evelyn found Nathan lounging on the sofa, flipping through a jewelry magazine. He had clearly been waiting for her.

Without glancing up, he remarked, "Madam Nora seems quite taken with you."

His wife had been gone for hours, leaving him impatient.

What can I do? My wife is just too charming.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Maintaining a good relationship with Madam Nora isn’t a bad thing. By the way, have you been here all this time?"

Nathan shut the magazine and lifted his gaze. "Yes, waiting for you. I spoke with your father."

Evelyn froze. "Please tell me you didn’t mention that to him."

"Everything except the de Armas situation," he replied smoothly.

Meaning, aside from Miranda’s true lineage, Nathan had revealed Vivian’s schemes to Richard.

Nathan set the magazine aside and rose, closing the distance between them. "Aren’t you curious how Vivian convinced the Laurent family she was Miranda’s daughter?"

Evelyn frowned.

True. What evidence did Vivian present to make them believe her? And more importantly—why hasn’t she been exposed yet?

Vivian was already traveling with the Laurents during the auction, meaning she’s been impersonating me for a long time.

"Did your mother leave anything behind?" Nathan asked abruptly.

Evelyn stiffened, recalling Richard’s recent call—he had been sorting through Miranda’s belongings.
###Chapter 183

"Could this be something Mother left behind?"

Evelyn returned to the Vanderbilt estate, hoping to discuss a solution with her mother.

But the moment she stepped inside, she froze.

Richard sat on the sofa, his expression dark as thunder.

And to her shock, Laura was kneeling beside him, her face streaked with tears.

"Father... What happened to Mother—?"

"You dare ask me that?" Richard slammed his fist on the table, standing abruptly. "You two have no shame! How could you steal the bracelet that belonged to Zoe’s mother?"

If Nathan hadn’t called him, revealing that Vivian had been impersonating Miranda’s daughter in public, he might never have discovered the missing bracelet.

His own daughter—how could she sink so low?

Madam Victoria, witnessing her son’s fury for the first time, stayed silent, too afraid to intervene.

Vivian’s face paled. Her fingers instinctively tightened around her sleeve. "Father... I don’t know what you’re talking about."

"You still deny it?" Richard’s jaw clenched. "Tell me now—who is your real mother? Miranda de Arma or Laura Scott?"

Laura, still on her knees, clutched at Richard’s leg, sobbing. "Darling, it’s my fault! Punish me, but please spare Vivian!"

"Get away from me!" Richard shoved her aside, his finger trembling with rage. "Your own daughter won’t even acknowledge you as her mother, and she dares to spew such lies. Don’t tell me you had no part in this!"

Laura’s breath hitched. She hadn’t expected Richard to uncover the truth so quickly.

"It’s over."

Richard’s voice was icy. "Return the bracelet. Or do you really want me to disown you?"

"Father, why are you doing this to me?" Vivian screamed, her voice breaking. "I’ve done nothing wrong! I only took a bracelet—why should I give it back? Evelyn stole Nathan from me! Why can’t I take her identity?"

Richard grabbed a glass from the table and hurled it at her.

It struck her cheek, leaving an angry red mark.

Vivian clutched her face, stunned. "You—you hit me?"

"Give. It. Back." Richard’s eyes burned with fury.

With a furious cry, Vivian ripped the bracelet off and flung it to the ground. It shattered instantly.

"I hate you!" She turned and ran, disappearing into the night.

Laura scrambled after her. "Vivian!"

Richard knelt, gathering the broken pieces with trembling hands. This was meant for Evelyn—how had it come to this?

He couldn’t even protect a simple bracelet.

Madam Victoria scoffed. "It’s just a bracelet. Must you make such a scene?"

"Mother," Richard said coldly, "if you interfere again, you’ll be sent back to the family estate."

Madam Victoria gaped.

Without another word, Richard stormed upstairs, the shattered bracelet clutched in his palm.

Madam Victoria seethed but didn’t dare argue further.

My son... he’s turned against me.

The night was thick with tension.

Inside a car parked near the park, the windows fogged from heated breaths.

Laura lay in a man’s arms, her cheeks flushed.

She pushed him away as he leaned in to mark her neck. "Stop it, you beast! If that old fool sees this, I’m dead!"

Laughing, she slowly dressed.

The man lit a cigarette, rolling down the window. Smoke curled into the night air. "Seems life’s treated you well since marrying Richard Vanderbilt. I thought you’d forgotten all your old... clients."

Laura’s smile vanished at the word clients. But she forced a smirk, hiding the disgust in her eyes.
###Chapter 184

"What nonsense are you speaking? How could I ever forget you, Nolan?" Laura's fingers traced circles on his chest.

His rough chuckle vibrated against her skin. "You only seek me out when you're lonely, darling."

She sighed dramatically. "Richard shows no interest in me anymore. What choice do I have?"

'Damn that man! If only he'd fulfill his husbandly duties instead of rejecting me night after night. This pregnancy won't conceive itself.'

'Richard brought this upon himself with his coldness. He has no right to judge my actions!'

'Just like with Vivian, I'll simply present another man's child as his heir. The Vanderbilt name will continue through my bloodline, one way or another.'

Nolan exhaled a cloud of smoke. "There's always an ulterior motive with you, isn't there?"

"You know me too well." A venomous smile curled her lips. "Your associates have certain... specialized skills. Name your price, and I'll make it worth your while."

"Sounds messy." His eyes gleamed with dark amusement.

Laura's nails dug into his arm. "There's a pest threatening my daughter's future that needs permanent removal."

The next morning...

Richard arrived at Viana Jewelry carrying an ornate lacquered box. "Zoe, I never imagined Vivian would steal your mother's bracelet. The damage is done, but I'm returning it to its rightful owner."

Inside lay the shattered remains of an heirloom bracelet, its golden filigree the only intact portions. Richard's jaw tightened. He'd been carefully cataloguing Marina's possessions to give Evelyn everything that rightfully belonged to her.

The audacity of those two women invading his private study made his blood boil.

Evelyn closed the box with deliberate calm. "I'll have it restored."

"Zoe, words can't express... I'll ensure Vivian faces consequences this time." His voice cracked. "I've failed you unforgivably all these years."

Her lashes fluttered downward. "I've no right to judge you."

'He's all the family I have left. What else can I say?'

"I'm divorcing Laura after this."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "You're actually leaving her?"

Richard's resolve hardened. "Bringing them into our home was my gravest mistake. I see now how my weakness poisoned your childhood."

His fingers trembled slightly. Nathan's probing questions during their last call had forced him to confront painful truths.

His daughter's distrust of marriage, her emotional walls - all consequences of his failures as a father.

"Zoe, Nathan Goldmann is a good man. He treats you with respect I never showed your mother." Richard's throat tightened. "Don't let my mistakes color your future. True partnership is possible."

After he left, Evelyn sat motionless, staring at the fractured bracelet. The broken pieces seemed to mirror her fragmented family history.
###Chapter 185

Evelyn's phone screen lit up with an urgent text message.

Her fingers trembled as she read the words. The color drained from her face as she shot up from her seat.

In her frantic rush to leave, she collided with Gregory in the hallway.

"Zoe, what's wrong?" Gregory grabbed her shoulders to steady her.

"It's Dad - he's been in an accident!" Evelyn barely managed to explain before darting toward the elevators.

Gregory's expression darkened at the news about Richard Vanderbilt. He immediately turned toward Nathan Goldmann's office.

The underground parking garage was eerily quiet. Evelyn spotted her father's car with its door hanging open. Richard slumped motionless over the steering wheel.

"Dad!" She rushed forward, but a sharp pain exploded in her side. The world spun as she caught a glimpse of her attacker's face before darkness consumed her.

The last thing she felt was her body hitting the cold concrete.

Two masked figures dragged her limp form into a waiting van. The taser-wielding man adjusted his baseball cap before sliding into the passenger seat.

Tires screeched as the vehicle disappeared into the night.

Somewhere in the underground black market...

Evelyn awoke to the metallic taste of fear. Cold chains bit into her wrists and ankles, securing her to a rusted metal frame.

Memories flooded back - the parking garage, her father, then...

"That man!"

The dim room reeked of mildew and despair. Yellowed newspapers covered peeling walls. Only a single wooden table broke the monotony of the barren space.

She tested her restraints. The chains didn't budge.

The door creaked open. Three masked figures entered.

Evelyn's muscles tensed. "Who are you?"

"Just hired help," the leader in a garish jacket replied. He nodded to his companions, who pinned her to the bed.

"I can pay you double whatever they're offering!" Panic clawed at her throat as she realized this was a carefully orchestrated trap.

The leader chuckled, running a gloved finger down her cheek. "Such pretty skin."

Evelyn forced herself to breathe evenly. "Name your price."

"Money's not what we're after." He produced a syringe from his pocket.

Her pulse skyrocketed. "What is that?"

"Hold her still."

Rough hands immobilized her as the needle pierced her skin. The burning liquid spread through her veins like liquid fire.

"Stop! Please!" Her vision swam as the drug took effect.

"Relax, princess. This won't kill you." His laughter echoed in her ears. "Though you might wish it did."

Evelyn's body betrayed her as the substance took hold. Sweat beaded on her forehead while the room twisted into impossible shapes.

The ceiling swirled like a whirlpool, swallowing her consciousness whole.
###Chapter 186

"Nat- Nathan?"

Evelyn's vision blurred as she thought the man beside her resembled Nathan. But when he leaned closer, his unfamiliar scent made her recoil. "What did you just call me?"

Her trembling hand reached for his collar before she realized her mistake. This wasn't Nathan.

She shoved him away violently.

Spinning around, Evelyn found herself surrounded by identical-looking men. Their outstretched hands and leering grins sent chills down her spine.

"No!"

Evelyn clutched her head, a bloodcurdling scream tearing from her throat. The terror twisting her beautiful features made her almost unrecognizable.

"Damn, this stuff works fast." The men exchanged glances as her pupils dilated unnaturally.

"Save the rest for tomorrow."

As they turned to leave, the door burst open.

All color drained from their faces when a well-dressed man with a cane entered, flanked by armed bodyguards.

Garrett removed his hat with deliberate slowness. "Hand her over."

"Boss, we didn't know—"

"You kidnapped Goldmann's woman and brought her to my casino?" Garrett's cane struck the nearest man's knee with a sickening crack. "Are you trying to get me killed?"

The thug collapsed, whimpering. "Mr. Goldmann's woman? But Nelson said she was just—"

"Who ordered this?" Garrett's voice dropped to a deadly whisper.

"Nolan Baker! He paid us to grab Richard Vanderbilt's daughter! We had no idea she was—"

Garrett's cane tip pressed against the man's throat. "Not even God can save Nolan now. Tell him to run to the ends of the earth." He turned to his men. "Get her to a hospital. Now. If Goldmann tears this place apart, I'll skin you alive!"

"Boss! Trouble!" A panicked boy rushed in. "Goldmann's men are storming the casino!"

Garrett's jaw clenched. With one last glare at his incompetent subordinates, he strode out.

Chaos reigned in the gambling hall. Patrons cowered in corners while unconscious security guards littered the floor like broken dolls.

"Mr. Goldmann," Garrett spread his hands in appeasement, sweat beading on his brow. "My deepest apologies. My men acted without my knowledge. The woman is unharmed."

The financial loss from this raid would be catastrophic. But angering the Goldmanns? That was a death sentence.

Even among criminals, some lines were never crossed.

Cross the Bouchers, you might end up in prison. Cross the Goldmanns? You'd wish for prison.

Nathan adjusted his cufflinks. "Names."

"Nolan Baker." Garrett swallowed hard. "But don't worry, I'll personally deliver him to you within—"

As head of the city's underworld, Garrett was powerful. But against the Goldmann empire? He was an ant. Sacrificing Nolan was the only way to save his operation.

"You have seventy-two hours." Nathan's icy gaze made Garrett's blood run cold. "Fail, and your entire organization burns."

"Yes, sir." Garrett bowed deeply, his shirt soaked through.

When they brought Evelyn out, her vacant stare and slack expression spoke volumes.

Nathan gathered her into his arms. Her skin was clammy, her eyes devoid of recognition.

The thugs trembled under his murderous glare. "Mr. Goldmann, we swear we didn't touch her! Just...just a small injection to calm her down—"

The temperature in the room dropped twenty degrees.
###Chapter 187

Nathan's eyes burned with fury. "What did you give her?"

"Ecsta—" Before the man could finish, Nathan's foot connected with his ribs, sending him sprawling to the ground.

Nathan's voice was a low, dangerous growl. "How dare you?"

The man clutched his side, wincing through the pain. "It—it wasn't a lethal dose!"

They had planned to administer it over three days to ensure addiction. A single dose would only leave her suffering for a short while—but they hadn’t counted on Nathan finding them so soon.

Nathan scooped Evelyn into his arms, his gaze slicing through them like a blade. "If she suffers, you won’t live to regret it."

Inside the car, Nathan held Evelyn close. Her skin was icy, no matter how tightly he wrapped his hands around hers.

"Zoe?" he murmured, but she only blinked up at him, her movements sluggish, her gaze unfocused.

Nathan's jaw clenched. His grip tightened around her. "Oliver. Faster."

The engine roared as Oliver pressed the accelerator.

By the time they reached the hospital, the drug's effects had fully taken hold. Evelyn thrashed violently, her mind lost in hallucinations. She lashed out at the doctor trying to examine her.

"Get away from me! Leave!"

"Zoe!" Nathan caught her wrist, pulling her against his chest. "It's me. You're safe. No one will hurt you here."

Her teeth sank into his shoulder.

Nathan hissed but didn’t let go. He held her tighter.

"Mr. Goldmann—"

The nearest doctor moved to intervene, but Evelyn’s eyes were wild, filled with a feral rage.

A sedative was quickly administered. As her body went limp, Nathan exhaled, the fabric of his shirt stained with blood from the deep bite mark.

The doctor wiped his brow. "The drug induces hallucinations, but the dose wasn’t extreme. She’ll recover—but the next few days won’t be easy."

Nathan said nothing.

The pain in his chest eclipsed the wound on his shoulder.

Oliver’s frown deepened. The drug Evelyn had been given was notorious—some took it for a fleeting high, but the aftermath was brutal.

At first, users lost control of their emotions. Then, with repeated doses, they became slaves to it—just like Dupin.

It didn’t kill. Not directly.

But over time, it destroyed minds. Families. Lives.

And someone had dared to give it to Evelyn.

Whoever was responsible would pay.

Three days later.

Nolan Baker had thought he’d escaped. He’d taken the money and run—until Garrett’s men dragged him back, broken and bleeding.

Now, he lay at Nathan’s feet, barely conscious.

Garrett’s voice was cold. "He claims Laura Scott ordered it. She wanted Ms. Vanderbilt addicted."
###Chapter 188

Oliver approached and slowly parted his lips.

This stepmother was truly merciless. She would destroy Evelyn to secure Vivian's future.

With a shuddering breath, Nolan gazed up at Nathan, who sat casually in the chair with one leg crossed over the other.

He resembled a demon straight from the underworld. His expression remained blank, but those piercing amber eyes radiated an icy sharpness that sent chills down Nolan's spine.

Nathan shifted positions, leaning forward to stare down at him. "Confess, and I'll spare your life."

Tears welled in Nolan's eyes as hope flickered within him.

But Nathan's next words extinguished that light, leaving only terror in its wake.

"Break his arms and legs. Make it known that anyone who dares help him will face the same fate."

Nathan rose and strode away without a backward glance.

Oliver gave a subtle nod to the men before following Nathan out.

Much later, Garrett arrived with his crew to assess the damage.

Taking in Nolan's battered state, Garrett shuddered. "Look what happened to Nolan. Learn who not to cross, or you'll end up just like him." He warned his men sternly.

"Yes, boss!" They chorused, none willing to suffer a similar destiny.

If their limbs were shattered without proper medical care, they'd be crippled for life.

Given the choice, they'd rather serve prison time with their bodies intact.

After several days of treatment, Evelyn's condition improved. The events of that day remained hazy, though she vaguely recalled harming someone.

When the doctor entered for his rounds, he asked, "Ms. Vanderbilt, how are you feeling today?"

"Thank you. Much better now."

Seeing her coherent response, the doctor relaxed. "You're fortunate the dosage wasn't higher. Otherwise, hospitalization would've been the least of your concerns."

Rehabilitation would have been necessary - a far worse ordeal than her recent suffering.

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "Doctor, may I know what was injected?"

"It's a hallucinogen called Dupin. Designed for medical research, it induces powerful visions."

"Initial bodily rejection varies. Mild cases experience manageable hallucinations. But severe reactions, like yours, cause complete loss of consciousness."

"It's highly addictive with difficult recovery," the doctor explained.

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

She'd suspected as much when her attacker mentioned addiction.

Reviewing her bloodwork, the doctor remarked, "Incidentally, your blood shows remarkable properties. Have you taken any special medications recently?"

Evelyn's eyes widened. "There's something besides the hallucinogen?"

The doctor frowned. "Yes, yet you're recovering unusually fast. Typically, it takes about a week to purge the system, but the hallucinogen appears nearly eliminated already."

"You're awake, Ms. Vanderbilt?" Oliver entered, interrupting the examination.
###Chapter 189

Evelyn suddenly recalled something when she spotted Oliver and asked, "Where's Nathan?"

"He went back to change clothes. Sent me here instead." Oliver flashed a warm smile.

Ah.

He probably didn't want bloodstains on his designer shirt.

"Oliver," Evelyn hesitated, "did I... bite Nathan?"

The memory of sinking her teeth into someone's flesh haunted her. She could've sworn she heard Nathan's voice.

Oliver's smile widened. "You remember."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. So it was true.

She swallowed hard before asking, "Do the children know I'm hospitalized?"

Being away from home for days - what must Liam and the others be thinking?

Oliver adjusted his glasses. "You were unstable these past few days. Nathan didn't want to worry them, so he kept it quiet."

Evelyn nodded slowly.

It made sense. If Liam saw her in this state and got hurt, she'd never forgive herself.

"And my father—"

"Your father's fine."

Nathan's voice cut through the room as he entered. The doctor and Oliver discreetly exited, granting them privacy.

He settled beside her bed, his striking features shadowed with exhaustion yet unbothered. "Just shocked, that's all."

As Evelyn's eyelids grew heavy, Nathan pulled her into an embrace. The sudden warmth made her gasp.

"Zoe," his voice was rough with emotion, "you scared me half to death. Promise me - no more reckless solo missions."

Nathan would never admit how seeing her lose control had shattered his usual composure.

A feeling entirely foreign to him.

Like if he loosened his grip even slightly, she might vanish forever.

What was he supposed to do with this woman?

"Nathan."

He met her gaze. "Hmm?"

Evelyn stared straight at him. "Take your shirt off."

Nathan froze, those mesmerizing eyes flickering with amusement before he chuckled. "I don't take advantage of patients."

Ignoring him, Evelyn began unbuttoning his tailored dress shirt.

For a wild moment, Nathan wondered if his wife was initiating something. Should he play along?

But Evelyn had no such intentions. She pushed the fabric off his right shoulder, revealing—

A vicious purple bite mark spanning his shoulder.

Nathan suddenly pinned her to the bed. Evelyn's breath hitched as the half-undressed man with godlike features leaned closer, his proximity short-circuiting her thoughts.

His lips brushed hers with uncharacteristic gentleness - featherlight kisses that gradually deepened.

Evelyn didn't resist, her wrists trapped above her head.

"Zoe—"

The door burst open.

Evelyn shoved Nathan away just as Mr. Goldmann Sr. gaped at them from the doorway. "You scoundrel! Zoe's still recovering and you can't keep your hands to yourself?"

Nathan looked heavenward for patience.

Sitting up hastily, Evelyn stammered, "It's not what it—"

"Zoe, darling, focus on healing. Don't indulge this rascal." Mr. Goldmann Sr. cut her off with grandfatherly concern.

"Dad, you really think I'd—"

"At least button your shirt before speaking," the older man huffed, making Nathan groan in frustration.
###Chapter 190

At the Vanderbilt mansion…

A sharp, resounding slap landed on Laura’s face, leaving her stunned.

When Richard discovered that Laura was behind Evelyn’s abduction, his entire body trembled with fury. His voice was a low, dangerous growl.

"You vile woman! All these years, I’ve treated you and Vivian with nothing but kindness. And this is how you repay me? How dare you lay a hand on Evelyn while I still draw breath?"

Laura clutched her burning cheek, her fingers trembling. She had never expected Nolan’s plan to fail.

It was all because of Nathan!

There was no point in making excuses now. But she could see the storm in Richard’s eyes, and she had to try. "Please, listen to me—"

"What more could you possibly say?" Richard’s voice was thick with disgust. "I truly believed you cared for Evelyn. I thought you were a good stepmother. But now I see how blind I’ve been."

Finally, he understood why Evelyn had never warmed to them.

They were cruel.

And he—

He had sent his own daughter away because of them.

He had nearly destroyed her.

Richard slammed the divorce papers onto the desk. "I was willing to give you another chance. But not anymore."

"You—you want a divorce?" Her voice cracked as she stared at the documents in horror.

"Yes. It’s over." His tone left no room for argument.

The years they had shared meant nothing now. His decision was final.

Laura dropped to her knees, clutching at his legs. "Richard, please! I’ve been by your side for so long. I gave you Vivian! You can’t do this to me!"

Richard hesitated. The way she said his name—soft, desperate—brought back memories of their first meeting.

Back then, she had seemed so gentle. So pure.

But it had all been an act.

Seeing his hesitation, she pressed on. "Richard, I know what I did was wrong. But I wasn’t thinking clearly. I never meant to hurt Evelyn—I just wanted to scare her! It was all for Vivian!"

Her voice broke. "Vivian is all I have. All these years, she’s been labeled a bastard. Do you think that doesn’t tear me apart? She loved Nathan for six years, and then Evelyn took him away. Yes, Evelyn is brilliant. She’s everything I wished Vivian could be."

Her nails dug into his trousers. "But has Evelyn ever spared Vivian? Do you really think Vivian stole those designs? It was Zoe who conspired with Frederick to frame her! What did Vivian ever do to deserve this?"

Richard exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "When you and Vivian set Evelyn up six years ago, did you ever think karma would come for you?"

His voice was heavy with regret. "I failed Evelyn because I favored Vivian too much. But Zoe—she never got the love she deserved from me. And despite that, has she ever retaliated against either of you?"

His gaze hardened. "If I hadn’t wronged you, I wouldn’t have brought you into this family. I never wanted Vivian to be illegitimate. But was any of this fair to Evelyn? No. And yet, you still chose to hurt her."
###Chapter 191

"What exactly is your grievance?" Richard had never considered Evelyn's perspective before.

He couldn't bring himself to.

The guilt he felt toward Vivian and her mother warred with the shame that surfaced whenever he thought of Evelyn. Her resemblance to Miranda was uncanny, and he'd been projecting his resentment onto her all these years. Seeing Evelyn in person always threatened to unleash emotions he'd buried about Miranda de Arma.

Perhaps he had indulged Vivian excessively, but society's cruel judgment of her illegitimate status had driven that indulgence. Balancing affection between his daughters fairly proved impossible.

The truth struck him like lightning - it wasn't Vivian or Laura he'd failed most as a father, but Evelyn!

Watching Richard's resolute expression, Laura collapsed onto the hardwood floor.

'Losing the Vanderbilt name means losing everything! I can't return to that squalid, impoverished existence. Never again will I worry about basic survival!'

'This can't happen! I won't surrender what I've sacrificed everything to obtain. Even if not for Vivian's sake, I must fight for myself now!'

"Richard, you can't do this," she pleaded.

Richard cut her off. "Enough. Sign the papers. For old times' sake, I'll provide a settlement. You won't leave destitute."

Laura's wail pierced the study. "But I'm carrying your child!"

Richard's posture stiffened. "What did you say?"

Tears streamed down Laura's cheeks as she cradled her abdomen. "That night we... I conceived. Your son deserves his father. Will you condemn him to Vivian's fate - scorned from birth?"

Richard swayed slightly. 'Laura's pregnant?!'

"Richard!" Madam Victoria burst in, alarmed at potentially losing a grandson. She helped Laura up. "Is this true? A boy?"

Laura's eyes flashed with triumph beneath her pitiful expression. "Mother, forgive me... I only confirmed the pregnancy during my hospital visit last week."

"Splendid news!" Madam Victoria beamed before scowling at Richard. "Divorce at your age? Have you lost your mind? She's giving you an heir!"

Richard clenched his jaw and stormed out without another word.

Madam Victoria dismissed him, turning her full attention to Laura's belly. "I underestimated you. As long as you deliver a Vanderbilt heir, no divorce will happen."

Laura dabbed her eyes. "Thank you, Mother."

Her inner smirk contradicted her grateful tone.

The pregnancy was fabricated, but desperate times called for desperate measures. She'd handle the consequences later.

'That bastard thinks he can discard me for his precious Evelyn? Never!'

At the hospital...

"Out! I need to change!" Evelyn shoved Nathan toward the door.

He spun gracefully, trapping her in his arms with a roguish grin. "I'd be delighted to assist with that."

"Get lost!" Her kick sent him stumbling into the hallway.

Oliver witnessed his boss's unceremonious ejection, his lips twitching violently as he fought to maintain professional composure. Every muscle strained to suppress inappropriate laughter.
###Chapter 192

Nathan Goldmann stood outside the hospital room, running a hand through his tousled hair in frustration. His young wife Evelyn had just kicked him out in the most humiliating fashion.

"I was only trying to help her change clothes," he muttered under his breath. "Did she really think I'd take advantage of her in that state?"

"Mr. Goldmann." Richard Vanderbilt's voice interrupted his thoughts as the older man approached.

Nathan immediately straightened his suit jacket, his expression shifting to its usual cool detachment. "Mr. Vanderbilt."

"How is Zoe doing now?"

"She's perfectly fine - alive and kicking," Nathan replied dryly. After a brief pause, he added, "You may go in."

Inside the private ward, Evelyn had just finished changing when Richard entered, placing a thermos on the bedside table. "The housekeeper prepared some nourishing broth for you. It'll help restore your strength."

"Thank you, I'll have it later," Evelyn accepted with a small smile.

Richard settled into the chair beside her bed, his face lined with guilt. "Zoe, I owe you an apology. This is all my fault. I never imagined Laura would go this far."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

'Laura? So my abduction and that ecstasy injection were all her doing?'

Her amber eyes darkened with barely contained fury.

'That woman nearly turned me into an addict. She'll pay for this.'

"I actually filed for divorce earlier today," Richard continued, his voice heavy. "But then... we discovered she's pregnant."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up in genuine surprise. "Pregnant?"

'That was fast.'

"Yes," Richard sighed. "I'm completely useless, aren't I? But don't worry - I'm only letting her stay at the Vanderbilt estate for the baby's sake. The divorce will proceed after she gives birth."

Richard couldn't bring himself to punish an innocent child. Laura could give birth and then disappear from their lives forever - the baby would remain a Vanderbilt.

Evelyn remained silent, her mind racing.

'Whether Father divorces Laura or not makes no difference to me. That woman got pregnant right when the divorce papers were filed?'

'The timing is suspicious. Almost... calculated.'

'And that man who knocked me out... I swear I've seen his face somewhere before.'

Meanwhile, Lucas Laurent sat waiting at an upscale café when Vivian Vanderbilt appeared through the crowd minutes later.

Vivian couldn't hide her surprise at Lucas's unexpected summons. She smoothed her dress as she took the seat across from him. "Lucas, to what do I owe this pleasure?"

"My mother intends to publicly acknowledge you as a de Armas at the Laurent family banquet this weekend." Lucas's casual announcement made Vivian's smile freeze.

"W-what?"

"Is there a problem?" Lucas steepled his fingers, studying her reaction with sharp eyes. "As the long-lost daughter of Miranda de Arma, shouldn't you be pleased?"

Vivian's hands trembled beneath the table as she avoided his gaze. "Isn't this rather sudden? Honestly, I don't mind keeping my identity private..."

"Unacceptable." Lucas leaned back, his gaze drifting to the window. "My grandfather is overjoyed to be reunited with his granddaughter. This banquet is being held specifically in your honor."

A flicker of panic crossed Vivian's eyes.

'I never expected them to make this official. If they do...'

"What are you afraid of?" Lucas's voice turned icy. "Is the de Armas name somehow... shameful?"

"Of course not!" Vivian forced a laugh. "I just need time to prepare—"

"For what?" Lucas's patience visibly wore thin. "We're simply acknowledging the truth." He drained his espresso and stood abruptly. "See you at the banquet."

As Lucas strode away, Vivian sat frozen, her blouse clinging to her sweat-drenched back, her fingers shaking uncontrollably against the tablecloth.
###Chapter 193

The phone buzzed in Vivian's hand, her mother's name flashing across the screen.

Laura's voice was strained, each word laced with panic. By the time the call ended, Vivian's face had drained of color. She shot up from her seat, her composure shattered.

"What? Dad wants to divorce you?!"

Not only had her mother's plan to frame Evelyn failed, but now her father was abandoning them.

Damn it! Why does that witch have all the luck?

Her nails dug into her palm.

No. I won’t let this happen. I’m still a de Arma, with or without that bracelet. The DNA results are enough. As long as Dad and Grandma aren’t here, no one can expose me.

A bitter smirk twisted her lips.

And Nathan? If he wanted to ruin me, he would’ve told Evelyn everything by now. But he didn’t. Maybe those six years together still mean something to him.

Nathan guided Evelyn out of the hospital, his grip firm on her waist. As they slid into the car, he dropped the bombshell.

"You're attending the Laurent family’s banquet the day after tomorrow."

Evelyn blinked. "Why?"

His lips curled, mischief glinting in his eyes. "Don’t you want to have some fun?"

She stiffened, studying his sharp profile. That smirk—it promised chaos.

"Is this your idea of helping me? Dragging me to that circus?"

Nathan turned, his gaze locking onto hers, dark with amusement. "The de Armas are about to parade a fraud in front of the world. Wouldn’t it be a shame if the real heir showed up uninvited?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Since when did Nathan enjoy stirring the pot this much?

Back at the Goldmann estate, three tiny tornadoes barreled into Evelyn the second she stepped inside.

Daisy clung to her leg, eyes wide. "Mommy, Grandpa said you were in the hospital! Are you sick?"

Caleb crossed his arms, smug. "Mommy wasn’t sick. She was secretly having a baby."

Liam rolled his eyes. "Babies take ten months, dummy. Mommy was only gone for three days."

Evelyn flicked each of their foreheads. "What kind of nonsense are you three dreaming up?"

Nathan watched, an idea forming as he studied his miniature replicas.

Later, as Evelyn unpacked in their room, Nathan cornered her against the wall, his voice a low purr. "The kids might be onto something. Three isn’t enough. Should we try for another?"

"Go to hell." She shoved him away, cheeks burning.

This man’s mind is a gutter.

A soft giggle interrupted them. Nathan turned to find three pairs of judgmental eyes peeking through the cracked door.

Daisy sighed dramatically. "Daddy, it’s been forever, and you still haven’t convinced Mommy."

Caleb nodded sagely. "Total failure."

Liam just gave a disappointed thumbs-down.

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose.

The next evening, the Laurent mansion glittered with elite guests.

Vivian floated through the crowd in a blush-pink gown, her demure smile perfectly practiced. Lillian de Arma guided her, regal and untouchable, as socialites flocked to greet the "long-lost" heiress.

Vivian basked in their attention, her chest swelling with triumph.

Even if I never become Mrs. Goldmann, this name will open every door for me.

Lillian sipped champagne, her gaze icy as it swept the room.

This spectacle wasn’t her idea.

It was Harrison de Arma’s—her father, watching from Stoslo.
###Chapter 194

"I never informed Father that I'd successfully tracked down Miranda's daughter. Yet somehow, he discovered it on his own and now intends to make a public announcement..."

Lillian turned her gaze toward Vivian, who was currently surrounded by admirers, her brows knitting together in unease.

"Despite the DNA results confirming her blood relation to Lucas, and her possession of the heirloom bracelet, something about this situation feels... off."

As Lucas descended the grand staircase, dozens of eyes followed his every movement.

Many socialites' hearts had shattered when Mr. Goldmann Sr. publicly declared his unavailability years ago. With Adrian Boucher - the entertainment industry titan - being untouchable due to his legion of fans, all attention had turned to Lucas, the last eligible bachelor among Bassburgh's elite.

Dubbed Bassburgh's Violin Prince, Lucas had inherited his father's extraordinary musical gifts.

He'd debuted on stage at five, performed internationally by seven, won gold at ten, and completed a world concert tour by fifteen. His academic achievements matched his artistic brilliance.

Now serving as the youngest professor at the Royal Academy of Music and their official spokesperson, he represented perfection.

However, Mrs. Laurent had made it clear: the Laurent family required their future daughter-in-law to come from at least a scholarly background.

"Lillian." A graceful woman draped in white mink approached, her arm linked with Yves Boucher's, her makeup impeccable.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"That's the Boucher patriarch and his wife!"

"Everyone knows Mrs. Laurent and Mrs. Boucher are inseparable. Their presence was inevitable."

Vivian glanced over, observing Lucas and Lillian conversing with the Bouchers, then bit her lip.

'The Bouchers - Bassburgh's only family that rivals the Goldmanns in prestige.'

With calculated steps, Vivian approached the group. "Auntie, Lucas—"

Both Mrs. Boucher and Yves turned their attention to Vivian. Lillian's eyes flashed with irritation at the interruption.

"Is this your sister's daughter?" Mrs. Boucher inquired, studying Vivian.

Lillian offered only a tight-lipped smile.

'Interrupting elders mid-conversation? Such appalling manners.'

"Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Boucher." Vivian adopted a demure posture, leaving Lillian no opening for reprimand.

Mrs. Boucher nodded politely, though her assessing gaze lingered.

'Well-mannered and pretty enough, but... lacking something essential.'

Both Lillian and Miranda had carried themselves with natural nobility that ordinary socialites couldn't replicate. Even Lillian's son radiated extraordinary charm - shouldn't Miranda's daughter possess even more?

Mrs. Boucher couldn't hide her disappointment.

Noticing the shift, Vivian lowered her head, teeth sinking into her bottom lip.

'What's wrong with this old bat? That look... is she judging me?'

"Dad, I can walk on my own! Stop dragging me—"

William had located Sophia and practically hauled her to the Laurent estate's gala.

He'd claimed Lillian Laurent planned to reveal the de Armas heiress's identity. Though it didn't concern her, Sophia knew her father's real motive - to parade her before Bassburgh's eligible bachelors!

'Is he that desperate to marry me off?!'

But when Sophia spotted Vivian across the room, she wrenched free from her father's grip, face contorting in shock. "Vivian Vanderbilt? What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 195

Vivian never anticipated running into that woman here.

"Damn it! Did Evelyn bring her along?"

A dangerous glint flashed briefly in her eyes.

Lucas Laurent studied Sophia Hill closely, struck by an odd sense of familiarity. After a moment's observation, realization dawned - wasn't she the woman who'd accompanied those two children to the Michelin-starred restaurant?

"Sophia!" Mrs. Boucher hissed, gripping her arm in warning. "That's Madam Lillian's niece you're speaking to."

"What?" Sophia's eyes widened in shock.

'How can Vivian be related to Aunt Lillian? Unless... she's the de Armas heir they're announcing tonight?'

"Aunt Lillian, there must be some mistake. She can't possibly be—" William Hill yanked his daughter aside, cutting her off sharply. "Enough! You're making a scene!"

Sophia shook off his grip. "Father, I'm not joking! That woman is the Vanderbilt bastard. Her mother is Zoe's stepmother - Laura Scott!"

Though Sophia spoke in hushed tones, every word carried clearly to the surrounding guests.

Vivian's face drained of color, her hands trembling with suppressed rage.

Still, she maintained her facade. "No, you're mistaken... Laura Scott merely fostered me—"

"Fostered?" Sophia scoffed. "Would your father appreciate you disowning him like that?"

"Sophia Hill!" Mrs. Boucher snapped, scandalized.

Seeing the older woman take Vivian's side, Sophia shot her a wounded look while suspicion churned in her gut.

'Vivian as a de Armas? That's absolute nonsense. I need to call Zoe immediately!'

Though the confrontation hadn't yet escalated into full scandal, Lillian de Arma had already marked Sophia's words.

She turned slowly, pinning Vivian with a penetrating stare.

Under that scrutiny, Vivian rushed forward with explanations. "Aunt Lillian, I would never lie to you! That woman holds a grudge from our restaurant encounter. She's deliberately slandering me!"

"Vivian Vanderbilt, you pathological liar!" Sophia spat. "You started that fight and threw coffee at me!"

"I... I didn't..." Vivian bit her lip, summoning tears to her eyes.

The gathered guests murmured disapprovingly, their sympathies swaying toward the seemingly victimized Vivian.

William, seeing his daughter's continued aggression toward their host's niece, moved to intervene—only for Lucas to step forward.

"I witnessed the incident. Ms. Hill's account is accurate." Lucas's calm statement doused William's rising anger.

Vivian's breath hitched.

'Is Lucas defending this bitch?'

"Both parties bore responsibility that day," Lucas continued smoothly. "This isn't the appropriate venue to rehash personal disputes."

Sophia's initial relief at his support curdled into outrage. "Are you blind or just—"

"Sophia!" William thundered. "One more word and you're grounded indefinitely!"

He regretted bringing his impulsive daughter tonight. 'I brought her to learn high society etiquette, not create diplomatic incidents!'

Vivian hid a smirk behind her wine glass.

'Everyone here knows better than to cross the de Armas. What makes this little tramp think she can humiliate me at my own event?'

She drifted to Lucas's side, affecting remorse. "I'm so sorry, Lucas. I've caused trouble for you and Aunt Lillian again."
###Chapter 196

Nathan didn't spare Vivian a single glance.

His piercing gaze locked onto two figures emerging from the crowd. Not just him - Lillian and Mrs. Boucher's attention was equally captured.

"Mr. Goldmann? What brings him here?"

"Are the Goldmanns and Laurents so close that he'd attend their banquet?"

"Could that woman beside him be his partner?"

Evelyn walked arm-in-arm with Nathan, her dark emerald gown shimmering under the chandeliers. The daring shoulder-baring design and thigh-high slit accentuated her graceful movements.

Her long hair was elegantly braided into a fishtail, framing her striking features that radiated both icy detachment and breathtaking beauty. Beside Nathan's commanding presence, they looked like royalty gracing the event.

"Zoe!" Sophia's face lit up when she spotted Evelyn. She rushed forward, grabbing her friend's arm excitedly. "You made it!"

Seeing Vivian tremble with barely concealed rage, Sophia smirked in satisfaction.

The crowd buzzed with confusion.

But Lillian's reaction stood out most. Her wine glass nearly slipped from her fingers as she stared at Evelyn with undisguised shock.

Nathan noticed Louis frowning at his mother's strange behavior.

Nathan guided Evelyn forward with a polite nod. "Mrs. Laurent."

Lillian barely managed to compose herself, her knuckles white around her glass.

Mrs. Boucher, observing Lillian's reaction, realized it wasn't Nathan but his companion causing the disturbance.

Evelyn studied Lillian curiously. 'So this is my mother's sister.'

Mrs. Boucher broke the tense silence. "To what do we owe this unexpected visit, Mr. Goldmann?"

Her tone dripped with disapproval.

Nathan ignored her implied challenge. "I understood this banquet was to announce the de Armas heir. Yet there seems to be some... confusion about the true identity. Surely Mrs. Laurent has some clarity to offer?"

His calm words sent ripples through the crowd.

"Is Mr. Goldmann suggesting there's an imposter?"

"Could the woman we've been introduced to be fake?"

"This scandal keeps getting juicier!"

The whispers grew louder.

Sophia stood taller, vindicated. "I told you Vivian couldn't be the real de Armas heir!"

Vivian's face drained of color. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails drew blood from her palms.

"You... you can't do this to me, Nathan," she stammered, playing the victim. "After six years by your side, is this how you repay me?"

She deliberately framed it as if Evelyn had stolen Nathan from her, knowing the crowd would eat up the drama.

Nathan's expression darkened. "How you inserted yourself into my life six years ago mirrors how you're pretending to be the de Armas heir now."

"That's not—" Vivian turned desperately to Lillian. "Aunt Lillian, you must believe me! You saw the DNA results yourself!"
###Chapter 197

Evelyn took a steadying breath, forcing herself to remain composed. The last thing she wanted was to cause a scene in front of all these high-society guests.

"Mr. Goldmann, if there's any misunderstanding, we can discuss it privately—"

Nathan cut her off sharply. "Mrs. Laurent, are you implying you refuse to acknowledge your mistake?"

Evelyn's grip on her wine glass tightened until her knuckles turned white.

'Why am I doubting myself? The resemblance is undeniable.'

'That face... it's like looking at Miranda all over again.'

'I should have realized sooner. How could I have been so blind?'

'All this time searching for Miranda in Vivian, yet finding nothing. That DNA test she showed me... I should have questioned it more thoroughly.'

Vivian was panicking. Seeing Evelyn's hesitation, she suddenly lunged forward and grabbed Zoe's hand, tears streaming down her pale cheeks. "Zoe, I surrender! I won't interfere with your relationship with Nathan anymore. Just... please convince him to stop this madness—"

Her performance was calculated - playing the victim to manipulate the crowd's sympathy and shift all blame onto Zoe.

Zoe's brilliant eyes darkened. She'd only come tonight to observe the unfolding drama, not to participate. Yet Vivian had dragged her center stage.

"The scandal of the season!"

"Homewrecking gold digger - how repulsive."

"Look at that vixen clinging to Mr. Goldmann. Probably stole him right from his fiancée's arms."

Sophia violently wrenched Vivian's hand away as the whispers grew louder. "Enough of your lies!"

"Ah!" Vivian deliberately stumbled backward, collapsing dramatically onto the floor.

The picture of vulnerability, Vivian knew exactly how to play her audience.

"Vivian, stop your pathetic acting—" Sophia moved to grab her, but Lucas blocked her path.

Sophia opened her mouth to protest, but Zoe pulled her back.

Zoe's gaze locked onto Vivian's face, her expression unreadable. "I intended to spare the Laurents embarrassment tonight. But since you insist on making me part of your spectacle, I'll play along."

Slowly, she withdrew the repaired bracelet Vivian had destroyed weeks ago.

"If you covet the de Armas heiress title so desperately, perhaps I should let you have it."

"Zoe, what nonsense is this? That bracelet is mine! How did you—"

When Vivian saw the family heirloom in Zoe's hand, a flicker of panic crossed her eyes. But she quickly regained composure - certain the Laurents would back her tonight. What proof could Zoe possibly have?

'That DNA test with Lucas is irrefutable. Everything she says is baseless!'

'I'll make sure everyone knows Zoe Vanderbilt not only stole my fiancé but now tries to steal my identity!'

Nathan watched with cold intensity, though he trusted Zoe completely. Even if she burned this entire banquet hall to the ground tonight, no one would dare challenge her with him standing guard.

Zoe examined the bracelet with amusement. "A gift from Father, naturally. Shall we call him here to verify?"

Vivian's face darkened. "Zoe, stop twisting things! Even if Father comes, he'll side with you. We all know he favors you over his illegitimate daughter—"
###Chapter 198

"Oh? So you're admitting you're Father's illegitimate child now?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her crimson lips curling into a smirk.

Vivian froze, her eyes darting nervously around the room.

The whispers started immediately.

"Is she really a bastard child?"

"Then everything Ms. Hill said must be true!"

Evelyn's smile deepened. "Isabella Gonzalez was Richard Vanderbilt's lawful wife. How could a legitimate wife possibly give birth to an illegitimate daughter like you?"

The crowd murmured in agreement.

"Exactly! Isabella was the second daughter of the Gonzalez family. She would never tolerate being anything less than the legal wife."

"Only a mistress would produce illegitimate offspring. How disgraceful!"

Vivian's nails dug into her palms as the gossip swirled around her.

Damn that bitch! She tricked me into admitting it!

Seeing Lillian's darkening expression, Vivian desperately grabbed her arm. "Aunt Lillian, please believe me! She's lying! I—"

"Lying?" Evelyn crossed her arms, her voice dripping with amusement. "Let's settle this with a blood test then. Father's blood type is B, Isabella's was O. Yet yours is AB. How exactly does that work?"

Vivian's face paled. "That's bullshit! My blood type is B!"

Evelyn chuckled. "No need to panic. We can have a doctor verify it right now. Or would you prefer a DNA test using your hair?"

Nathan stepped forward, handing Lillian a document. "The proof is all here."

Vivian lunged forward, but Lucas restrained her.

As Lillian scanned the papers, her expression turned stormy. She remembered Nathan's warning from weeks ago.

Her grip crumpled the edge of the document.

"Aunt Lillian, please! Evelyn is framing me!" Vivian cried.

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Framing you? Why don't you tell everyone how you framed Zoe five years ago?"

Vivian's eyes welled with crocodile tears. "What did I do? She's the one who stole Nathan from me! We were together for six years!"

The crowd murmured sympathetically.

"Six years is a long time..."

"That seductress must have stolen him away."

Evelyn's laugh cut through the whispers. "You claim six years, yet my children with Nathan are five and a half. So tell me, who's really the homewrecker here?"

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

"Mr. Goldmann already had children with her six years ago!"

"The rumors about his secret marriage were true!"

"This is explosive!"

Nathan's lips twitched at Evelyn's sudden use of his nickname "Nate." He found he rather liked it - a private endearment only she could use.

"If you hadn't gotten pregnant that night, Nathan would be mine!" Vivian shrieked.

Evelyn's smile turned icy. "If you hadn't drugged my drink and had me thrown out of the Vanderbilts, Nate and I would never have met. So tell me, should I thank you for bringing us together?"
###Chapter 199

"Silence!" Vivian shrieked, her eyes burning with fury. "You wretched creature, if fate hadn't favored you that night, Victor Baldwin would have-"

Mid-sentence, Vivian froze as realization struck - she'd lost control and revealed too much. Her entire body began trembling violently.

Gasps erupted around them.

Evelyn casually picked up a wine glass from the nearby table, swirling the crimson liquid as she approached Vivian. "Indeed, had fortune not smiled upon me six years ago, your scheme would have succeeded. Weren't you just claiming to be Miranda's daughter? Don't you covet the de Armas family name so desperately?"

"That identity holds no value to me - not when even my own mother rejected it. Allow me to toast you in her memory." Evelyn's lips curved into a chilling smile as she raised the glass and poured its contents over Vivian's head.

The wine cascaded down Vivian's hair, staining her face and designer gown.

Vivian stood paralyzed, humiliation burning through her veins as every guest witnessed her disgrace.

Sophia's eyes widened with realization. "Vivian Vanderbilt, how shameless can you be? Impersonating Zoe's mother's daughter?"

"No! That's not-!" Vivian tried to flee.

"Don't you know how your mother schemed her way into the Vanderbilts?" Sophia continued mercilessly. "Zoe's father never divorced Miranda when your mother was carrying you! Not only are you an illegitimate child who's been harassing Zoe relentlessly, but now you're stealing her identity too?"

The crowd erupted in scandalized whispers.

"Good heavens! What a vile woman!"

"So her mother was the homewrecker, and she's denying her own parentage now?"

"All this time she's been impersonating a de Armas heir? The audacity!"

"I actually treated her kindly earlier. What a waste of my courtesy."

The cruel remarks assaulted Vivian from all sides, making her sway unsteadily as her carefully constructed world crumbled.

Evelyn set the empty glass down with finality. "Remember this, Vivian - even an identity I reject remains forever beyond your reach."

'Let her savor the consequences of tonight,' Evelyn thought.

Without sparing a glance at the stunned crowd, Evelyn turned and exited the banquet with effortless grace.

Vivian saw Lillian's thunderous expression and moved to explain, but a stinging slap silenced her.

Even Lucas looked shocked - his etiquette-obsessed mother had never struck anyone in public before.

Lillian's rage burned white-hot. "How dare you make a fool of me!"

"Aunt Lillian, please! They're lying-"

"Take your documents and get out!" Lillian hurled the papers at Vivian's face before storming away.

The atmosphere turned palpably tense until the Bouchers intervened, salvaging what remained of the event.

Security swiftly escorted the hysterical Vivian out as society's elite mocked her mercilessly.

"Imagine impersonating a de Armas heir! She's burned bridges with the Laurents permanently now."

"The sheer nerve of that woman!"

Vivian trembled with humiliation beyond anything she'd ever experienced.

'This humiliation demands repayment in blood. Evelyn Vanderbilt must die!'

Evelyn had already vanished into the night, leaving the scandal far behind her.
###Chapter 200

"I never considered reclaiming my identity as a de Armas heir," Evelyn murmured, her fingers tracing the edge of her champagne flute. "But no one gets to steal it from me - especially not Vivian. That would disgrace my mother's memory."

Strong arms encircled her waist from behind, pulling her against a solid chest. Nathan's warm breath tickled her ear. "Those stilettos must have wings, darling. You're outpacing me in six-inch heels."

His grip tightened as she wobbled slightly. "Must you always tempt gravity?"

When Evelyn remained silent, Nathan suddenly swept her off her feet in one fluid motion. She gasped, squirming in his hold. "Nathan Goldmann! Put me down this instant!"

He carried her to the limousine without relinquishing his hold. Cradling her face, he forced her to meet his smoldering gaze. "What was that endearment you called me at the gala? Say it again."

"What endearment?" Evelyn blinked innocently.

His eyes darkened dangerously. Recognition dawned and she pushed at his chest. "It was just... a silly nickname."

"Mocking me, Zoe?" His voice dropped an octave.

"Don't be ridiculous! Nathan Goldmann, release me right n—"

His lips crashed against hers, swallowing her protest. Evelyn's breath hitched as his fingers tangled in her hair, holding her captive. Her lashes fluttered wildly while Nathan's breathing grew ragged, his gaze burning with barely restrained desire.

Back at the Goldmann estate...

Nathan pinned Evelyn beneath him on the silk sheets, his mouth claiming hers with relentless hunger. His muscular frame dwarfed her slender form, leaving her breathless beneath his onslaught. A haze of pleasure clouded Evelyn's vision as she arched against him.

"Wait—" She gasped when Nathan shrugged off his dress shirt, revealing sculpted abs that made her mouth go dry. Her cheeks flushed crimson.

"Zoe," he growled against her throat, "I'm done waiting."

Just as passion threatened to consume them, Evelyn stiffened. "Nathan, stop! I can't—not tonight."

His jaw clenched. "If this is another one of your—"

"It's my cycle," she blurted, watching comprehension dawn on his face. "Aunt Flow is visiting, you impossible man!"

The admission doused Nathan's ardor like ice water. He exhaled sharply before brushing a tender kiss to her forehead. "I'll prepare chamomile tea."

Evelyn blinked in astonishment at his unexpected domesticity. "You know about... menstrual cramps?"

Nathan cleared his throat, uncharacteristically flustered. "Research indicated chamomile provides relief."

A delighted laugh bubbled up. "Not all women suffer, Mr. Goldmann. But I'll never refuse tea brewed by the legendary tycoon himself."

The genuine smile lighting Evelyn's face made Nathan's chest tighten. This was the unguarded expression he'd fought so hard to earn. "Consider it done," he murmured, heading for the kitchen.

Minutes later, Evelyn's panicked voice echoed through the mansion. Nathan abandoned the whistling kettle, taking the stairs three at a time. "What's wrong?"

Peeking from the ensuite, Evelyn bit her lip. "I've... run out of feminine products. Could you ask Oliver to—"

"I'll go," Nathan interrupted, already reaching for his car keys. The billionaire CEO headed out on a mission no boardroom negotiation could have prepared him for.
###Chapter 201

Nathan took a sharp inhale, his jaw visibly tightening. "I'll handle this myself."

"No way I'm letting another man purchase these for her."

He snatched his car keys and stormed out, leaving a bewildered Evelyn standing in the hallway.

The tires screeched as he pulled into the nearest 24-hour pharmacy.

Never in his life had he bought feminine products for a woman. Without knowing Evelyn's preferred brand, he grabbed one of each type from the shelves.

The middle-aged cashier blinked awake when twenty different packages of sanitary pads came rolling down the conveyor belt.

Her raised eyebrow spoke volumes.

'This gorgeous man has some peculiar shopping habits...'

Nathan's ears burned crimson as he cleared his throat. "These are for my wife."

"Married already? How lovely!" The cashier's suspicious expression melted into approval as she bagged his unusual purchases.

Thankfully the late hour meant no witnesses to his embarrassment. Nathan practically ran back to his car.

Evelyn's mouth fell open when he returned with enough menstrual products to stock a small clinic.

Avoiding eye contact, Nathan thrust the bags at her. "Wasn't sure which kind you use. Got everything they had."

Her cheeks flamed as she grabbed one package. "Thanks."

The bathroom door clicked shut behind her as Evelyn collapsed against it, mortification heating her face.

Later at the kitchen island, Nathan slid a steaming mug of chamomile tea toward her.

Guilt prickled Evelyn's conscience. The CEO of Goldmann Group had just made a midnight pharmacy run for her personal needs.

She cupped the warm mug, studying him over the rim. "Nathan...you can be surprisingly decent sometimes."

His lips quirked. "Just realizing that now?"

A small smile tugged at her mouth. "You're almost tolerable when you're not being insufferable."

Nathan stood with deliberate slowness. "Finish your tea, then meet me in the study. I have something that might...interest you."

Curiosity piqued, Evelyn followed minutes later.

Nathan lounged on the leather couch, shirtsleeves rolled up to reveal toned forearms. One hand supported his chin as he stared intently at the laptop screen.

"What's so fascinating?" Evelyn perched on the opposite end.

He rotated the screen toward her.

Her face immediately flushed scarlet. "You disgusting pervert! Keep your porn habits to yourself!"

"Look closer." Nathan's expression remained impassive as he zoomed in. "Focus on the woman's face."

Evelyn squinted, then gasped.

'The girl in this...video...she looks like a younger version of Vivian. Is that...Laura Scott?!'

Her nails bit into her palms. "Why do you have this?"

"The men who kidnapped you talked before they disappeared." Nathan's smirk turned predatory. "Don't you want to know how Laura secured her place in the Vanderbilt family?"

Evelyn's throat tightened. She only knew her father had met Laura during his wilder years, resulting in Vivian's secret birth two years later.
###Chapter 202

Nathan retrieved an envelope from his desk drawer and slid it across the polished mahogany surface toward Evelyn. "You'll want to see this."

The envelope contained a stack of photographs.

Evelyn flipped through them slowly, her expression darkening with each image.

Despite being over two decades old, the photos were startlingly clear. The woman in heavy makeup and scandalous attire, entertaining a group of men, was unmistakably Laura.

Some shots showed her locked in passionate embraces with multiple men, others captured her performing suggestive dances on tabletops. The most damning ones depicted her in compromising positions with different partners. This wild, unrestrained version of Laura was nothing like the composed schemer Evelyn had known.

A chilling realization struck her. If Laura's past was this debauched... could it mean...?

Nathan's lips curved knowingly at her expression. "The Underground Freeway crowd remembers Laura well. Nine out of ten were her regular clients."

The word "clients" confirmed Evelyn's suspicion.

Laura was a prostitute.

"You're saying she has connections there?"

"Precisely. How else could she have arranged your kidnapping so easily?"

Evelyn's eyes turned stormy. "Then Vivian might not actually be Father's child."

Nathan's smirk deepened. "Sharp as ever. DNA tests confirm Vivian isn't Richard's daughter."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Laura's deception has lasted this long!

"Frankly," Nathan continued, "Laura probably doesn't even know who Vivian's real father is. Your father was simply the most convenient mark."

His voice dropped lower. "And now she's planning to get pregnant by someone else and pass the child off as Richard's."

Evelyn froze, pieces clicking into place.

The sudden pregnancy announcement. The rushed divorce proceedings. She's buying time to conceive another man's child and claim it's Father's.

Not this time.

Evelyn studied the photos, a dangerous smile forming. "May I keep these?"

"By all means." Amusement glittered in Nathan's eyes as he watched her tuck the evidence away.

Meanwhile, at the Vanderbilt estate...

Since announcing her pregnancy, Laura had been treated like royalty. Madam Victoria forbade her from lifting a finger, insisting she rest for the baby's sake.

Laura basked in her newfound status. Vivian was safely established as a de Arma, and the Vanderbilts were finally showing her proper respect.

But one thought nagged at her: When will I actually conceive?

The doorbell interrupted her worries.

A courier stood outside. "Package for Ms. Laura Scott?"

"That's me." Laura frowned, unable to recall any recent purchases.

The nondescript box bore no return address. Her hands trembled as she peeled back the packaging.

The color drained from her face.

She hastily rewrapped the parcel as her phone rang. Seeing Vivian's name, she clutched the damning evidence to her chest and fled upstairs.
###Chapter 203

"Vivian, why are you— What!?" Laura's hands trembled as she gripped her phone. Vivian's fake identity had been exposed!?

Laura couldn't stay calm.

"How did this happen? Everything was under control!"

"It's all Evelyn's fault! That witch ruined everything! Mom, I hate her—I want her dead!"

Laura clenched her jaw, forcing herself to remain composed. "Vivian, listen to me. Don’t panic. I’ll handle this."

After hanging up, Laura glared at the package in her hands, her blood boiling.

Who sent these photos?

These were her darkest secrets—things she had buried years ago.

Only the Underground Freeway knew about her past.

Had Nolan betrayed her? Was this his way of blackmailing her?

No. She couldn’t let Richard find out.

She wouldn’t let him destroy her.

At Soul Jewelry Studio—

Evelyn received a message.

Laura had gone to the Underground Freeway after receiving the photos.

A smirk curled Evelyn’s lips.

"Now she’ll know exactly what I went through."

Revenge was sweet.

Gregory entered the office. "Zoe, Madam Laurent is here to see you."

Evelyn stiffened. "Tell her I’m not available."

She didn’t know how to face Lillian.

Even after learning about her mother’s noble lineage, Evelyn refused to embrace that identity.

Her mother’s past didn’t define her.

Gregory relayed the message.

Lillian sighed but didn’t argue. "Then I’ll return another time."

She left quietly.

At Viana Jewelry—

Richard’s phone rang.

The hospital.

His face darkened as the doctor spoke.

"What about the baby?"

The answer made his expression turn to ice.

"I’ll be there soon."

Laura woke in a hospital bed, her body covered in bruises.

Memories flooded back—the Underground Freeway, the men, the drugs.

She had been injected with something.

And then—

Her stomach twisted.

She remembered everything.

The door slammed open.

Richard stood there, fury in his eyes.

"Darling, let me explain—"

A sharp slap cut her off.

The doctor rushed forward. "Sir, please calm down!"

Richard didn’t care.

"You lied to me about being pregnant?"

Laura clutched her stinging cheek. "I had no choice! I love you—I didn’t want a divorce!"

"Love?" His gaze raked over her bruises. "You disgust me."

"It wasn’t my fault! They—they forced me!"

Richard scoffed. "Pathetic."

He turned and walked out.

Laura collapsed back onto the bed, tears burning her eyes.

Evelyn had won.

And she had lost everything.
###Chapter 204

"I want a divorce."

"Wh-What?" Laura gasped, staring at Richard in utter shock.

Richard shook the doctor's hand off his arm and glared at her. "A woman who thrives on deception doesn’t deserve to be my wife, let alone step foot in the Vanderbilt estate." Without another word, he strode out of the hospital room, leaving Laura frozen in place.

"Richard, wait!" Laura scrambled off the bed, but her legs buckled beneath her, sending her crashing to the floor. No matter how desperately she sobbed, he didn’t turn back. She could only kneel there, weeping into her hands. The doctor, watching the scene unfold, couldn’t help but pity her.

"Please, madam, let me help you up." The doctor assisted her back onto the bed, but Laura suddenly clutched his arm. "Doctor, who brought me here?"

"A passerby found you unconscious after an alleged assault and rushed you here. But they left immediately, only instructing us to contact your husband."

Laura’s hands trembled as realization struck.

Someone set me up.

Once the doctor left, Laura’s fury erupted. She swept everything off the bedside table, sending glass shattering across the floor. It felt like an invisible web had been spun around her, trapping her without warning. The suffocating truth made her chest tighten.

The door creaked open again.

This time, Evelyn and Oliver stepped inside. "Laura," Evelyn said, her voice smooth as silk, "how does it feel to be on the receiving end of your own schemes?"

Laura’s face twisted with rage. "You!"

A cold smile played on Evelyn’s lips. "Karma’s a cruel mistress, isn’t it? If you could do it to me, why shouldn’t I return the favor?"

Laura lunged at her. "You little witch—!"

Oliver moved swiftly, pinning her down before she could lay a finger on Evelyn. He had promised Nathan he wouldn’t let his wife get hurt.

Forced onto her knees, Laura seethed with humiliation. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, do you think your father will believe you once I tell him the truth?"

Evelyn crouched down, meeting her gaze. "Do you really think he’d take your word over mine?"

Laura let out a bitter laugh. "You’re no saint either. Does he even know the real you? I’ll make sure he finds out!"

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable. "Have you seen the photos yet?"

Laura’s bravado faltered.

Evelyn continued, voice low. "If those photos reached my father, do you think he’d still trust you?"

Laura’s breath hitched. She stared into Evelyn’s eyes—cold, calculating, like a serpent poised to strike. Panic clawed at her throat. "What… What do you want?"

Her defiance crumbled. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she grabbed Evelyn’s sleeve. "Zoe, please… I know I was wrong. Forgive me. Don’t show him those photos. Richard is all I have left. I can’t lose him!"

Her desperate pleas might have moved anyone else.

But Evelyn had seen through her act long ago. Even if she showed mercy now, Laura would never extend the same to her.

Evelyn had kindness to spare—just not for Laura and Vivian.

"You only beg when you’re cornered," Evelyn said coolly. "But where was your remorse when you plotted against me? Weren’t you thrilled when your plan worked?"

Laura’s voice cracked. "Zoe, I swear, it won’t happen again! I’ll do anything—just don’t make me divorce him!"
###Chapter 205

Laura Scott refused to return to her former life. Leaving the Vanderbilts would mean losing everything.

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

'Just need to control this witch temporarily. Once she forgives me, I'll make sure she disappears permanently.'

"Heh, begging won't help you. You'd better act fast."

Evelyn straightened her spine. "You drove me out of Vanderbilt Manor years ago. Now it's your turn to leave."

She couldn't bear looking at Laura another second, striding out of the hospital room while Oliver released Laura and followed.

Laura remained frozen on the hospital bed, her expression darkening by the minute.

Oliver returned to Goldmann Enterprises' executive office, faithfully reporting every detail of the hospital encounter.

'Mr. Goldmann assigned me as Ms. Vanderbilt's temporary bodyguard. What else could I do?'

Nathan rested his chin on his hand, setting aside documents with a faint smirk. "Seems she handled it perfectly. She deserves a reward."

Oliver suppressed a pout.

'I performed well too. Where's my reward?'

When Nathan arrived at Soul Jewelry Studio, employees immediately recognized his purpose for visiting, showing no surprise.

Lydia Vanderbilt was massaging her wrist exiting the warehouse when she spotted Nathan. "Nathan!" she called, rushing toward him.

Nathan's brows furrowed at the shrill voice.

"Please forgive my earlier behavior. I never meant to compete with Evelyn. Are you still angry with me?"

Nathan found her unbearably chatty.

'Is Evelyn the only sane Vanderbilt?'

He attempted to leave when Lydia suddenly bit her lip and lunged toward his chest.

Nathan swiftly caught her shoulders, his gaze turning arctic.

Though denied the embrace, Lydia felt triumphant at his touch - until Nathan violently shoved her away just as Evelyn emerged with paperwork, sending Lydia sprawling.

The commotion drew everyone's attention.

Lydia hadn't anticipated public humiliation.

Nathan immediately approached Evelyn, adopting a wounded expression. "She threw herself at me."

Gasps echoed through the studio.

'What?'
'Mr. Goldmann actually explaining himself to Ms. Zara with that puppy-dog look?'

Lydia scrambled up, panicking. "Evelyn! It wasn't me! I just slipped!"

Evelyn understood exactly why Lydia had begged to work at Goldmann Enterprises. She'd grudgingly admired Lydia's perseverance in enduring the grueling tasks assigned to her.

But watching Lydia openly seduce Nathan still churned Evelyn's stomach.

"You slipped? At what age do people still faceplant from slipping?"

Snickers erupted around them.

Flushing crimson, Lydia stood. "I didn't-"

"You've caused nothing but trouble since arriving. Instead of working, you've embarrassed Grandmother repeatedly. Leave if you can't handle this job."

"Sister Evelyn...are you firing me?" Lydia clutched her skirt hem.

"Disappearing for hours during work shifts? Why should I keep you?"

Evelyn knew exactly what Lydia did in the warehouse - Xavier had faithfully reported her three-hour daily absences and refusal to complete assignments.
###Chapter 206

The office buzzed with tension as Lydia stood frozen, her fingers clutching the edge of the desk. It was clear she had been pushed to her limits, forced to endure tasks far beneath her dignity.

Evelyn had held her tongue until now, assuming Lydia wouldn’t last long in this position. But against all odds, the woman had stubbornly clung to her role. Today, however, fate had handed Evelyn the perfect opportunity to dismiss her.

Seeing the resolve in Evelyn’s eyes, Lydia turned desperately to Nathan. "Nathan, please—"

"This isn’t my decision to make," Nathan said smoothly, his lips curving into an amused smile. "Zoe has full authority here." The room collectively understood what it meant for a man to stand firmly behind his wife.

Lydia’s lips trembled before she spun on her heel and stormed out, humiliation burning in her wake.

Evelyn handed the documents to the receptionist and strode back to her office. Nathan followed, only for her to whirl around, pressing a hand against the doorframe, effectively trapping him.

She glared up at his infuriatingly perfect face. "Nathan Goldmann, must you always drag your admirers to me so I can chase them off?"

His lips twitched, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes. He slid an arm around her waist, pulling her flush against him. "Feeling possessive, are we?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Nine out of ten women would fall for you without a second thought. Why waste that charm on just one?"

He doesn’t even have to try. Women throw themselves at him constantly. So why won’t he let me go?

Nathan studied her for a long moment before murmuring, "But out of those ten, you’re the only one I want."

She tried to push away, but his grip was unyielding. He chuckled darkly. "If you don’t like them around me, I’ll make sure they stay away."

"Who said I care?" Evelyn snapped, but before she could finish, his calloused fingers brushed her lips, tilting her chin up. His mouth sealed over hers, swallowing her protests.

No more excuses. That stubborn mouth deserves to be kissed into silence.

Evelyn’s thoughts scattered under the heat of his kiss. No matter how much she resisted, her body betrayed her every time.

Nathan pulled back with effort, his breathing uneven. If not for her current condition, he wouldn’t have stopped.

"We’ll pick up Caleb from the academy together this evening," he said, voice rough.

Evelyn stepped back, avoiding his gaze. "I know."

She didn’t want him to see the flush staining her cheeks, but the tips of her ears gave her away.

Nathan suppressed a grin. My wife’s shyness is utterly adorable.

At the Royal Academy of Music

Sophia burst into the disciplinary office, her voice sharp. "Caleb!"

The boy stood before the teacher, his lip split and uniform dirtied. Beside him, an older student glowered, his mother’s expression twisting in outrage the moment she spotted Sophia.

"Are you Caleb Vanderbilt’s guardian?"

Sophia blinked, then glanced at Caleb. "What happened?"

"Can’t you see? Your boy attacked mine!" the woman snapped, her fury palpable.

Sophia arched a brow at Caleb.

Of course. He called me here because he got into a fight.

Caleb blinked up at her with wide, innocent eyes. "Godmother, I didn’t start it. He insulted me first."
###Chapter 207

"Ridiculous! My son would never insult anyone!" The woman glared at the teacher, her voice sharp with indignation. "And you're telling me it's acceptable for him to be beaten? Where is the principal? I demand an explanation for this disgrace! Do the Langleys look like people you can trample over?"

The teacher sighed, caught between the two furious parties. She glanced at Caleb, her tone firm but weary. "Caleb, regardless of the circumstances, violence is never the answer. You must apologize to your classmate."

Caleb tilted his head, defiance flashing in his eyes. "Why should I? He called me a fatherless bastard. Shouldn’t he apologize first?"

Sophia inhaled sharply, her patience thinning. "Your son is the one hurling insults, and you have the audacity to play the victim?"

Thank heavens I’m the one here.

If Zoe had been summoned instead, she might’ve actually slapped the kid. And if she’d come with Mr. Goldmann—

"You—" The woman scoffed. "My son would never say such a thing! Ask him yourself if you don’t believe me!"

The boy refused to meet Sophia’s gaze, his jaw clenched as he muttered, "I... I didn’t say that."

"See?" The woman smirked triumphantly. "Your son attacked mine, and that’s a fact. I won’t let this go unless he apologizes!"

Sophia crossed her arms, unimpressed. "Fine. Let’s settle this, then."

"You—!" The woman turned to the teacher, seething. "Look at her! What kind of parent encourages this behavior? Like godmother, like godson. A child like him has no place in this academy!"

Sophia knew Caleb wouldn’t lash out without reason. Though she wasn’t his birth mother, she was his godmother—and she refused to let anyone bully him.

"You believe your son’s denial, yet you dismiss my godson’s word? Hypocrisy at its finest."

"Godson?" The woman sneered. "So this brat couldn’t even call his real mother? No wonder he’s so ill-mannered—raised by someone like you, it’s no surprise."

Sophia’s chin lifted, her gaze icy.

The woman’s mocking laughter filled the room. "Ah, I see. He probably doesn’t even have a mother. No wonder he’s so wild—an orphan with no one to teach him manners."

Caleb’s small fists tightened, his face darkening.

Before anyone could react, Sophia’s palm struck the woman’s cheek with a sharp crack.

Even Caleb froze, stunned. His godmother was usually playful and carefree—he’d never seen her so fierce.

The teacher shot to her feet. "Miss Hill! You can’t just hit someone!"

"She insulted my godson," Sophia retorted, rolling up her sleeves. "A slap is the least she deserves."

The woman shrieked, lunging at Sophia. "How dare you?! You and your brat will regret crossing the Langleys! You’ll be run out of Bassburgh!"

Chaos erupted as the two women grappled, the teacher frantically calling for security.

Then the door swung open.

A tall figure stepped inside, his presence instantly commanding silence. The teacher nearly sagged in relief.

Lucas Laurent took in the scene—two women brawling like street fighters—before striding forward. He seized the back of Sophia’s collar, yanking her away from the fray.

"Who the hell—?" Sophia whirled, then stilled.

Her breath caught at the sight of that familiar, impassive face.
###Chapter 208

Lucas pulled her aside sharply. "Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough?"

...

The woman’s bravado faltered the moment she saw his face. "Mr. Laurent, you’re finally here! You need to settle this for me. Forget that this boy hit my son—this woman just slapped me!"

"Mrs. Langley, your son should apologize first for his disrespectful comment."

Mrs. Langley gaped. "My son—since when did he say anything rude? He’s the one who got hurt! And she attacked me first!"

"If you want the truth about the children’s fight, check the surveillance footage. As for you and this lady—" Lucas shot a sideways glance at Sophia, who was straightening her clothes.

Sophia met his gaze and scoffed. "What? Going to blame me too? Mrs. Langley just called my godson an uneducated orphan with no mother to raise him. She even threatened to kick him out of Bassburgh. So what if I hit her?"

She jabbed a finger at Mrs. Langley. "You’d better apologize first because this kid’s parents aren’t people your family can mess with!"

Mrs. Langley stiffened.

She dares say that in front of Mr. Laurent? Let’s see how far she gets.

"You actually have the nerve—"

"Mrs. Langley." Lucas’s voice was icy. "If you judge people by their status, you can’t even touch her—she’s backed by the Hills."

Mrs. Langley’s face paled.

The… Hills?

Sophia smirked and waved a hand. "And the Hills are nothing compared to Caleb’s family. Mrs. Langley, if you try to force him out of school, you’re smashing an egg against a rock."

Mrs. Langley’s mouth snapped shut.

The Hills might not be in business, but they’re still a scholarly family. Their eldest daughter married into the Bouchers. Pushing this further would only humiliate me.

She forced a tight smile. "Since it’s a misunderstanding, let’s just apologize and move on."

Sophia stepped closer, tilting her head with a mocking grin. "If we’re apologizing, shouldn’t you go first?"

Mrs. Langley’s expression twisted. She glanced at Lucas, who remained silent, then dragged her son forward. "We… apologize."

Caleb scratched his cheek lazily. "Fine, I’ll accept it."

Mrs. Langley swallowed her fury and hurried away.

Caleb bounded up to Lucas. "Professor Laurent! What are you doing here?"

Sophia crossed her arms and stayed silent.

Even if he’s Aunty Lucas’s son, he still sided with Vivian at the banquet. That’s why I can’t stand him.

Lucas’s gaze flicked to Sophia before landing on Caleb. "I thought you’d hired a minor to impersonate your parents."

A minor?

The words hit Sophia like a slap.

"A minor? Are you blind?" she hissed.

"You look like a teenager from head to toe." Lucas eyed her coldly. "Flat-chested and short."
###Chapter 209

Sophia stood at 5'3", her petite frame accentuated by her girlish fashion sense. Next to Lucas Laurent, who towered at 6'2", she looked undeniably tiny. But calling her flat-chested?

That wasn’t just rude—it was downright insulting!

Caleb burst into laughter.

"Caleb!" Sophia huffed, hands on her hips. "You’re teaming up with him to bully me now? Should I tell your mom?"

Caleb immediately dashed over and clung to her, his voice sweet and pleading. "Godmother, I’m sorry! Please don’t tell Mommy!"

Watching him act so adorably, Sophia’s irritation melted away.

Then Caleb’s smartwatch buzzed. His face fell. "Uh-oh. Mommy’s here to pick me up!"

Sophia escorted him to the school gates, where a sleek Rolls-Royce gleamed under the afternoon sun.

"Mommy!" Caleb sprinted toward Evelyn the moment she stepped out.

She ruffled his hair. "Why were you outside already?"

As she spoke, her gaze landed on Sophia approaching. She narrowed her eyes at Caleb. "Did you cause trouble again?"

"No way! I just wanted fried chicken wings, and Godmother brought me some!" Caleb insisted, grinning.

Sophia forced a smile. "He was perfectly behaved. Just a little snack break."

Evelyn studied them skeptically. Something felt off.

"Daddy! You came too!" Caleb quickly diverted the conversation, scrambling into the car.

Evelyn turned to Sophia. "Need a ride?"

Sophia waved her off. "Nah, I drove. Besides, I don’t want to third-wheel your family time."

Evelyn chuckled. "Alright, we’ll head home then."

Sophia blinked, waving as the car pulled away. Once they were out of sight, she exhaled sharply.

Those three little troublemakers only remember me when they need an accomplice. If Zee ever finds out half the things I’ve helped them with, I’m doomed.

"Ah, so Mr. Goldmann is the kid’s father."

The sudden voice behind her made Sophia freeze. She turned slowly, tilting her head up to meet Lucas’s amused gaze.

Damn, he’s tall.

"What are you staring at, shorty?" Lucas smirked before walking away.

Sophia bristled. "Oh, wow, congrats on being born tall! Must be nice breathing all that dusty air up there. Thanks for filtering it for the rest of us!"

What kind of jerk is he? Rude, arrogant—ugh!

At the Vanderbilt Manor

"Look what your daughter did to Lydia! She fired her without a valid reason!" Linda had been complaining to Madam Victoria since returning from Luxe Group, and now the matriarch was scolding Richard at the dinner table.

She had hoped Lydia and Evelyn would get along. Instead, Evelyn had unceremoniously kicked her out.

Lydia bit her lip, feigning distress. "Grandma, I barely said anything to her, and she just… dismissed me."

"Evelyn is becoming insufferable!" Madam Victoria’s temper flared. "First, she exploits Lydia, then fires her on a whim? This time, she’s gone too far!"

The more she thought about it, the angrier she grew. "I’ll go talk to her myself tomorrow. This is unacceptable!"

Richard abruptly set down his silverware. The table fell silent.
###Chapter 210

The tension in the dining room was palpable.

Madam Victoria's fingers tightened around her fork as she watched Richard abruptly push his chair back, the silverware clattering against the fine china.

What is he doing?

She had never seen him like this—cold, controlled fury simmering beneath his composed exterior.

"You should know the relationship between Mr. Goldmann and Zoe," Richard said, his voice dangerously low. "Don’t think I’m unaware of your schemes. If you dare confront her, you can return to the ancestral mansion immediately."

Madam Victoria’s lips parted in shock.

How dare he speak to me like this?

She had endured his coldness for years, but this—this was outright defiance.

"You would threaten your own mother?" she hissed.

Richard’s gaze didn’t waver. "I’m glad you still remember I’m your son." He exhaled sharply, his tone turning bitter. "Zoe is your granddaughter, yet you’ve never cared for her. But a grandson? That’s all you’ve ever wanted. If not for your obsession with an heir, I would’ve divorced Laura years ago. I wouldn’t have been humiliated by her fake pregnancy."

Madam Victoria froze.

Fake pregnancy?

She had wondered why Laura had been absent all day, assuming she was at the hospital for routine checkups.

But this—this was deception.

Richard stood, tossing his napkin onto the table. "There is no grandson for you. Are you satisfied now?"

Without another word, he strode out, leaving her seething.

Madam Victoria’s hands trembled with rage.

Laura Scott… How dare she lie to me?

She had pinned all her hopes on Laura, but now—now she had no choice but to turn to her eldest daughter-in-law.

The next afternoon, Evelyn adjusted the emerald tassel pendant around Mrs. Hawthorne’s neck, the gemstones catching the light beautifully.

"What do you think?" Evelyn asked, stepping back to admire her work.

Mrs. Hawthorne beamed, turning in front of the mirror. "It’s exquisite! No one in my circle has anything like this. It’s unique—elegant yet modern."

Evelyn smiled. "I’m glad you’re pleased."

She carefully removed the necklace, placing it in a velvet-lined gift box before handing it over.

As Mrs. Hawthorne left, chattering excitedly, Evelyn’s phone buzzed.

A message from Madam Victoria.

An invitation to dinner with her aunt.

Evelyn’s lips curved into a knowing smirk.

Nothing is ever that simple with her.

She handed her tasks to Gregory. "I need to step out."

Gregory frowned. "Again? What does Madam Victoria want this time?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Who knows? But since everyone from the ancestral mansion suddenly wants to see me, I should find out."

Gregory’s expression darkened.

If the Vanderbilts are seeking her out… It must be about Viana Jewelry’s inheritance.

Evelyn grabbed her coat, her mind already racing.

Let’s see what game they’re playing now.
###Chapter 211

"Madam Victoria has always been keeping a close watch on this."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly. "If the Vanderbilts are truly planning to lay their hands on Viana Jewelry, then I must attend this dinner."

"Zoe, do you want me to accompany you? Who knows what they might pull." Gregory's voice was laced with concern.

Evelyn hesitated for a fleeting moment.

'Gregory's right. They wouldn't invite me without an agenda. I need to be prepared.'

Stepping into the upscale restaurant, Evelyn had tied her long hair into a sleek high ponytail. She wore a chic black-and-white color-blocked dress with a daring slit, paired with shimmering gold sequin earrings.

Her entrance turned heads, whispers trailing behind her like a shadow.

A hostess at the reception desk, struck by her commanding presence, approached with a practiced smile. "Miss, do you have a reservation? Private room or booth?"

"Private Room 203."

"Right this way." The hostess led her upstairs.

At the door of the private room, the hostess knocked before opening it. Inside, seated beside Madam Victoria and Lydia, were two unfamiliar middle-aged women and a man Evelyn had never met.

Madam Victoria's smile was immediate. "You're here, Zoe. This is your aunt. It's been years since you last saw her."

She gestured to the elegantly dressed woman beside her.

Yvette Warren was Madam Victoria's eldest daughter-in-law and Lydia's mother. Married to York Vanderbilt, the eldest son of the Vanderbilt family, she had borne both a son and a daughter—securing her place as Madam Victoria's favorite.

"Oh, so this is Zoe. She's grown into such a beauty, just like her mother." Yvette's voice was high-pitched, her words dripping with something between admiration and veiled mockery.

Evelyn took her seat, her crimson lips curving slightly. "Aunt Yvette, I didn’t expect you to arrange a dinner so soon after arriving in Bassburgh."

"What are you saying? You're my niece, after all. We’re family. It’s only natural I’d want to see you after so long."

"Is that so? How thoughtful of you." Evelyn arched a brow.

'Family? I haven’t spoken to any of them in years. Who would believe she actually missed me?'

Her gaze flickered to the man across from her, and she frowned. "And this is…?"

'Please don’t tell me this is some long-lost cousin.'

Yvette beamed. "This is Mr. Zimmerman’s grandson from Cornelia. You must know of his grandfather—the Zimmermans were once very close with our family. And this is Mrs. Zimmerman."

Mrs. Zimmerman scrutinized Evelyn with an unreadable expression before pursing her lips. "So this is Richard’s daughter with Isabella? She’s certainly pretty, but I wonder if she’s hardworking."

Yvette laughed. "Oh, all women become hardworking after marriage. Besides, Zoe is highly educated. Where else would the Zimmermans find such a refined daughter-in-law in Cornelia?"

Mrs. Zimmerman seemed somewhat convinced.

Noticing her son’s unwavering stare at Evelyn, she could guess exactly what he was thinking.

Evelyn finally pieced it together.

'Ah. So this is a setup.'

Her expression cooled. "Aunt Yvette, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. I was under the impression this was a family gathering, not a matchmaking session."

Madam Victoria interjected smoothly. "Zoe, your aunt simply thought of you now that you’re of marriageable age. You should be grateful she found you such a prestigious match from Cornelia."
###Chapter 212

"Indeed, Zoe, the Zimmermans hold considerable prestige in Cornelia. You'd have nothing to worry about if you married into their family." Yvette and Madam Victoria spoke in perfect unison, their eagerness to wed Evelyn to the Zimmermans practically vibrating through the lavish dining room.

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "I already have children. Are the Zimmermans so desperate that they'd accept a ready-made family with their chosen daughter-in-law?"

Yvette and Mrs. Zimmerman's faces darkened instantly. Madam Victoria recovered first. "Zoe, what nonsense is this? Since when do you have children?"

"Whether I have children or not, you can confirm with Father." Evelyn crossed her arms, leaning back with deliberate nonchalance. "Their father happens to be Mr. Goldmann. So tell me, no matter how influential the Zimmermans are in Cornelia, how could they possibly compare to Nathan Goldmann?"

Mrs. Zimmerman's expression turned mortified. She glared at Yvette. "Were you lying to my son and me?"

"Mrs. Zimmerman, please don't misunderstand." Yvette forced a placating smile before turning to Evelyn. "Zoe, stop these ridiculous claims. If you'd truly given birth, the Vanderbilts would know. Don't make up stories."

'Mother did mention Evelyn's involvement with the legendary Nathan Goldmann of Bassburgh,' Yvette thought, 'but Lydia also has her sights set on him. If I don't help her secure Goldmann, how will my daughter ever stand a chance?'

'So whether these children exist or not, I'll make sure this marriage happens regardless.'

Her gaze flickered to Jacob Zimmerman, who hadn't stopped staring at Evelyn since she entered.

'That lecherous fool is practically drooling over her. Perfect.'

"If this is a blind date," Evelyn said, rising gracefully, "then I'm wasting my time. None of you have any right to decide my marital future."

Lydia jumped up to stop her. "Evelyn, don't be upset. At least stay for dinner."

"Yes, Zoe," Yvette added hastily, "we'll discuss this later. The appetizers are coming. Leaving now would embarrass us all terribly." She couldn't let this golden opportunity slip away - she needed to trap Evelyn into this marriage today.

Their desperation was almost comical.

'They want to shackle me to this stranger so badly?' Evelyn thought bitterly. 'Is this what they call family?'

'To them, kinship is just another transaction.'

Resuming her seat with a practiced smile, Evelyn said, "You're right. It would be terribly rude to leave now."

"Exactly, Zoe!" Madam Victoria beamed. "You've always been the most sensible Vanderbilt."

'Not that it will help her escape today,' the old woman thought smugly.

As courses were served, Yvette turned to Jacob. "So Jacob, what do you think of our Zoe?"

"Magnificent... absolutely magnificent." Jacob's hungry gaze never left Evelyn. "I've never encountered a woman of such caliber in Cornelia. None of my previous companions could compare."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Zimmerman has... interesting taste. Do illegitimate children make a woman more appealing to you?"

Mrs. Zimmerman stiffened, but her son barely registered the comment. "It doesn't matter," Jacob declared. "We live in modern times - even divorced women remarry. Why should I care about children? I'll treat you like royalty if you'll have me."

"Oh? Really?" Evelyn's lips curved dangerously.

Jacob, utterly enchanted, nodded eagerly. "Absolutely!"

Seeing her son's intoxicated state, Mrs. Zimmerman interjected sharply. "Any children would remain with their father. The Zimmermans won't be raising another man's offspring - imagine the scandal!"
###Chapter 213

"A woman who's been with other men wants to bring her illegitimate children into the Zimmerman estate? Absolutely not."

Mrs. Zimmerman's lips tightened into a disapproving line, though she reluctantly accepted the reality of Evelyn's situation when she saw her son's determined expression.

"Once she's part of our family, she'll still need to serve me properly."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Would you have me abandon my own flesh and blood?"

"Zoe!" Madam Victoria's voice turned shrill. "The Zimmermans won't accept those children, yet you insist on bringing them into Jacob's household? Have you lost your mind?"

'This little slut is trying to sabotage the marriage arrangement. Over my dead body!'

Madam Victoria shot a meaningful glance at Yvette, who immediately understood the unspoken command.

'What's done cannot be undone. We'll make sure this marriage happens today, by force if necessary.'

The Vanderbilt women's synchronized manipulation could have won them theater awards. Across the table, Jacob kept stealing glances at Evelyn, his desire growing with each passing moment until he could barely contain himself.

Evelyn ignored his lecherous stares, gracefully sampling the dishes before her with practiced caution. She hadn't touched a single drink offered by others.

Madam Victoria's fingers drummed impatiently against the tablecloth.

'How are we supposed to drug her if she won't drink anything?'

Fortunately, Yvette had anticipated this. Every sealed beverage placed before Evelyn contained nearly invisible needle punctures - a precaution reserved solely for her place setting.

They'd expected this cunning vixen would refuse anything poured by others.

After sipping half her drink, Evelyn noticed the conspiratorial glances exchanged between Yvette and Madam Victoria. A cold smile curved her lips as she set the bottle aside and reached for more food.

"Zoe, you're barely eating," Madam Victoria simpered, piling more food onto Evelyn's plate. "A growing girl needs her strength."

Suddenly, Evelyn pressed a hand to her forehead, swaying slightly before collapsing onto the table.

"Zoe? Zoe!" Madam Victoria shook her roughly.

Mrs. Zimmerman frowned. "What's wrong with her?"

Yvette smoothly interjected, "She's feeling unwell. Lydia, help your cousin to the guest room."

Lydia rose with a saccharine smile. "Of course."

As she supported Evelyn's limp form, Lydia couldn't suppress her triumphant smirk. Everything was going according to plan.

"Why would she suddenly fall ill?" Mrs. Zimmerman's displeasure was evident.

Jacob immediately intervened. "Mother, please. She'll be my wife soon. Don't you want me to marry?"

"Fine, fine. Have it your way." Mrs. Zimmerman relented, though her lips remained pursed. Her son's happiness was paramount, even if it meant tolerating this... situation.

Yvette turned to Jacob. "You should check on them. Lydia might not be... thorough enough in her care."

Jacob needed no further encouragement. His barely restrained excitement made him abandon all pretense of finishing his meal. "I'll go at once."

Lydia guided Evelyn into the prearranged room, barely containing her glee as she deposited the unconscious woman onto the bed.

"After Jacob has his way with you," she sneered, "no man of quality would want spoiled goods. Certainly not Mr. Goldmann."

'A tainted woman could never compare to my purity!'

Though Jacob came from Coralia's prestigious Zimmerman family, his reputation was anything but respectable. Known equally for his gambling debts and wandering hands, no respectable Coralian woman would have him - which made Evelyn Vanderbilt the perfect target.
###Chapter 214

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open the moment Lydia turned to leave.

She rose swiftly from the couch, delivering a precise strike to Lydia's neck that sent her collapsing to the floor.

Dragging the unconscious woman onto the plush sofa, Evelyn smirked. "Since you wanted to play dirty, don't blame me for turning the tables."

She'd come prepared.

Stopping at a pharmacy en route had been a stroke of genius - the specialized antidote now coursing through her veins would neutralize any date rape drugs for the next four hours.

The drink bottles had appeared perfectly sealed, but Evelyn's sharp eyes had caught the nearly invisible puncture marks near each cap.

Drawing the curtains plunged the VIP room into shadow just as the door handle turned. Evelyn ducked behind the sofa, letting out a breathy moan. "Lights off... please."

Jacob Zimmerman froze mid-reach for the switch, a lecherous grin spreading across his face. "Ooh, someone's feeling adventurous tonight."

Disgust churned in Evelyn's stomach, but she forced a sultry laugh. "Mr. Zimmerman... I'm waiting... on the couch... feeling so... dizzy..."

"Coming, my sweet little kitten," Jacob crooned, already fumbling with his belt.

Blind in the darkness, Jacob's hands found warm flesh. "My, my, someone's eager," he chuckled, hastily shedding his clothes.

The sounds of fabric hitting the floor mingled with increasingly vulgar moans.

Evelyn used the noise cover to crawl silently toward the exit.

Too preoccupied with his conquest, Jacob never noticed his intended prey slipping away.

The door clicked shut behind Evelyn. She flipped the placard to "DO NOT DISTURB" with cold satisfaction.

'Madam Victoria and Yvette's faces will be priceless when they discover this little scene,' she thought, smoothing her dress.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn strolled calmly back to the dining room. The shock on Yvette and Madam Victoria's faces was almost comical.

"Zoe! How are you—"

"Is something wrong?" Evelyn blinked innocently. "I just needed some air. Didn't Lydia take me to rest? Where is she?"

Yvette's chair screeched across the floor as she bolted toward the private rooms, Madam Victoria and Mrs. Zimmerman hot on her heels.

Evelyn followed at a leisurely pace, anticipation curling her lips.

The scene Yvette barged in on would haunt her forever.

The sudden light revealed Jacob mid-thrust—with her own daughter beneath him.

"You!" Jacob recoiled like he'd been burned, scrambling for his pants. "What the hell—"

"You animal!" Yvette launched herself at him, nails raking his face. "You've ruined my Lydia!"

Mrs. Zimmerman shoved Yvette away violently. "Your harlot daughter seduced my boy! This was clearly her doing!"

"Mom, this bitch set me up!" Jacob howled, his face purpling with rage. He'd expected filet mignon and been served ground beef instead.
###Chapter 215

Madam Victoria staggered back, her face pale with shock. "This—This was supposed to be Evelyn! How did—"

'Didn't we drug that little witch?'

Evelyn strolled in, her eyes widening in feigned surprise as she covered her mouth. "Oh my! What on earth happened here?"

"Evelyn, you vile creature! This is your doing, isn't it?" Yvette lunged forward, her hand raised to strike, but Evelyn dodged effortlessly.

Evelyn darted behind Mrs. Zimmerman, her voice trembling with false innocence. "How can you blame me? Lydia was the one who confessed her admiration for Mr. Zimmerman while leading me here. She even knocked me out! When I woke up, I was in a different room entirely."

"Lies!" Yvette shrieked.

Just then, the unconscious woman on the couch stirred, her eyelids fluttering open. Her body ached as she took in the crowd gathered around her. Then she looked down—and froze.

She was naked.

A scream tore from Lydia’s throat as she scrambled to cover herself. "Why—Why am I here?!"

Her wild gaze landed on Evelyn—and then on Jacob Zimmerman, who sat beside her, equally exposed.

Memories flooded back.

"Evelyn, you scheming b*tch!" Lydia howled. "You set me up!"

Evelyn blinked, her expression the picture of wounded confusion. "Me? If anyone was scheming, it was you and Aunt Yvette. I felt sick after drinking what you gave me. You were the one who dragged me here, whispering about your undying love for Mr. Zimmerman."

"That’s a lie! I never—"

"Then explain why you’re the one in his bed," Evelyn countered coolly. "If you hadn’t confessed your feelings, I would’ve been the one in your place. But how could I stand in the way of true love? Especially when I was unconscious?"

Lydia’s mind raced.

'After I left Evelyn in the room, something hit me—then darkness.'

She pointed a shaking finger. "You! You knocked me out!"

Evelyn’s lips quivered, tears welling in her eyes. "I was unconscious too. Grandmother and Aunt Yvette know exactly what was in that drink, don’t they?"

Madam Victoria and Yvette stiffened, their faces burning with humiliation.

They did know.

Because they had drugged it themselves.

Evelyn bit back a smirk, savoring their panic.

She turned to Mrs. Zimmerman, her voice soft with resignation. "It seems I can no longer be considered a suitable match for your family. I understand—I’m a mother now, after all. The Zimmermans deserve purity. But Lydia…"

Her gaze flicked to her cousin. "She’s untouched, well-mannered, and utterly devoted to your son. Wouldn’t she make a far better bride?"

Madam Victoria and Yvette looked ready to combust.

Their plan had backfired spectacularly.

Instead of trapping Evelyn, they’d handed Lydia to Jacob on a silver platter.

Jacob recoiled in disgust. "Mother, I refuse to marry her! I don’t care how long she’s admired me—she’s beneath me! Look at her!"

"Enough!" Mrs. Zimmerman snapped. "You’ve ruined her virtue. The Zimmermans do not shirk responsibility. You will marry her."

Evelyn’s gamble had paid off.

'The Zimmermans prize reputation above all. Why settle for a woman with a child when they can have an untouched maiden?'

She hid her smile behind a demure bow.

The trap had closed—just not on her.
###Chapter 216

"No, Mrs. Zimmerman."

"You don't think my son is worthy of you?" Mrs. Zimmerman's piercing gaze locked onto Yvette, whose face showed utter devastation.

"Indeed, Lydia is fortunate to marry into the Zimmerman family. Pity I wasn't so lucky." Evelyn struggled to suppress her laughter, though her sparkling eyes gave her away.

Madam Victoria nearly collapsed, her carefully laid plans crumbling before her eyes. Not only had her schemes failed, but Lydia had lost her virtue in the process.

Yvette felt the same bitter disappointment. She had dreamed of Lydia marrying into Bassburgh's elite, yet now her daughter had been compromised by Jacob Zimmerman.

All because of Evelyn.

Yvette's eyes burned with hatred as she glared at the young woman.

Evelyn noticed the venomous look, but she was accustomed to such animosity. This was simply poetic justice - they were reaping what they'd sown!

The boardroom fell silent as Oliver opened the heavy doors. Nathan, seated at the head of the table, immediately sensed something amiss.

Oliver nodded to the executives before approaching Nathan with urgent news.

Nathan's expression darkened. "Why am I only hearing about this now?"

"The meeting ran longer than anticipated-" Oliver explained helplessly. Gregory had been insistent, and Ms. Vanderbilt hadn't returned for quite some time.

Oliver knew exactly how important Evelyn was to Nathan - how his world would shatter if anything happened to her.

Nathan closed his folder decisively. "We're adjourned."

Loosening his tie, he strode out with Oliver, his face stormy. The confused executives exchanged bewildered glances, left without explanation.

Nathan ordered Oliver to track Evelyn's location and rushed to the hotel, only to find her exiting calmly.

Oliver blinked in surprise. Everything appeared normal.

Had Gregory overreacted?

From the backseat, Nathan watched Evelyn's unhurried steps and felt his tension ease. He'd worried unnecessarily - this woman never let anyone walk over her.

Just as he prepared to exit the car, a man approached Evelyn, speaking animatedly.

When the stranger reached for Evelyn's arm, the temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees.

Evelyn hadn't expected Jacob to be so persistent. With a practiced smile, she removed his hand. "Mr. Zimmerman, please maintain some decorum. Lydia would make a far more suitable Zimmerman daughter-in-law, don't you think?"

"That clumsy girl? Never. Zoe, from the moment I saw you, I knew-"

Jacob wasn't about to let this beauty slip away. If not for Lydia's interference, she would already be his.

Love at first sight? Love?

Evelyn's eyes danced with silent laughter. The man was clearly only interested in her appearance.

"Why chase after a woman with children?" Evelyn said with dwindling patience, turning to leave.

Jacob grabbed her arm again. "I don't care about that! Zoe, I truly-"

Suddenly, a strong arm wrapped around Evelyn's waist, pulling her against a firm chest. The faint scent of expensive cologne surrounded her as she collided with the familiar warmth, leaving her momentarily breathless.

###Chapter 217 Why Was Nathan There?

Jacob Zimmerman froze mid-step, his expression twisting in displeasure. "Who the hell are you?"

"The father of her children."

Nathan Goldmann's icy glare could have frozen the entire park. This insignificant man wouldn't lay a finger on his woman.

Jacob's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, paralyzed by the sheer dominance radiating from the taller man.

Evelyn Vanderbilt nestled deeper into Nathan's embrace, looping her arms around his neck with practiced ease. "Darling, what kept you?" The pet name dripped from her lips like honey, instantly dissolving the storm clouds in Nathan's eyes.

His grip tightened possessively around her waist while his other hand tilted her chin up. "Seems I arrived just in time to catch a thief trying to steal what's mine."

Evelyn arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Then take me home."

Home.

The word sent an unexpected warmth through Nathan's chest.

"Zee—" Jacob tried again, but a single warning look from Nathan had him stumbling backward.

Who was this terrifying man?

Inside the sleek black Bentley, Evelyn squirmed on Nathan's lap. "Are you planning to let go anytime soon?"

Nathan's fingers traced idle patterns on her thigh. "Using me as your shield and now throwing me away? That's cold, even for you."

Evelyn bit her lower lip, acutely aware of Oliver Lawson's presence in the driver's seat. This compromising position would fuel office gossip for weeks.

"Who was that cockroach?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low.

Evelyn shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "Another pawn in Grandmother's matchmaking schemes."

The arm around her waist became an iron band.

Evelyn gasped as her body molded against his, their faces inches apart. "Nathan Goldmann, what—"

"Tell me you didn't entertain that fool." His breath fanned across her lips.

"Please." Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Madam Vanderbilt is so desperate to push Lydia into your bed that she's auctioning me off to the highest bidder." Her nails dug into his shoulders. "This is your mess to clean up."

Nathan studied the fire in her eyes—the same fire that first drew him to her. The Vanderbilts would pay for treating his woman like disposable goods.

"Evelyn," he murmured against her temple, "there will only ever be one Mrs. Goldmann."

She turned her face away, but not before he caught the faint blush. "I never applied for the position."

Nathan's smirk was pure sin. "Should I start interviewing stepmothers for our children then?"

Evelyn's silence spoke volumes.

Over my dead body, Nathan thought with dark satisfaction.

Meanwhile, back in Cornelia...

Lydia Vanderbilt's hysterical sobs echoed through the Vanderbilt estate. Her mother, Yvette Warren, had dragged her back in disgrace after the failed seduction attempt. Virginity lost to Jacob Zimmerman wasn't part of Madam Victoria's grand plan.

The old matriarch turned her back on her weeping granddaughter. Some investments simply weren't worth salvaging.

Three days later, federal agents swarmed the Vanderbilt Hot Springs Resort. York Vanderbilt, the family's eldest son, was arrested on charges of corruption and money laundering.

Coincidence?

Nathan Goldmann didn't believe in coincidences.
###Chapter 218

The scandal exploded across every major news outlet.

Madam Victoria watched in horror as her eldest son York was dragged away in handcuffs. Their Cornelian assets were frozen, their business empire teetering on the brink of collapse. Desperate, she turned to her only remaining hope—Richard.

"Richard, he's your brother! You must save him!"

Richard clenched his fists as his mother sobbed before him. "He was caught laundering money, Mother. How exactly am I supposed to fix this?"

His voice cracked with frustration. "I warned him—repeatedly—but did he listen? Now the entire world knows. What do you expect me to do?"

Helplessness weighed him down.

He had built his life in Bassburgh to escape the toxicity of his family. His mother had always favored York, turning a blind eye to his shady dealings in Cornelia.

Then Madam Victoria's eyes lit up with sudden realization. "Zoe! She's involved with Nathan Goldmann! Ask her to speak to him—he has the influence to make this disappear!"

Richard let out a bitter laugh. "So now you remember you have a granddaughter?"

Tears streamed down her wrinkled face. "I'm your mother. Must you push me to my grave?"

His expression hardened. Yes, she was his mother. And despite everything, he couldn't abandon her.

"...Fine. I'll talk to Zoe."

When Evelyn saw the headlines about the Vanderbilts, she knew Nathan was responsible.

Only he could uncover York's illicit activities so swiftly.

The Vanderbilt name was now synonymous with scandal. She braced herself—her grandmother would come running to Richard.

The call came sooner than expected.

"Zoe," Richard's voice was heavy. "We need to talk about your uncle."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "You want me to save him."

Of course. Her grandmother had sent him as her messenger.

Richard hesitated. "I know how you feel about them. But they're still family. Just this once—help me. After this, I'll ensure your grandmother never troubles you again."

He hated dragging her into this. But if this was the price to free himself from his mother's demands, he'd pay it.

Evelyn stayed silent.

The Vanderbilts had never treated her as family. Their cruelty still stung.

But then—an idea flickered in her mind.

Her jaw tightened.

"...Fine. Just this once."

Evelyn strode into Nathan's office without knocking.

He glanced up from his paperwork, arching a brow at her unannounced visit. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

"I need a favor." She stopped before his desk, voice steady. "Release York Vanderbilt."

Nathan's expression darkened. He studied her for a long moment. "You're pleading for them?"

Was she really this forgiving after everything they'd done?

"No." Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "I'm doing this for my father."
###Chapter 219

Evelyn pressed her lips together firmly before adding, "Our only priority is securing York's release. The travel agency and everything else—that's not my concern."

She could help free her uncle, but she would never forget what Yvette and Madam Victoria had done to her.

This was solely for her father's sake. The rest of their mess wasn't her problem.

Of course, if they refused to change their ways, that would be a different story entirely.

Nathan stood, closing the distance between them in a few strides. He leaned down slightly, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "I can get him out, but—"

His arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. "What do I get in return?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Of course he would exploit the situation.

She blinked once, slowly. A kiss was just a kiss. What difference would a few more make?

Before she could act, his finger pressed against her lips, his eyes darkening with intensity. "You're not getting off that easily."

She swatted his hand away. "Then what do you want?"

"You." His answer was immediate, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she caught the shift in his demeanor. Just as she opened her mouth to retort, his lips crashed onto hers, silencing any protest.

The Next Day

Madam Victoria received the call from Yvette and nearly sagged in relief at the news—York had been released.

But then Yvette continued, her voice strained, and Madam Victoria collapsed onto the couch. "What? We're being shut down?"

"Completely. There's nothing we can do. Mother, the business is finished. The Zimmermans are already backing out of Lydia's engagement because of this."

Though Yvette loved her daughter, frustration simmered beneath the surface. Jacob had ruined Lydia, and now their family's reputation was in tatters.

There was no undoing the past.

They could still marry Lydia off, but with their current disgrace, no respectable family would want her.

"Mother, why not let Henry take over Richard's jewelry business?" Yvette pressed. "He has no son. The company should stay within the family—not be handed to a daughter who'll marry out and take it with her."

Madam Victoria had considered this for years. With their Coralia ventures collapsing, Viana Jewelry was their last lifeline.

She marched into Richard's study and laid out her demand.

His reaction was instant fury. "Have you lost your mind? You want me to hand my company over to my nephew?"

"I'm perfectly sane," she snapped. "Viana is a Vanderbilt legacy. You can't possibly intend to leave it to Evelyn."

Madam Victoria's lips curled. "She'll marry Nathan Goldmann. She won't need it. Henry is your blood—he should inherit."

Richard's jaw clenched, his fists trembling at his sides.

Madam Victoria softened her tone, coaxing. "Richard, don't defy me now. I know you love your daughter, but she'll never want for anything with Goldmann. Viana is all we have left."

When he remained silent, she pressed further. "Don't overthink it. Listen to me. Evelyn won't miss one small company."
###Chapter 220

The tension in the study was palpable.

"Mom, Viana Jewelry was founded by Zoe's mother. I can't just hand it over to my nephew," Richard said firmly, his voice edged with frustration.

Madam Victoria's face twisted with anger. "Why not? Isabella has been gone for years. The company is yours now. Why should you care about the wishes of someone who's no longer here?"

She scoffed, her tone dripping with disdain. "Besides, Isabella was never kind to you when she was alive. Look how she treated you. What's stopping you?"

Evelyn stood frozen outside the study, her heart pounding as she overheard the cruel words about her mother. Without hesitation, she pushed the door open, her expression dark.

"What did you just say?"

Richard stiffened. Had she heard everything?

Madam Victoria's eyes widened in shock. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. "I just got Uncle York released. I came to congratulate you, but instead, I heard you insulting my mother."

She tilted her head, a cold smile playing on her lips. "Maybe I shouldn’t have bothered."

"He's your uncle!" Madam Victoria snapped.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "I know. But beyond that, I don’t owe the Vanderbilts anything."

She stepped closer, her voice steady. "I helped Uncle York for my father’s sake, not for anyone from Cornelia."

Madam Victoria’s face turned ashen. "Zoe, I’m your grandmother. You should show some respect."

Evelyn laughed humorlessly. "Respect? After what you and Aunt Yvette tried to pull—forcing me to marry Jacob? You lost any right to my respect."

Richard’s expression darkened. "What?"

He knew Jacob Zimmerman’s reputation was abysmal. The thought that his own mother and sister-in-law would try to trap Evelyn into such a marriage made his blood boil.

Madam Victoria paled, caught off guard. "That’s nonsense! Lydia is the one marrying Mr. Zimmerman. Are you still not satisfied?"

"Enough!" Richard’s voice cut through the room like a blade. "You’re my mother, and I’ve always respected you. But if you truly did that to Evelyn, you’ve crossed a line."

His jaw tightened. "Whatever happens to the Vanderbilts is your concern, but I will never give Viana Jewelry to Henry."

Madam Victoria’s eyes flashed with fury. "Fine! If you’re going to defy me like this, then I’m leaving!"

She stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

The silence that followed was heavy.

Evelyn watched her father’s face, his sorrow evident. She softened slightly. "Dad, I won’t let you give Viana to Henry."

She knew Madam Victoria saw the company as a lifeline for the Vanderbilts—ripe for the taking.

But her father wasn’t blind to her schemes.

Richard exhaled slowly. "I know. I wouldn’t give it to your cousin either. Don’t worry."

Evelyn nodded, a flicker of relief in her eyes. "I trust you."

Richard’s heart clenched at her words. He hadn’t expected her faith, and now, he was determined to prove himself worthy of it.

Viana Jewelry would remain safe—until Zoe was ready to take the reins.

At Soul Jewelry Studio...
###Chapter 221

The evening air was thick with unspoken tension as Evelyn Vanderbilt adjusted the silver tassel earrings that swayed with every step she took. The royal blue off-shoulder dress clung to her frame, the gauzy skirt whispering against her ankles like a secret.

Nathan Goldmann watched her approach, his gaze darkening with every second.

"You look stunning," he murmured, his voice low and rough.

Evelyn’s cheeks warmed, but she kept her composure. "You didn’t have to reserve the entire restaurant."

His lips curved. "I didn’t want distractions."

The steakhouse was dimly lit, the flickering candles casting shadows across his sharp features. For once, the ruthless CEO looked almost… human.

Evelyn picked up her wine glass, but Nathan’s fingers wrapped around her wrist, stopping her.

"Don’t," he warned, amusement glinting in his eyes. "We have plans later."

She nearly choked.

The memory of yesterday’s reckless promise burned in her mind. She had been too confident, too careless. Now, she was trapped in a game she couldn’t back out of.

Nathan leaned in, his breath brushing her ear. "You’re not getting out of this, Evelyn."

Her pulse spiked.

The rest of the meal passed in a haze. Every glance, every accidental touch sent sparks through her. She was hyper-aware of him—his scent, the way his fingers curled around his fork, the way his eyes never truly left her.

Then, midnight struck.

Fireworks exploded outside the window, painting the sky in bursts of gold and crimson. Evelyn turned, mesmerized.

Nathan stood behind her, his body pressing close. "Do you like it?"

She barely had time to nod before his lips brushed her cheek.

Her breath hitched.

The wine, the lights, the way his hands settled on her waist—it was too much.

Nathan’s grip tightened. His voice was rough with restraint. "You have no idea what you do to me."

Evelyn swallowed.

She was in trouble.

Deep, delicious trouble.
###Chapter 222

Evelyn felt Nathan's warm breath against her ear as he murmured, "I can't wait another second."

His lips captured hers in a searing kiss.

In the luxurious penthouse suite...

Nathan pressed Evelyn down onto the rose-petal strewn bed, his mouth moving hungrily over hers. The passion between them burned hotter than ever.

Her dark hair fanned across the silk sheets, each strand teasing his senses.

"How should I punish you for making me wait so long?" His deep voice sent shivers down her spine.

"May I?" he whispered against her neck, his hands roaming possessively.

Evelyn gasped as he sought her consent. Heat flooded her cheeks. "You bastard...asking now of all times—Mmm!"

Nathan's grip tightened around her waist, but then—

Her phone rang.

The shrill tone shattered the moment. Evelyn pushed against his shoulders. "Nathan, I have to—"

"Let it ring," he growled through clenched teeth.

But the persistent caller wouldn't give up. With a mischievous smile, Evelyn flipped their positions and grabbed his silk tie.

Nathan's eyes darkened with anticipation. "Taking charge, darling?"

She secured his wrists to the headboard with expert knots—then sprang up to answer her phone.

Richard's urgent voice made her blood run cold. "Your grandmother's been in an accident. Get to the hospital immediately."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she hung up. She turned to find Nathan had already freed himself, his expression stormy.

"I have to go," she whispered, leaning in to brush her lips against his.

Nathan caught the back of her head, deepening the kiss before releasing her with a frustrated groan. "You owe me."

At the hospital entrance, Nathan stopped her to drape his tailored jacket over her shoulders. "It's cold inside."

Evelyn's heart fluttered at the gesture.

Inside the private ward, Madam Victoria lay propped up in bed—with Laura seated dutifully beside her.

"Disgraceful!" Madam Victoria spat when she noticed Evelyn's attire. "Parading around in a man's clothes!"

Evelyn smiled coolly. "Mr. Goldmann was concerned for my comfort. Nothing disgraceful about that."

Madam Victoria's tirade died at Nathan's name. She turned to Richard. "If not for Laura, I wouldn't be here. She got injured saving me. You must take your wife back."

Richard remained silent.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed.

'Laura saved her?'

The bandages on Laura's hands seemed suspiciously pristine.

"Don't trouble yourself, Mother," Laura said meekly. "Consider this repayment for your kindness all these years."
###Chapter 223

"Who told you that you don't deserve it? You saved my life. That makes you the greatest benefactor of the Vanderbilts." Madam Victoria's voice trembled slightly, her hands still shaking from the near-fatal accident. If Laura hadn't rushed forward and pushed her out of the way, she would have been crushed beneath the wheels.

"Richard, you're not a young man anymore. Stop obsessing over divorce. Laura has been your wife for years. So what if she faked a pregnancy? She only wanted to give you a son. Was that so wrong?"

Madam Victoria shot a sharp glance at Evelyn as she spoke. "We're family. Why make things difficult for your own flesh and blood?"

The words were clearly aimed at Evelyn.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, a smirk playing on her lips. "How convenient, Grandma. Just as you were about to be hit by a car, Ms. Scott miraculously appeared to save you. What are the odds?"

Laura bit her lip.

Damn you, Evelyn Vanderbilt! You're really here to ruin everything, aren't you?

"Zoe, I know you despise me, but I didn’t save your grandmother with ulterior motives. I don’t even want to return to the Vanderbilts, nor do I expect your father’s forgiveness." Laura stood slowly, her voice soft but firm. "I should go."

"Go where? Sit down," Madam Victoria commanded, her tone brooking no argument. "The divorce isn’t finalized yet, is it? You’ve made such a scene over this. I’ll overlook it because Zoe is being unreasonable, but why must you act the same?"

Richard, who had been silent until now, finally spoke. "Stay with Mother."

Laura nodded obediently and resumed her seat.

Seeing Richard exit the ward, Evelyn followed.

Madam Victoria huffed and patted Laura’s hand reassuringly. "Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, you’ll return to the Vanderbilt manor."

Laura smiled sweetly. "Thank you, Mother."

Outside the ward, Richard turned to Evelyn with a conflicted expression. "Zoe, about Laura… she saved your grandmother, and she’s admitted her mistakes. I want to give her another chance. Will you forgive me for that?"

Evelyn’s expression darkened. "Are you sure you can trust her again?"

"Zoe, I know you dislike her—"

Evelyn cut him off. "This isn’t about whether I like her or not. If this is your decision, then let her return. Just don’t blindly trust her this time." Her words carried a warning.

Richard seemed to understand the underlying message, but he still chose to believe Laura again.

Evelyn didn’t stop him. Laura’s desperate attempt to win back Madam Victoria’s favor only proved she had deeper motives.

She wanted to see what Laura was truly planning.

Evelyn walked out of the hospital. Spotting Nathan leaning against his sleek car, already being approached by two women, she sighed and rubbed her temples.

Having an expensive car is one thing, but when the man driving it is this ridiculously handsome, it’s a problem.

She strode forward. The two women turned, taking in Evelyn’s confident stride and the way she wore a man’s coat draped over her shoulders. Realization dawned, and they quickly retreated.

"Let’s go. He’s taken. What a shame…"

Evelyn handed Nathan his coat back. "Why didn’t you wait inside the car?"

Nathan crossed his arms, a smirk tugging at his lips. "It was too hot. I needed some air."

Evelyn pretended she hadn’t just asked that. A pang of guilt hit her when she saw him standing outside in just a thin shirt.

Nathan turned, pressing her gently against the car door, his gaze intense. "No more interruptions tonight, right?"

Evelyn’s eyes flickered mischievously. "It’s already late, so…"
###Chapter 224

Nathan's voice was dangerously low as he whispered against Evelyn's ear, "Zoe, if I suffer any consequences from restraining myself tonight, you'll be the one to blame."

Back at the Goldmann estate, Nathan carried Evelyn straight upstairs and tossed her onto the bed.

She scrambled to push him away, her cheeks flushed. "The kids—they're home! This isn't appropriate—"

"They're asleep," he murmured, peeling away her clothes like unwrapping a gift.

"But—the hotel suite! It'll go to waste!"

"I don't care about the money."

"Nathan—mmph!" His lips crashed against hers, swallowing her protests.

Just as she struggled to catch her breath, he suddenly pulled back. The air between them grew thick with tension.

Nathan stood abruptly, his back turned to her, his jaw tight.

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

That's it?

She stole a glance at him.

This man, with his godlike physique and devastating charm… has performance issues? So he really never touched Vivian all those years? Then what happened between us six years ago must have been a fluke.

Her heart softened.

If that's the case, I can't let him feel embarrassed. He's been so good to the kids. I should be more understanding.

"Nathan," she said gently, "it's okay. Even if you have… limitations, I won't judge you."

Silence would have been better.

His gaze snapped to hers, icy and sharp. "Are you questioning my ability?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but he was already pinning her beneath him. "I think I need to prove myself."

In the next moment, she realized her mistake.

The night stretched endlessly.

Morning light filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn groaned as she stirred, every muscle in her body aching. Her throat was raw.

I should never have said that.

An arm slid around her waist, pulling her back against a hard chest. A deep, satisfied voice rumbled against her ear. "Awake?"

She shivered.

This man is insatiable.

By late afternoon, Evelyn finally returned to her studio, wearing a high-necked sweater to hide the marks on her skin.

As she entered, she spotted a tall, elegant man studying the jewelry display.

Her pulse jumped when he turned.

Lucas Laurent?

She crossed her arms, eyeing him from the sofa. "Did Mrs. de Arma send you?"

Lucas took a sip of tea, his expression unreadable. "Consider it so. My mother wishes to see you. I know you've avoided her because of the Vanderbilt situation, so I came instead."

"I told you—I don't claim the de Arma name. I'm a Vanderbilt."

"But you don't acknowledge them either," he countered smoothly. "Your ties to the Vanderbilts aren't as strong as you pretend, are they?"

Evelyn paused, meeting his gaze. "Even if my relationship with them is strained, it doesn't change my bloodline."

"Whether you accept the de Arma name or not doesn't matter." He set down his cup. "My grandfather simply wants to reunite with his granddaughter."

He slid a business card across the table. "When you're ready to learn about your mother, contact me."

Her eyes flicked to the embossed logo.

Royal Academy of Music?
###Chapter 225

No one could fathom how Nathan managed to say it with such solemnity. "Zoe, if I suffer any consequences from suppressing these urges, you'll be the one to blame..."

Upon returning to the Goldmann estate, Nathan swept Evelyn off her feet and carried her straight upstairs, tossing her onto the plush bed.

Evelyn scrambled to push against his looming figure. "The children—they're home! This isn't appropriate—"

"They're fast asleep." Nathan began peeling away her clothes like unwrapping a precious gift.

"But—the hotel suite! It'll go to waste!"

"That pocket change means nothing to me."

"Nathan—Mmmph!" Her protest was swallowed by his searing kiss.

Just as Evelyn gasped for air, Nathan abruptly pulled away, leaving an awkward tension hanging between them.

He turned his back, his chiseled profile suddenly rigid.

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

"That's it?"

Her sidelong glance at Nathan spoke volumes.

"This devastatingly handsome man with a godlike physique actually has... performance issues? So he truly never touched Vivian all those years. That night six years ago must have been a fluke."

"If that's the case... how tragic. But this concerns his masculine pride. Staying silent might wound him deeper."

"Given how wonderfully he treats the children, I should be more considerate."

"Nathan," she said gently, "even if you have... difficulties, I'd never judge you."

'Comforting him is the right thing to do, isn't it?'

Her words acted like a detonator. Nathan's gaze turned arctic. "Are you doubting my capabilities?"

Evelyn's reassuring smile froze as his weight pinned her down again. "Seems I need to prove myself."

What followed made Evelyn realize her grave mistake.

That night stretched into eternity.

Dawn arrived—

Evelyn pried her eyes open, every muscle screaming in protest, her throat raw.

'I should've kept my mouth shut!'

An arm snaked around her waist as a sleep-roughened voice murmured, "Awake already?" His breath tickled her nape.

Evelyn shuddered.

'This man grows insatiable!'

By twilight, Evelyn finally returned to Soul Jewelry, a high-necked blouse hiding the evidence of last night's activities.

At the studio's entrance, a statuesque figure stood examining the display window.

Her breath hitched when Lucas Laurent turned.

'Professor Laurent? What's he doing here?'

Perched on the sofa, Evelyn crossed her arms. "Did Madam de Arma send you?"

Lucas sipped his tea calmly. "Consider it so. Mother wishes to meet you. Knowing your reluctance due to the Vanderbilt entanglement, I came instead."

"My name is Vanderbilt—"

"Yet you deny that affiliation too," Lucas countered. "Your ties to them are tenuous at best."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her cup. "Blood doesn't lie."

"Whether you claim the de Arma name matters little." Lucas set down his porcelain cup with deliberate grace. "Grandfather simply wants his granddaughter home."

He slid a business card across the table. "When you're ready to learn about your mother, contact me."

Evelyn's gaze caught the embossed crest—Royal Academy of Music. 'A professor? Interesting.'
###Chapter 226

Evelyn knew she needed to act quickly before things spiraled out of control.

At Soul Jewelry Studio...

The office gradually emptied as employees left for the evening.

Nathan leaned against Evelyn's office doorway, arms crossed, watching her search through documents by the bookshelf. His gaze remained fixed on the captivating woman before him.

Completely unaware of his presence, Evelyn continued her search with her head down until she sensed movement behind her.

Strong arms suddenly wrapped around her waist, making her jump. She didn't need to turn around to know who it was.

"Nathan, what are you—"

"Can't I just hug my wife?" His amused voice rumbled above her head.

Why did this woman have such a hold over him?

Evelyn took a deep breath, memories of last night flooding back. Her cheeks burned with embarrassment.

Though she'd never admit how powerless she'd been against his charms.

"We need to pick up Caleb from school." Nathan rested his chin on her shoulder, his warm breath turning her ears pink.

Evelyn pushed him away. "Personal space, please."

Nathan merely chuckled and pulled her closer, his hand firm on her waist.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Nathan Goldmann might just be the most shameless man she'd ever met.

Even though Nathan had been merciful by not teasing her at work, their son noticed something unusual during pickup at the Royal Academy of Music.

"Daddy, what's that mark on your neck?" Caleb stared curiously.

Evelyn's head snapped up in alarm. The love bite was still visible!

Nathan caught Evelyn's reaction from the corner of his eye. When she avoided his gaze, he smirked. "That's grown-up stuff, son."

"Uncle Oliver, what happened to Daddy's neck?" Caleb turned to the assistant when his father wouldn't explain.

Oliver wouldn't dare answer that. He coughed nervously. "You'll understand when you're older."

Angela had already taken Liam and Daisy back to the Goldmann mansion. The children had been cast in a drama series alongside Adrian Boucher, with Daisy playing his daughter and Liam portraying his younger self.

Evelyn had initially objected to them entering the entertainment industry but relaxed when they proved responsible.

Nathan, however, remained displeased about his daughter playing Adrian's child. It felt like someone had stolen his favorite possession.

Caleb continued puzzling over the mysterious mark on his father's neck.

Nathan hadn't missed any opportunity to tease Evelyn these past few days.

Arriving at Soul Studio, Evelyn immediately headed to the restroom to conceal the mark on her own neck. That man had endless energy! She couldn't face her children like this.

Her office phone rang.

Evelyn stashed her concealer and answered when she saw Richard's name. "Dad?"

"Zoe, your grandmother's been discharged. Your uncle's visiting. Come home for dinner tonight."

At the Vanderbilt manor...

Laura prepared tea for Yvette as the younger sister-in-law. Yvette had always looked down on Laura, the former mistress. But after learning from Madam Victoria that Laura was on their side, her attitude softened somewhat.
###Chapter 227

"Laura, I heard you've been looking after Mother at the hospital these past few days."

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

Laura smiled gracefully. "It's my duty as a daughter-in-law."

York studied Laura and couldn't deny his brother had excellent taste in women.

He compared her to his own wife Yvette, who had become rather unrefined over the years. After childbirth, she'd completely let herself go, transforming into a tired, frumpy housewife.

Even though Laura wasn't young anymore, she maintained her youthful beauty remarkably well.

Yvette's expression darkened when she noticed her husband's lingering gaze on Laura. She cleared her throat pointedly, snapping York back to reality. He gave an awkward smile and quickly changed the subject. "Speaking of family, where are Vivian and Zoe?"

Madam Victoria turned to Richard. "Yes, Vivian is your daughter after all. We should invite her to join us for dinner."

Laura's smile faltered slightly at Madam Victoria's words, though she hid it well.

When Richard thought about Vivian, he realized it had been quite some time since he'd seen her. Regardless of her past mistakes, she was still his flesh and blood.

"Have Laura call her over."

After Richard agreed, Laura forced a cheerful smile. "I'll contact Vivian right away."

Evelyn arrived just as the Vanderbilts were enjoying their meal, the timing impeccable.

Seeing Evelyn looking more radiant than ever while recalling her own struggles, Vivian's resentment flared anew.

Richard smiled warmly at the empty seat beside him. "Zoe, come sit by me."

Madam Victoria frowned disapprovingly. "That's your wife Laura's seat. You're giving your daughter's place to her instead?"

Laura, seated farther down the table, interjected smoothly, "It's quite alright, Mother. Let Zoe have it."

Evelyn took the seat beside her father. York smiled appreciatively. "You've grown into such a beauty."

Yvette couldn't resist a barbed comment. "Of course you'd compliment your sister-in-law's daughter."

He'd praised Vivian earlier, now Evelyn - yet never had a kind word for his own daughter.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Thank you for the compliment, Uncle. I recall Lynn has been blossoming beautifully too. Why isn't she joining us?"

Her innocent question made both Yvette and Madam Victoria's expressions darken.

How dare she ask!

York shifted uncomfortably. He'd sent his daughter to the Zimmerman boy, waiting to see if she could secure that advantageous marriage.

His plain daughter paled in comparison to these sophisticated city nieces.

"York, you owe your freedom to Zoe." Richard broke the awkward silence while reminding his brother who'd helped him.

Before York could respond, Madam Victoria cut in sharply. "What nonsense! It was all Mr. Goldmann's doing."

Richard frowned. "Mother, why would Mr. Goldmann intervene if not for Zoe? Have you forgotten your granddaughter's assistance?"

"Moreover, I was the one who asked Zoe to help in the first place."

Madam Victoria flushed at being publicly corrected by her son.

This son of hers had truly lost all respect for her! Or perhaps they'd never been close to begin with.

Evelyn studied her father curiously as he defended her. Had he finally seen through Laura and Vivian's facades? This unexpected support suggested he might be waking up to the truth at last.
###Chapter 228

Evelyn's gaze swept discreetly across the dining table. Madam Victoria was discharged. York and Yvette came to Bassburgh. Even Laura and Vivian are back at the Vanderbilt mansion. This isn't just a simple dinner.

The air was thick with tension, each person harboring their own hidden motives.

Yvette turned to Evelyn with a calculated smile. "Zoe, I heard you've started your own jewelry studio. How's business?"

Her tone carried a false sweetness, as if she were fishing for information rather than expressing genuine concern.

Madam Victoria chimed in with a mocking lilt. "Of course she's doing well. Nathan Goldmann is backing her. Even if she did nothing, she'd live comfortably."

"Nathan Goldmann?" York's eyebrows shot up, clearly impressed that his niece had landed such a powerful man.

"Yes, Zoe has brought honor to the family—all thanks to that pretty face of hers," Madam Victoria sneered, implying that Evelyn had nothing else to offer.

Evelyn's lips curled into a sharp smile. "Exactly. I owe it all to the face my mother gave me."

She tilted her head slightly. "Neither Vivian nor Lydia managed to catch his attention. I suppose you're disappointed they couldn't be of use with their faces?"

Vivian's fingers tightened around her fork, but Laura subtly pressed a hand to her wrist, warning her to stay silent.

Richard had only just begun warming up to them again. If he got angry now, they'd never be allowed back into the manor.

Madam Victoria scoffed, dropping all pretense. "You have your own studio and Nathan Goldmann's support. Why not hand Viana over to your cousin?"

Yvette nodded eagerly. "Exactly, Richard. You don't have a son. Viana should stay with the Vanderbilts. Why not pass it to Henry? He is family, after all."

Evelyn let out a dry laugh before Richard could respond.

"When my parents built Viana, not a single Vanderbilt contributed. Now that your businesses have failed, you think you can just take it?"

"Zoe, how can you say that?" Yvette gasped, feigning offense.

"Am I wrong?" Evelyn's voice was icy. "This so-called family never lifted a finger to help us, yet now you think you can guilt-trip my father into handing over what he built?"

"Zoe!" Madam Victoria snapped. "Your father hasn't even spoken yet!"

"My father is silent because he respects his mother," Evelyn countered smoothly. "But that doesn't mean you get to dictate what happens to Viana."

She leaned back in her chair, her tone final. "I won't be giving it to anyone. If you want it, come and take it—but you'd better be prepared for the consequences."

Madam Victoria and Yvette paled. They weren't afraid of Evelyn.

They were afraid of the man standing behind her.

If they tried to force the issue, they knew exactly how it would end.

Laura remained silent, neither supporting nor opposing them. But what Richard said next changed the expressions of everyone at the table.
###Chapter 229

"That's correct. I will only give Viana to Zoe. Only my daughter deserves it."

Richard had clearly grasped their intention to force him to relinquish control of Viana Jewelry.

If that was their game, there was no point delaying. "I've already had my lawyers designate Zoe as the sole beneficiary of Viana."

Please check at N/?vel(D)rama.Org.

..

"Have you lost your mind? Why would you give it to her!?"

"What exactly did you contribute when Isabella and I founded Viana?"

Richard glared at Madam Victoria with undisguised contempt. "Mother, I've always respected you. But since you've never treated me as your son or acknowledged Zoe as your granddaughter, there's no need for pretense anymore."

"How dare—" Madam Victoria trembled with fury, but the words died in her throat.

The dinner concluded in icy silence. As Yvette and York departed, few noticed the subtle signals York exchanged with Laura.

Unfortunately, Evelyn happened to be walking behind them and caught the interaction. Passing Laura, she flashed a chilling smile. "Play with fire, and you'll get burned."

The warning sent a shiver down Laura's spine.

Her jaw tightened with determination. That woman would never know peace until she was permanently removed from the picture!

Nathan was reviewing documents in his study when Oliver's message arrived.

'The Cornelia Vanderbilts are attempting to steal Viana from Evelyn? Who gave them the audacity?'

He'd investigated them long ago. Aside from Richard, who was relatively competent, Madam Victoria's other children were utterly worthless.

The matriarch's archaic, patriarchal mindset was evident in how she favored her two sons. York's son Henry had been spoiled rotten since childhood, transforming into a useless parasite who contributed nothing.

The thought of handing Viana to such a man was laughable.

"Daddy!"

The triplets peeked through the doorway.

Nathan set aside his papers, raising an eyebrow as they swarmed him.

He cradled Daisy while ruffling Caleb and Liam's hair. "What brings you three here?"

Caleb announced, "Mommy just returned from Vanderbilt Manor and she's upset."

Liam added, "Did the Vanderbilts bully her?"

Daisy concluded, "They're horrible people!"

Nathan studied their concerned little faces. So young, yet already worrying about adult matters.

He chuckled. "Do you really think anyone could bully your mother?"

The children exchanged hesitant glances.

While their mother wasn't easily intimidated, the possibility remained.

"Daddy, aren't you going to do something? Your wife is being bullied!" Caleb narrowed his eyes.

Nathan paused, then laughed. "Do you think Mommy would let me interfere? Your father operates behind the scenes. I won't let anyone take advantage of her."

Again, the triplets shared uncertain looks.

That did sound plausible.

Daisy fiddled with Nathan's tie as a thought struck her. "Behind the scenes?" She tilted her head. "Daddy, does that mean you're living off Mommy?"

Caleb asked, "What does that mean?" Liam and Daisy chorused, "It means he's a deadbeat who depends on his wife for everything."
###Chapter 230

Evelyn was utterly speechless.

What could possibly frighten the ruthless business tycoon? The answer was simple - his wife's anger. But now, his greatest terror was his children forming unconventional opinions about him. It was enough to give him a heart attack.

Standing on the balcony, Evelyn spoke quietly into her phone. After listening to the response, she murmured, "Thank you, Mr. Zachary. Please keep this from my father."

The lawyer's voice crackled through the receiver before Evelyn nodded. "Very well, we'll continue this discussion tomorrow."

As she ended the call, Evelyn's gaze turned icy while surveying the city lights below. The true purpose of tonight's family dinner had become painfully clear to her.

Even with her father's unwavering support, it paled in comparison to the insatiable greed of Madam Victoria and York's family.

If they couldn't persuade Richard to relinquish control of Viana Jewelry, forceful measures would undoubtedly follow.

Then there were Laura and Vivian.

Laura had wisely chosen her allegiance this time, holding valuable leverage. Though Evelyn couldn't confirm Laura's collaboration with them, she'd uncovered something intriguing.

Strong arms suddenly encircled her waist. The thin fabric of her nightgown did little to shield her from the warmth radiating from the body pressed against her back.

"Facing the entire Vanderbilt clan alone must be exhausting. Why didn't you include me?" Nathan's voice carried a wounded tone.

If not for his familiar features and unchanged identity, Evelyn might have suspected an imposter stood behind her.

"Your intervention isn't necessary yet," Evelyn turned to face him. Stripped of his usual stern demeanor, his striking features appeared even more breathtaking.

Wait—why was she thinking he looked more attractive?

Nathan traced her lips with his finger, his eyes darkening. "Handle things your way. I'll manage the consequences."

Evelyn hesitated, breaking eye contact. "I understand, but could you—Mmph!"

Her protest was silenced as his lips captured hers. He'd anticipated her objection and refused to entertain it.

"Time for bed," he murmured, sweeping her into his arms toward their awaiting bed.

As his hands began exploring, Evelyn flushed. "Nathan, you said sleep—"

He remained firmly in control.

The night unfolded with its customary passion.

The following morning...

Evelyn met Mr. Zachary at an upscale café. The lawyer presented her with an equity transfer agreement. Seeing it matched her father's original document perfectly, satisfaction warmed her expression.

"Ms. Vanderbilt, may I ask why you require this particular document?" The lawyer couldn't fathom why Evelyn needed a replicated agreement.

Her gaze sharpened. "It serves my purposes. Perhaps it will help my father recognize certain truths about people around him."

Whatever schemes they devised, having this duplicate agreement provided reassurance.

A thought occurred to her, bringing a sly smile. "Mr. Zachary, there's another matter requiring your expertise."

The lawyer paused before nodding. "Of course, please elaborate."

Laura hadn't returned home the previous evening. When she finally appeared, she avoided Richard's questioning stare.

"Laura, where were you all night? Richard finally permitted your return with Vivian, yet you chose to stay elsewhere." Madam Victoria's displeasure at Laura's absence was palpable.
###Chapter 231

Laura could only lower her gaze and murmur meekly, "Mother, I... I'll return home tonight."

"Tonight? Are you mocking me?" Madam Victoria's eyes flashed with irritation as she noticed Laura's fearful glance toward Richard. She turned sharply to her silent son. "If you've summoned your wife back, then act like proper spouses. What will society say when they discover your wife spends days here but flees to her own residence every evening?"

"Mother, don't blame Richard. This is entirely my doing." Laura absorbed all criticism gracefully, her demeanor radiating the perfect image of a devoted wife.

Richard set down his teacup. Though he'd recalled Laura and Vivian to the Vanderbilt estate, her fabricated pregnancy remained an open wound.

Yet observing Laura's genuine behavioral transformation recently, he finally conceded, "Since you've returned, you may stay permanently."

The divorce proceedings remained incomplete, and continued separation would undoubtedly fuel malicious gossip.

Laura's lips curved into a docile smile. "Very well, I shall remain here henceforth."

Richard's phone interrupted abruptly. "Mr. Zachary?"

Madam Victoria's face darkened instantly, recalling her son's determination to transfer his Viana Jewelry shares to Evelyn last night upon hearing the lawyer's name.

After exchanging brief words, Richard excused himself and ascended the staircase.

Watching his retreat, Madam Victoria ground her teeth. "That ungrateful wretch truly intends to surrender Viana to that harlot?"

A calculated glint flashed through Laura's eyes.

'My sole purpose in returning is reclaiming Vivian's birthright. Richard discarded decades of companionship without hesitation—he deserves no mercy.'

'I deliberately mentioned Viana at the hospital to manipulate Mother into harassing Evelyn. As long as Evelyn remains occupied, she can't interfere with my Vanderbilt schemes.'

'Last night, Mother conspired with Yvette to pressure Richard into transferring shares to that incompetent Henry. They've backed him into a corner.'

'However, I detected York's lingering attraction yesterday when serving tea. My subtle signals at dinner successfully hooked him.'

'Let Mother and Yvette battle Evelyn for Viana shares. While they're locked in mortal combat, I'll manipulate York to usurp everything from the shadows. Ultimately, only Vivian and I shall remain standing in the Vanderbilt dynasty.'

Meanwhile, Evelyn studied the text from Mr. Zachary in her office. Her father had entrusted the contract to his lawyer and scheduled a board meeting to announce his heir in two days.

This confirmed her suspicions—her father likely intended to use the board to silence Madam Victoria's faction.

As his daughter, she'd provide additional leverage.

Yvette received a photograph of Richard entering a law firm.

After scrutinizing it, she immediately contacted Madam Victoria.

Having noted Richard's earlier departure, Madam Victoria deduced he'd gone to finalize the share transfer documents.

"Mother, if Richard truly gifts Viana to that slut, what future remains for the Vanderbilts?" Yvette pressed urgently. "Consider Henry—our Coralia ventures have collapsed. He's grown enough to inherit his uncle's company now. Only by securing Viana can we preserve the Vanderbilt legacy."
###Chapter 232

Madam Victoria listened to Yvette's words. Her heart had always favored her only grandson above all else, but her son Richard insisted on handing Viana Jewelry to Evelyn now. How could she remain calm?

She scoffed. "If we can't change his mind, we'll take it by force!"

The next day, Madam Victoria marched into the law firm and demanded the transfer contract as Richard's mother. Mr. Zachary handed her the draft without hesitation.

Once she left, Mr. Zachary immediately called Evelyn.

"Ms. Vanderbilt, a woman claiming to be Mr. Vanderbilt's mother just collected the contract. I gave it to her as instructed," he reported.

Evelyn had already briefed him—if anyone asked for the documents, he was to provide only the unsigned draft.

After all, an invalid contract was nothing but worthless paper. The real agreement remained securely locked away, accessible only with proper authorization.

A cold smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Thank you for your cooperation. Don’t forget to bring your best performance the day after tomorrow. I’m counting on you to deliver the most dramatic live show they’ve ever seen."

As she hung up, her eyes darkened with resolve.

This time, Father will finally see his so-called family for what they truly are.

Two days later, at Viana Jewelry…

The Vanderbilts had gathered, including Yvette’s family, in the conference room. Key executives filled the seats as Richard prepared to announce the heir to his shares.

When Richard declared Evelyn would inherit his stake, not a single board member objected.

Madam Victoria, seated as an honored guest, slammed her palm on the table. "I disagree!"

"Mother," Richard said wearily, "everyone here accepts Zoe because she’s proven her capability. What more do you want?"

He’d arranged this meeting hoping his family would finally relent.

Madam Victoria rose, her voice sharp. "Viana belongs to the Vanderbilts! And you’re handing it to a woman who’ll marry into another family and abandon us? Are you trying to give our legacy away to strangers?"

Her words drew uneasy glances among the executives—particularly those with daughters.

‘A woman who’ll abandon her family? How archaic.’

Richard clenched his jaw, disappointment bitter in his throat. His mother’s prejudice knew no bounds.

Yvette smiled placatingly. "Richard, it would be a shame to let such a valuable company slip away. Zoe will marry eventually, and she doesn’t even need it. Surely you should—"

"Even if my daughter doesn’t need it," Richard cut in coldly, "I won’t hand it to you for free."

Yvette flushed, shooting a glare at her husband, York.

York chuckled. "Richard, don’t mind Yvette. She’s never been the most... thoughtful person."

Yvette’s face twisted with fury at the insult.

Unlike his wife and mother’s agitation, York remained eerily calm.

They’re too shortsighted to see the bigger picture.

Evelyn is with Nathan Goldmann now. Crossing Richard would be suicidal.

Mother and Yvette’s greed is nothing but feminine folly.

Madam Victoria cared only for securing the shares for her grandson—by any means necessary.

Just then, a man in a tailored suit entered, introducing himself as a lawyer.

Madam Victoria lifted her chin triumphantly. "Richard, don’t blame me. Everything I do is for the Vanderbilt name."
###Chapter 233

"What... what is this?" Richard's voice trembled with disbelief as he stared at the unexpected presence of another lawyer hired by his mother.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Vanderbilt." The unfamiliar man in a crisp suit stepped forward. "I'm Mr. Hendricks, representing Madam Victoria. She's entrusted me to oversee the Viana Jewelry equity transfer documents. Please review them carefully."

Richard's face darkened instantly when he saw the altered beneficiary name - now changed to Henry Vanderbilt instead of Evelyn.

The document reeked of forgery. Any legal professional could spot the inconsistencies at first glance, let alone someone of Richard's business acumen.

"My dear son," Madam Victoria said with a triumphant smirk, "the contract clearly states Henry as the rightful heir. What possible connection could Viana Jewelry have with Evelyn now?"

She silently thanked Yvette for suggesting this brilliant scheme. Without her daughter-in-law's quick thinking, that cunning Evelyn might have actually gotten her hands on the company shares.

After all, the original document had come from Richard himself. She'd merely... adjusted some minor details.

Richard's laughter erupted like thunder, a dangerous mix of fury and disbelief. His own mother had resorted to such childish, transparent tricks to stop him? The absurdity was almost comical.

The meeting room doors swung open again.

Evelyn entered gracefully, flanked by Mr. Zachary. Her fitted black dress accentuated her slender frame, while the Gothic snake bracelet - her own design - glimmered under the lights. Matching serpent earrings and bold scarlet lips completed the striking ensemble.

Madam Victoria and Yvette exchanged disdainful glances. To them, Evelyn looked every bit the scheming temptress they'd always accused her of being.

Mr. Zachary's presence made Madam Victoria shift uncomfortably in her seat, though she quickly reminded herself that Richard would always remain her son, no matter what.

"My apologies for the delay, Father." Evelyn moved to stand beside Richard, her sharp eyes immediately catching the fraudulent contract on the table. "How interesting," she murmured with an amused smile. "I don't recall there being two versions of this agreement."

Madam Victoria's face twisted in irritation. "What nonsense are you spouting? The terms are clearly outlined in black and white!"

"Are they?" Evelyn's gaze locked onto her grandmother's. "Because I certainly wasn't aware Father had transferred his Viana shares to Cousin Henry."

"That's hardly our concern!" Madam Victoria snapped, eager to push through the announcement.

Richard slammed the document onto the table. "Mother, did you truly think such an amateurish forgery would fool me?"

"Forgery?" Madam Victoria's voice rose an octave. "This is your original contract!"

Yvette interjected quickly, "Richard, look at the details—"

"And what makes you so certain this is Father's contract?" Evelyn's question sliced through the tension like a knife.

The two women exchanged nervous glances, the air thickening with unspoken tension.

"This document came from Mr. Hendricks!" Madam Victoria rallied. "Would a licensed attorney lie to me?"

But when they turned to look, the mysterious lawyer had vanished without a trace.

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Grandmother, it appears you've been deceived."

Madam Victoria paled, realization dawning too late.

Mr. Zachary produced a file from his briefcase and handed it to Richard, who scanned it quickly before holding it up for all to see.

"This," Richard declared, "is the authentic agreement."
###Chapter 234

Evelyn watched as Yvette's face drained of color. "How... How can this be? I saw you just yesterday—" The woman's words caught in her throat when she realized what she was about to reveal.

Madam Victoria pointed an accusing finger at Mr. Zachary. "You're the one who personally delivered the contract to me last week!"

The lawyer maintained his professional composure. "Madam Victoria, we've never met prior to today."

"Don't you dare lie to me!" Her voice rose hysterically. "I remember your face perfectly—you handed me those documents in your office!" In her panic, she'd unwittingly confessed everything.

"Enough!" Richard's voice cut through the tension like a whip. His expression darkened. "Mother, you've crossed a line. If this is how you treat your own son, consider our relationship severed. Return to Cornelia immediately."

Madam Victoria's hands trembled violently as she pointed at her son. "I see now... This was all a setup!" She turned sharply on her heel. "Fine! I'm leaving!"

With the matriarch's dramatic exit, Yvette had no choice but to follow. Only York remained unfazed, casually rising from his seat as if the entire confrontation had bored him.

The office fell into sudden silence after their departure.

Evelyn escorted Mr. Zachary to the building's entrance. The lawyer shook his head in disbelief. "I never imagined Madam Victoria would resort to such underhanded tactics."

He'd expected a simple contract dispute, not an elaborate scheme involving forged documents to steal company shares.

A knowing smile played on Evelyn's lips. "After today's performance, we'll need to implement additional security measures."

"My grandmother has no experience with legal documents," she continued. "She wouldn't recognize a fake contract if it bit her. I can only imagine my father's expression when she presented it to him."

As Mr. Zachary departed, a sharply dressed man emerged from the shadows—the infamous "Mr. Hendricks." He flashed a grin. "Did I meet your expectations, Ms. Vanderbilt?"

Evelyn nodded and transferred the agreed payment. "Your performance was... convincing."

"The pleasure was mine." The imposter lawyer bowed theatrically. "Always happy to assist with such... creative projects."

Unbeknownst to them, Vivian lurked nearby, her phone capturing every moment. She'd arrived too late for the main confrontation but had caught this damning exchange.

'This footage will ruin that scheming bitch,' Vivian thought triumphantly as she slipped away.

Meanwhile, at Bassburgh Airport...

Two sleek black limousines idled near the arrivals terminal. Nathan stood beside his father as Oliver Lawson joined them, scanning the crowd for their expected guest.

An impeccably dressed elderly man emerged, his shock of white hair contrasting sharply with his vibrant pink vest. Despite his advanced age, Theodore Goldmann moved with the vitality of a man decades younger.

Removing his designer sunglasses, Theodore revealed sharp amber eyes that missed nothing. His mixed heritage gave him a timeless, distinguished appearance.

"Father." Mr. Goldmann Sr. stepped forward to embrace the older man.

Theodore's attention immediately shifted to his grandson. "You scoundrel! I hear I have great-grandchildren now?"

"Three, actually," Mr. Goldmann Sr. interjected with pride. "Two boys and a girl."

Theodore chuckled, his voice rich with amusement. "Well done! This one here"—he clapped Nathan on the shoulder—"outdid even you in your prime!"

Mr. Goldmann Sr. simply smiled indulgently.

Their reunion was interrupted by a young woman approaching with luggage in tow, followed by a broad-shouldered man. Oliver's face lit up in recognition. "Harrison! You actually came back!"

The military-trained man grinned as the two brothers clasped hands in a firm greeting, while the young woman smiled warmly at the Goldmann family. The stage was set for new developments—both in business and in personal relationships that would shape the coming days.
###Chapter 235

Harrison replied, "Yes, Rosalind and I returned with the Elder Master this time."

While the two brothers were catching up, the woman had already approached Nathan with a smile. "Nathan, you haven't changed at all after all these years, have you?"

Nathan only responded with indifference.

Seeing that his attitude toward her remained as cold as ever, Rosalind wasn't fazed. To her, Nathan was exactly the same as she remembered.

He still treats everyone with that same detachment, that same cold rationality. It's what makes him so compelling.

"Theodore sighed. "Indeed, he hasn't changed. Except now, he's the father of three little ones."

This boy was barely sixteen when I left for abroad.

A flicker of shadow passed through Rosalind's eyes, vanishing just as quickly.

Only a few years, and Nathan already has children?

Madam Victoria's expression darkened as she stared at the photo Vivian had sent. "Hmph, it was Evelyn! That scheming little—!"

I knew it! Why else would someone suddenly send photos to Yvette? It was a trap, and we walked right into it!

Yvette, seated on the couch, seethed with fury. Between her daughter's scandal and being outmaneuvered twice, she refused to let this go.

"Mother, that woman is nothing but trouble. Not only did we gain nothing, but we handed Viana Jewelry to her without a fight. So why don't we—"

"Why don't we what?" Madam Victoria cut in sharply.

"Why don't we expose her? Let all of Bassburgh know that Evelyn is an ungrateful, disrespectful wretch? Ruin her reputation beyond repair!"

I refuse to let that witch get away with this!

That evening, at the Goldmann mansion...

Evelyn stepped out of the dressing room in a custom evening gown, the elegant fabric draping flawlessly over her figure. The sophisticated design accentuated her poise, making her look every bit the refined noblewoman.

"Do I really need to dress like this just for dinner?" She shot Nathan a suspicious glance, realizing he had a habit of enjoying her in formal wear.

Nathan's lips curved slightly. "This isn't just any dinner. We're meeting my grandfather."

"Your grandfather?" Evelyn stiffened.

He closed the distance between them, wrapping an arm around her waist. "It's a family gathering."

"Can I skip it?" She averted her gaze, her usual resistance to such events flaring up.

Understanding her hesitation, Nathan suddenly lifted her off her feet.

Evelyn instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck as he lowered her onto the bed. His lips brushed against her neck, his voice a low murmur. "Relax. My grandfather may have a temper, but he's all bark."

"Nathan, didn't you say we were leaving for dinner—?" Her cheeks flushed.

"Behave."

Evelyn exhaled in exasperation.

Later, arm in arm with Nathan, Evelyn stood outside VIP Room 01 at the Grand Courtyard Hotel. She nervously adjusted her hair, worried her earlier distraction had ruined her makeup.

Nathan caught her fidgeting and leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Stop worrying. You're stunning."

My wife is breathtaking without even trying. But if dressing her up keeps other men at bay, all the better.

If a man wants his woman to stay by his side, he should spoil her rotten—let her temper flourish until no one else dares approach her. That way, she'll never belong to anyone else.
###Chapter 236

Evelyn shot him a sideways glance. His gentle demeanor had always struck a chord with her.

The waiter swung open the doors to reveal an opulent golden private dining room. A massive round table set for fifteen dominated the space.

Caleb, Liam, and Daisy were perched beside Mr. Goldmann Sr. But it was the silver-haired man at the head of the table who caught Evelyn's attention.

'Is that Nathan's grandfather? His mixed-race features are so pronounced compared to Mr. Goldmann Sr.'s appearance.'

Her gaze then landed on the elegant woman seated nearby.

"Mommy! Daddy! Over here!" Daisy waved enthusiastically, her tiny hand cutting through the air.

Nathan's arm slid around Evelyn's waist as he guided her to their seats. The warmth of his touch sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. beamed at Theodore. "Father, this is Evelyn Vanderbilt - the children's mother."

Evelyn inclined her head respectfully. "It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Goldmann."

The elder Goldmann waved dismissively. "No need for formalities. This is just family gathering."

As Evelyn settled into her chair, she locked eyes with the woman across the table. The icy glint in those eyes starkly contrasted with the polite smile curving her lips.

Rosalind's gaze then shifted to Nathan. "Nathan, I never imagined you'd settle down."

"They're not officially married yet," Mr. Goldmann Sr. interjected, then turned to the couple. "Speaking of which, when are you two making it official?"

"Yeah Daddy!" Caleb piped up, his wide eyes shimmering with hope. "When will you marry Mommy?"

Nathan's lips quirked as he glanced at Evelyn. "Whenever your mother decides to say yes."

Evelyn's fingers found his thigh beneath the table, delivering a sharp pinch. Nathan caught her wrist effortlessly, his grip firm yet gentle.

'This woman turns feral at the mere mention of marriage,' he mused silently. 'After everything we've shared - three beautiful children - how could she possibly refuse?'

Rosalind observed their silent exchange with barely concealed surprise. 'Nathan's never behaved this way with any woman before...'

Theodore's booming voice broke the tension. "Enough chatter! I'm starving enough to eat a horse. Let's get the food served!"

The children, still unaccustomed to their great-grandfather's stern demeanor, instinctively leaned closer to Mr. Goldmann Sr.

Throughout the meal, Rosalind's attention kept drifting back to Evelyn. "What do you do professionally, Ms. Vanderbilt?"

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "I design jewelry."

"Our mommy is Zara - the famous jewelry designer!" Daisy announced proudly between bites, her grandfather carefully feeding her. The little girl's stare lingered on Rosalind, as if issuing a silent challenge.

'This woman keeps eyeing Daddy like he's dessert. She's definitely trouble.'

Rosalind blinked, taken aback by the child's perceptiveness. 'Did this tiny creature just stake her mother's claim?'

"Zoe," Mr. Goldmann Sr. interjected smoothly, "this is Rosalind Summers. She grew up with Nathan and the Lawson siblings before accompanying Theodore abroad. They were quite the playmates in their youth."

He'd always held Rosalind in high regard. Had Evelyn not borne his grandchildren, she might have been his first choice for a daughter-in-law.

Yet as he'd come to know Evelyn, he realized she possessed something Rosalind lacked - the unique ability to keep his formidable son in check.
###Chapter 237

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile, but she remained silent.

Theodore set down his wine ss with deliberate slowness. His expression hardened as he began his interrogation. "Does this fragile-looking young woman truly possess the qualities required to become the future matriarch of the Goldmann family?"

His words instantly charged the air with tension. In Theodore's eyes, the Goldmann heir's wife couldn't be some delicate flower. She needed formidable capabilities and the presence to command respect.

Yet the slender figure seated before him seemed too soft, too vulnerable. It was only natural for him to doubt her suitability.

Rosalind averted her gaze, amusement flickering across her features. She knew Theodore's exacting standards for his grandson's bride. The woman had to be politically astute, familiar with every aspect of the Goldmann empire's operations - both public and private.

'After all,' Rosalind thought, 'the Goldmanns operate far beyond mere business. If this woman can't handle hosting the annual Goldmann Gala or making critical decisions, how could she possibly lead this family?'

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as if preparing to speak, but Nathan's fingers tightened around hers. His steady gaze conveyed silent reassurance.

"Grandfather," Nathan's voice cut through the tension, "your criteria for selecting a granddaughter-in-law don't align with my priorities. None of those qualifications factored into my choice of partner."

His tone left no room for argument.

Rosalind studied Nathan intently.

'Is he truly this committed to her?'

Mr. Goldmann Sr. chuckled nervously. "Father, Nathan has always had his own mind. And in my opinion, Zoe isn't as unsuitable as you assume."

Theodore snorted. "That's your perspective. I want to know exactly how much she understands about our family's true nature. Being the Goldmann matriarch isn't some decorative title."

'The hostess of our annual gala must be more than some pretty face. If she can't handle crises or defend herself, she'll become nothing but a liability to my grandson!'

Mr. Goldmann Sr. hesitated. He hadn't disclosed the family's darker aspects to Evelyn, nor did he know if Nathan had.

Evelyn understood Theodore's implications perfectly. Considering Nathan's previous revelations, she'd already deduced the Goldmanns were more than wealthy businessmen.

"Objectively speaking," Theodore continued, "she lacks Rosalind's qualifications. Rosalind has trained under me for years. The entire family would respect her as matriarch."

At the mention of her name, Rosalind offered a modest smile. "Grandfather, you flatter me."

"I merely state facts." Theodore cared little for others' feelings. He considered long-term consequences that mere romance couldn't resolve.

Nathan's eyes narrowed to slits. His lips pressed into a thin line before parting. "My wife won't need to deal with those matters. I have no intention of inheriting the mess you've created."

"You insolent brat! How dare—"

"Father, please," Mr. Goldmann Sr. intervened. "We have guests." Turning to Nathan, he added, "Must you provoke your grandfather at a family dinner?"

Theodore glared at his son. "I haven't acknowledged this as a family gathering yet!" His meaning was clear - Evelyn hadn't earned his recognition as a Goldmann.
###Chapter 238

The tension in the dining room was palpable.

Nathan met Theodore's stormy gaze without flinching. "If you refuse to acknowledge Evelyn, then I have no choice but to leave with her."

Theodore's grip tightened around his fork. "Are you daring to threaten me?"

This arrogant brat! He's only fathered three children, yet he acts like he owns the world!

Rosalind shot Nathan a nervous glance. "Nathan, don't provoke your grandfather."

Nathan ignored her, his voice firm. "Yes. That was a threat."

"Fine! Get out of my sight!" Theodore slammed his cutlery onto the table, the sound reverberating through the room. His commanding presence filled the space, making the air thick with hostility.

The atmosphere froze.

Nathan took Evelyn's hand, ready to stand, but she gently pulled him back down. Her eyes locked onto Theodore's. "Sir, judging someone before knowing them seems rather unfair, don't you think?"

Theodore blinked, caught off guard. He had expected her to cower, not challenge him.

"Hmph! Confidence is one thing, but words mean nothing here."

"Then what would it take to prove myself?" Evelyn asked calmly.

Theodore smirked. "If you can achieve outstanding results in military training within half a month—without Nathan's help—I'll reconsider my opinion of you."

"Grandfather, that's unreasonable!" Nathan's voice was sharp.

Military training was grueling even for seasoned recruits. Expecting Evelyn, who had no prior experience, to excel in such a short time was nothing short of cruel.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. frowned. "Father, you can't possibly—"

"What? You think I'm being unfair?" Theodore cut in, his gaze fixed on Evelyn. "Well? Do you accept?"

He was counting on her to back down.

She's just a woman with no training. There's no way she can pull this off.

Liam's eyes darkened, his small face set in a scowl.

This old man is deliberately humiliating Mom.

Rosalind, noticing Evelyn's silence, assumed she was hesitating.

How could an untrained woman possibly manage this?

She spoke up, feigning concern. "Grandfather, there's no need to put Ms. Vanderbilt through this. She's... different from us."

"And what makes her different?" Theodore scoffed. "You were just as inexperienced when you first joined. I don't make exceptions for anyone."

His stance was clear—unyielding.

Nathan's jaw clenched, but before he could argue, Evelyn spoke.

"Fine. I accept your challenge."

Rosalind's eyes widened briefly before she masked her surprise.

Theodore leaned back, satisfied. "Good. Remember—this was your choice."

Just as he was about to gloat, he caught a sharp glare from the smallest figure at the table.

Liam.

The boy held his gaze for a moment before looking away, his expression cold.

I don't like him. He made Mom uncomfortable.

After dinner, Nathan and Evelyn left the hotel with their children.

Caleb and Daisy were visibly upset. "We don’t like Great-grandpa! Grandpa is way nicer!"

Evelyn ruffled their hair gently. "Don’t say that. He’s family."

But even as she spoke, her mind was already racing—how was she going to survive military training?
###Chapter 239

Blood ties remained unbreakable—as long as they were Nathan’s children, that bond would never fade.

Caleb turned his face away, his voice tight. "No matter what, I still don’t like him."

Liam stayed silent, his jaw clenched. One thing was certain—he would never forgive anyone who had hurt his mother.

"Nathan." Rosalind caught up to them, her steps light but deliberate.

Nathan barely glanced at her, his fingers tightening around Evelyn’s hand. "What is it?"

Evelyn studied Rosalind with narrowed eyes.

This woman clearly has feelings for Nathan. How obvious can she be?

"Nathan, don’t worry," Rosalind said smoothly, her gaze flickering toward Evelyn. "I’ll help you convince Grandfather. After all..." She paused, her lips curving into a practiced smile. "It wouldn’t be fair to force Ms. Vanderbilt into military service."

Evelyn’s lips twitched.

Since when does she care about fairness? What’s her real game here?

The three children stared at Rosalind with identical expressions of suspicion.

She’s just like Vivian—another woman trying to cling to Daddy.

Nathan’s expression darkened, though he said nothing.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "That’s kind of you, Ms. Summers. But I always keep my word."

Rosalind’s smile stiffened. "Are you sure? Military life won’t be easy. You’ll face hardships you can’t even imagine."

Evelyn arched a brow. "I’ve survived worse. A little discipline won’t break me."

With that, she gently pulled her hand from Nathan’s and led the children toward the car.

Rosalind opened her mouth to speak, but Nathan was already following Evelyn, leaving her standing alone.

Her fists clenched at her sides, nails digging into her palms.

On the ride back, Nathan studied Evelyn’s profile—her arms crossed, her expression unreadable.

Leaning closer, he smirked. "Zoe, did you agree to Grandfather’s challenge because you can’t bear to be apart from me?"

Why else would she willingly subject herself to military training? She must really love me.

Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance. "You’re overthinking it. I just don’t like being underestimated."

Nathan’s grin widened. Whatever her reason, he was pleased.

But then—

"Actually, I’m starting to regret it." Evelyn sighed, meeting his gaze. "I acted too impulsively. If I hadn’t agreed, maybe I could’ve—"

His expression darkened before she could finish. "Are you trying to piss me off?"

Evelyn shrugged, feigning indifference. "Your grandfather already picked a wife for you. Ms. Summers is quite beautiful. I’m sure she meets your standards."

Nathan’s lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Are you jealous?"

"I’m giving you a choice, aren’t I?"

If not for that night six years ago, if not for the children, maybe things would’ve been different.

Nathan closed the distance between them, pinning her against the seat. His fingers brushed her chin. "I don’t need a choice. Push me toward another woman again, and I’ll punish you so severely you won’t forget it."

Evelyn’s cheeks burned as she looked away. "Your punishments are always the same. Predictable."

Nathan chuckled, loosening his collar. "Good. That means you remember."

"Zoe, look at this." Gregory handed Evelyn a newspaper, his expression grim.

The headline blared in bold letters: Evelyn Vanderbilt—The Unfilial Granddaughter Who Framed Her Own Family for Power.

At first glance, it was clearly Madam Victoria and Yvette’s doing.

They weren’t giving up.

And they were determined to drag her name through the mud.
###Chapter 240

Mercy was no longer an option for Evelyn.

At the Vanderbilt estate...

Richard slammed the newspaper onto the mahogany table, his face dark with fury. Laura entered carrying a fruit tray, her eyes flickering to the scandalous headlines. "Richard darling, why are they writing such terrible things about Zoe? There must be some mistake."

His jaw tightened. He knew exactly who was behind this smear campaign - his own mother and sister-in-law. The veins in his temples pulsed visibly as he refused to answer.

Vivian descended the staircase dramatically. "Father, Evelyn conspired with lawyers to deceive Grandmother and Aunt Yvette. It's all over the papers!"

"Vivian, don't make baseless accusations," Laura chided unconvincingly.

"Baseless? I saw the documents myself! If this is true, doesn't it mean Evelyn tricked you too? You already agreed to transfer your shares, and she still schemed behind your back!"

Vivian babbled on, oblivious to her father's thunderous expression. She desperately wanted him to turn against Evelyn.

Just as Laura pretended to intervene, Richard's fist crashed onto the table, silencing the room. "You have no right to judge your sister!"

"But Father, I'm your daughter too-"

"Do you even remember that?" Richard's voice turned icy. "I won't be fooled by you twice."

Vivian bit her lip until it bled, humiliation burning her cheeks.

Laura's nails dug into her palms as she watched Richard defend Evelyn. Their standing in his heart had clearly plummeted.

When Richard stormed upstairs, Laura's mask cracked. 'He brought this upon himself!'

That evening...

At a luxury hotel, Yvette and Madam Victoria anxiously refreshed social media, waiting for the internet mob to attack Evelyn.

"Why hasn't there been any backlash yet? The story broke hours ago!"

Yvette's phone rang suddenly. Lydia's panicked voice made her blood run cold. "What? Henry's been in an accident?!"

Madam Victoria nearly fainted. Henry was their only hope for continuing the Vanderbilt bloodline. They abandoned their scheming immediately and raced back to Cornelia.

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit bedroom...

Laura writhed beneath York, her venomous words dripping between moans. "Oh York, if only Richard appreciated me half as much as you do..."

The illicit affair had become addictive for York. Compared to his provincial wife Yvette, Laura was everything a man could desire - seductive, wild, and utterly without shame.

'Richard doesn't know how lucky he is,' York thought bitterly.

He tilted Laura's chin. "His loss, my gain. I'll treat you better than he ever did."

"Aren't you afraid Richard will find out?" Laura teased, tracing circles on his bare chest.

York smirked. His athletic physique put Richard's aging body to shame. "If you're not afraid, why should I be?"

His phone buzzed insistently. Annoyed, York silenced it without looking.

Their passionate reunion continued until dawn. As they parted outside Laura's residence, neither noticed the shadowy figure capturing their every move with a high-resolution camera.
###Chapter 241

At Cornelia Police Station—

"Officer, there must be some mistake! My son would never sell drugs!" Yvette Warren's voice trembled with desperation.

Beside her, Madam Victoria clutched her chest, her face ashen. "He's just a boy! How could he be involved in something like this?"

Their panic was justified. If Henry Vanderbilt was convicted of drug distribution, the consequences would be far worse than when York had been arrested for money laundering.

Henry was the sole heir of the Vanderbilt family—the only one who could carry on their legacy. A criminal record would stain his future. What respectable family would marry their daughter to a felon?

The officer taking the statement looked up, his expression stern. "He's in his twenties. That's hardly a child. Our officers found narcotics in his possession, and given the severity of the case, he's looking at a minimum of five years in prison."

Madam Victoria swayed, her knees buckling. If not for Yvette's grip, she would have collapsed. "Officer, please, this must be a misunderstanding! My grandson is a good boy!"

"A good boy?" The officer scoffed, slamming his palm on the table. "Henry has been arrested multiple times for illegal gambling. We've let him off with warnings, but he never learns. And now? He's crossed a line that can't be ignored."

Yvette's face drained of color. She turned on Lydia, who stood silently nearby. "This is your fault! You were supposed to watch over him!"

Lydia's eyes burned with indignation. "Me? Henry has always been reckless! Why am I suddenly to blame?"

"He's your brother!" Yvette snapped.

Lydia let out a bitter laugh. "Of course. It's always about Henry. And look where your blind favoritism has gotten him!" With that, she stormed out, leaving the two women in stunned silence.

The weight of Henry's impending sentence crushed them. But then, Yvette's phone buzzed. A single photo appeared—one that made her blood run cold.

At Soul Jewelry Studio—

Evelyn had arranged for discreet surveillance, and just as she suspected, Laura Scott and her uncle had met in secret.

Uncle York and his sister-in-law. What a scandalous affair.

Her phone rang. The caller ID flashed Madam Victoria. Evelyn knew exactly what she wanted.

"Zoe, Henry is in trouble!" Madam Victoria's voice was sharp, demanding rather than pleading. "You must ask Mr. Goldmann to intervene. With his influence, Henry will be released immediately!"

Evelyn stood, walking to the floor-to-ceiling window. Her reflection was calm, detached. "Grandmother, is this how you ask for a favor?"

"Zoe, he's your cousin! Have you no heart?"

"I'm afraid I don't know you well enough to care," Evelyn replied coolly. "When things are fine, you scheme against me. Now that you're drowning, you expect my help? Tell me—why should I lift a finger?"

Her expression remained unreadable, her tone icy.

Madam Victoria's voice cracked. "You—you ungrateful girl!"

Evelyn smirked. "Ungrateful? No. Just realistic."

She ended the call.

The game had only just begun.
###Chapter 242

I had given them every opportunity, but the Vanderbilts kept pushing their limits, forcing my hand.

They resorted to drugs just to trap me into marrying Jacob.

They shamelessly tried to steal Viana Jewelry from me.

And they spread vicious rumors online to ruin my reputation.

For my father's sake, I even helped bail Uncle York out of jail, yet they didn't show an ounce of gratitude—as if it was my duty.

Now she dares call me cold-blooded? Then I'll prove her right beyond her wildest expectations!

"Evelyn, you're still a Vanderbilt. Will you really abandon Henry to his fate?" Madam Victoria's voice trembled with barely concealed panic. Her usual composure had shattered.

"Yes. Not only will I abandon him, but I'll make sure he learns his lesson." My lips curled into a cold smile. "Honestly, Henry became this worthless because of your blind indulgence. He chose this path—now he'll face the consequences. I'm simply giving him the chance to reform."

"What...what do you mean?" Her breath hitched.

I flicked my lashes up. "I was the one who reported Henry. The case is already filed—stop dreaming about getting him out. Prison will teach him right from wrong."

Madam Victoria's scream pierced through the phone. "Evelyn Vanderbilt! You sent your own cousin to jail! You vile creature! I warn you—if you don't release Henry immediately—"

"Threaten me again," I interrupted icily, "and I'll ensure he never sees daylight again. His sentence depends entirely on my mood. Keep provoking me, and he'll rot there forever."

Who didn't know how to play this game? I owed my mastery to all those who'd threatened me before.

My words finally made realization dawn on her.

Not only did I have Nathan Goldmann's power backing me, but when I decided to be ruthless, I showed no mercy. The moment they kept testing my limits, they'd already fallen into my trap.

Evelyn Vanderbilt, once pushed too far, became terrifyingly unstoppable. As for Henry? Even if he got out, his life was already ruined.

I ended the call without hesitation. From start to finish, I hadn't softened—they'd forced this outcome.

Knowing their nature, understanding they'd never stop coming after me, the only solution was to crush them completely.

"This family spoiled Henry rotten since childhood. Gambling, street fights—he's been in and out of police stations but never changed. When my investigators uncovered his drug trafficking, sending him to prison became my responsibility. Better reform him now before he escalates to murder."

A knock interrupted my thoughts. Gregory entered with a smile. "Zoe, you have a visitor."

Then a familiar figure appeared behind him.

Nathan strode out of the administrative office. Oliver didn't need to ask—he knew exactly where his boss was heading.

Sometimes Oliver wondered if Mr. Goldmann ever felt neglected while his wife was busy disciplining her shameless relatives.

The elevator doors opened, revealing Rosalind standing there.

She stepped forward with a practiced smile. "Nathan, where are you off to?"

His gaze cooled. "Why are you here?"

"Your father asked me to bring you lunch." She lifted a designer lunchbox. "He mentioned you often skip meals when busy."
###Chapter 243

Nathan's eyes narrowed slightly. Has Father gone completely insane?

"Give it to Oliver," Nathan signaled his assistant.

Oliver took the lunchbox with a polite smile. "Rosalind, I'll handle this."

Rosalind didn't respond immediately. Instead, she studied Nathan with a knowing smirk. "Heading out somewhere?"

"Rosalind, Mr. Goldmann is visiting his wife," Oliver answered before Nathan could, earning himself a sharp glare.

Wife? A flicker of ice passed through Rosalind's gaze. He must mean Evelyn Vanderbilt. Nathan really does prioritize her above all else.

"Is there anything else?" Nathan checked his watch impatiently.

Rosalind shook her head, her smile never wavering.

Without another word, Nathan strode away.

Oliver lingered just long enough to offer Rosalind a conciliatory grin. "Don’t take it personally. He’s just eager to see Evelyn."

Then he hurried after Nathan, oblivious to the way Rosalind’s expression darkened.

Nathan arrived at Soul Jewelry Studio only to find a cluster of female employees whispering outside the reception room, peering inside with hushed excitement.

"What’s going on here?" His voice cut through their chatter like a blade.

They startled, scrambling aside as he approached.

Through the open door, Nathan saw Evelyn bent over a jewelry design, deep in conversation with a man standing far too close to her. The man’s profile was unmistakable—Adrian Boucher.

Evelyn glanced up, spotting Nathan. Adrian turned as well, their eyes locking in a silent standoff.

Adrian merely smirked, unfazed, while his assistant, Nina, and the rest of his team subtly retreated.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn asked, brows knitting together.

Is he really that free?

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Do I need a reason?"

Is she upset that I interrupted her little moment with Adrian?

Evelyn blinked, baffled. What’s his problem today?

Adrian set down the jewelry sample he’d been examining and chuckled. "Surely Ms. Vanderbilt is allowed to entertain a client?"

The air between them crackled, two powerful men radiating tension in the confined space.

Nathan’s gaze hardened. This bastard thinks he can act so casually just because we grew up together?

"What happened to Taylor Jewelry?" Nathan demanded.

"Taylor Jewelry has partnered with Soul Jewelry. Madam Nora introduced me," Adrian replied smoothly.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "You don’t think my designs are worthy of an award-winning actor?"

"I never said that."

Nathan looked away, clearing his throat. "Ordering jewelry is fine," he muttered. "But there’s no need to stand so close."

The staff exchanged shocked glances.

Mr. Goldmann is jealous?

"Childish," Evelyn muttered under her breath before turning back to Adrian.

Nathan suddenly felt like an intruder in his own wife’s workspace. When will she ever focus on me like that?

After finalizing the design, Adrian flashed her a charming smile. "I’ll need the full collection for my film. Don’t worry—I’ll return everything intact. And I’ll pay the advertising fee, of course."
###Chapter 244

Adrian had mentioned before that he had a particular preference for jewelry pieces, and he'd explained that the production team initially wanted to use imitation props when he joined the project.

But he believed that fake accessories wouldn’t deliver the same authentic visual impact to the audience.

He insisted on using real jewelry.

The production budget didn’t allow for such an extravagant expense, so Adrian decided to cover the cost himself.

This arrangement also served as excellent publicity for Evelyn’s brand, and since he was footing the bill, why wouldn’t she be thrilled?

Evelyn smiled. "Alright, we’ll have our team deliver the pieces to your set when the time comes."

"Thank you." Adrian nodded and left with his entourage after finalizing the order.

Evelyn glanced at the receipt in her hand, then turned to see Nathan lounging on the sofa in the corner, arms crossed.

She paused, watching as the staff dispersed, then approached him.

Leaning down, she waved a hand in front of his face. "Nathan, are you okay?"

"No, I’m not." His voice was flat as he reclined further into the cushions.

‘Can’t she tell I’m waiting for her to coax me?’

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. Nathan was acting more and more like Caleb and Daisy—sulking until he got attention.

Only when he was serious did he resemble Liam.

‘The kids really did inherit his traits in the most unpredictable ways.’

"Have you eaten?" she asked.

Nathan pressed his lips together, glaring at her in silence.

Evelyn straightened. "Alright, I’ll take that as a no. Let’s go grab something to eat."

His brows lifted slightly. "That’s it?"

‘She thinks a meal is enough to make up for this?’

"If you don’t want to, then never mind."

Nathan exhaled sharply and stood. "No, I’m coming."

Just then, Oliver appeared at the door, holding a lunchbox. "Mr. Goldmann, you’re still here. Should I bring in the meal that Ms. Summers prepared for you?"

The air instantly turned icy.

Evelyn glanced at the lunchbox, then back at Nathan, a smirk tugging at her lips. "Oh, so your dear childhood friend already brought you food? I’ll go eat alone, then."

Without another word, she turned and walked out.

Nathan shot Oliver a murderous glare. "You really have a talent for saying the wrong thing at the worst time."

Oliver paled. ‘What did I do?’

Laura opened her door, expecting to see York. Instead, she was met with a sharp slap before she could even register who stood before her.

"Laura Scott, you homewrecking snake! How dare you seduce York?!" Yvette snarled, shoving Laura to the ground.

She straddled her, fists flying—slapping, scratching, yanking her hair.

Laura cried out in pain. "Yvette Warren, have you lost your mind?! Who told you I seduced him?!"

Yvette forced her to look at the photos on her phone. "Liar! I knew something was off—York’s been distant, ignoring my calls while his son faces prison! And now I find out it’s because of you, you shameless tramp!"

"Yvette, you’ve got it all wrong—"

Another slap cut her off.

Yvette had snapped—her son’s downfall, her husband’s betrayal with her own sister-in-law.

"I’ll make sure everyone sees what a disgrace you are!"

Laura was no match for Yvette’s fury.

Her clothes were torn, face swollen, eyes bruised, hair a tangled mess—her dignity stripped bare.
###Chapter 245

Yvette stood up, her phone already capturing Laura’s disheveled state. "Just wait," she sneered. "I’m sending this pathetic look of yours to Richard!"

Laura’s blood ran cold. The consequences flashed before her eyes. She scrambled to her feet and clutched Yvette’s leg in desperation. "Yvette, please! I know I was wrong! Don’t tell Richard! You wouldn’t want to pit the brothers against each other over this, would you?"

"You brought this on yourself," Yvette spat, unmoved. "When Richard sees how shamelessly you seduced his older brother, let’s see how you keep your place in this family!"

She tapped her screen, ready to send the incriminating photo.

Laura lunged, fingers clawing for the phone. A sharp struggle ensued before the device clattered to the floor near the door. Both women tumbled down in the scuffle.

Yvette’s head struck the edge of the table with a sickening thud.

"Yvette, I’m begging you—this wasn’t my fault! It was—" Laura’s plea died in her throat.

Yvette’s eyes stared blankly into space.

Laura’s face drained of color. Trembling, she pressed a finger beneath Yvette’s nose.

Nothing.

Not a single breath.

She recoiled, collapsing onto the floor in horror, hands clamped over her mouth.

She’s… not breathing!

Evelyn was in the middle of lunch at the company cafeteria when a sudden hush fell over the room.

All eyes turned toward the entrance.

A miracle had occurred—Nathan Goldmann, the CEO himself, had stepped into the staff cafeteria.

He collected his meal and, without hesitation, took the seat opposite Evelyn.

She glanced at his tray, then at him, amused. "The staff must’ve been in awe. They gave you twice the usual portion."

Nathan prodded the spaghetti with his fork, then set it down with a faint grimace.

Evelyn smirked. "Not used to simple food, are you?"

"Just trying something different," he replied smoothly.

She pushed her untouched fish broth toward him. "Try this. It’s light."

Nathan took a sip, then nodded. "Not bad."

"Didn’t Rosalind pack you lunch today? I bet her cooking puts this place to shame," Evelyn teased, sipping her coke.

Nathan’s gaze locked onto hers. "If you’re curious, I can have Oliver bring hers to you."

She laughed. "Oh, no. That meal was made just for you."

"Then when will you cook for me?" His voice dropped, low and intimate. "I’d prefer yours over anyone else’s."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She looked away quickly. "I’m not much of a cook."

Nathan leaned forward, fingers steepled under his chin, a sly smile playing on his lips. "Doesn’t matter. I like everything you do."

The surrounding employees froze, forks halfway to their mouths, suddenly finding their meals tasteless.

Evelyn’s phone rang, cutting through the tension.

Her father’s name flashed on the screen.

She answered, and within seconds, her expression darkened.

Nathan frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. "Yvette… she jumped off a building."
###Chapter 246

The body of Yvette Warren was discovered at the scene after she leaped from her apartment. Madam Victoria and Richard rushed to the police station to assist with the investigation.

Madam Victoria had already been devastated when her grandson was imprisoned, and now Yvette was gone. She hadn’t even had a moment to grieve before collapsing.

Nathan escorted Evelyn to the hospital, where York and Lydia were waiting.

The moment Lydia spotted Evelyn, she lunged forward, gripping her collar with trembling fingers. Tears streamed down her face as she screamed, "This is all your fault! My mother is dead because of you! You did this!"

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly. He shoved Lydia away and shielded Evelyn with his arm. "Don’t you dare blame her for everything."

"It is her! She’s the reason Henry is in prison. She’s the reason my mother is gone. She’s cursed!" Lydia’s voice cracked with hysteria.

"Lydia, enough!" York pulled his daughter back, forcing a strained smile at Nathan. "Forgive her, Mr. Goldmann. She’s not in her right mind."

Nathan remained impassive.

Evelyn stood silently, her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms. She had never liked Yvette, but she had never wished for her death.

"Look at her! She won’t even deny it!" Lydia shrieked. "She’s a murderer!"

Only someone as ruthless as Evelyn would seek revenge against her own family.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a thought suddenly striking her. "Dad, where’s Laura?"

At the mention of Laura, York’s expression flickered for a fraction of a second.

Richard, seemingly indifferent to Laura’s absence, shrugged. "No idea."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, then asked quietly, "Where exactly did Yvette jump from?"

Richard hesitated but didn’t answer.

Lydia sneered. "Why do you care? Haven’t you done enough damage?"

Evelyn met Lydia’s glare. "If I were you, I wouldn’t believe Yvette was the type to take her own life."

She turned on her heel. "Instead of wasting time here, I’ll find out what really happened."

Nathan followed without hesitation.

Evelyn strode through the hospital corridors, her pace quickening until Nathan caught her wrist. "Zoe."

She stopped but didn’t turn around. He could feel her trembling.

Nathan stepped in front of her, tilting her chin up. "Zoe, I know this wasn’t your fault."

"It wasn’t me," she whispered, "but it’s still connected to me." Her eyes were shadowed with guilt. She refused to believe Yvette would kill herself over a single photograph—yet it had led to her death.

Nathan cupped her face, his voice steady. "Evelyn, I know you never meant for this to happen. You said you wanted to investigate, didn’t you?"

He squeezed her hands gently. "If you feel responsible, then find the truth. I’ll be right beside you."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. His words—I’ll be right beside you—were the anchor she needed to steady herself.

Yes. She would uncover the truth. Because one thing didn’t make sense—if Yvette had received that photo in Cornelia, why would she come all the way to Bassburge to end her life?

And if she were Yvette, who would she turn to after seeing that photo?

Laura.
###Chapter 247

The following morning at the Bureau of Justice…

Joel Watson handed the autopsy report to Evelyn with a grim expression. "Here's the full analysis. It wasn't suicide—she was already dead before she was pushed off that building." He pointed to the key findings. "Livor mortis patterns and fabric abrasions confirm she was dragged post-mortem."

A forced fall after death meant only one thing: murder. Evelyn scanned the report carefully. The primary cause of death was severe cranial trauma.

"Any traces left by the killer?" she asked.

Joel nodded. "Skin fragments under her nails. DNA testing is underway."

He studied Evelyn's silence as she processed the details. "Finished? I need to submit this to the detectives. It's officially a homicide case now."

Evelyn returned the report with a faint smile. "Let’s grab dinner with Sophia when you’re free."

Joel hesitated, then chuckled. "We’ll see. My schedule’s packed for the foreseeable future."

"Understood," Evelyn replied.

Meanwhile, at the hospital…

"Your precious daughter ruined my grandson’s life and now my daughter-in-law is dead! She’s cursed!"

Madam Victoria, freshly conscious, refused to accept reality. She raged at Richard, her voice shrill with fury. No matter how he tried to reason with her, she kept screaming. "That wretched girl is nothing but trouble! She’ll get what’s coming to her!"

Richard’s heart sank at his mother’s venomous hatred for Evelyn, but he was powerless to change her mind.

Just then, two officers entered the room.

Richard stood. "Officers, is this about—?"

"Are you the family of Yvette Warren? The autopsy results are in. Her death has been ruled a homicide."

Madam Victoria erupted. "It’s that witch! I know it’s Evelyn!"

"Mother, enough!" Richard’s expression darkened.

She scoffed. "Who else would do this? You’d defend her even now? She despises us—she’d stop at nothing for revenge!"

The officers exchanged glances. One stepped forward. "Ma’am, please calm down. We’re here to gather information about the deceased."

"You must investigate thoroughly! My daughter-in-law was innocent! It had to be Evelyn—she’s the devil!"

The officer raised a brow. "What makes you say that?" His partner began taking notes.

"She framed my grandson and threatened us! She’s ruthless—she killed her!"

Madam Victoria’s hysterics made it hard to discern truth from rage.

Richard intervened. "Officers, my daughter isn’t capable of this. I trust you’ll conduct a fair investigation."

"Of course. Given this lady’s state, could we speak with you outside?"

"Certainly."

Richard followed them into the hallway, discussing the case for twenty minutes. As the officers left, Laura and Vivian appeared at the end of the corridor.
###Chapter 248

Laura's face drained of color when she spotted the police officers. She quickly averted her gaze as they walked past, relieved when they didn't seem to notice her unease.

"Dad, how's Grandma doing?" Vivian asked, oblivious to her mother's strange behavior.

Richard snapped impatiently, "Just go inside and stay with her."

Vivian entered the hospital room without another word.

Richard turned to Laura with narrowed eyes. "You couldn't even bother coming back until now. What exactly have you been doing?"

Swallowing her panic, Laura forced calm into her voice. "I just started a new job... Besides, no one called to inform me."

No one had contacted her last night when her face was still swollen from the altercation. She wouldn't have come even if they had.

Richard didn't press further. "Go see Mother now."

Laura plastered on a smile and entered the room. "Mother, I'm here to visit you."

Madam Victoria huffed. "Took you long enough to show up!" Already agitated about her grandson and daughter-in-law, she redirected her hatred for Evelyn toward Laura and Vivian.

"Mother, I'm so sorry about Yvette. I just heard the news. She was so young, but—" Laura feigned grief.

"That wretched Evelyn did this! I know it was her! I'll expose that vile girl's true nature!" Madam Victoria's voice shook with rage.

Laura froze. She hadn't expected the old woman to suspect Evelyn. This could work to her advantage.

"Mother... Yvette went to see Evelyn behind our backs. They might have gotten into a physical altercation and—"

"How would you know she went to see Evelyn secretly?" Madam Victoria's sharp eyes pinned Laura in place.

Biting her lip, Laura answered slowly, "Because Yvette was with me that day. She said Evelyn had been threatening her and wanted to confront her. If I'd known this would happen, I would have stopped her."

Two days later, the rumor spread like wildfire across the internet. Evelyn had been branded the "murderer" who killed her own aunt.

Theodore Goldmann sat in the Goldmann mansion's parlor, tossing aside the newspaper with a scoff. "How delightful. My grandson's fiancée is being labeled a killer before the wedding."

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered, voice steady. "My apologies, Mr. Goldmann. I'll handle this matter myself."

She refused to drag the Goldmanns into her problems and intended to resolve this alone.

"You didn't actually do it, did you?" Theodore's expression darkened, his piercing gaze testing her.

Evelyn clenched her fists as her lashes fluttered. Before she could respond, Nathan descended the staircase. "She's innocent."

Theodore snorted. "Spare me. Ever since your father married that actress plagued by scandals, I knew you'd repeat his mistakes."

He'd reluctantly accepted his son marrying a rumor-tainted actress, and now his grandson was set to wed another problematic woman.

Both blinded by pretty faces.

"I don't care about your so-called 'problems.' The fact remains Evelyn did nothing wrong." Nathan took Evelyn's hand and led her away. Watching his grandson protect her so fiercely, Theodore sighed. This girl would need to pass his tests if she wanted to become the lady of this household!
###Chapter 249

The media frenzy outside Goldmann Tower was overwhelming. Evelyn stepped out of the car with Nathan, shielded by a wall of bodyguards.

Even through the security cordon, camera flashes exploded like fireworks. "Ms. Vanderbilt!" a reporter shouted, shoving a microphone forward. "The online allegations claim you're a murderer. Care to comment?"

Another journalist elbowed forward. "Is it true you've been extorting your own family members?"

Nathan's grip tightened on Evelyn's shoulder as he turned to issue orders to his security team. Before he could speak, a venomous voice cut through the chaos: "Death to killers!"

A masked figure lunged from the crowd, blade glinting.

Nathan moved like lightning, taking the stab wound meant for Evelyn across his forearm.

"Nathan!" Evelyn's hands flew to his bleeding arm as the crowd gasped.

Security swarmed the attacker, ripping off his disguise. "You'll pay for this," the lead bodyguard growled.

Nathan barely glanced at his injury. "Just a scratch." His glacial stare swept across the press corps. "You have sixty seconds to leave before I have you removed."

The reporters scattered like frightened birds.

Evelyn's hands trembled as she retrieved her emergency first-aid kit. "You're bleeding everywhere," she murmured, applying pressure to the wound.

Nathan watched her frantic movements with quiet amusement. His gaze then snapped to the restrained assailant. "Who sent you?"

The man refused to meet his eyes. "N-no one—"

"Take him upstairs," Nathan commanded. "I want answers."

Evelyn's jaw set. "I'm coming too."

The would-be assassin now knelt bruised and battered in Nathan's office, flanked by stone-faced guards.

Evelyn circled him like a panther. "Speak."

"I told you, it was just for money!" the man whimpered.

"How much?" Evelyn demanded.

"Five grand. To stab you and make sure the cameras caught it."

The attacker swallowed hard. "The woman who hired me... she was older. Dressed fancy."

Recognition flashed in Evelyn's eyes. She turned to Nathan. "Have the police take him. I know exactly who's behind this."

Oliver arrived with a medical kit, which Evelyn commandeered. Nathan obediently shrugged off his bloodied jacket.

As she cleaned the wound, Nathan studied her concentrated expression. "You've figured it out?"

Evelyn dabbed antiseptic with surprising gentleness. "There's only one 'older woman' who'd go this far."

She secured the fresh bandage, then frowned up at him. "At this rate, people will start thinking the great Nathan Goldmann is made of glass."
###Chapter 250

Nathan arched his brows with a teasing smile. "Only you get to decide if I'm weak or not."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. Had he said those words before today, she would have called him shameless without hesitation. But now...

"I'll...try to be nicer to you, since you're putting in so much effort." The words left her lips with uncharacteristic shyness.

"How much nicer?" Nathan closed the distance between them, his voice dropping to a husky whisper as he drank in the sight of her radiant face. His Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

Without warning, Evelyn pressed her lips to his in a bold move that left him momentarily stunned.

Nathan's heart melted instantly, savoring the rare initiative from his usually reserved wife. He adored when she kissed him first.

"Your reward." Evelyn pulled away abruptly, turning to reorganize the first aid supplies with flushed ears.

Nathan wanted to let her escape - truly he did. But the sight of her flustered state proved irresistible. In one fluid motion, he pulled her against him, guiding her backward onto the couch.

"Nathan, stop!" Evelyn pushed against his chest. "We're in the office."

The thought of someone walking in made her skin prickle with embarrassment.

"No one's coming." His lips found the sensitive spot below her ear. "But your arm-"

"Focus."

That afternoon, Evelyn stood before a packed press conference in the corporate auditorium. Journalists from every major outlet filled the room, along with several obscure publications Nathan had undoubtedly summoned.

From the wings, Nathan observed silently while Oliver hovered nervously beside him. "Sir, these reporters are notoriously ruthless. Are you certain Ms. Vanderbilt can handle this?"

"I have complete faith in her."

Nathan's gaze never wavered from Evelyn. If she chose to trust him, he would return that trust tenfold.

The Vanderbilt contingent arrived en masse - Laura and Vivian escorting Madam Victoria, with York and Lydia trailing behind. Richard entered last, his steps measured.

Laura's face darkened when she saw Evelyn standing unharmed on the dais. How had the little bitch escaped unscathed? No matter. The "murderer" label would haunt Evelyn forever now.

Even this pathetic attempt at damage control meant nothing. Madam Victoria would never believe her.

"Good afternoon, members of the press. I'm Evelyn Vanderbilt - the so-called 'murderer' currently making headlines."

Evelyn's clear voice carried across the murmuring crowd. Unlike the cowering victim they expected, she met every camera lens with unshakable poise. "My family sits among you today. Feel free to ask anything in their presence."

"Ms. Vanderbilt," a sharp-featured reporter stood abruptly, "rumors suggest you fought with your family over Viana Jewelry shares. Is this true?"

Evelyn nodded calmly. "Absolutely true. We disagreed about Viana Jewelry's future."

The reporter pounced. "Did you kill for those shares?"

The room erupted in excited chatter.

Evelyn's lips curved into a mysterious smile. "Shall I tell you a story?"

She didn't wait for permission. "A man left his provincial hometown for the city, where he met a woman who promised to help him build a legacy. Together they established a modest company."

"But the man's family despised the woman - especially after she bore a daughter. Every holiday visit became an ordeal, with the man's mother and relatives hurling insults. Even the innocent granddaughter faced their contempt."
###Chapter 251

The years slipped away like sand through fingers. The woman succumbed to illness, leaving behind only a company and a daughter.

The man raised the girl alone, pouring his soul into the business while his so-called family turned their backs, offering neither support nor solace.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, a bitter laugh escaping her lips. "Years later, when the girl came of age, the man intended to entrust her with the company—only for his mother to storm in with a distant cousin’s son, demanding he hand over everything the girl’s mother had built."

Her voice sharpened. "All because they believed a daughter wasn’t worthy of inheritance."

Madam Victoria’s face darkened. She recognized the thinly veiled accusation in Evelyn’s words.

The reporters exchanged glances, murmurs rippling through the crowd.

How archaic. A daughter has every right to her legacy.

And to push her aside for some distant male relative? Disgusting.

"Evelyn Vanderbilt!" Madam Victoria’s voice cut through the murmurs, sharp as a blade. "Enough with your fairy tales. Explain how you murdered your aunt!"

A reporter stepped forward. "Ms. Vanderbilt, regarding the death of Yvette Warren—our sources indicate you clashed with your relatives over Viana Jewelry’s inheritance. Did vengeance drive you to kill her?"

Nathan stood behind the curtains, his jaw clenched. If Evelyn hadn’t insisted he stay out of sight, he would’ve dragged every last one of them through hell.

Evelyn met the reporter’s gaze. "Do you have proof?"

Silence. Then whispers.

Madam Victoria scoffed. "You lured Yvette out and had her killed!"

Evelyn smiled. "I was in Cornelia the entire day she died. How, exactly, did I manage that?"

"You hired someone!" Madam Victoria spat. "Just like you bribed a lawyer to steal Viana Jewelry!"

The room erupted.

Laura’s lips curled in triumph. This is it. You’re finished, Evelyn.

Nathan’s fingers twitched. He couldn’t stand idle any longer. But just as he moved, Oliver gripped his arm—

The doors swung open.

Two officers strode in, followed by forensic expert Dr. Joel Watson.

The crowd froze.

The police? Did they confirm Evelyn’s guilt?

Madam Victoria shot to her feet. "Officers! Arrest her—she’s the murderer!"

Richard stood abruptly. "Mother, enough—"

The police walked past them. Straight to Laura.

A warrant flashed in the light. "Ms. Scott, you’re under arrest for murder."

Laura’s smirk shattered. "W-What? That’s impossible! She’s the killer!"

Her face drained of color as handcuffs clicked around her wrists.
###Chapter 252

"Officer, this must be a mistake! How could my mother possibly kill anyone?" Vivian's voice trembled with disbelief.

The lead detective stepped forward, his expression grim. "There's no mistake, Miss Vanderbilt."

Evelyn's piercing gaze swept across the assembled Vanderbilts before settling on Laura. "Dr. Watson's forensic team extracted DNA from epithelial cells under Aunt Yvette's fingernails. The results match Laura Scott's genetic profile."

Laura's face drained of color.

Fingernails... That bitch must have scratched me when I grabbed her hair!

Joel Watson produced a manila folder with a flourish. "The full DNA analysis is here." He handed it to Richard, who scanned the document with growing horror before whirling to face Laura.

"So it was you?" Richard's voice was dangerously quiet.

Laura's hands fluttered like trapped birds. "No! This is insane! Why would I kill Yvette? I had no motive!"

Evelyn descended the stage steps with deliberate grace. "You had every motive when Aunt Yvette discovered your affair with Uncle York."

The revelation sent Laura stumbling backward. Even York looked like he'd been struck.

Suddenly, Laura erupted into hysterical laughter. "You vicious little witch!" She lunged at Evelyn, only to be restrained by two officers and a security guard.

Evelyn stood over her fallen stepmother, eyes glacial. "You brought this on yourself. All those years playing the victim while scheming against my father. The countless attempts on my life. And now murder?" She shook her head. "You're the most poisonous creature in this room."

Madam Victoria collapsed into her chair, hands shaking. Laura killed Yvette? Impossible!

Lydia seized Vivian's arm with bruising force. "Your whore of a mother is a murderer!"

"Enough!" Richard roared before turning to Evelyn. "Zoe, what exactly did you mean about Laura and her brother-in-law?"

York wiped sweat from his brow, unable to meet his brother's gaze.

The truth dawned on Richard. "My wife and my own brother?" A mirthless laugh escaped him. "Brilliant, Laura. Absolutely brilliant."

Though long estranged from Laura, the betrayal cut deep. They weren't even divorced yet.

Laura sneered through her tears. "You deserved it! You cast me aside like garbage—why shouldn't I take my pleasures where I could?"

Richard's entire body shook with suppressed rage.

"You were always the fool," Laura spat. "Falling for my act all those years ago, destroying your marriage to Isabella for me. Pathetic!"

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like a scalpel. "Yes, my father was blind. Blind enough to raise another man's child for twenty years."

The courtroom gasped. Richard went rigid.

Evelyn produced a second envelope, letting it fall at Laura's feet. Inside lay damning paternity results—proof Vivian wasn't Richard's biological daughter.

"Recognize these?" Evelyn asked softly. "They show exactly how you trapped my father and infiltrated this family with your lies."

The walls were closing in on Laura Scott, and everyone could see it.
###Chapter 253

Richard picked up the envelope lying on the floor, its contents spilling out—dozens of explicit photographs featuring a face he knew all too well. The paternity test results confirmed what he had feared: Vivian was not his biological daughter.

Vivian collapsed onto the floor, her body trembling.

"You're not Richard's child," Evelyn stated coldly, her voice devoid of emotion. "Laura used to work in the Underground Freeway. Her profession was... specialized. She entertained countless men. As for how she got pregnant—or who your real father is—I doubt even she knows."

"No! It's not true! Vivian is yours, Richard! You have to believe me!" Laura shrieked, desperation clawing at her voice.

"You lying witch." Richard flung the photographs at her, his fury erupting. "How dare you deceive me for years!"

Laura's face paled as realization dawned. She turned to Vivian, her hands outstretched. "Vivian, listen to me—I can explain—"

"Don't say my name!" Vivian recoiled, her voice breaking with revulsion. "You disgust me! Why did you even give birth to me? I hate you! And you—" She whirled on Evelyn, her eyes burning with venom. "I hate you too!"

With that, she bolted from the room, her sobs echoing down the hall.

Laura's breath hitched as she saw the raw hatred in her daughter's eyes.

The police wasted no time. They seized Laura, dragging her away before she could utter another word. The truth had been laid bare, and the media, having witnessed the scandalous spectacle, quickly dispersed.

Madam Victoria, Richard's mother, berated York Vanderbilt at the scene, her fury uncontainable. Lydia, York's daughter, stood frozen, struggling to process that her father had been involved with Laura.

Evelyn's gaze fell on her father's slumped shoulders. "I'm sorry, Dad..."

Richard swallowed hard, forcing a weak smile. "Don't apologize. At least now I know the truth."

Her throat tightened as she watched him walk away, his figure small and broken. All the resentment she had harbored toward him dissolved in that moment.

Then she felt a presence behind her.

Nathan.

Before she could speak, his arms encircled her, pulling her against his chest. His embrace was firm, his warmth seeping into her.

Evelyn stiffened in surprise.

"I was backstage the whole time," he murmured, his hand cradling the back of her head. "Worrying about you."

Her lashes fluttered shut. She had thought no one would ever care for her like this—except her children. But now, she wasn't alone.

A small smile curved her lips as she pulled back slightly. "Nathan... I never realized you could be so sweet."

Especially when he's not being his usual arrogant self.

Nathan's brow furrowed. "Sweet?" He scoffed, loosening his tie. "Is that how you see me?"

Before she could react, he swept her off her feet.

Evelyn gasped, instinctively wrapping her arms around his neck. "What are you doing?"

"Proving I'm not sweet," he growled, striding out of the room.

That night, Nathan made sure she understood exactly how not sweet he could be.

Exhausted, Evelyn fell asleep in his arms.

Nathan watched her for a long moment before pressing a kiss to her forehead. Then he slipped out of bed, dressed, and made a call.

"Sir, the prison reports Laura is refusing to confess," his assistant informed him. "She insists on blaming Evelyn and is emotionally unstable."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Then make sure she receives special treatment in prison."

"And Vivian?"

Nathan's voice was ice. "Send her where she belongs."

Mercy was not an option.
###Chapter 254

The dim lights of the underground market flickered ominously.

Garrett exhaled a cloud of smoke from his cigar, watching the trembling woman at his feet with cold amusement. "Mercy?" His voice was a low growl. "You should know better than to ask for that."

Vivian clutched the hem of his pants, her knuckles white. "Please! I'll do anything—just let me go!"

He tilted his head, studying her like a predator toying with its prey. "You think begging will change anything?" A cruel smirk twisted his lips. "Your mother's debts don't disappear just because you cry."

Her blood ran cold.

Laura Scott—her mother—had dragged her into this nightmare. Vivian had spent years resenting her for the lies, for the men, for the shame. And now, she was paying the price.

Why couldn’t I have been Evelyn? The thought burned like acid in her mind.

"I—I can repay it!" she blurted. "Nathan Goldmann—you know him, right? He’ll help me!"

Garrett burst into laughter, the sound harsh and mocking. "Nathan Goldmann?" He kicked her away, sending her sprawling onto the filthy floor. "Wake up, sweetheart. He’s the one who sent you here."

Her breath hitched. No. No, that can’t be true.

"Evelyn," she whispered, her nails digging into her palms. She did this. She turned Nathan against me.

"Starting tonight, you’ll earn back every cent your mother owes," Garrett said, his voice devoid of pity. "Try to run, and I’ll make sure you regret it."

Vivian collapsed, the weight of her fate crushing her.

My life is over.

And it was all Evelyn’s fault.

The morning papers were ablaze with the latest scandal.

Evelyn set the newspaper down, her fingers lingering on the headline. The media had painted her as the victim, condemning the Vanderbilts’ greed and Laura’s cruelty.

But they hadn’t mentioned Richard.

She glanced across the table at Nathan. "Thank you," she said softly. "For keeping my father out of this."

Nathan leaned back, his gaze steady. "If you really want to thank me," he murmured, "marry me."

Her pulse stuttered.

Marriage?

"T-That’s… sudden," she managed.

His lips quirked. "Our children aren’t getting any younger, Zoe. Don’t you think it’s time?"

Before she could respond, a sharp voice cut through the room.

"I haven’t approved this yet."

Theodore Goldmann stood in the doorway, Rosalind at his side. His stern gaze locked onto Evelyn. "She hasn’t passed my test. The answer is no."

Nathan’s expression darkened.

Evelyn swallowed.

This isn’t over.
###Chapter 255

Rosalind had overheard everything—Nathan actually intended to marry that woman. She bit her lower lip lightly, concealing the storm of resentment brewing in her eyes.

Nathan's expression darkened at the interruption. "I don't need anyone's permission to decide who I marry."

"Boy, are you deliberately defying me?" Theodore snapped, his voice sharp with authority. "Since she agreed to my conditions, I won't approve this marriage until she proves herself."

Nathan stood, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "So, you're saying if Evelyn completes the military training and achieves results, you'll give your blessing?"

Theodore hesitated. He sensed the trap in his grandson's words but couldn't back down now. "Fine. But she has to pass every test and show real progress within two weeks. Do you honestly think that's possible?"

An untrained civilian surviving half a month in the military? What kind of results could she possibly achieve?

Nathan's expression soured slightly.

Rosalind stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Theodore's arm. "Grandfather, this is too harsh on Ms. Vanderbilt. Maybe we should reconsider the bet."

Her words sounded sympathetic, but her true intention was clear—she wanted Evelyn to back out voluntarily.

If she quits now, she’ll save herself the humiliation. A pampered socialite like her won’t last a week in training. Grandfather is only setting her up to fail. Why would she willingly walk into this?

Nathan turned to Evelyn. "Zoe, forget the bet. You don’t have to do this."

Even if she backs out, even if Grandfather disapproves, I’ll marry her anyway. No one can stop me.

Evelyn had expected Nathan to believe in her. His words stung—he didn’t think she could do it.

"No," she said firmly. "The more you doubt me, the more I want to prove you wrong."

She finished her coffee in one gulp and stood. "I’m heading to the company now." Grabbing her bag, she strode out without another glance.

Nathan watched her leave, his jaw tight.

Theodore, surprisingly, looked almost impressed. She’s got spine. Not bad.

Rosalind noticed his shift in attitude, and a flicker of coldness passed through her gaze.

At Soul Jewelry Studio

"You're leaving for two weeks?" Gregory blinked in surprise as Evelyn handed over her workload.

"I’m enlisting for military training," she replied. "Everything’s in your hands until I return."

She paused. "Is Adrian Boucher’s jewelry order ready?"

Gregory nodded. "Finished. We can deliver it to his team today."

"Good. Handle the follow-ups for me." She smiled, but as soon as he left, her expression turned pensive.

She opened her desk drawer, pulling out a business card she’d never used.

Her fingers tightened around it.

No. I’ll deal with Mrs. Laurent when I get back.

Her phone buzzed—Edmund Lincoln was calling.

Administrative Office

"Nathan, you know Grandfather is making this impossible for Evelyn. Are you really going to let this happen?" Rosalind studied him carefully as he flipped through documents.
###Chapter 256

Nathan's gaze flickered slightly, but his voice remained steady. "She must have her reasons for leaving."

A pang of regret twisted in his chest. I should have trusted her. Evelyn wasn't the type to crumble under pressure.

She had always been stubborn, fiercely independent. If she walked away, it was because she chose to—not because she was weak.

The problem was, he didn’t know if she was angry. And if she was, he had no idea how to fix it.

A thought struck him, and he glanced at Rosalind. "You women all have similar tastes, don’t you?"

Rosalind paused, her lips curving into a practiced smile. "That depends. Why do you ask?"

Nathan exhaled, rubbing his temple. "Zoe’s probably been upset with me for a while. I was thinking of getting her something."

He was too preoccupied to notice the way Rosalind’s fingers dug into her palms, her nails leaving crescent-shaped marks. Her smile stayed in place, but her eyes turned icy.

"Isn’t Ms. Vanderbilt a jewelry designer?" she suggested smoothly. "She might appreciate something unique."

Nathan’s expression cleared. "You’re right. There’s an auction at The Jade Store tonight. They might have something she’d like."

He grabbed his coat, already turning toward the door.

Rosalind’s voice stopped him. "Nathan, would you like me to come with you? I could help you pick something out. After all, women do tend to understand each other’s preferences."

He hesitated, then nodded. "Alright."

A satisfied smile played on her lips as she followed him out.

Anything to stay by his side.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat across from Edmund Lincoln at a quiet café overlooking Antique Street. The district was famous for its jade trade, a labyrinth of old-world shops where deals were final—no refunds, no regrets.

"You look well," Edmund remarked, adjusting his vintage gold-rimmed glasses. "I saw the news about the Vanderbilts. I was concerned."

Evelyn smirked, lifting her teacup. "If something were wrong, do you think I’d be sitting here having tea with you?"

He chuckled. "Fair point. Though I did hear you turned down Lillian de Arma."

Her fingers tightened around the cup. "Nothing escapes you, does it?"

"I thought you might reconsider, given your mother’s lineage."

Evelyn’s gaze drifted to the window, her voice softening. "Uncle Edmund… why did my mother leave the de Armas?"

It didn’t make sense. Miranda had abandoned her name, her status, even her homeland—vanishing from Stoslo to Zlokova under a new identity.

People only did that when they were running from something.

Edmund’s expression darkened. "She was ill."

"Ill?" Evelyn’s breath hitched. "You mean the cancer was real?"

Her father had told her the same story—that her mother had succumbed to illness. But something about it had always felt… incomplete.

Edmund sighed. "Zoe, this isn’t the right time to discuss it."

Her eyes flashed. "You always say that. But I’m starting to think you’re hiding something."

She held his gaze, unflinching.

Because if there was one thing Evelyn Vanderbilt knew, it was that her mother’s past was anything but simple.
###Chapter 257

Edmund chuckled softly, shaking his head. "Didn't I tell you I'd reveal everything when you're ready? There's no point in telling you now, especially considering—"

He hesitated, glancing away.

"Especially considering what?" Evelyn pressed, her fingers tightening around her teacup.

Edmund set his cup down with deliberate calm. "There's a jade exhibition at The Celestial Gem today. Care to join me?"

Recognizing his attempt to divert the conversation, Evelyn exhaled sharply but let it go. The Celestial Gem's grand hall was a masterpiece of modern design, its shelves adorned with exquisite jade pieces. While common varieties like serpentine and moss-in-snow jade were openly displayed, the rarer imperial jades and kingfisher-grade pieces remained locked behind glass, reserved for privileged eyes only.

The venue buzzed with elite collectors and connoisseurs. Unlike typical jewelry auctions, The Celestial Gem specialized exclusively in jade. Edmund guided Evelyn to their seats, but as she turned, a familiar broad-shouldered silhouette caught her eye. Nathan? What was he doing here?

Her breath hitched when she noticed the woman beside him—Rosalind.

Rosalind leaned close to whisper something, her lips nearly brushing Nathan's ear. He remained stoic, his gaze fixed on the stage, offering only occasional nods.

When Rosalind's triumphant eyes met Evelyn's, the younger woman spun back around, crossing her arms defensively over her chest.

The auctioneer's gavel snapped Evelyn's attention to the stage. Why would Nathan attend with Rosalind? Were they...? She knew Theodore Goldmann favored Rosalind as Nathan's ideal match. If not for her and the children, they'd probably be together by now. So why did that thought make her stomach twist?

The current lot was a flawless white jade bangle, its crystalline purity magnified on the overhead screens. Evelyn chewed her lip as bids escalated—until Nathan's baritone cut through the crowd.

Her teacup rattled against its saucer. He'd just placed the highest bid for an obviously feminine piece. For Rosalind?

Edmund followed her line of sight and arched a brow. "Jealous?" he murmured.

Evelyn stiffened. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Your death grip on that purse says otherwise." His smirk was infuriating.

She forced her fingers to relax. Since when did she care about Nathan's shopping habits?

Nathan remained oblivious, but Rosalind had spotted Evelyn immediately.

She made no move to alert Nathan. Let the little upstart stew in her misconceptions. The way Evelyn's shoulders hunched? Priceless. "Leaving so soon?" Edmund asked as they stood.

"Office emergency," Evelyn lied smoothly. Truthfully, she couldn't bear watching them another second.

Edmund didn't press. "I'll drive you."

That night, Evelyn bypassed Goldmann Manor entirely, heading straight for Vanderbilt Estate.

Richard's face lit up when she announced she'd stay over—then clouded with concern. "Does Mr. Goldmann know you're here?"
###Chapter 258

Evelyn's expression shifted when Nathan was mentioned, but she forced a smile to reassure Richard. "I already told the children," she said softly.

Richard nodded in understanding.

"Dad, why don't you hire some help?" Evelyn changed the subject, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. "A housekeeper would give you more time to rest."

Richard waved his hand dismissively. "I've grown accustomed to having free time. Keeping busy suits me just fine."

Evelyn looked down at her lap, then suddenly brightened. "Why don't I bring the children to visit? You've never met them properly."

Richard hesitated before smiling tentatively. "That's true... Do you think they might... dislike me?"

"Of course not." Evelyn reached for his hand. "They're young but incredibly perceptive." In the past, she would never have considered bringing them to the Vanderbilt estate, but circumstances had changed.

The doorbell chimed through the house.

Richard rose to answer it, his posture stiffening when he saw their visitor. "Mr. Goldmann?"

Evelyn's teacup clattered against its saucer as she spotted Nathan in the doorway. 'How did he get here so quickly? Wasn't he enjoying his time at The Jade Store with Rosalind?' She watched as Richard ushered him inside, then abruptly set down her cup and retreated upstairs without a word.

Nathan's brow furrowed. Was she genuinely upset with him?

"Has something happened between you and Zoe?" Richard asked cautiously, sensing the tension.

Nathan offered a placating smile. "Nothing serious. I'll go speak with her." Richard nodded, stepping aside to let him pass. Some disagreements were best handled privately.

When Nathan entered Evelyn's bedroom, he found her meticulously folding a cashmere throw. The corner of his mouth lifted as he approached, wrapping his arms around her from behind. "Are we really doing this?" he murmured against her hair.

"Let go." Evelyn's voice was tight.

"Not until you tell me why you're angry." Nathan, who typically avoided explanations, found himself pressing for details. "Was it something I did? Or is this about our discussion this morning?"

Evelyn took a sharp breath, twisting out of his embrace to face him. "Figure it out yourself. Why ask me?"

Nathan studied her, uninterested in playing the blame game. Truthfully, he didn't care who was right. "I'm sorry. It's not that I don't trust you. I just couldn't bear seeing you put in that position."

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it. Was this his idea of an apology? And he thought this was about their morning argument? "Zoe, please." Nathan's voice softened as he cupped her face. The earnest look in his striking eyes disarmed her completely. No matter how furious she felt, she couldn't maintain her anger when he looked at her like that. If he'd been his usual stubborn self, she might have held her ground. But this vulnerable sincerity made her feel petty for being upset over something so trivial.

"Why are you here?" Evelyn crossed her arms, deliberately looking away. She hated how easily he could melt her resolve.

"Aren't you shipping out tomorrow?" His hands slid to her waist. "I wanted to spend the night—"

Evelyn pressed a finger to his lips, finally meeting his gaze. "Shouldn't you let me rest before training? Unless you want me sore all over tomorrow?"

Nathan caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "Fine," he conceded with a smirk. "I promise you'll get proper rest tonight."
###Chapter 259

"If that's how you feel, you should leave tonight." Evelyn pulled her hand away with a forced smile and pushed him toward the door.

The lock clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn leaned against the door, her mind replaying the scene of Nathan and Rosalind at The Jade Store. He hadn’t even apologized. How could he act so innocent?

Why did it bother her so much? She shouldn’t care.

Silence lingered on the other side. Had he left?

She had shoved him out. Any rational man would have walked away. But what if he hadn’t?

Against her better judgment, Evelyn turned the knob and peeked outside. Nathan still stood there, his wounded gaze piercing through her.

No.

She grabbed his collar, yanked him inside, slammed the door, and pinned him against the wall before crashing her lips onto his.

If men did this to assert dominance, why couldn’t women?

Nathan’s eyes darkened as he cupped the back of her head, taking control. He pulled her closer, backing her toward the bed until they tumbled onto it, clothes in disarray.

He nipped at her lower lip, voice rough. "Zoe, you started this—"

Her rare aggression unraveled him. She was his. Only his. Always.

He murmured something against her ear, but exhaustion claimed her before she could decipher it.

Nathan held her close, drifting off with her in his arms.

The next morning, Evelyn packed a single backpack—just essentials and hiking gear.

Nathan descended the stairs to find her in a high ponytail, no makeup, dressed for the wilderness. A stark contrast to her usual polished elegance, yet striking in its own way.

Oliver waited outside with the car.

Nathan walked her out, his hand lingering at her waist as he leaned in. "If you run into trouble, find Chloe."

Evelyn paused, meeting his gaze briefly before slipping into the car without a word.

As the vehicle disappeared, Nathan pulled out his phone.

"Has the ring from The Jade Store been delivered to ckgold yet?"

After winning the auction, he’d entrusted Rosalind with the arrangements, directing the delivery to ckgold Group. He’d planned to give it to Zoe upon her return—but patience wasn’t his strength.

He’d visit the training camp soon. A surprise.

Rosalind’s voice was cool. "Not yet. The store confirmed delivery in two days."

Nathan frowned. "Push them to expedite it."

After hanging up, Rosalind stared at the velvet box in her hand, her expression icy.

The armored SUV rolled through Swallow District’s dense woods, toward the secluded training camp.

Evelyn gazed out the window, lost in thought.

Theodore’s warnings about the Goldmanns echoed in her mind.

They were anything but ordinary.
###Chapter 260

The massive gates of the secret training facility in Swallow County slowly creaked open, revealing its military-grade interior. The sleek black Patton vehicle rolled through the entrance, carrying two unexpected visitors.

Oliver stepped out first, his polished shoes meeting the gravel with precision. Evelyn followed, her eyes widening at the sight of disciplined troops drilling in the distance. A muscular figure approached with Chloe, who looked strikingly different in her crisp uniform and beret - every inch the formidable soldier rather than the cheerful girl Evelyn knew.

"Evelyn!" Chloe's face lit up as she broke into a jog toward them. "What are you doing here?" Her combat boots kicked up dust with each eager step.

Oliver cleared his throat. "Ms. Vanderbilt will be training with us." His tone left no room for argument.

Chloe's smile faltered. She turned to Evelyn with concern. "Has Nathan lost his mind? This place isn't for..." Her voice trailed off as Oliver interrupted.

"It was Elder Master Goldmann's decision." The unspoken warning in his words made Chloe press her lips together.

Evelyn watched the silent exchange, understanding dawning. Theodore Goldmann was testing her. The realization sent both apprehension and determination coursing through her veins.

"Anyway," Chloe brightened, pulling the man beside her forward. "Evelyn, meet Harrison - mine and Oliver's older brother."

Harrison's keen eyes assessed Evelyn with professional detachment, though curiosity flickered beneath the surface. He'd heard much about Nathan's mysterious wife from Chloe's letters.

"Welcome, Ms. Vanderbilt," he said with a respectful nod, scratching his stubbled chin.

"Please, just call me Evelyn." She offered a small smile. "I'm here to train like everyone else for the next two weeks."

Chloe exchanged a doubtful glance with her brothers. The last female recruit had lasted three days before quitting. "Our training regimen is... intense."

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "I'll manage."

Something in her tone made Chloe's eyes spark with admiration. This was why Nathan had chosen her.

"Let me show you around, Zoe," Chloe said, using the affectionate nickname.

As they walked toward the barracks, Harrison turned to Oliver. "What's Elder Master thinking? She looks like a strong wind could knock her over."

Oliver adjusted his glasses. "Theodore's orders are clear - no special treatment. If she can't survive the fortnight, she'll never be accepted into the family."

Harrison whistled low. "Harsh."

Meanwhile, Chloe led Evelyn past groups of saluting cadets to the women's quarters. The shared rooms were spartan but clean, each containing two neatly made beds and basic amenities. Two sets of training fatigues lay folded at the foot of one bed.

The door burst open as a ponytailed girl juggling water bottles nearly dropped them at the sight of Chloe. "Captain Lawson! I didn't expect-"

"At ease, Rachel." Chloe gestured for the flustered recruit to approach. "This is your new bunkmate, Evelyn Vanderbilt. Evelyn, meet Rachel Dixon - our youngest recruit at nineteen."

Rachel wiped her palm on her pants before extending it. "Hi! Everyone calls me Rye. You can too!"

Evelyn shook the offered hand firmly. "Just Evelyn is fine."

"You two get acquainted," Chloe said, already moving toward the door. "Rachel can show you the ropes. And Evelyn?" She paused, her expression softening. "My door's always open if you need anything."

As Chloe's footsteps faded down the hall, Rachel turned to Evelyn with undisguised curiosity. "So... what's a fancy lady like you doing in hell's boot camp?"

Evelyn smiled as she ran her fingers over the coarse fabric of her new uniform. "Proving I belong."
###Chapter 261

The massive gates of the elite training facility in Swallow County slowly creaked open, revealing the sprawling military base beyond. The sleek black Patton glided through the entrance, carrying its two passengers into the heart of the compound.

Evelyn Vanderbilt stepped out of the vehicle first, her eyes scanning the regimented rows of soldiers drilling in the distance. Oliver Lawson followed close behind, adjusting his sunglasses against the bright sunlight.

A muscular figure approached them, accompanied by a striking woman in a crisp uniform. Chloe Lawson's short hair peeked from beneath her beret, giving her an androgynous charm that somehow enhanced her beauty. "Evelyn!" she called out, breaking into a jog toward the newcomers.

Oliver cleared his throat pointedly. "Ms. Vanderbilt is here for training," he announced before Chloe could ask questions.

Chloe's eyebrows shot up. "Has Nathan lost his mind? Bringing her to a place like this?" Her voice carried equal parts concern and disbelief.

"It was Elder Master Goldmann's decision," Oliver explained with a helpless shrug. Chloe's mouth opened and closed several times before she finally gave up protesting. 'Elder Master Goldmann's orders... He's pushing her too hard. She's so refined - how will she survive this?'

"By the way, Evelyn," Chloe said, brightening as she pulled the man beside her forward. "This is Oliver's and my brother, Harrison."

Harrison Lawson studied Evelyn with open curiosity. Chloe's frequent stories about Nathan's mysterious wife had piqued his interest long before this meeting. He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Vanderbilt."

"Just call me Evelyn," she replied with a small smile. "I'm just another trainee here for the next two weeks."

Chloe exchanged a doubtful glance with her brother. Few civilians lasted more than a few days in their intensive program, let alone delicate society women. "Our training regimen is... rigorous," Chloe warned carefully.

Evelyn's response came without hesitation. "I'll manage."

Chloe couldn't help but grin. This woman truly was Nathan's chosen partner!

"Ms. Zoe, let me show you around the facility."

"Thank you," Evelyn replied, following her guide.

Once they were out of earshot, Harrison turned to his brother. "What's Elder Master Goldmann thinking? She looks like she'd break in a stiff breeze. This isn't some finishing school."

Oliver sighed. "His orders were clear - no special treatment. Not even from you. She either completes the training satisfactorily or..." He left the implication hanging.

Harrison nodded slowly. So it was a test of character.

Meanwhile, Chloe led Evelyn through the women's barracks. The female cadets snapped to attention as they passed, saluting Chloe's superior rank.

They arrived at a shared dormitory - simple but clean, with two neatly made beds and basic amenities. The air conditioning hummed softly, a small luxury in the otherwise Spartan accommodations. Two sets of training fatigues lay folded on the second bed.

"Chloe! What are you doing here?"

A pigtailed girl carrying a water jug nearly dropped her load at the unexpected visitors. Chloe beckoned her forward. "This is your new roommate. Rachel Dixon, meet Evelyn Vanderbilt. Rachel's our youngest recruit - been here three months."

Rachel extended a slightly damp hand. "Hi! Everyone calls me Rye. You can too!"

Evelyn shook the offered hand firmly. "Just Evelyn is fine."

"You two get acquainted," Chloe said, already backing toward the door. "If you need anything, ask Rachel or come find me." She thumped her chest with mock solemnity, her eyes twinkling with amusement at playing the helpful guide.
###Chapter 262

Evelyn's eyelids grew heavy as she processed the information. 'Three assessments in just half a month? That means I must apply within the next seven days.' She mentally calculated the numbers. 'The maximum score per assessment is sixty points. To pass, I need to accumulate at least one hundred twenty points total.'

As evening fell, Rachel led Evelyn to the mess hall for dinner. The spacious dining area spanned two floors, buzzing with activity. At first glance, male trainees significantly outnumbered females.

"You'd better eat quickly once the food's served," Rachel warned with a knowing look. "Otherwise, you'll be left with scraps."

Evelyn smirked. "Sounds like you're speaking from painful experience."

Rachel responded with an embarrassed chuckle.

While queuing for their meals, Evelyn accidentally tripped over someone's outstretched leg. Only Rachel's quick reflexes prevented her from tumbling to the floor. The offender—a man lounging with his beret covering his face—nearly toppled from his chair from the impact.

Snatching off his hat, he sprang up angrily. "Who the hell—" His furious tirade died mid-sentence when he saw Evelyn's delicate features. The anger melted into stunned admiration. "Oh... it's... never mind."

Evelyn offered a polite nod before quickly moving away with Rachel.

A companion waved a hand in front of the dazed man's face. "Earth to Felix Boucher! She's gone!"

"Shut it," Felix growled, shoving the hand away. His gaze remained fixed on the retreating figures. A slow grin spread across his face. "Since when did we get such a goddess in this training camp?"

Swallow County had been testing his patience with its lack of attractive women—until now. Suddenly, his mandatory stay here didn't seem so unbearable anymore.

At their table, Rachel leaned in urgently. "Listen, you should avoid that guy you bumped into. He's the camp bully. Most people steer clear of him."

"That bad?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"His family connections make him untouchable. While we're here training, he treats this place like his personal playground—you'll rarely see him in actual sessions."

Evelyn merely smiled. Her sole purpose here was passing the assessments; camp politics held no interest for her.

Their conversation was interrupted when Felix sauntered over, flipping his hair dramatically before propping himself at their table. "New goddess, care to get acquainted?"

Evelyn met his gaze with an indifferent smile. "No."

The rejection sparked raucous laughter from Felix's entourage, drawing curious stares from nearby tables.

Felix shot his friends a withering look before turning back to Evelyn, undeterred. "No need to be shy, beautiful. Name's Felix Boucher. Remember it—mention my name if anyone gives you trouble here."

"That won't be necessary," Evelyn replied coolly.

Rachel tensed beside her, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. 'This is dangerous. If he loses his temper...'

But Felix merely grinned wider, clearly enjoying the challenge. His eyes gleamed with predatory interest as he studied Evelyn's unimpressed expression. The game, it seemed, had only just begun.
###Chapter 263

The corner of Evelyn's lips twitched.

No matter how hard she looked, there wasn't a single trace of anger on that infuriating man's face. Instead, he was resting his chin on his hand, watching her with an amused smirk.

Felix tilted his head, his fox-like eyes glinting. "Trying to get my attention, little goddess?"

Most women who attempted such tactics only earned his disdain—pretentious, calculating creatures.

But if it was her? Well, he'd happily play along.

Evelyn nearly choked on her soup. She scoffed, shooting him a glare. "Little brother, your ego is truly something else."

He nodded without hesitation. "I'm aware."

She had no comeback for that.

Suddenly, Felix reached into his pocket and pulled out a sleek chocolate bar. "Imported from Ampleforth. Want a taste?"

When she hesitated, he leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "Everyone's watching. Rejecting me again would be humiliating. Just take it."

Before she could protest, he pressed the chocolate into her palm, then sauntered back to his table, hands stuffed casually in his pockets.

Evelyn blinked.

What just happened?

A few tables away, a raven-haired woman with a pearl hairpin clenched her spoon so tightly her knuckles turned white. The girls beside her exchanged nervous glances.

"Did Mr. Boucher just... give away Winifred's chocolate?" one whispered.

The short-haired girl gulped. "He did. To her."

Evelyn returned to her room with Rachel.

"That chocolate is insanely expensive," Rachel said, eyeing the bar with awe. Then she grinned. "Sis Evelyn, does he like you?"

"Don't even start," Evelyn groaned. "I'm only here for two weeks. I don't need complications."

Rachel blinked. "Wait, just two weeks? I thought you wanted to be an agent?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Nope. Temporary assignment."

The next morning, Evelyn woke at 5 AM to pitch darkness and relentless rain.

Training wasn't canceled for weather.

The recruits ran laps around the muddy field, the male instructor's sharp whistle cutting through the downpour. One misstep, and they'd pay for it.

Rachel panted behind Evelyn, rain stinging her face. "What kind of cursed day is this? It hasn't rained in ages!"

"Tell me about it," another girl gasped.

Evelyn stayed silent, conserving energy. She adjusted her breathing, focusing.

Then a familiar voice purred beside her. "How was the chocolate last night? Sweet enough for you?"

Evelyn side-eyed Felix, resisting the urge to roll her eyes.

This man was relentless.

She sped up, but he matched her pace effortlessly. "Careful, little goddess. Wouldn't want you slipping."

Meanwhile, at Blackgold Group...

"Mr. Goldmann, Ms. Vanderbilt is performing exceptionally well in training," Oliver reported.

Nathan set down his pen, jaw tight. "I can't see her. How do I know you're not lying?"

His mind raced.

It's pouring. Does she have to train in this? What if she gets sick?

Does she sleep alright without me there?

Is that roommate of hers causing trouble?

The questions gnawed at him.
###Chapter 264

Nathan Goldmann sighed deeply as he stared at his phone screen. "I miss Evelyn already. It's only been one day."

Oliver Lawson couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Sir, she’s only going to be at the training camp for two weeks, not years."

Would he lose his mind if she were gone longer?

A knock interrupted them, and Rosalind Summers stepped into the office with a practiced smile.

"Nathan, your grandfather is returning to the Goldmann estate, and since Evelyn isn’t here, he asked me to pick up the children tonight."

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly.

The kids don’t like Rosalind. They’ll throw a fit if she shows up.

"That won’t be necessary," he replied coolly. "I’ll handle it myself and take them to the Vanderbilt manor."

He had promised Evelyn he’d visit Richard whenever possible.

Rosalind’s smile didn’t falter. "Very well. I’ll take my leave then."

The moment she turned away, her pleasant facade vanished, replaced by icy displeasure.

By the elevator, she pulled out her phone, her voice devoid of warmth. "Winifred, are you still at the camp? Good. I’ll visit you tomorrow."

The next day, Evelyn and Rachel Dixon walked across the training grounds.

"Field training starts tomorrow," Rachel said. "Any thoughts on who you want as your partner?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Doesn’t matter. I’ll go with whatever the instructor decides."

Field training meant being sent deep into the mountains, paired with another trainee. Evelyn wasn’t picky—she just needed to complete the mission.

As they approached their dorm, a familiar figure came into view.

Rosalind.

"Evelyn," she greeted smoothly. "How’s training treating you?"

Rachel, who didn’t know her, studied Rosalind with interest.

She’s striking, but in a sharp, almost aggressive way. Evelyn’s beauty is more refined—elegant and intelligent.

Evelyn kept her tone neutral. "It’s been fine. What brings you here?"

"I came to see a friend. I trained here once, you know." Rosalind tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, deliberately drawing attention to the white jade ring on her thumb.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to it, her expression cooling.

That’s the ring Nathan bought at The Jade Store.

Rosalind noticed her stare and lifted her hand, fingers brushing the ring. "You like it? I admired it when we were shopping, but I never expected Nathan to buy it for me."

Evelyn forced a smile. "It suits you."

She turned to leave, but Rosalind stopped her.

"Don’t misunderstand, Evelyn. Nathan and I have known each other since childhood."

Evelyn paused.

Again with the childhood card. Is she trying to claim some kind of seniority?

She turned back, her smile razor-sharp. "No misunderstanding at all. But no matter how close you two are, you’re still just his childhood friend."

With that, she walked away, Rachel hurrying after her.
###Chapter 265

Rosalind stood at the base of the stairs, arms crossed tightly over her chest, her gaze dark as she watched the silhouette disappear into the building.

If it weren’t for those three brats, she would never be worthy of standing beside Nathan.

"Sis Rosalind, have you been waiting long?" Winifred hurried over, snapping Rosalind out of her bitter thoughts.

A practiced smile curved Rosalind’s lips. "I didn’t expect you to actually come."

Winifred shrugged. "Of course I did. How’s the training camp been?"

Rosalind’s expression smoothed into indifference. "Fine. Though a new recruit arrived two days ago—someone I can’t stand."

Winifred’s face twisted in irritation. "Who?"

"Evelyn Vanderbilt, or something like that."

Rosalind’s brows lifted slightly. "Evelyn Vanderbilt?"

She hadn’t expected Winifred to already know about Evelyn, given how recently the woman had arrived.

"Yes, her." Winifred scoffed. "She’s already got Mr. Boucher wrapped around her finger. Always hovering around her like some lovesick puppy. Disgusting."

A slow, dangerous smile curled Rosalind’s lips.

Winifred despises Evelyn. This just got easier. I might not even need to lift a finger.

Nathan returned to the Goldmann mansion late that night, the three children in tow.

They had spent the day at the Vanderbilt manor, and it was clear they had warmed up to Richard, their maternal grandfather.

Rosalind stepped forward, her smile polished. "Nathan, you’re back. Have you eaten? If not, I can have the servants—"

"Daddy, I’m sleepy!" Daisy cut in, stretching her arms toward Nathan with a dramatic yawn.

Nathan chuckled, scooping her up. "Already?"

"Mommy says kids who sleep early grow big and strong," Daisy mumbled, rubbing her eyes.

She wasn’t tired—she just wanted Nathan’s attention.

Wrapping her arms around his neck, she pouted. "Daddy, will you read us a bedtime story?"

Nathan sighed in mock exasperation. "Fine. One story."

Liam and Caleb exchanged grins before bolting upstairs. "Story time!"

Rosalind, left standing in the foyer, clenched her fists.

Three little obstacles. But as long as Grandfather approves of me, I still have a chance. Evelyn? She’s nothing.

After tucking the children in, Nathan stepped out of their room—only to nearly collide with Rosalind.

She held out an ornate box from The Jade Store. "The ring you ordered arrived. I thought it might get misplaced at the office, so I brought it home for you."

Nathan took it with a curt nod. "Thanks."

He walked away without another word.

Rosalind’s smile didn’t waver, but her eyes darkened with something cold.

Dawn broke over the mountains, the fog lingering stubbornly.

By midmorning, the cadets were assembling, heavy packs strapped to their backs as they prepared for the day’s hike.

Evelyn knelt on the ground, adjusting the straps of her bag, when a girl with a high ponytail approached.

"Hey," the girl said. "My usual partner bailed. If you don’t have a teammate yet, want to pair up?"

Evelyn glanced up, considering. She hadn’t found a partner either.

"Sure."

Winifred grinned. "Perfect." She turned to the instructor. "Sir, we’re teaming up!"

The instructor nodded, marking their names down.

Evelyn didn’t miss the way Winifred’s smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

This should be interesting.
###Chapter 266

The instructor gave a curt nod.

Evelyn ventured deeper into the forest with Winifred, who regarded her with a polite smile. "You're Evelyn, right? I'm Winifred. I've been in the camp for a year. Nice to meet you." Evelyn returned the smile, though her instincts prickled.

"Did you volunteer for this training?" Winifred asked, her tone light but probing.

Evelyn didn't deny it. Instead, she tilted her head slightly. "I'm here for a test."

Winifred's eyes flickered, but she merely nodded and said nothing more.

The dense foliage swallowed the path behind them, the towering trees casting long shadows. New recruits were always paired with veterans—standard procedure. That was why Winifred had been assigned to her.

Evelyn scanned the surroundings, unease creeping in. "How much farther to the camp?"

Winifred hesitated, her gaze shifting away. "Not far. Maybe ten minutes."

But ten minutes passed, then twenty. The forest only grew thicker, the camp nowhere in sight. Evelyn stopped abruptly. "Are we going the right way?"

When she turned, Winifred was gone.

"Winifred?"

Only the rustling leaves and distant bird calls answered.

Evelyn's jaw tightened. If Winifred had been here a year, she’d know the route—unless she’d led her astray on purpose.

But why? They’d only just met.

Right now, finding Winifred was the priority.

Back at camp, the instructor frowned as he finished roll call. "Two missing."

"Sir, the new recruit and Winifred aren’t here," someone called out.

Felix scanned the crowd, his expression darkening when he didn’t spot Evelyn.

Then Winifred stumbled into view—alone.

The instructor marched toward her. "Where’s the recruit?"

Winifred bit her lip, feigning distress. "She wouldn’t listen to me. She insisted on heading north. I couldn’t stop her."

A ripple of shock spread through the group.

North. The restricted zone.

The camp sat on Swallow County’s southern edge, but the northern woods were uncharted—home to predators and treacherous terrain. Only fools ventured there.

Felix stepped forward, his voice sharp. "You expect us to believe a new recruit ignored orders? You left her."

Winifred recoiled, eyes widening. "Felix, I—"

He cut her off, turning to the instructor. "Sir, we need to send a search party. Now. Before nightfall."

The instructor’s face tightened, but he grabbed his walkie-talkie. "Main camp, we have a recruit lost in the restricted zone. Deploy rescue immediately."
###Chapter 267

The dense forest stretched endlessly before Evelyn Vanderbilt. She had been searching for what felt like hours, but the training camp's location remained elusive. Frustration gnawed at her as twigs snapped beneath her boots.

Was she truly lost in this wilderness?

Her military training told her to stay put - wandering aimlessly would only make rescue harder. With a sigh, she dropped her backpack and sank onto a moss-covered log.

Then came the rustling.

Evelyn froze. "Winifred?" she called out, her voice tight with hope. Silence answered. The movement stopped momentarily before resuming - something large moving through the underbrush.

Her breath hitched as a dark shape emerged. Not human. Definitely not human.

Slowly, she reached for her pack, fingers trembling. The creature moved closer. Sunlight glinted off curved tusks as a massive wild boar stepped into view. Its beady eyes locked onto hers.

Evelyn's palms grew slick with sweat. Running would trigger its chase instinct. She remained statue-still, barely daring to breathe.

A branch cracked under her shifting weight.

The boar charged.

Evelyn abandoned her pack in a heartbeat, sprinting for the nearest tree. Tusks grazed her boot heel as she scrambled up the trunk. The impact shook the entire tree as the boar rammed it with terrifying force.

She clung to a thick branch, heart hammering against her ribs. Again and again the beast attacked, until finally, with a disgruntled snort, it wandered off.

Night fell swiftly in the forest. Crickets began their evening chorus as Evelyn remained treed, unwilling to risk encountering the boar again.

Miles away, Chloe Lawson led the search party through the restricted zone. Their flashlights cut through the gathering darkness, tranquilizer guns at the ready.

"We've been out here for hours," one searcher complained. "At this rate-"

"Finish that sentence and I'll break your nose," Chloe snapped. Nathan Goldmann's wrath wasn't something she cared to face tonight.

A sudden rustle silenced the group. Weapons raised, they advanced toward the sound. Then - a flicker of light between the trees.

They found Evelyn tending a small fire, her face smudged with dirt. She looked up as they approached, relief washing over her features. "Took you long enough."

Chloe rushed forward, immediately noticing the tear in Evelyn's pants. "Zoe! What happened to your leg?"
###Chapter 268

"I encountered a wild boar and sprained my ankle while climbing a tree." Evelyn had been so consumed by the desperate climb that she barely registered the pain until much later, when the adrenaline faded.

"Do you realize this is a restricted zone? It's extremely dangerous terrain."

"This is restricted?" Evelyn blinked in surprise. Chloe nodded firmly while the soldier beside her added, "This is an ancient, uncharted forest teeming with predators. Consider yourself fortunate it was just a boar." Even trained personnel avoided wandering here alone. A boar was manageable - encountering a wolf pack would have been fatal. Evelyn fell silent, a disturbing realization dawning on her.

The base camp appeared through the trees, its perimeter lights glowing warmly. The instructor's tense shoulders relaxed visibly upon seeing the group return safely. However, his expression darkened when learning of Evelyn's transgression. "Restricted means prohibited! Were you attempting suicide, venturing there alone?"

"My apologies."

The sincerity in Evelyn's voice softened his stance. "No more reckless behavior. You'll be marked absent for today's training and assigned field cleanup at dawn as disciplinary action."

Back in the barracks, Rachel nearly tackled her in relief. "Thank goodness you're safe! What possessed you to enter restricted territory?"

Evelyn dropped her pack heavily. "Winifred led me there."

"Winifred?" Rachel's eyes widened. "But why would she...?"

"No clue." Evelyn couldn't recall offending anyone. Why would Winifred deliberately strand her in lethal wilderness? Had fortune not favored her, she might never have returned.

She resolved to confront Winifred later. "Rach, any food left?" Her stomach growled audibly, empty since lunch.

"Plenty!" Rachel produced a stacked meal container, then retrieved a second. "Seconds available if you're still hungry!"

Dawn's pale light found Evelyn alone on the dew-slick field, raking leaves while others breakfasted.

Felix materialized under an oak, hiding something behind his back. "Exhausted yet, little goddess? Require assistance?"

"Negative." Evelyn kept raking without glancing up. Felix pouted dramatically before revealing a steaming food box. When Evelyn paused, he teased, "By completion time, the mess hall will be closed. This is purely altruistic - no need for gratitude."

Her stomach growled betrayal before she could refuse.

Felix smirked victoriously. "Eat. I'll handle this." He snatched the rake with surprising enthusiasm for someone who'd likely never performed manual labor. Evelyn studied the meal, perplexed by his kindness but genuinely appreciative.

"Thanks."

Seated on a weathered bench, she ate hurriedly. Felix wasn't the spoiled aristocrat she'd assumed. Between rakestrokes, he stole glances - watching Evelyn's bowed head, the delicate motion of her lips as she chewed.
###Chapter 269

A gentle breeze played with Evelyn's hair, teasing loose strands from behind her ear to dance across her face. She kept tucking them back absentmindedly, a simple gesture that captivated Felix completely.

A maple leaf drifted down, landing softly in Evelyn's dark locks. Felix's breath caught. He moved toward her but stumbled over the forgotten rake, sending him crashing into Evelyn's space.

His hands shot out to brace against the bench, stopping his fall mere inches from her face. The sudden movement startled Evelyn, who turned to find Felix's intense gaze just breaths away. The moment stretched between them, charged and silent.

Winifred watched from the shadows, her nails digging into her palms. With shaking fingers, she snapped a photo and immediately forwarded it to Rosalind's chat.

At ckgold Group headquarters, Rosalind knocked sharply on Nathan's office door. He looked up from his documents, his piercing eyes questioning. "What is it?"

Rosalind approached with calculated steps. "I heard Ms. Vanderbilt entered a restricted zone yesterday. The punishment was leaf raking duty."

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. 'Why would she go there? Was she hurt? Why didn't Chloe inform me?' His jaw tightened.

Mistaking his concern for anger, Rosalind continued carefully, "She's unharmed, but..."

"But what?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low.

Rosalind feigned hesitation. "Someone sent me this. I debated telling you, but I thought you should know." She placed her phone before him.

The image showed Evelyn and Felix in what appeared to be a compromising position - their faces dangerously close, bodies nearly touching. "This is clearly meant to cause trouble between you two-"

"If that were true," Nathan cut in icily, "why send it to you?" His suspicious glare made Rosalind pale.

She bit her lip, realizing her mistake. "Forgive me, Nathan. I only had someone check on Ms. Vanderbilt because I knew you'd worry. I never expected... I'm sorry."

Nathan studied her for a long moment before dismissing her with a cold, "Don't waste my time with these games."

Once alone, Nathan's composure cracked. Just days apart and already she was getting cozy with another man? At this rate, she'd be eloping by month's end. He needed to remind that woman exactly who she belonged to - and that she had a family waiting.

Later in the library, Evelyn browsed the shelves when Winifred's cronies began whispering loudly.

"Some people can't help stealing men, even in training camp."

"Disgusting. Give her another week and she'll have seduced every male here."

Evelyn ignored them, but as she passed, Winifred grabbed her arm roughly. "I know what you did, you little slut."
###Chapter 270

Evelyn arched an eyebrow and turned to face her. "What exactly did I do?"

Winifred smirked triumphantly, convinced she'd uncovered Evelyn's dirty secret. "About you being a man-stealer."

This woman kept playing innocent, but everyone knew she'd been sent to the training camp for seducing another woman's man. Winifred was determined to expose Evelyn's true colors so Felix would see her for the snake she was!

Evelyn pulled her hand away and narrowed her eyes. "Have I ever done anything to you?"

Not only had Winifred led her into the restricted zone and abandoned her, now she was trying to lecture her based on some ridiculous rumor?

Winifred wasn't backing down. "You messed with Felix! That's how you offended me!"

Felix? All this drama over that man? Evelyn let out a dry laugh, raising a challenging brow. "Your pathetic crush on Felix isn't my problem. Don't take your failures out on me."

"I knew you were a scheming little—"

Evelyn suddenly gripped Winifred's chin, making her gasp. "W-what are you doing?"

That icy stare bore into her. "Didn't anyone teach you not to spread malicious gossip?"

The surrounding trainees watched in confusion. "Your insecurity isn't my fault," Evelyn continued calmly. "But being a toxic, jealous bitch? That's entirely on you." She released Winifred with a dismissive flick of her wrist.

Crossing her arms, Evelyn delivered her final blow. "Wonder what Instructor Lancaster would say if he knew you led a new recruit into restricted territory and left her there?"

"You— He'd never believe you!" Winifred's voice cracked with panic.

"Really?" Evelyn tilted her head. "I just arrived. How would I know where the restricted zones are? But you've been here a year... Do you think the instructor's an idiot?"

With a careless shrug, Evelyn watched as Winifred turned pale and stormed off in a huff. Shaking her head at the childish display, Evelyn turned away.

Meanwhile, Winifred marched straight to the basketball court where Felix was playing. "Felix!" she shrieked.

The young Boucher heir didn't even glance her way, focused on his game. His friends nudged him until he finally turned with an irritated scowl. "What?"

Winifred stomped closer. "Did you know Evelyn's a known man-stealer? She got sent here because she was sleeping with someone else's husband! Don't be fooled by her act!"

Felix tucked the basketball under his arm, giving her an incredulous look. "Are you delusional, Winifred? Since when did you become such a gossip?"

"It's the truth! Why won't you believe me?"

"Why should I?" Felix passed the ball to a teammate and planted his hands on his hips. "Listen, Winifred. I know you're into me, but you're not my type." He pointed a warning finger at her. "And if you mess with Evelyn again, you'll regret it."

Snatching the ball back, he returned to his game without another glance.

"You'll regret this, Felix Boucher!" Winifred screamed after him before collapsing onto a bench in tears.

Two other girls rushed to comfort her, whispering suggestions. Winifred wiped her eyes viciously. "Didn't you hear him? He threatened me if I go near her again!"
###Chapter 271

"Who said we need to confront her directly? Isn't Rachel sharing a room with her? Since they're so close, let's deal with Rachel first."

With no training scheduled for the afternoon, Evelyn stayed in her dormitory, reviewing materials for the upcoming assessments while stealing moments of rest.

'Two more days until I can apply for the evaluation. Time flies so fast - half a month will be gone in a blink.'

Noticing Rachel's prolonged absence, Evelyn set aside her book when the door creaked open. "Rachel, you're back—"

She turned to find Nathan closing the door behind him. Springing to her feet, Evelyn gasped, "Nathan? What are you—"

"Surprised?" His fingers twisted the lock with deliberate precision.

Fear prickled Evelyn's skin at the thought of Rachel returning to this scene. As she moved toward the door, Nathan's arm snaked around her waist, lifting her effortlessly onto the narrow bed.

"Have you lost your mind?" Evelyn struggled against his grip. "This is the women's dormitory!"

'This arrogant bastard. Is this all he ever thinks about?'

Nathan pinned her wrists above her head while his free hand conducted a slow inspection of her body. "I heard you broke into a restricted zone," he murmured, his voice deceptively light. "You're tougher than you look. Doesn't seem like you suffered much."

Evelyn's breath hitched. 'Has Chloe been reporting on me?'

"Let me go, Nathan." She twisted beneath him, acutely aware that Rachel could return any moment.

His fingers tightened on her chin, forcing her to meet his penetrating gaze. "Did you miss me?"

Her eyelashes fluttered as the memory surfaced - that damned ring Nathan gave Rosalind, glinting on her finger just days ago. Evelyn turned her face away sharply. "No."

Nathan's eyes darkened, his lips pressing into a thin line. "Is it because of that Boucher trash? Felix Boucher caught your eye?"

'Felix Boucher? That worthless playboy?' The shock showed plainly on Evelyn's face - not at the accusation, but at the revelation of his identity. 'Rachel mentioned his powerful family background. Everyone here calls him Mr. Boucher... So Boucher is his surname. The second son of the Bouchers...'

The mattress dipped as Nathan leaned closer, his breath hot against her ear. "Answer me." His voice held dangerous calm, the kind that preceded storms.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. The air between them crackled with unspoken challenges, the dormitory walls suddenly feeling far too small to contain their collision. Somewhere beyond the locked door, footsteps approached - light, familiar. Rachel's.

Nathan didn't flinch, his body still caging hers. "Well, Evelyn? Shall we give your roommate a proper welcome?"
###Chapter 272

Evelyn remained silent.

Nathan's fingers brushed against the cool white jade ring in his pocket before he took her hand, sliding it onto her thumb with deliberate care. "I wanted to give you something today," he murmured. "Do you like it?"

The moment Evelyn saw the ring, her expression darkened.

Like it?

A bitter laugh nearly escaped her lips.

She sat up abruptly, yanking the ring off and hurling it to the floor. The delicate jade shattered instantly.

Nathan's face turned stormy. His grip on her wrist tightened, the fury in his eyes scorching. "Evelyn Vanderbilt," he growled, "don't mistake my patience for weakness."

"What do you think I am?" Evelyn met his murderous glare with bloodshot eyes, her voice laced with venom. "Nathan, did you really think I wouldn’t find out? You and Rosalind went to The Jade Store together—wasn’t this ring meant for her?"

Her chest heaved. "Not only did you buy it for her, but you had the audacity to give me something she wore first? Am I just some beggar to you, taking whatever scraps others discard?"

Nathan froze.

What?

Since when had this ring ever belonged to Rosalind?

His lips parted, dry from disbelief. "Zoe, I—"

"I don’t want to hear it." Evelyn turned away, lying back down with her back to him. The ache in her chest was unbearable, as if something long buried had finally ruptured.

She could have ignored the ring.

But knowing it had touched Rosalind’s skin first?

Unacceptable.

Nathan’s outstretched hand hovered in the air before he slowly withdrew it. His jaw clenched. "Throw it away if you want," he said coldly. "That ring was never meant for Rosalind. It was always yours."

When Evelyn didn’t respond, he exhaled sharply. "Rest well."

The door clicked shut behind him.

Only then did Evelyn bite her lip hard enough to draw blood.

She hated this.

Hated how much power he still had over her emotions.

Nathan slammed the car door behind him, his knuckles white against the steering wheel.

Evelyn wasn’t irrational. If she had accused him like that, something had happened—something he didn’t know about.

He grabbed his phone. "Oliver," he snapped. "Go to The Jade Store. Find out exactly when that white jade ring was delivered. And keep this investigation quiet."

Especially from Rosalind.

Hanging up, Nathan’s expression turned glacial.

Damn it. I should’ve been more careful.

By ten that night, Evelyn had finally calmed down.

She picked up the broken pieces of the ring, turning them over in her palm. Nathan’s words echoed in her mind.

"It was always yours."

But she had seen him with Rosalind at the store.

With a frustrated sigh, she dropped the fragments into a small velvet pouch. I’ll have Chloe return this to him later.

Her gaze flicked to the window. It was pitch black outside, and Rachel still wasn’t back.

A prickle of unease ran through her.

Despite only knowing Rachel for a few days, Evelyn couldn’t shake the worry. She grabbed her jacket and headed out.

At the stairwell, she froze.

Two shadowy figures stood whispering, Rachel’s name slipping from their lips.

Evelyn stepped forward, blocking their path.

"Looking for someone?"
###Chapter 273

The two girls froze in their tracks.

"Where's Rachel?" Evelyn's icy stare pinned them in place.

One girl swallowed hard before answering. "Earlier...we saw Winifred and her friends take Rachel somewhere. We don't know where."

'Winifred again!'

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial.

Winifred lounged in her dorm with two cronies, laughing about their cruel prank on Rachel as if it were some hilarious joke.

The door exploded inward with a violent kick, making all three jump.

Winifred scrambled to her feet when Evelyn stormed in. "Hey! You can't just—"

The sharp crack of Evelyn's palm meeting Winifred's cheek echoed through the room. The other two girls gasped as Winifred stumbled back, clutching her face.

"You hit me?" Winifred's voice trembled with disbelief.

Evelyn grabbed her collar and shoved her against the wall. "Where. Is. Rachel."

Winifred's eyes flashed with defiance despite the stinging cheek. "After attacking me, you think I'll tell you anything? You'll regret this!"

She lunged forward, nails aimed at Evelyn's face.

Evelyn caught her wrist mid-air and delivered another stinging slap that sent Winifred crashing to the floor.

Tears welled in Winifred's eyes as she cradled her swollen face. "You—"

Evelyn snatched a steel fork from the nearby table.

The other girls scrambled backward, but Evelyn only had eyes for Winifred. She hauled the sobbing girl up by her shirt collar, pressed her against the bed frame, and held the fork's sharp tines against her jugular.

"Having fun tormenting people?" Evelyn's voice was deadly calm.

Winifred's breath came in panicked gasps. "E-Evelyn Vanderbilt, if you dare—"

Evelyn's cold laugh cut her off. "Try me. I've never backed down from anything. Today's your lucky day - you've managed to piss me off at just the right time."

She twisted Winifred's wrist painfully against the mattress. "Let's see how brave you feel now."

The fork flashed downward.

Winifred screamed.

The other girls covered their eyes, expecting blood.

But the fork embedded itself in the mattress between Winifred's splayed fingers, missing flesh by millimeters.

Winifred went deathly pale, her entire body shaking.

"Now you understand fear," Evelyn whispered, pulling the fork free. "Consider this your warning. Next time, I won't miss."

When Evelyn released her, Winifred collapsed like a puppet with cut strings.

Evelyn found Rachel locked in a bathroom stall, her weak knocks barely audible. The moment Evelyn removed the jammed broom, Rachel tumbled out, shivering violently in soaked clothes.

"I'm so sorry, Rachel." Evelyn caught her before she hit the floor.

Rachel burst into tears at the sight of her rescuer. Evelyn quickly helped her back to their room, where Rachel changed into dry clothes and huddled under blankets, still trembling from hours of cold and hunger.
###Chapter 274

Evelyn handed a steaming mug to Rachel, watching as the younger girl wrapped her chilled fingers around the ceramic. "You must be starving. I've got instant ramen in my bag - the ones you gave me two days ago. Let me fix it for you."

Rachel nodded silently, bringing the mug to her lips with trembling hands.

Turning slightly, Evelyn met Rachel's downcast gaze. "This is my fault. I never should have dragged you into my mess."

The thought of what could have happened made Evelyn's stomach churn. If she hadn't been so stubborn, Rachel wouldn't have spent hours locked in that freezing bathroom.

Rachel's lips quirked in a weak attempt at a smile. "Don't blame yourself. Truth is...I'm pretty pathetic." She stared into her mug. "Three months in this program and I still can't hold my own. What kind of agent freezes up during basic hazing?"

The memory of being overpowered and drenched with ice water made Rachel's cheeks burn with shame. Evelyn poured boiling water into the cup noodles, letting them steep before moving to sit beside Rachel. "You're new. Real training takes years. You're young - with enough practice, you'll surpass them all."

Rachel's eyes searched Evelyn's face. "Is it true you're only staying two weeks?"

Evelyn's gaze dropped as she nodded.

"That's...unfair." Rachel's voice cracked. "I finally meet someone decent here, and you're leaving so soon."

Evelyn chuckled, nudging Rachel's shoulder. "You can always reach me through Chloe. Who knows? Maybe I'll visit."

She stood abruptly, her expression hardening. "Though I doubt Wynona and her pack will believe that after today's lesson."

Rachel's eyes widened. "You actually confronted them? But what if-"

"Would hiding make it better?" Evelyn's piercing stare held Rachel in place. "Some people only understand one language. And kindness isn't it."

Rachel swallowed hard, seeing the truth in Evelyn's words.

"Eat up," Evelyn said, gesturing to the noodles. "Tomorrow comes early here."

The next morning...

Evelyn stood at attention in the instructor's office, facing Mr. Lancaster's desk. Winifred and her clique lurked near the door, avoiding eye contact. The memory of last night's confrontation still had Winifred's hands shaking.

Mr. Lancaster slammed a bent fork on his desk. "Care to explain this?"

Evelyn didn't flinch. "Yes, sir. Though I'd suggest asking why they pushed me to that point first."

"Enough!" The instructor's fist hit the desk. "This isn't some back alley brawl! You threaten fellow trainees again, you're gone!"

Winifred hid a smirk behind her hand.

'Rules forbid intimidation between recruits. She's done for.'

Evelyn turned slowly, her gaze locking onto Winifred's smug expression.

'Playing victim? How original.'

"Sir," Evelyn said calmly, "I have no quarrel with them. But locking a recruit in freezing conditions crosses lines. Perhaps ask why they targeted Rachel first?"

Winifred's friend scoffed. "Lies! We never touched her!"

'She can't prove anything anyway.'

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. The game was just beginning.
###Chapter 275

"Yes, sir. She barged into our room uninvited and started threatening us without provocation. She even struck Winifred across the face. We've done nothing wrong." Their voices overlapped in practiced harmony, confident in their numerical advantage and mutual alibis against Evelyn's defense.

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when Instructor Lancaster slammed his palm on the desk. "Enough! No further explanations necessary. This training camp has no place for violent behavior. Pack your belongings immediately."

Winifred and her clique exchanged smug glances beneath lowered lashes.

'No matter how talented she is, expulsion still falls on her shoulders.'

Evelyn remained rooted to the spot, her posture unwavering. The instructor blinked at her defiance. "Did I stutter? You're dismissed."

"I'm not leaving." Evelyn's voice carried glacial calm. "They violated regulations first. Why am I the one being punished?"

Instructor Lancaster's face flushed crimson. Never had he encountered such brazen insubordination. He shot to his feet. "Evelyn Vanderbilt! This is a military training facility, not some debutante ball! When I give an order—"

"I committed no infraction." Her arctic gaze locked onto his. "Therefore I won't—"

"Mr. Lancaster, what seems to be the problem?" Chloe Lawson's melodic voice sliced through the tension as she appeared in the doorway.

The instructor stiffened. "This doesn't concern you, Ms. Lawson."

Chloe glided forward, resting a casual hand on his shoulder. "When cadets face disciplinary action, protocol requires senior officer oversight. Surely you remember procedure?" Her smile didn't reach her eyes.

Instructor Lancaster's jaw twitched. Within these walls, Chloe Lawson held dual authority—both as Commander Henry Lawson's sister and Goldmann Banquet's executive leadership. Only the highest-ranking officers could countermand her.

"Ms. Lawson!" Winifred seized the opportunity. "Evelyn attacked us with a dinner fork last night! She could've blinded me!"

"Indeed!" Another cadet chimed in. "We all witnessed her unprovoked assault!"

Their voices tumbled over each other in their eagerness to paint Evelyn as the aggressor.

Chloe's perfectly arched brows lifted. "Were any medical reports filed?" She turned to Evelyn. "Did you injure them?"

Evelyn's expression remained impassive. "They're perfectly healthy. Though I'm sure the infirmary would happily bill them for unnecessary examinations."

Chloe's attention swung back to the accusers. "If there are no injuries, how exactly were you harmed?"

The cadets shifted uncomfortably. Winifred's fingers flew to her cheek. "She slapped me! The mark's faded now, but she threatened us with cutlery!"

'Twisting facts requires such minimal effort,' Evelyn observed silently.

Chloe tilted her head. "Is this accurate?"

Evelyn shrugged. "If you consider self-defense an attack. They tormented my roommate. When I confronted them, five against one seemed unfair odds. I merely... balanced the equation." She fluttered her lashes. "I'm rather delicate, you see."

A chorus of choked coughs erupted from Winifred's group. 'Delicate? The woman disarmed three cadets in under ten seconds!'

Chloe's lips twitched. "Mr. Lancaster, self-preservation hardly constitutes brawling."

The instructor spluttered. "Preemptive violence is still—"

"Show me your injuries then," Chloe interrupted, extending a palm toward Winifred. "Proof of this alleged assault."

Winifred's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish. The faint redness from last night's slap had vanished with morning light. Her manicured nails curled into fists.

Evelyn watched the unraveling farce with detached amusement. The scales were tipping—she could feel it in the sudden tension coiling through Winifred's shoulders, in the way Instructor Lancaster avoided Chloe's penetrating gaze.

The game wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 276

"Did you learn nothing valuable from this training camp? Is harassing teammates the only skill you've mastered?" Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Mr. Lancaster, appropriate disciplinary action must be taken. Otherwise, this behavior will continue unchecked."

The instructor hesitated when Chloe Lawson intervened, then ordered sternly, "All of you - ten laps around the field immediately!" Though Winifred and her clique seethed with resentment, they had no choice but to storm out.

Evelyn followed Chloe into the corridor. "Thank you for stepping in." She recognized Chloe's protective stance and felt genuine gratitude. "Evelyn, don't mention it." Chloe lowered her voice. "By the way, Nathan Goldmann visited yesterday. Did you tell him about accidentally entering the restricted zone?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Wasn't it you who informed him?"

Chloe's hands flew up in denial. "Absolutely not! I hadn't even filed my report yet. You're saying you didn't tell him either?" Evelyn shook her head slowly.

'If Chloe didn't report it...' Evelyn's fingers curled into her palms. 'First the rumors about Felix, now this. Someone's watching my every move.'

At Goldmann Group headquarters...

"Mr. Goldmann, The Jade Store confirmed delivery of your jade ring on the 12th. Ms. Summers collected it from reception the following morning—" Oliver Lawson's report was cut short by Nathan's glacial expression, his lips pressed into a razor-thin line.

'Rosalind had the ring before my call.' Nathan's knuckles whitened around his pen. 'She dared visit Zoe with my family heirloom without authorization.' The betrayal cut deep - childhood bonds and his grandfather's favor meant nothing against such presumption.

"Instruct Harrison to revoke Rosalind's training camp access."

Oliver shifted uncomfortably. "But sir... your grandfather specifically ordered Ms. Summers to oversee Ms. Vanderbilt's final assessment."

Nathan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Did he now?"

One week later...

Evelyn strode into the administration office, her request form crisp between her fingers. The instructor blinked at her early assessment application. "You've only completed half the program."

"I'm ready." Her voice left no room for debate.

After scanning the determined set of Evelyn's shoulders, the instructor slid the waiver across the desk. "Read all terms carefully before signing." Evelyn's pen barely hesitated before etching her signature in bold strokes.

Outside, Felix Boucher materialized from the shadows, making Evelyn jump. "What now?" she demanded, crossing her arms.

Felix adopted a wounded expression. "Still mad, little goddess? I apologized a dozen times for that misunderstanding."

"Keep your distance," Evelyn warned.

"Did Winifred cause trouble?" Felix's playful demeanor vanished. "I've made it clear I'm not interested. If she's harassing you—" He rolled up his sleeves with sudden violence.

Evelyn caught his arm. "Don't be ridiculous. I don't need you fighting my battles." She stepped back, putting professional space between them. "I'm here for one purpose only. In seven days, this ends. There's no reason for further contact."

The steel in her voice left no room for argument. Felix opened his mouth, then closed it with a resigned nod as Evelyn turned on her heel, her ponytail swinging like a metronome counting down their final days in this gilded cage.
###Chapter 277

"Leaving? Only one week left?"

Felix froze mid-step, his coffee cup nearly slipping from his fingers. "You're departing so soon?"

Evelyn adjusted her training gloves with practiced ease. "My assignment here was always temporary. Once the assessment results come in next week, I'll return home."

She'd never intended to form attachments at this training facility. Complete the mission, collect the data, leave. That was the protocol.

Felix's shoulders slumped like a deflated balloon. His goddess was slipping through his fingers.

"Mr. Boucher," Evelyn's voice cut through his melancholy, "don't waste your energy on me."

Caught red-handed, Felix flushed but squared his shoulders. "It's not wasted if given freely."

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Then let me be blunt. I'm married. Three children. Your pursuit is pointless."

The coffee cup finally hit the floor.

"You're joking." Felix's laugh sounded strangled. "If you're rejecting me, just say so. No need for elaborate stories."

Evelyn arched one eyebrow. "The Boucher family has resources. Verify it yourself."

Felix's mouth worked soundlessly. His romantic fantasies shattered like the porcelain at his feet.

A firm pat landed on his shoulder. "Appreciate the breakfasts. I'll repay the favor someday."

Evelyn strode away without looking back.

Felix remained rooted, his mind replaying her words on loop. Married. Children. How? Who was the bastard who'd claimed her first?

"Felix." Winifred emerged from the shadows, triumph curling her lips. "Now you see her true colors? A married woman leading you on—"

"Shut up." Felix shook off her grasping hands violently.

Winifred's face contorted as he stormed away. "That Vanderbilt witch!" She kicked the broken coffee cup. "One week until assessments? I'll make sure she fails spectacularly."

——

Two days later, whispers followed Evelyn through the training halls.

"Evelyn Vanderbilt? The newbie? She's attempting assessments after one week?"

"Suicidal. Most wait three months minimum."

The standard program duration was ninety days. Only after completing this period could recruits apply for evaluation. Passing meant official membership.

Top performers might earn selection for Stoslo's elite training—a brutal proving ground that created legends like Chief Lawson or forgotten foot soldiers.

Rachel accompanied Evelyn to the testing arena. The space buzzed with candidates and spectators alike.

Today's trial: combat proficiency.

Evelyn would face veterans with over a year's training.

A lamb walking into a lion's den.

Or so they thought.

Rachel squeezed Evelyn's arm. "You sure about this?"

Evelyn rolled her shoulders, cracking her neck. "Watch and learn, roomie."

The crowd parted as Evelyn stepped into the ring. Across from her, Logan Heinrich smirked, cracking his knuckles.

"One week versus twelve months," Logan taunted. "This'll be quick."

Evelyn settled into her stance. "Don't blink. You might miss your defeat."

The bell rang.
###Chapter 278

"Evelyn, are you sure you want to go through with this assessment?" Rachel whispered nervously, her fingers twisting the hem of her shirt.

A confident smile played on Evelyn's lips as she gave Rachel's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Trust me, I've got this."

The heavy doors swung open, revealing the assessment hall. The Lawson siblings entered first, followed by the stern-faced instructor. But it was the woman walking beside them that made Evelyn's blood run cold.

Rosalind Summers.

Evelyn's grip tightened on her practice sword as she watched Rosalind take her seat at the deputy examiner's table. Their eyes met across the room, and Rosalind's lips curled into a knowing smirk that sent shivers down Evelyn's spine.

"That's Ms. Summers," someone murmured behind her. "She's the deputy examiner today."

"Isn't she stunning?" another trainee sighed.

The whispers of admiration filled the hall. Rosalind had joined the training camp years ago, part of the same elite batch as Harrison and Chloe Lawson. Her senior status was undisputed. But the real commotion began when the doors opened again.

Nathan Goldmann strode in like a storm.

"Oh my God! Is that Mr. Goldmann?"

"Mr. Goldmann is attending our assessment? This is unbelievable!"

Rachel gasped beside Evelyn. "I can't believe we're seeing the legendary Mr. Goldmann in person!"

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat. What was he doing here?

Winifred, standing nearby with her clique, scowled at the awestruck trainees. "Don't even bother dreaming, girls. Mr. Goldmann would never look at any of you. Only Rosalind is worthy of him."

Winifred truly believed Rosalind was perfection incarnate, the only woman who could match Nathan Goldmann. Rosalind herself stood abruptly when she spotted Nathan. "Nathan? What brings you here?"

His response was ice cold, meant for her ears alone. "I don't trust you."

Harrison Lawson, the original head examiner, immediately surrendered his seat to Nathan. The entire hall erupted in shocked whispers.

"Mr. Goldmann is the examiner now?"

Rosalind's smile faltered at Nathan's words. Had he figured something out? A flicker of panic crossed her features before she schooled them back into calm. She hadn't personally interfered with Evelyn's assessment - she wasn't that stupid. Now she could only hope Winifred's arrangements wouldn't fail her.

Evelyn refused to look at the stage. Nathan as examiner? Watching him and Rosalind sitting together, so perfectly matched, made her stomach churn. He'd clearly chosen to believe Rosalind about the ring incident.

The instructor cleared his throat. "Assessment participants, let me reiterate the rules. Each match has a strict time limit. If a participant is forced out of the arena or rendered immobile within that time, they will be eliminated."

He picked up the list, pausing when he saw the first names. The tension in the room thickened as he announced, "Lillian Heinrich and Evelyn Vanderbilt."

Even the instructor seemed surprised by this pairing. Sending a newcomer like Evelyn against Lillian, who'd been training for two years? Lillian had been the top performer in last season's assessment. This was either an insult to Lillian or an overestimation of Evelyn's abilities.

Nathan's brows furrowed as he scanned the assessment sheet. Whose idea was this arrangement?

A cold satisfaction gleamed in Rosalind's eyes. Winifred hadn't disappointed her after all.

Winifred turned to smirk at Evelyn, her expression dripping with smug superiority. "How unfortunate for you, facing Lillian right away. Don't expect any mercy from her."
###Chapter 279

Evelyn paid no attention to the taunts. She reached into her pocket and slipped a silver ring onto her index finger before turning decisively toward the combat circle. Nathan followed her movements with sharp eyes.

Her opponent, Lillian, was a muscular woman with cropped hair who smirked at Evelyn with open contempt. "They expect me to fight this fragile doll? She'll crumble with one hit."

The hourglass flipped. Lillian charged forward, aiming to end the match instantly.

But Evelyn pivoted with surprising agility. Her hand shot out like lightning, seizing Lillian's wrist and yanking her off-balance. A well-placed kick sent the larger woman sprawling.

Gasps erupted from the spectators. "She can actually fight!"

Lillian scrambled up, teeth bared. She lunged again, locking her legs around Evelyn's waist to drag them both down. But just as she tried to pin her opponent, Evelyn twisted free with serpentine grace.

Nathan's grip tightened on his papers. His initial concern gave way to dawning realization. "Clever girl," he murmured. "She's not fighting strength with strength - she's wearing her down."

Rosalind bit her lip until it bled. This wasn't supposed to happen. That delicate Vanderbilt heiress shouldn't be holding her own against a trained fighter.

The sands kept flowing.

Frustration made Lillian reckless. She grabbed Evelyn by the waist and hurled her toward the boundary line. Evelyn hit the mat mere inches from disqualification.

Nathan's papers crumpled in his fist.

"Sis Evelyn!" Rachel's scream snapped Evelyn back to awareness. She rolled aside just as Lillian dove for her. But the larger woman caught her arm in an iron grip.

A sickening pop echoed through the arena as Lillian wrenched Evelyn's shoulder from its socket.

White-hot pain turned Evelyn's face ghostly pale. Lillian sneered, preparing to break the arm completely - until Evelyn's ring flashed upward. The sharp edge grazed Lillian's chin.

In that split second of distraction, Evelyn twisted her body and drove them both over the boundary line.

The referee's whistle pierced the air. The crowd erupted.

Winifred's face twisted in disbelief. "They both went out! The match doesn't count!"

Nathan rose slowly, his voice cutting through the noise. "The rules state elimination occurs when one fighter exits the ring. There's no provision for simultaneous exits."

Harrison nodded. "In such cases, the first to touch the line loses."

And everyone had seen - Lillian hit the ground first.

The defeated fighter scrambled up, clutching her bleeding chin. "This is bullshit! She cheated with that ring!"

Evelyn cradled her dislocated arm, sweat beading on her forehead. The pain was excruciating, but she met Nathan's gaze steadily.

The real battle had only just begun.
###Chapter 280

The crowd erupted in shock as Lillian's accusation sliced through the air.

"She had a hidden weapon! That's cheating!"

"No wonder she managed to defeat Sis Viv. This isn't fair!"

Winifred's voice rose above the murmurs, sharp with indignation. "Evelyn injured someone and broke the rules! This loss shouldn't count—it's a disgrace!"

Her words ignited the spectators. Even those who hadn't witnessed the fight now buzzed with outrage, convinced of Evelyn's dishonesty.

Nathan's expression darkened, his icy glare sending a chill through the instructor beside him. Just as the man opened his mouth to speak, Evelyn clenched her jaw and cut in.

"Show me the rule that says I can't defend myself."

The instructor hesitated. "Well, the assessment guidelines don't explicitly—"

"If the rules don't forbid it, then why is it my fault when I fight back?" Evelyn's face was pale, her arm still numb from the earlier dislocation.

Lillian scoffed. "You scratched me with your ring!"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "So I should just stand there while you dislocate my arm? This is a combat assessment—injuries happen. If I can handle this pain, why are you whining over a scratch?"

Nathan's gaze was glacial, his presence radiating danger. Rosalind, sensing his fury, wisely kept silent.

Winifred wasn't done. "But sir, she clearly—"

Chloe cut her off with a sharp laugh. "A loss is a loss. Both of you got hurt—that makes it even. Since when is a ring considered a weapon? With that kind of attitude, you'll never make it to the top."

Winifred's face flushed, her retort dying in her throat. She could only seethe in silence.

Lillian had no rebuttal. She had struck first, and her defeat was her own fault. As she stepped off the stage, she shot Winifred a venomous glare.

If Winifred hadn't assured me Evelyn was weak, I wouldn't have been humiliated like this.

Winifred tried to pull her aside, but Lillian shoved her away.

Evelyn watched the exchange, understanding dawning. So that's why they paired me with Lillian.

"Sis Evelyn, how's your arm?" Rachel rushed to support her as she descended the stage.

Evelyn winced but forced a smile. "I'm fine."

She could feel Nathan's burning gaze from above but refused to look his way. Instead, she let Rachel guide her to the infirmary.

The doctor reset her shoulder while Evelyn bit back a scream. Rachel winced in sympathy.

Lillian didn't hold back at all.

Once the joint was back in place, the doctor left with a few stern warnings. Rachel finally exhaled.

"Sis Evelyn, that match was rigged. Pairing you with Lillian? That's insane."

Even veterans avoid fighting her.

Evelyn lowered her eyes. "It doesn't matter. It's over now."

No matter who they throw at me, I can't afford to lose.

Just then, Chloe appeared at the door, smirking.

"Zoe, by the way… Mr. Goldmann wants to see you."
###Chapter 281

Rachel's fingers trembled slightly as she grasped Evelyn's arm. "Zoe, why does Mr. Goldmann want to see you? Does he suspect you of cheating too?" Chloe gave an awkward chuckle, patting Rachel's shoulder reassuringly. "Don't be ridiculous. Of course not."

The walk to Harrison's office felt longer than usual. Chloe pushed open the heavy oak door to reveal Nathan lounging on the leather couch, his tailored suit stretching across broad shoulders. Harrison and Rosalind stood stiffly nearby, their expressions unreadable.

"Leave us." Nathan's command cut through the tension like a knife.

Rosalind's eyes flashed with something dark as she brushed past Evelyn, the door clicking shut behind her with finality.

"Why are you standing all the way over there?" Nathan's voice dropped an octave as he patted the empty space beside him. The glint in his hazel eyes promised trouble.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "This is a military training facility, Nathan. Someone might see—"

"Come here." The dangerous edge in his tone made her pulse jump. "Unless you'd prefer I carry you?"

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn took three measured steps forward—only to gasp as Nathan's arm shot out, yanking her onto his lap. His familiar cedar scent enveloped her as he nuzzled the sensitive spot below her ear.

"Still mad at me?" His breath ghosted over her collarbone. "About the jade ring... I asked Rosalind because I didn't know what you'd like."

Evelyn stiffened. "You consulted her about my gift?"

A rare flush crept up Nathan's neck. "I thought women had similar tastes." The admission sounded almost painful. "I've never... shopped for a woman before."

The confession melted some of Evelyn's irritation. This powerful CEO who commanded boardrooms was utterly clueless about jewelry. The realization sparked unexpected warmth in her chest.

Nathan's lips curved against her throat. "Were you jealous, Zoe?"

"Don't flatter yourself." Evelyn turned her face away, but the heat in her cheeks betrayed her. "She's the one parading around with stolen gifts."

The rich rumble of Nathan's laughter vibrated through her. "True. She never stood a chance." His hands slid beneath her uniform jacket. "You've lost weight."

Evelyn swatted at him. "You incorrigible—"

He caught her wrist effortlessly, his thumb tracing circles on her pulse point. The wicked promise in his gaze turned her bones to liquid. "Behave."

In that moment, with his perfectly combed hair and rumpled tie, Nathan Goldmann embodied every bit the wolf in Armani.
###Chapter 282

Evelyn quickly removed her stockings.

Nathan's gaze darkened abruptly. His tongue pressed against his back teeth as if contemplating something.

Noticing the dangerous shift in atmosphere, Evelyn tried to wriggle free from his grasp.

Before she could escape, he flipped her onto the couch, pinning her beneath him.

Later, Evelyn rushed back to the dormitory wrapped tightly in her coat, only to collide with Rosalind and Winifred in the hallway.

Rosalind's sharp eyes took in Evelyn's flushed cheeks, disheveled hair, and the way she clutched her coat around herself. The implications were obvious.

The hatred flashing in Rosalind's eyes vanished instantly. 'Not yet,' she reminded herself. 'The timing isn't right.'

Winifred, who'd always despised Evelyn, smirked maliciously. "Well, well. Someone's been rolling in the sheets with some dirty man, haven't they?"

Evelyn's expression darkened momentarily. She gave Rosalind a sidelong glance but ignored Winifred completely.

Infuriated by the dismissal, Winifred grabbed Evelyn's coat in front of Rosalind.

When the coat slipped open, the love bites on Evelyn's neck were clearly visible. Rosalind's hands clenched into fists at her sides. She never imagined the usually cold and aloof Nathan could be so... passionate.

Winifred's face twisted with contempt. "Disgusting! You actually slept with some random man during training? What kind of slut are you?"

Evelyn smirked. "Winifred, is 'slut' the only word in your vocabulary? Who exactly are you calling a slut?"

"You know damn well who I'm talking about!" Winifred snapped.

Evelyn's smile widened. "Ah, so you're calling me a slut. Got it." Realizing she'd been tricked into repeating herself, Winifred's face darkened with rage. "How dare you mock me!"

Some people never learn. Winifred had already forgotten Evelyn's previous warnings as she raised her hand to strike.

Evelyn caught her wrist effortlessly. "Do you think having one injured arm makes me incapable of hitting back?"

Before Winifred could react, Evelyn's left hand connected sharply with her cheek. The resounding slap left Winifred stunned, her face whipped to the side.

Rosalind privately thought Winifred deserved it for running her mouth, but Evelyn's audacity to strike right in front of her was unacceptable.

She stepped forward protectively. "Miss Vanderbilt, while Winifred's words were harsh, was physical violence necessary?"

"'Winifred'?" Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously. "So you two know each other?"

The pieces clicked into place. 'Then Nathan knowing about my accidental trespassing and the incident with Felix... was this their doing?'

Rosalind recovered quickly, smiling. "I know most people in this training camp. Is that so strange?"

"Who you know is none of my concern, Miss Summers," Evelyn said coldly. "But I'd advise against meddling too much. This isn't my first time teaching Winifred manners. People with filthy mouths deserve to be slapped."

Evelyn flexed her wrist, glaring at Winifred with icy disdain.

Seeing Rosalind hesitate, Winifred pulled her aside. "Rosalind, don't be intimidated! She's just some strong woman - nowhere near your status! You have Mr. Goldmann's backing!"
###Chapter 283

Rosalind's expression shifted subtly.

This woman's tongue is downright poisonous. Normally, I'd revel in such praise in front of others, but saying this in front of Evelyn only serves to humiliate me further.

Winifred remained oblivious to Rosalind's reaction and continued to glare at Evelyn. "Let me make one thing clear—Mr. Goldmann is currently at the training camp. No matter how tough you think you are, if you dare lay a finger on me now, I—"

A sharp slap cut her off mid-sentence.

How dare she!

A smirk curled on Evelyn's lips. "Was that a threat? Are you expecting Ms. Summers to fetch Mr. Goldmann to back you up?" She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Let me enlighten you. Even if Nathan Goldmann were standing right here, I'd still slap you. Care to test that theory?"

"You—You—!" Winifred choked on her words, as if an invisible hand had clamped around her throat.

Why is Evelyn so fearless? Who’s backing her?

"You wouldn’t get hit if you knew when to keep your mouth shut," Evelyn mused, amused.

Then she turned to Rosalind. "Don’t you agree, Ms. Summers?"

The icy fury in Rosalind’s gaze remained carefully veiled behind a composed smile. "Ms. Vanderbilt, you’re certainly clever. But remember, we’re in a training camp. Rules still apply."

Evelyn understood the unspoken warning—behave yourself here. She scoffed. "Rules are meant to be followed, but only if others don’t overstep first. I don’t start fights, but I always finish them."

With that, she cast one last glance at both women and strode away.

Rosalind watched her retreating figure, her eyes darkening with something far colder than anger.

Back in her room, Evelyn froze at the sight before her.

An extravagant bouquet of midnight-blue enchantress roses and an array of high-end supplements lay neatly arranged on her bed.

Rachel materialized beside her, grinning. "Surprised?"

Evelyn frowned.

This isn’t Nathan’s style. Flowers and vitamins?

"Who sent these?" she asked flatly.

Rachel blinked. "Who else? Mr. Boucher, of course. He heard about your injury and insisted on sending these."

Evelyn exhaled, exasperated. "Return them. I can’t accept gifts this lavish."

I’ve done nothing to warrant Felix’s attention, and I don’t intend to.

Rachel hesitated. "But he personally picked everything. You… don’t like them?"

Evelyn hardened her tone. "No, I don’t. Send them back."

"...Alright." Rachel sighed, gathering the items reluctantly.

That afternoon, at the Goldmann estate…

Theodore Goldmann sat across from his son in the garden pavilion, a chessboard between them. Rosalind and Harrison entered, the latter delivering Evelyn’s assessment results.

Theodore arched a brow. "She’s skilled, it seems."

Mr. Goldmann Sr. smirked. "Like father, like son. Our judgment is never wrong."

He couldn’t be prouder of Evelyn as his daughter-in-law. Beyond bearing three heirs, her talent and resilience made her the ideal match.

Even if Theodore disapproved, neither he nor Nathan would waver.

Rosalind’s lips thinned. "Grandfather, while Ms. Vanderbilt won, she used a ring as a weapon in a hand-to-hand match. That’s hardly fair."
###Chapter 284

Harrison's eyebrows lifted slightly as he turned to face Rosalind.

"Why bring this up now?" Evelyn exchanged a quick glance with Harrison, careful not to reveal anything unusual. "I understand Ms. Vanderbilt might be physically weaker in hand-to-hand combat, but isn't this assessment about strategic advantage?"

Harrison nodded thoughtfully, finding some merit in her words.

Theodore stroked his beard in silent agreement.

Mr. Goldmann Sr. frowned. "How could a simple ring be considered a weapon?" Rosalind explained cautiously, "The ring Ms. Vanderbilt wore wasn't ordinary jewelry. It's clearly a self-defense mechanism with concealed sharp edges capable of inflicting wounds." Mr. Goldmann Sr.'s expression darkened as he considered this information.

Harrison looked genuinely surprised. "So that innocent-looking accessory is actually a concealed weapon?"

'No wonder Lillian claimed Evelyn injured her with a ring. Does this mean she actually cheated?'

Rosalind offered a pained smile. "Exactly. But Nathan was present that day, and it wouldn't have been appropriate for me to expose her in front of him."

"What? That boy went to the training camp?" Theodore's amusement vanished instantly. 'Is he actually taking my warnings seriously?'

Rosalind quickly attempted to diffuse the situation. "Grandfather, please don't be upset. Nathan was simply concerned for her safety. And to be fair, Ms. Vanderbilt does possess considerable skill. She can clearly handle herself, which means Nathan won't need to worry about her in the future."

She continued with a practiced smile. "While Ms. Vanderbilt may have bent the rules to secure her victory, her actions were understandable. However, to address the trainees' concerns about the match's fairness, I propose deducting 10 points from her total score of 30." Though her words appeared supportive, her true intention was to deepen Theodore's disappointment in Evelyn.

'She passed through dishonorable means. Others might be fooled, but I see right through her!'

Theodore lifted his teacup thoughtfully. Before he could speak, a commanding presence entered the pavilion.

Nathan's stormy expression made it clear he'd overheard the conversation. "Outmaneuvering an opponent is a legitimate strategy. Why should points be deducted for tactical brilliance?" Rosalind's heart skipped a beat as she realized Nathan had likely been observing her recent maneuvers.

'Not only did he personally attend the assessment, but he anticipated I'd report to Grandfather with Harrison present?'

Biting her lip subtly, she chose her words carefully. "Nathan, the trainees are all complaining about Ms. Vanderbilt's unconventional victory method. They feel it was unfair to her opponent—"

A cold chuckle interrupted her. "Tell me," Nathan's gaze turned piercing, "since when is brute strength the only measure of victory?"

Rosalind fell silent under his scrutiny. Theodore set down his cup with deliberate calm. "Rosalind is merely upholding the training camp's standards. Are you suggesting we ignore rule violations?"

"Grandfather, with respect," Nathan countered smoothly, "can you point to any regulation prohibiting jewelry in the ring? The ring Zoe wore served as self-defense and was only employed when her opponent dislocated her wrist. Hardly a violation, wouldn't you agree?"

Theodore hesitated, caught off guard by the logic. Nathan pressed his advantage. "Victory isn't always about fair play. Sometimes it requires unconventional methods. Didn't our great-grandfather build his empire using every advantage available?"

'Does anyone truly believe our ancestor rose to power in Stoslo through honorable combat alone?'
###Chapter 285

"He became the legend he is today precisely because of the ruthless methods he was willing to employ."

Theodore Goldmann's voice was cold, his gaze sharp. "Adaptability is the key to survival. How can one defeat their opponent without the necessary means?"

He waved a dismissive hand. "Do as you please. All I care about are the results."

Nathan Goldmann strode out of the estate, his expression unreadable. Just as he reached his car, Rosalind Summers called out to him.

She hurried after him, her voice laced with hesitation. "Nathan, my words earlier weren’t meant as an attack. I was only considering the bigger picture—"

"Rosalind," Nathan cut her off without turning around. "Stay in your lane. If I discover you’ve been scheming behind my back, there will be consequences."

The car door slammed shut, leaving Rosalind frozen in place. His warning echoed in her mind, sending a chill down her spine.

‘I haven’t done anything against Evelyn… except for the jade ring. Does he already know?’

The next day…

The physical assessment results were posted on the notice board, drawing a crowd of trainees.

Evelyn and Rachel Dixon made their way over after breakfast. Rachel scanned the list quickly, her eyes widening in disbelief.

"Twenty-nine points? How is that possible?"

Evelyn remained calm. ‘This was expected. They deducted a point because of the ring. But there are other assessments. As long as I secure a total of 120 points, I’ll be fine.’

As she turned, her gaze locked with Lillian Heinrich’s. The hostility in Lillian’s eyes was unmistakable.

Lillian spun on her heel and walked away. Evelyn followed, catching up to her in the corridor.

"Lillian, can we talk?"

Lillian crossed her arms, her posture rigid. "What do you want?"

"I know the assessment wasn’t fair to you," Evelyn said evenly. "I didn’t mean to use the ring against you, but I had no choice. I needed to win."

She took a breath. "I won’t stand in your way. I’m only here for four more days. Once I get my results, I’m leaving. I’m not competing for a top position—I have my own career outside of this."

Lillian studied her for a long moment. "You’re not here for the management spot?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I’m not a fighter like you. I’m just fulfilling an agreement. I can’t afford to be eliminated before then."

Something in Lillian’s expression shifted. The resentment faded slightly, though her tone remained guarded. "You held your own against me. That’s not nothing."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Luck played a part."

Lillian’s lips thinned. "Winifred was the one who paired us. You’ve clearly made an enemy of her. Watch your back while you’re still here."

With that, she walked away.

Evelyn watched her go, a pang of regret flickering through her.

‘If circumstances were different, we might have been friends.’
###Chapter 286

As for Winifred...

It was finally time to deal with her after two failed attempts to sabotage me.

Winifred stepped out of her room only to find Evelyn leaning against the stair railing, arms crossed.

Her body went rigid. "W-What do you want?"

Without her usual entourage around, the girl's confidence seemed to evaporate.

Evelyn's lips curved as she advanced. Winifred instinctively retreated until Evelyn dragged her into the secluded woods behind the dorms. "Evelyn, if you lay a finger on me, I'll—"

"What exactly will you do?" Evelyn blocked her escape route. "Relax, I just want answers."

Winifred trembled visibly. The fear was palpable now. "What do you want to know?"

"Did you lure me to the restricted zone because of Felix?" Evelyn's voice turned icy.

Winifred's eyes darted nervously, yet she lifted her chin defiantly. "S-So what if I did? Felix kept chasing after you since your arrival! Even gave you those chocolates I gave him!"

Evelyn recalled the untouched gift. "I never ate them. You can have them back."

"No! He already gave them to you!" Winifred's face twisted with jealousy.

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "And did you arrange my assessment match against Lillian?"

Winifred's gaze dropped to the ground, her silence speaking volumes.

"Lillian confirmed it was you. No point denying." Evelyn's sweet smile sent chills down Winifred's spine.

"I... I just wanted you to fail!"

"Do you realize how dangerous those stunts could've been for someone else?" Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. "Winifred, no one's stealing Felix from you. Stop dragging innocents into your petty games. Do you really think this behavior will make him like you more?"

Winifred bit her lip hard enough to draw blood.

Evelyn produced her phone. "Four days left in training. Cause any more trouble, and this recording goes public."

"You recorded me?!" Winifred lunged for the device, but Evelyn pocketed it effortlessly.

"I got what I needed - your confession. Enjoy your remaining days here. Cross me again, and you'll regret it."

As Evelyn turned to leave, she spotted Felix watching them from a distance.

Spotting her supposed savior, Winifred dashed behind him. "Felix! She threatened me! You saw everything! This is her true nature - not the delicate flower she pretends to be!"

Too stunned to push away the girl he usually avoided, Felix could only stare at Evelyn in shock.

He'd followed them, fearing Winifred might harm Evelyn, but overheard their entire exchange.

The fragile goddess he'd imagined stood transformed - cool, calculated, and utterly self-assured. Gone was the damsel needing protection. Before him stood a woman who commanded respect.
###Chapter 287

Evelyn wasn't concerned about Felix seeing her true nature. With a confident smile, she strode toward him, her gaze flickering to Winifred cowering behind his back. "This is who I really am," she stated coolly. "I don't show mercy to those who scheme against me."

"Felix, listen—" Winifred clutched his arm with a wounded expression. When Felix finally snapped out of his daze, he shook her off abruptly, his eyes locked on Evelyn. "Little goddess, you... did this because you felt threatened by Winifred, didn't you?"

Evelyn's icy stare remained unflinching. "Do I look threatened to you?" Her voice dripped with disdain. "Winifred targeted me because of you. I've taken what I needed from her. One more misstep, and I'll release the recording."

Felix studied Evelyn as if seeing her for the first time. Perhaps he never truly knew her at all. From that moment onward, he avoided her completely, even when their paths crossed in the dining hall.

Rachel kept hoping for a chance encounter with Felix, but he never approached them again. Curiosity gnawed at her. "Evelyn, what happened with Mr. Boucher? He used to follow you around like a lost puppy."

"Isn't this better?" Evelyn shrugged, loading her tray with food near the window. "There was never anything between us."

Rachel stood motionless, lost in thought.

Suddenly, Harrison appeared in the bustling cafeteria. His sharp eyes scanned the room before landing on Evelyn. Under the watchful gazes of everyone present, he approached her. "Ms. Evelyn Vanderbilt."

Evelyn paused mid-motion, her tray in hand. "Yes?"

Harrison cleared his throat, lowering his voice. "Mr. Goldmann requests your presence in the private dining room upstairs."

As Evelyn prepared to leave with Harrison, Rachel grabbed her arm. "Evelyn, where are you going?"

Evelyn patted her shoulder reassuringly. "I'll catch up with you later."

Watching Evelyn depart with Harrison, Rachel's shoulders slumped. The rumors about Mr. Goldmann seeking out Evelyn had reached her ears.

She remembered when Chloe had been searching for Evelyn—that too had involved Mr. Goldmann. What was their connection?

"Hah," a mocking voice interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn didn't even invite you along. You consider her your friend, but who knows what she really thinks of you?" Rachel clenched her jaw. "Shut up. I don't believe your lies."

As she turned to leave, Winifred's voice slithered after her. "You don't really know who she is, do you?"

Rachel froze.

Winifred sauntered over, placing a hand on Rachel's shoulder with false sympathy. "Rachel, we never meant to make things difficult for you. We just don't want you getting too close to Evelyn."

"You call her your friend, but do you even know her secrets?" Winifred whispered conspiratorially. "Do you know why Felix is ignoring her now?"

"Why?" Rachel couldn't help asking.

"Because he discovered the truth. She has children—did she ever mention that to you?"

"Why would a mother join this training camp? To seduce powerful men, of course. And why do you think she's being summoned to that private room right now?"
###Chapter 288

Winifred presented all the 'evidence' she had gathered against Evelyn with dramatic flair, because that was simply her nature.

Felix saw right through her charade.

Winifred's poisonous words began influencing Rachel. Though part of her resisted believing Winifred's claims, she couldn't deny how little she truly knew about Evelyn - not even basic facts like her having children.

And Mr. Goldmann...

Could Evelyn really be the person Winifred described? Was Felix keeping his distance because he knew something about Evelyn's past?

"Think about it, Rachel," Winifred pressed, her voice dripping with false concern. "If she truly considered you a friend, why would she hide so much from you? Why keep defending someone who doesn't trust you?"

The words struck a chord with Rachel's already wavering resolve.

She had genuinely considered Evelyn a friend, yet the woman had shared virtually nothing about her personal life. What kind of friendship was built on such secrecy?

Meanwhile, in the private dining area, Evelyn stared at the lavish spread covering the entire table, with the personal chef standing attentively behind Nathan. If not for the military tents visible through the windows, she might have thought herself in a five-star restaurant. The contrast with her standard-issue meal box was almost comical.

Nathan rested his chin on one hand, watching her with amusement. "I had these specially prepared for you. You've lost too much weight - time to replenish those nutrients." As he spoke, a bodyguard discreetly removed her meager meal box while another pulled out a chair for her.

Evelyn sat slowly, eyeing the feast. "Nathan, this is enough food for an entire platoon."

His expression turned playfully wounded. "It breaks my heart seeing you so thin."

Truthfully, the camp's terrible food had whittled away his beautiful wife's curves. What if she became too weak to defend herself against all these vipers?

Evelyn could only sigh at his dramatics.

Nathan had perfected the art of looking innocent. Once the chef and bodyguards withdrew, he laced his fingers together, resting his chin on them as he watched her eat with visible delight.

"Why are you staring?" Evelyn asked, suddenly self-conscious. She dabbed at her mouth, checking for stray crumbs.

His lips curved. "Tomorrow's the shooting assessment. Nervous?"

The evaluation consisted of two parts: slow fire and rapid fire. The slow fire segment required sixty precise shots at fifty yards - the farthest standard distance with the smallest bullseye diameter. Total points determined the final score.

It was the most demanding test of accuracy in marksmanship, and arguably the most crucial evaluation.

For someone who'd never handled firearms before, passing both assessments seemed nearly impossible - especially with the added pressure of rapid fire.

Evelyn pursed her lips, avoiding his gaze. "Nothing to worry about. Maybe I'll get lucky."

Nathan chuckled. "Zoe, you wouldn't be here if you weren't confident." When she hesitated, he added, "You hate losing, don't you?"

Then his tone shifted. "Who gave you that self-defense ring? The same person who trained you?"

His piercing gaze demanded answers.

Her mother had been a de Arma. Miranda had connections to Morwich's elite circles. The pieces fit together too neatly.

Moreover, Edmund Lincoln clearly held Evelyn in high regard. It wasn't difficult to deduce he'd been the one to teach her those impressive combat skills.
###Chapter 289

The sun cast long shadows across the training grounds as Evelyn adjusted her uniform. Since Edmund had taught her self-defense, she wondered if Nathan suspected he'd taught her other skills too? Her heart pounded beneath her calm exterior as she met his piercing gaze.

"Uncle Edmund saw how challenging it was for me to manage the children alone," she explained with practiced ease, smoothing her hair. "He simply taught me basic self-defense. Surely that's not unreasonable?"

Nathan's lips curved slightly. "Of course not."

Even if his beautiful wife chose to keep secrets, he'd uncover them eventually.

As Evelyn left the private dining room, Winifred lurked nearby, desperate to identify her mysterious companion. The color drained from her face when she saw Harrison Lawson escorting Nathan out.

So that was why she'd rejected Felix! She'd set her sights on someone far more powerful!

Rachel scrolled through her phone when the door creaked open. She shoved the device under her pillow as Evelyn entered.

"You're back," Rachel forced a smile, avoiding eye contact.

"I'm sorry for leaving you downstairs." Evelyn frowned, removing her jacket. She'd wanted to dine with Rachel, but revealing her connection to Nathan wasn't an option yet.

Rachel waved dismissively. "It's fine." She hesitated. "Evelyn...do you know Mr. Goldmann?"

Evelyn froze mid-motion. "Why do you ask?"

"Oh, just..." Rachel's laugh sounded brittle. "I heard Chief Lawson wanted to see you, and that day with Chloe—"

"Rachel," Evelyn interrupted gently, "there are things I can't explain yet. Please trust me on this."

She'd noticed Rachel's growing distance. It wasn't that she wanted to deceive her friend—she simply needed to prove herself on her own merits first.

Rachel nodded stiffly. "Get some rest. Big assessment tomorrow." As she turned away, Evelyn studied her roommate's tense shoulders before climbing into bed.

Dawn brought an empty bunk. Evelyn hurried through her morning routine, grabbing a quick breakfast from the commissary. Whispers followed her like shadows as she walked.

At the training field, a cluster of cadets fell silent as she approached, their smirks speaking volumes.

"Only lost one point for cheating? Must be nice sleeping with Mr. Goldmann."

"Pathetic. Wasn't she some rich man's mistress before getting dumped here?"

"Felix must've been blind to like trash like that."

The words stung differently coming from strangers. Evelyn almost laughed—she'd known rumors would spread once her connection to Nathan surfaced. But who had leaked it?

Rachel's probing questions from last night resurfaced. Evelyn's hands clenched. The pieces were falling into place.
###Chapter 290

Evelyn spotted Rachel standing with Winifred amidst the bustling crowd.

Winifred's lips curled into a smirk when she noticed Evelyn alone in the sea of people. "I thought you had some clever tricks. Turns out it was just Mr. Goldmann pulling strings for you all along."

Rachel couldn't bring herself to meet Evelyn's gaze. Though she hadn't spread the rumors, Evelyn had still chosen to keep secrets even when directly questioned.

If Evelyn didn't consider her a friend, why should she care anymore?

Noticing Evelyn's attention on Rachel, Winifred draped an arm possessively around her shoulders. "How does it feel when even your own roommate doubts you? A woman who chases after men while already having children has no place here!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd at Winifred's revelation.

"She has kids?"
"But she looks so young! Out of wedlock?"
"Probably doesn't even know who the fathers are!"

The venomous whispers swirled around Evelyn, but her expression remained unreadable. After years as gossip fodder, such petty comments barely registered.

Winifred grew agitated when Evelyn failed to react. "Why are you staring at me? Everyone's talking about you! How can you just stand there?" As all eyes turned to Evelyn, she simply crossed her arms with chilling composure. "You started these rumors."

"So what if I did?" Winifred sneered, confidence oozing. "Can you honestly deny your involvement with Mr. Goldmann? Weren't you alone with him in that private room? Rachel told me how he summoned you to meet Chloe during your assessment. That explains those marks on your neck!"

The crowd's opinion visibly shifted, their expressions turning disdainful at Winifred's convincing details.

Winifred pressed her advantage. "Mr. Goldmann belongs to Rosalind. Who do you think you are, trying to steal him? That's why Rosalind said you were transferred here for seducing taken men."

A cold laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "So Rosalind fed you these lies?"

Winifred faltered momentarily under Evelyn's piercing gaze but quickly recovered. "Everyone knows about Mr. Goldmann and Rosalind! Of course a shameless woman with illegitimate children wouldn't care about stealing someone else's man."

Evelyn suddenly burst into laughter, the sound sharp and unexpected.

Winifred's face darkened. "What's so funny?"

"Let's make a wager, Winifred." Evelyn tilted her chin up, arms still crossed. "If you can get Rosalind to admit her relationship with Mr. Goldmann to my face, I'll kneel before you. But if she denies it..." Her voice dropped dangerously. "You'll pay the price."

"W-why should I play your game?" Winifred stammered.

"Chickening out?" Evelyn took a deliberate step forward. "You started this, Winifred. I'm giving you one chance to prove your accusations. We've got an hour before my assessment - perfect timing for some public entertainment, don't you think?" Her gaze swept across the gathered crowd. "Aren't you all curious to see the truth?"
###Chapter 291

The crowd buzzed with excitement, their whispers urging Winifred to accept the wager. Winifred's face drained of color as she studied Evelyn's unwavering confidence.

Why wasn't this bitch afraid?

What if she lost everything?

"Winifred," Evelyn taunted, her lips curling into a predatory smile, "I thought you believed in Rosalind? Or are you too cowardly to prove it?"

"Who said I'm scared?" Winifred snapped, her nails digging into her palms. "You'll be kneeling before me soon enough, Evelyn!"

She had to trust Rosalind. There was no way her ally would betray her now.

With trembling fingers, Winifred dialed Rosalind's number, putting the call on speakerphone. The moment Rosalind answered, Winifred blurted out, "Rosalind, tell everyone you're Mr. Goldmann's woman! Now!"

A heavy silence followed. Then Rosalind's icy voice crackled through the speaker: "What nonsense are you spouting, Winifred?"

Before Winifred could respond, Evelyn snatched the phone. "Rosalind darling," she purred, "care to clarify your relationship with Nathan Goldmann?"

The line went dead silent. Rosalind's breath hitched audibly before she hissed, "Winifred, you imbecile!"

"Say something!" Winifred shrieked, desperation clawing at her throat.

Rosalind's reply came like a guillotine's drop: "I never claimed to be involved with Mr. Goldmann. Stop spreading lies." The call ended with a final click.

Back in her apartment, Rosalind hurled her phone against the wall. "That stupid, useless girl!"

Winifred stood frozen as the crowd's murmurs turned to laughter. The truth was undeniable now - she'd been exposed as a liar.

Evelyn gripped Winifred's chin, forcing their eyes to meet. "Congratulations," she whispered, her voice dripping with venom. "You've just lost your only ally. And changed my opinion about Rosalind's intelligence."

The recording in Evelyn's pocket felt heavier than ever. Winifred had played right into her hands.

"I-I'm sorry!" Winifred stammered, her bravado crumbling. "Please, I'll never spread rumors again!"

Evelyn's laugh was colder than winter wind. "Too late for apologies, darling."

The crowd gasped as realization dawned. Winifred had orchestrated everything - the restricted area incident, even pairing Evelyn with Lillian in the assessment.

All her schemes unraveled in one spectacular downfall.
###Chapter 292

What an unexpected twist!

Everyone had assumed Winifred was the victim, but the truth painted a very different picture.

Several girls had pitied her when she tearfully claimed a stranger had bullied and assaulted her. Now, they realized she had orchestrated her own downfall.

If she was bold enough to pull such a stunt, fabricating the entire story about an attacker wasn’t beyond her.

Winifred’s face drained of color as she staggered backward. The sympathetic glances had vanished, replaced by accusing fingers and hushed whispers.

"Evelyn!" she shrieked, her voice trembling with hysteria. "How could you do this to me?"

Evelyn’s expression remained icy. "How could I? The question is—how could you? I gave you chance after chance, and this is how you repay me?"

Her voice sharpened. "Didn’t I warn you? Every action has consequences. If you had the audacity to lie, you should have the courage to face the fallout."

She stepped closer, her gaze unyielding. "And who gave you the right to slander me in front of everyone?"

If she let this slide again, the false rumors would never end.

Winifred hadn’t anticipated this. She never imagined Evelyn would expose her publicly.

No one defended her. No one offered sympathy.

Overwhelmed, she crumpled to the ground, sobbing.

Evelyn didn’t spare her another glance. As she walked past Rachel, she paused.

"I thought we could be friends," she said softly. "I told you I couldn’t explain everything, but you chose to believe them anyway."

Without waiting for a response, she walked away.

Rachel’s hands trembled, her eyes reddening.

Felix stood nearby, having witnessed everything. He hadn’t stepped in when Evelyn was under fire—now, he couldn’t bring himself to face her.

His fists clenched, then loosened. Silently, he turned and disappeared into the crowd.

At Goldmann Group

Nathan emerged from the conference room, slipping on his jacket. He glanced at Oliver. "Get the car. We’re heading to the training camp."

Oliver hesitated. "You’re still going?"

Nathan arched a brow. "Problem?"

Oliver shook his head quickly. "None at all. I’ll get the car."

Lately, Nathan had been visiting the camp whenever he had a free moment—as if afraid his wife would vanish.

Just as Oliver reached the elevator, Theodore stepped out.

"Where are you off to?" he demanded.

Oliver glanced at Nathan, uncertain how to respond.

Nathan approached leisurely. "What brings you here?"

Theodore huffed. "I heard you’ve been sneaking off to that camp. Not today. You’re staying put."

With that, he strode toward his office.

When Nathan didn’t move, Theodore turned back. "Listen, boy. It’s just an assessment. Stay out of it. Do you want everyone thinking Evelyn’s success is because of you?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Theodore was right. His constant presence would only cast doubt on Evelyn’s achievements.

Grim-faced, Nathan turned and stalked back to his office.

Training Camp

The shooting test was underway.

Candidates stood in groups of five—men and women separated—preparing for the 100-yard challenge.

Earplugs in place, they waited for the signal.
###Chapter 293

Evelyn meticulously inspected her rifle and ammunition before stepping onto the training field. Satisfied with her equipment, she took her position with steady determination.

"Fate has a twisted sense of humor," came a familiar voice beside her. Lillian Heinrich stood there, her smirk barely concealed. The instructors had randomized the groupings, throwing them together once more. Evelyn let out a dry chuckle. "The universe clearly wants to make this difficult for me."

Lillian's eyes narrowed. "Don't expect me to go easy on you this time."

The sharp report of gunfire shattered the morning air. Bullets found their marks with rhythmic precision as the instructors recorded each participant's performance. Lillian moved with practiced ease, her two years of training evident in every motion.

But the real surprise came from Evelyn. For someone with no prior firearms experience, her form was flawless. Her grip was steady, her focus unshakable. The instructors exchanged glances as she matched Lillian shot for shot.

When the results were announced, only three remained from their group of five. "Rosalie Axelson, 35 hits - pass." The instructor continued, "Lillian Heinrich, 46 hits - outstanding performance."

A murmur ran through the crowd as he turned to Evelyn. "Evelyn Vanderbilt..." He paused dramatically before announcing, "46 hits - outstanding."

Gasps erupted. "She matched Lillian?" "No way that's possible!" Chloe Lawson punched her brother Harrison's arm excitedly. "You barely passed your first assessment, and Evelyn aced it!"

Harrison scowled. "I was ten years old then," he muttered defensively.

The next challenge proved more demanding - ten rapid-fire rounds at 100 yards, requiring three hits per target in under two minutes. Evelyn lay prone, her rifle steady. After six successful targets, she felt an unnatural movement against her leg.

Her blood ran cold. A pit viper slithered across her boot, making its way toward Lillian. "Don't move!" Evelyn hissed, grabbing Lillian's shoulder.

Lillian turned, her eyes locking onto the venomous creature. Despite her tough exterior, primal fear took over. She jerked back instinctively. The sudden movement startled the snake, which reared to strike.

In one fluid motion, Evelyn drew her knife and plunged it into the serpent's body. She shoved Lillian aside just as the wounded creature broke free, sinking its fangs into the back of Evelyn's hand.

The instructors rushed forward, kicking the snake away. Screams erupted from nearby trainees as they saw the dead viper. Blood dripped from Evelyn's wound as she remained remarkably calm, assessing the damage with clinical detachment.
###Chapter 294

"Snake! A venomous snake!"

Felix burst through the crowd, sprinting toward Evelyn. Harrison immediately blocked his path with a sharp command. "All trainees evacuate immediately! Assessment suspended!"

"Sir, how is she?" Felix demanded, panic lacing his voice.

"Pit viper bite. She needs emergency treatment now."

'A snake? In a military training camp?'

"Evelyn!" Chloe rushed forward as Harrison examined the swelling wound. "Her hand's already turning purple. We must extract the venom immediately." He met Evelyn's pain-glazed eyes. "This will hurt, Ms. Vanderbilt."

The blade flashed. Evelyn bit back a scream as Harrison widened the puncture wounds, methodically squeezing out dark venom. Sweat poured down her ashen face.

"Stretcher! Now!" Harrison barked. Chloe took off running toward the medical tent with the instructor.

Lillian sat frozen in the dirt, staring at the woman who'd shoved her away from the striking viper. Evelyn Vanderbilt had saved her life.

The medical tent doors slammed shut behind the stretcher. Though Harrison had removed most venom, the camp lacked proper antivenom. The doctor's hands shook slightly. "We don't have pit viper serum here. She needs a specialized hospital—"

Harrison grabbed his collar. "She'll be dead before we reach the city!"

Chloe and Felix stood paralyzed like lightning-struck trees. As Evelyn's eyelids fluttered shut, Felix clenched his fists. "My brother knows a venom specialist. I'm calling him now."

•••

Nathan had been losing chess matches to Theodore all afternoon, his mind elsewhere. An inexplicable dread coiled in his chest like a living thing.

Theodore huffed at his distracted grandson. "The assessment's surely over by now. We'll hear results soon—"

Nathan's phone shattered the moment. Chess pieces scattered as he snatched it up. Theodore scowled at the unprecedented breach of their game's sanctity.

The color drained from Nathan's face. "I'm leaving." The words came out razor-sharp.

"What's happened? Why—"

"You barred me from that camp." Nathan whirled on his grandfather, eyes blazing. "And now Zoe's dying. Happy?" He stormed out before Theodore could respond.

Tires screeched across Swallow County's winding roads as Nathan's sports car became a silver bullet. His Bluetooth crackled with a venomous order: "I want the snake-planter's head on a spike within the hour."

The speedometer needle trembled at 120mph. A 45-minute drive became 25 minutes of near-misses and horn blares. Nathan's knuckles stood white on the steering wheel, his mind replaying Evelyn's laughter from their last dinner—how her nose crinkled when she teased him about his terrible coffee.

The infirmary doors loomed ahead. Somewhere inside, the woman who'd rewired his heart was fighting for her life. And heaven help whoever had orchestrated this.
###Chapter 295

Nathan arrived at the infirmary to find Adrian Boucher and an elderly gentleman already inside.

He recognized the older man immediately and understood exactly why Adrian had brought him here. Only the Bouchers had the influence to summon Professor Lennox from his reclusive lifestyle.

Professor Lennox was a renowned serum specialist in the medical field, known for his eccentric and aloof personality. Wealth and fame held no sway over him—his presence here was solely due to the Bouchers' request.

Adrian turned his head slowly, his lips curving into a smirk as he met Nathan's gaze. "You owe me one."

Nathan's expression remained stern. "I know. I'll repay the favor when the time comes."

The camp doctor stood nearby, honored to assist the legendary Professor Lennox as he examined Evelyn. The professor drew a vial of blood and handed it to the doctor. "Test this immediately."

The doctor hesitated, curiosity flickering in his eyes, but he didn't dare question the order. He took the sample and hurried to the lab.

Adrian noticed the unusual excitement in Professor Lennox's demeanor. Intrigued, he asked, "Professor, why test her blood?"

"There's something unusual about it," the professor murmured, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "In all my years, I've never seen a case like this. A pit viper bite should have been fatal—yet not only has the venom failed to spread to her organs, but its effects are actively weakening."

Pit viper venom was notoriously deadly, containing a complex cocktail of toxins that attacked the body rapidly. But Evelyn showed minimal signs of poisoning, and the venom seemed unable to circulate in her bloodstream.

Both Nathan and Adrian exchanged surprised glances.

"I haven't even administered the serum I brought," Professor Lennox continued. "Given how unique her blood is, I wanted to analyze it first."

Her blood is special? Nathan pressed his lips together, his mind racing. What other secrets is she hiding?

The doctor soon returned with the test results. "Professor Lennox, here you are."

The professor adjusted his spectacles and scanned the report, his expression shifting to one of astonishment. Nathan frowned. "What did you find?"

"Fascinating," Professor Lennox murmured. "Her blood exceeds normal human parameters in every measurable aspect—yet it doesn't negatively affect her."

He sat down, staring at the results as if they held the answers to an unsolved mystery.

Nathan approached Evelyn's bedside. "If she's fine, why hasn't she woken up yet?"

"Do you think she's invincible?" Professor Lennox scoffed, still absorbed in the report. "Be grateful she's alive. It'll take time for her to regain consciousness."

Nathan brushed his fingers against Evelyn's forehead, relieved to find her temperature normal—no fever, no signs of distress.

"Mr. Goldmann." Harrison's voice came from outside the infirmary.

Nathan straightened and stepped out.

Harrison wasted no time. "Our investigation confirmed that someone planted the viper in the training camp. We've apprehended the culprit—he confessed that Winifred ordered it."

Nathan's expression darkened.

Harrison continued, "Other witnesses confirmed Winifred has been targeting Ms. Vanderbilt. She was the one who lured her into the restricted area and arranged the match against Lillian."

"It wasn't me!" Winifred's desperate voice echoed from the detention room as an instructor dragged her inside. "I didn't put that snake here!"

She reached out, gripping the instructor's sleeve in a frantic attempt to stop him from leaving.
###Chapter 296

Evelyn stepped through the iron gate, her gaze locking onto Winifred's panicked figure slumped against the wall.

"Your hired hand confessed everything," Evelyn stated coldly. "Still denying it?"

Winifred's hands trembled as she shook her head violently. "I swear, I've never seen that man before!"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Pray that Zoe survives this. You've tangled with forces far beyond your reach."

Winifred's blood ran cold. "Zoe... is Mrs. Goldmann?"

The realization hit like a freight train. All her past actions flashed before her eyes - each petty insult, every calculated slight. Had she been signing her own death warrant without knowing?

Chloe Lawson watched the color drain from Winifred's face with grim satisfaction. "Enjoy your stay. Mr. Goldmann will decide your fate personally."

"No! You have to believe me—" Winifred's desperate pleas echoed unanswered down the sterile hallway.

Across town, shadows danced across a dimly lit safehouse. Two figures sat across from each other at a scarred wooden table.

"The trail's clean?" The woman's voice held an edge of steel.

"Like it never happened." The man tapped his temple with a greasy smile. "My boys know how to scrub evidence."

A silver briefcase slid across the table. "Half a million. Disappear from Bassburgh for at least six months."

The man's tongue darted out to wet his lips as he grabbed the case. "Pleasure doing business."

When the door clicked shut behind him, the woman removed her mask, revealing chillingly beautiful features.

"Let's see divine intervention save her now," she murmured to the empty room.

Meanwhile, Nathan Goldmann hadn't left the hospital bedside in forty-eight hours. The rhythmic beeping of monitors had become his personal torture.

The door creaked open to reveal Mr. Goldmann Sr., his cane tapping against the linoleum. "No change?"

Nathan barely glanced up, his voice rough with exhaustion. "Professor Lennox says her vitals are stable, but..."

"Alfred's handling the children." The elder Goldmann placed a reassuring hand on his son's shoulder. "Focus on your wife."

Just then, Chloe burst in, her usual military crispness softened by relief. "Mr. Goldmann! She's waking up!"

Nathan was at the bedside in an instant, cradling Zoe's pale hand. Her eyelids fluttered like trapped butterflies before finally opening.

"Welcome back, sleeping beauty," Chloe teased, though her eyes shone suspiciously bright.

Zoe's cracked lips parted. "How... long?"

"Two days," Nathan answered, his thumb tracing circles on her palm. "You gave us quite the scare."

Memories flooded back - the assessment, the sudden pain, the viper's gleaming scales. Zoe's breath hitched. "The snake—"

"Shh." Nathan pressed a kiss to her knuckles. "We'll handle everything. Just rest."

Outside the room, Chloe's expression turned grim. "Winifred's still refusing to confess, despite... persuasive methods."

For two days they'd kept Winifred in isolation - no food, no water, no sleep. Yet the woman clung to her innocence like a lifeline.

Nathan's jaw tightened, but before he could respond, a weak tug on his sleeve drew his attention. Zoe's eyes, though clouded with pain, burned with quiet intensity.

"Not... her," she whispered.

The revelation hung heavy in the sterile hospital air. If Winifred wasn't the mastermind, then someone far more dangerous still walked free.
###Chapter 297

Evelyn tried to sit up, but Nathan quickly reached out to steady her, his expression tight with concern. "Zoe, how are you feeling?"

She studied his face—dark circles shadowed his eyes, and a faint stubble roughened his jaw. Exhaustion clung to him, yet it did nothing to diminish his striking features. "Much better," she murmured, pulling her gaze away. "No discomfort at all." Her tone was light, as if she'd merely woken from a nap.

Then, realization struck. "Wait—my assessment results—"

Nathan's brows knitted together, his voice dropping into a chastising murmur. "You're worried about grades after nearly dying?" His jaw tightened. "I should have those organizers punished for their negligence."

As he moved to stand, Evelyn's fingers curled into his sleeve. "Stay."

His gaze flickered down to her—stubborn, yet oddly endearing in her demand.

She's trying to be commanding, but it just comes off as adorable.

A smirk tugged at his lips. "No 'please'?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Please."

Nathan blinked, momentarily speechless.

Chloe cleared her throat, reluctantly interrupting. "Since you're awake, Evelyn, we should address the Winifred situation."

Evelyn's attention snapped to her. "What happened to Winifred?"

Chloe hesitated. "We caught the man who released the viper. He confessed Winifred ordered it. We detained her, but she refused to admit anything."

Winifred? Behind the attack?

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line, her mind racing.

Nathan's voice cut through the silence, cold and unyielding. "If she won't talk willingly, use other methods. Break her."

Chloe stiffened. Those methods were brutal—hardly fitting for a young woman, no matter her crimes.

Evelyn spoke suddenly. "I want to see her."

The interrogation room door swung open, flooding the space with light—and revealing Winifred sprawled on the floor, a crimson pool spreading beneath her, a knife clutched in her lifeless hand.

Evelyn froze.

Nathan's palm covered her eyes instantly. "Don't look." He turned to Chloe, voice sharp. "Call the police. Bring everyone who interrogated her this morning to me—now."

Police cars swarmed the training camp. Winifred's body was zipped into a bag and carried away, the onlookers' faces grim.

Among them, Felix Boucher watched, stunned. He'd never liked Winifred, but this—this was a waste.

Back in the hospital room, Evelyn sat stiffly on the bed, her expression unreadable. She'd had her grievances with Winifred, but she'd already exposed her with that recording. She never imagined it would end like this.

Chloe said they'd held her for two days without food or water, yet she still wouldn't confess.

Winifred was a coward at heart. If she'd truly orchestrated this, she would've cracked under pressure.

Something wasn't adding up.
###Chapter 298

Evelyn couldn't pinpoint a logical explanation, but her instincts screamed that Winifred had been set up. Whoever framed Winifred knew about their personal history...

Lost in thought, she didn't notice the figure appearing at the doorway. "Evelyn."

Startled, Evelyn blinked and recognized Rachel standing there.

Rachel entered hesitantly, nervously rubbing her hands together. "Evelyn...I'm relieved you're awake. About what happened before...I know apologies mean nothing now. I don't expect forgiveness. But I needed to say this..."

Her voice cracked. "I believed Winifred over you. That's how everything got twisted. I actually thought you never considered me a friend. This is entirely my fault." Rachel's eyes reddened. "You must have been devastated that day."

The memory burned - standing silent while Evelyn faced humiliation, when Evelyn had actually defended her against Winifred's gang.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Rachel, I can't blame you entirely. I came to camp with one goal - to pass the assessment in two weeks. I wasn't exactly open with anyone either."

She gave a wry smile. "Letting people in...that's never been easy for me." 'If I can't even make myself understood, how can I blame Rachel?'

Rachel wiped her eyes. "Just knowing you don't hate me...that's enough. I'll let you rest now." Watching Rachel's dejected retreat, Evelyn slumped back, overwhelmed by the whirlwind of recent events - and Winifred's shocking suicide.

When Nathan returned to find Evelyn motionless, his breath hitched. He rushed over, leaning down urgently - only for Evelyn to bolt upright, their foreheads colliding painfully.

"Nathan! Are you okay?" Evelyn gasped, rubbing her head while Nathan clutched his nose. 'Why did he have to hover so close!'

Nathan pinched his nose bridge, grateful it wasn't surgically enhanced. Removing his hand revealed a crimson streak. He dabbed his philtrum - definitely bleeding.

"Don't move!" Evelyn grabbed tissues, pulling him onto the bed's edge to tend his injury. Seeing the usually composed Nathan in such disarray sparked unexpected laughter.

Nathan scowled. "You're laughing at my suffering?" "Sorry!" Evelyn's shoulders shook with suppressed giggles. "I can't help it!"

Watching her genuine, unguarded reaction, Nathan suddenly gripped her wrist. In one fluid motion, he pulled her onto his lap, arms encircling her waist.

Evelyn froze as he leaned close, his whisper raising goosebumps: "Zoe...do you know what haunted me these past two days while you lay unconscious?"
###Chapter 299

"What were you thinking about?" Evelyn lowered her lashes, her fingers tracing invisible patterns on the bedsheet.

Nathan's gaze softened as warmth pooled in his dark eyes, his lips curving into that familiar smirk that always made her pulse quicken. "I was thinking," he murmured, leaning closer until his breath tickled her ear, "that the moment you're fully recovered, I'm dragging you to city hall in handcuffs if necessary. Grandfather's requirements be damned."

His voice dropped to that rough, possessive tone that sent shivers down her spine. He was done waiting. She would be his wife in every legal sense - her name permanently etched beside his on every document requiring a spouse's signature.

Evelyn's breath hitched. The intensity in his declaration caught her off guard, though she'd recognized his constant vigil at her bedside these past days. The way his calloused fingers had trembled when checking her temperature. The dark circles beneath his eyes that spoke of sleepless nights.

'Marrying Nathan...' The thought didn't terrify her as much as it should. But reality came crashing back, and she placed a gentle hand against his chest, creating space between them. When she remained silent, Nathan's smile faltered. "You're refusing me?" he asked, the vulnerability in his voice nearly undoing her resolve.

"It's not refusal," she countered, twisting the hospital blanket between her fingers. "But I made a promise to your grandfather. If I marry you without passing his assessment first, I'll forever be the scheming social climber in his eyes."

She met his gaze squarely now. "And let's not pretend your family isn't a political minefield. Becoming Mrs. Goldmann without understanding the battlefield? That's a recipe for disaster."

Nathan stilled, then surprised her by chuckling darkly. "Always ten steps ahead, aren't you, Zoe?" His fingers brushed a stray curl behind her ear. "Ask me anything. I'll lay the Goldmann skeletons bare for you."

He shifted, his expression turning grave. "Let's start with why Quincy, Chloe, and Harrison's parents died. They weren't just employees - they were Titus's most trusted operatives, selected from the elite training camps."

Evelyn's brows knitted together as Nathan continued, "My great-grandfather co-founded an organization with Stoslo's crown princess called the Night Banquet. Publicly known as the Goldmann Banquet."

Her breath caught. Even with her limited time in Stoslo, she'd heard whispers about the shadowy organization rumored to be the royal family's private army. "Your great-grandfather was involved with Stoslo's royalty?"

Nathan's laugh held no humor. "Why do you think Grandfather looks like a mixed-blood aristocrat?" His thumb traced the curve of her cheekbone. "Because he is. The illegitimate son of Princess Anna and Patrick Goldmann - a street rat turned royal bodyguard."

The story unfolded like something from a gothic novel - how Patrick Goldmann had clawed his way from the gutters to become the princess's personal enforcer, earning the moniker "The Princess's Hyena" for his brutal efficiency in eliminating her enemies. Their affair had produced Titus, a child the royal family refused to acknowledge.

"To protect him from court politics," Nathan explained, his voice tight, "the princess sent them to Zlokova with enough wealth to establish our family name." His jaw clenched. "The year they left Stoslo was the year both Patrick and the princess died under... suspicious circumstances."

Evelyn's fingers found his, intertwining tightly as the weight of his family's history settled between them. The Goldmann legacy wasn't just wealth - it was written in blood and royal betrayal.
###Chapter 300

Evelyn stood frozen, her mind reeling from Nathan's revelation about the Goldmann family's past. It was as if she'd been handed a truth too extraordinary to grasp.

Nathan lifted her effortlessly, settling her onto his lap. "Zoe," he murmured, his voice thick with sincerity, "I've laid everything bare for you. Now you understand why my grandfather keeps Rosalind so close—why he values her above all others. Her grandparents raised him. They were his family when he had none."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, silent.

Nathan took her hand and pressed it against his chest, where his heartbeat thrummed steadily. "I swear to you," he vowed, his gaze unwavering, "as long as I draw breath, no one—not my grandfather, not Rosalind, not anyone—will make you suffer. Anyone who dares to hurt you will answer to me."

His voice dropped lower, rougher. "Even if it costs me my life."

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine. "Hades himself wouldn't dare keep you," she whispered.

Nathan traced the curve of her lips with his thumb. "Then my life is yours to claim," he said. "No one else has that right."

Two days later, Evelyn received her assessment results.

Her breath caught. 130 points.

"Sir," she blurted, "there must be a mistake. I didn't complete one of the trials. How could I score 130?"

The instructor's expression softened. "The extra ten points are for your bravery. You risked your life to save your teammate. While recklessness isn't commendable, courage is."

He added, "Lillian Heinrich admitted she panicked. She said you were the reason she's alive."

Evelyn clutched the report. "What about Lillian? How did she do?"

"Only the top scorer advances. Lillian withdrew voluntarily—because of you."

The words echoed in Evelyn's mind. Lillian's choice stunned her.

Outside, Evelyn spotted Rosalind and Harrison deep in conversation.

Rosalind's eyes flickered with surprise when she noticed Evelyn, but her smile remained polished. "Ms. Vanderbilt," she said smoothly, "I heard about your ordeal. I never expected Winifred to go that far. I'm relieved you're unharmed."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you, Ms. Summers?"

Rosalind lowered her lashes. "Of course. You're the woman Nathan loves." Her voice dipped, almost regretful. "I owe you an apology—for the jade ring. I wanted to test your feelings for him."

Evelyn blinked.

This doesn't sound like her.

But she smiled. "Nathan explained everything. And in a way, I should thank you. You helped me realize something."

Rosalind's smile stiffened. "Oh?"

Evelyn twirled a lock of hair around her finger, her lips curving. "I was afraid to face my feelings for him. But after everything that's happened..." She met Rosalind's gaze squarely. "I think I'm in love with him."
###Chapter 301

The breeze carried Evelyn's words through the air like a whispered secret.

Rosalind's face stiffened instantly. That feminine intuition women possessed never lied. She understood exactly what Evelyn meant - this was a clear declaration of war over Nathan.

The audacity of this woman, staking her claim so boldly right in front of her.

"Ms. Summers, you seem pale. Are you feeling unwell?" Evelyn feigned concern with perfect innocence.

Rosalind forced a tight smile. "If you truly value your relationship with Nathan, I hope you'll cherish it properly."

"Don't worry about that, Ms. Summers." Evelyn's eyes glinted with challenge. "I don't plan on leaving any room for competition."

And by competition, she meant Rosalind herself.

Evelyn walked past her, satisfaction curling in her chest at the sight of Rosalind's crumbling composure.

Rosalind's expression darkened like storm clouds gathering. How had this woman survived every trap set for her? That incompetent Winifred had failed spectacularly, but did Evelyn really think she could stop true love?

Pulling out her phone with trembling fingers, Rosalind typed a message: [Investigate the Vanderbilts immediately!]

Evelyn descended the stairs with her documents when she nearly collided with Nathan and Harrison. The latter looked like a guilty schoolboy caught cheating and hastily excused himself.

Nathan's eyes sparkled with amusement as he advanced toward her, each step measured and deliberate in that confident stride of his.

Evelyn found herself backing up until her shoulders met the wall.

He caged her in with his arms, his laughter rich and warm. "Put Rosalind in her place, did we?"

Evelyn remained silent.

"Told her you're in love with me?"

Still no response.

"And that no other woman stands a chance?" His deep voice wrapped around her like velvet, his masculine presence overwhelming.

Evelyn drew a sharp breath. "It was just a joke. I couldn't tolerate her arrogance, so-"

So Harrison had been playing spy. Typical.

Nathan arched an eyebrow. "But did you mean it?" He wasn't interested in explanations.

Evelyn steadied her voice. "Why are you making such a big deal out of this?"

Just as she tried to slip away, his arm snaked around her waist, pulling her back. "Answer the question."

"Nathan, we're in public!" She prayed no one would witness this scene.

"Fine, my shy little Zoe." He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, grinning. "I'll take your words at face value then."

Her admission - both the love confession and the possessive claim - had sent his heart soaring.

"How are the results?" Nathan smoothly changed topics, glancing at her documents. A proud smile curved his lips. "Impressive. Such hard work deserves proper compensation."

Evelyn snatched the papers back. "I don't want your rewards."

His chuckle was warm with affection. "Zoe, you'll have to learn to accept what I give you. Besides our children, I'll soon be your family - your lawfully wedded husband."

Family. The word struck Evelyn with unexpected force. Marriage to Nathan meant more than just vows - it meant a complete home for their three children.

She wouldn't be alone anymore. Hidden behind a pillar, Felix Boucher eavesdropped with wide, shocked eyes.
###Chapter 302

The truth hit him like a freight train. His beloved Evelyn had been pushing him away because she already belonged to Nathan Goldmann.

And worse - they already had children together.

He had lost before the game even began. Fate had brought them together too late.

At the underground market's dimly lit alleyway...

A redhead in fishnet stockings clung to a man's arm as they exited the massage parlor. She planted a sloppy kiss on his cheek before sending him off. "Come back soon, sugar. I'll be counting the minutes."

As she turned to reenter the establishment, her gaze landed on an unusual trio approaching - a masked woman flanked by two imposing bodyguards.

The redhead eyed the woman's elaborate mask with amusement. "Sorry, honey. We don't cater to female clients." Her gaze raked over the muscular men. "Though these two studs are more than welcome."

The masked woman tilted her head slightly. One of the bodyguards stepped forward, pressing a thick wad of cash into the redhead's hand. "We're looking for Vivian Vanderbilt."

The woman's fingers trembled as she counted the bills. Fifteen thousand dollars - more than half a year's earnings!

Her demeanor shifted instantly. "Vivian? Oh yes, she's been with us about a month now. Right this way!" The money burned in her palm. In this underworld, cash was king.

Vivian leaned against the doorway, taking a long drag from her cigarette. The skimpy outfit and caked-on makeup were armor against the world. Honor meant nothing when survival was at stake.

"Vivian, you've got visitors!"

The redhead ushered the trio forward. Vivian forced a professional smile despite her exhaustion.

Her bloodshot eyes widened when she saw the masked woman. Female clients were unheard of in this establishment.

"You're Vivian Vanderbilt?" The masked woman's voice was cool as ice.

Vivian stubbed out her cigarette. "That's me."

"Let's talk inside."

The small room smelled of cheap perfume and regret. The masked woman settled onto the stained couch while her guards stood sentinel.

"I hear Evelyn Vanderbilt is your stepsister?"

At the mention of Evelyn, Vivian's hands clenched into fists. "What's it to you? Did that bitch send you?"

A gloved hand rose in placation. "Relax, Ms. Vanderbilt. I despise that woman as much as you do."

Vivian eyed her warily. "Then why are you here?"

A soft chuckle escaped the mask. "Would you like to escape this hellhole?"

Escape. The word sent shivers down Vivian's spine. "You can get me out of here?"

"Tell me everything about Evelyn," the woman purred, "and I'll make all your problems disappear."

Thirty minutes later...

The masked woman slid into the backseat of a black sedan. Removing her disguise, she smirked at her reflection.

Who would have guessed? Evelyn's mother was a de Arma. This changed everything.

She dialed a familiar number. "Grandfather? We need to talk. You'll never believe what I just discovered..."
###Chapter 303

Evelyn packed her bags and stepped out of the training camp. Nathan was already waiting for her downstairs, leaning against his sleek black car with his arms crossed.

Chloe rushed over to say goodbye, clutching Evelyn’s hand tightly. "Evelyn, promise I can visit you during my break?"

A soft smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "Of course! My door is always open for you."

Before leaving, she turned to take one last look at the vast training grounds, the memories flashing through her mind. Then, with a quiet exhale, she slid into the car.

Nathan noticed her lingering gaze out the window and gently brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. "Not ready to leave yet?"

Evelyn turned to him, her expression thoughtful. "Nathan, there’s something I need to ask you."

He stilled. It was the first time she had ever asked him for a favor. "Name it."

"Lillian is incredibly talented. She gave up her assessment because of me. Could you…?"

"You want me to fast-track her promotion?" Nathan’s eyes narrowed slightly. Even now, Evelyn was thinking of others. Had she forgotten the wound on her arm?

She crossed her arms and looked away, feigning indifference. "How can I believe you’re sincere if you won’t even do this for me?"

Lillian had the skills and experience. With Nathan’s influence, it wouldn’t be difficult to push her name forward.

Nathan pulled her into his arms, a smirk playing on his lips. "That depends on how you plan to bribe me."

Evelyn’s lips twitched. A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes as she traced circles on his chest with her finger. "That depends on how well you handle it."

Nathan’s grip tightened around her finger, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Zoe, don’t play with fire unless you want me to ask Oliver to pull over right now."

His teeth grazed her earlobe, sending a shiver down her spine. Zoe had learned to tease him, and he wasn’t sure he could hold back even if he swore celibacy for a week.

Evelyn wriggled out of his embrace with a huff. "Double standards."

Why was it fair for him to tease her, but not the other way around? Wait—why was she even thinking like this?

Nathan adjusted his posture, his expression unreadable, though amusement flickered in his eyes. "You can do whatever you want when we get home."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. He was probably hoping she’d keep pushing his limits.

Nathan pulled out his phone and dialed Harrison. "Add a cadet named Lillian Heinrich to the priority list for headquarters transfer. Get it done by the end of the week."

After hanging up, he turned to Evelyn, his gaze expectant. "Satisfied?"

She grinned and gave him a thumbs-up.

Nathan sighed in mock exasperation.

At the Goldmann Mansion

"Mommy!"

Caleb, Liam, and Daisy, who hadn’t seen their mother in weeks, stood eagerly by the door with the butler. The moment she stepped out of the car, they rushed toward her.

Evelyn crouched down, wrapping them all in a tight hug. "Did you miss me?"

"Of course!" Caleb declared.

Liam nodded vigorously. "You look thinner, Mommy."

Daisy pouted. "Did they not feed you there?"

Evelyn chuckled, ruffling their hair. But then she noticed Daisy’s rounder cheeks and pinched them playfully. "Someone’s been eating well while I was gone."

Daisy gasped in mock offense. "I did not!"

Liam crossed his arms. "How could we not? Uncle Adrian keeps feeding us lobster every night!"
###Chapter 304

Evelyn remained silent.

"Their Godfather Adrian?"

These two little troublemakers were masters of manipulation.

Nathan approached Mr. Chester, who gave a respectful nod. "Mr. Goldmann, Elder Master Goldmann has been waiting for you in the study for several hours."

"Understood." Nathan turned to Evelyn. "Take the children downstairs."

Evelyn rose slowly, letting the three of them go ahead. Nathan took her hand, leading her toward the study.

When they entered, Rosalind Summers stood beside Theodore Goldmann.

Theodore sat behind the desk, his presence commanding. Evelyn's gaze instinctively turned frosty.

"Grandfather, Evelyn has completed the assessment and passed. Now, about our wedding—"

"I remain firm in my rejection of this marriage!"

Nathan's expression darkened. "You're going back on your word?"

"Yes, I am. You will not marry this woman!" Theodore's hostility toward Evelyn had intensified, his stance more rigid than before she had even entered the training camp.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. She had fulfilled her end of the bargain—endured the grueling mission, risked her life—yet he was reneging?

"Elder Master Goldmann," she said carefully, "I don’t understand why you’re withdrawing your agreement."

She hadn’t expected an immediate wedding, but a deal was a deal. She had fought for this.

Theodore slammed his palm on the desk. "Because your mother was a de Arma—Hernandez’s daughter!"

The de Armas.

Nathan’s face hardened. How had his grandfather uncovered that?

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. What did her mother’s lineage have to do with anything?

Nathan stepped in front of her protectively. "Evelyn’s mother was a de Arma, but she is a Vanderbilt. My father and I were aware of this."

Rosalind’s eyes flickered. So Nathan and his father had been shielding Evelyn all along.

Theodore shot to his feet, jabbing a finger at Nathan. "You knew, and you hid it from me!"

"Grandfather, if you have grievances with the de Armas, take them up with Harrison. Evelyn has no part in that feud."

"You foolish boy! Have you forgotten how your great-grandfather nearly died because of them?" Theodore’s voice was laced with venom.

Evelyn stiffened. "The de Armas did that?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "That was generations ago. It has nothing to do with us."

Furious, Theodore snatched an ashtray and hurled it at Nathan.

Rosalind gasped. "Nathan—!"

The ashtray struck his cheek before shattering on the floor. A bruise bloomed across his skin.

"Nathan!"

Evelyn’s heart lurched. Seeing him hurt ignited something dark inside her. She balled her fists. "Elder Master Goldmann, Nathan is right. Whatever happened between our families is in the past. It doesn’t concern us!"
###Chapter 305

Rosalind was stunned. How could Evelyn dare to defy Theodore?

Hah, she had truly enraged him now. This would be her downfall!

"You!" Theodore's expression darkened with fury. "Get out of my sight!"

Nathan gripped Evelyn's wrist, turning sharply. His voice was ice. "The only woman I will ever marry is Evelyn."

Watching him walk away without hesitation, Theodore was reminded of his own son, Philip, who had been just as stubborn when he insisted on marrying Victoria. His eyes narrowed dangerously.

Though he had eventually accepted Victoria as his daughter-in-law, it had been against his will.

This was different. Even if Evelyn was a Vanderbilt, she carried the cursed blood of the de Armas! That woman would be the ruin of them all!

Rosalind's heart turned to stone.

She had thought revealing this to Theodore would force Nathan to abandon Evelyn, but—

Nathan had chosen to defy his grandfather rather than give her up!

"Grandfather, don't worry. Ms. Vanderbilt's children are the only reason Nathan is clinging to her. He doesn’t want them to lose their mother."

Yes. Without those children, Evelyn would be nothing.

Theodore's face hardened. "Hmph. We are Goldmanns. We don’t need to settle for a woman like her. As for Evelyn, I will never allow de Arma blood into this family!"

Once inside the car, Evelyn cupped Nathan’s face. "Nathan, let me see."

He turned and pulled her into his arms instead, catching her off guard. "Nathan?"

"Zoe, just let me hold you."

His embrace was tight, his face buried in the curve of her neck. The man who had stood unshaken before Theodore now showed her this rare vulnerability.

Evelyn frowned, recalling Theodore’s words. "Nathan… are the de Armas really as terrible as your grandfather says?"

"That feud started with my great-grandfather’s generation." Nathan lifted his head, fingers brushing her cheek. "He was at war with the left-wing royals, and the de Armas were among their strongest supporters."

"My father never wanted me involved in those old conflicts, but my grandfather… he was shaped by that hatred. He despises the royals, especially the de Armas."

Nathan took her hand, his gaze dropping. "I’m sorry, Evelyn. I kept this from you because I didn’t want it to burden you."

To him, the sins of their ancestors meant nothing. No matter who Evelyn was, he wanted her—only her.

Evelyn studied him silently before tracing the bruise on his face.

"Ow."

He winced dramatically, lips curving into a pained smirk. "That hurts, Zoe."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Men. They were impossible when they turned soft.

"Let’s go back. I’ll treat that."

Nathan tightened his grip on her hand, amused. "Back where? My grandfather just banished us. Where exactly can we go?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Then—"

He grinned.

"You promised me a reward, didn’t you? Take me there."

With that, Nathan drove away from the Goldmann mansion, leaving the storm behind.
###Chapter 306

The sun cast golden rays over Blue Bay, an exclusive neighborhood nestled in the silk stocking district.

Evelyn gazed through the car window at the fiery red maples lining the road, their vibrant leaves breathing life into the elegant streetscape.

Bassburgh’s elite enclave was a paradise of mountains and sea, where luxury villas overlooked the shimmering coastline. The air was crisp, the surroundings serene, and the infrastructure impeccable—making it the preferred retreat for tycoons and celebrities alike.

She turned to Nathan, brows furrowed. "What are we doing here?"

He didn’t answer, his grip tightening on the steering wheel as he pulled up to a sprawling 3,700-square-foot villa.

The estate was a masterpiece—lush gardens bursting with blooms, a crystalline pond reflecting the sky, and a charming wooden pavilion perched beside a winding stone path.

The villa itself stood two stories tall, its warm golden façade exuding understated grandeur.

Evelyn stepped out of the car, stunned. "You didn’t—"

A smirk tugged at Nathan’s lips. "Our newlywed home. Quiet, private… perfect for just the two of us."

Her breath hitched. "Just us?"

He wrapped his arms around her from behind, his chin resting on her shoulder. "Zoe, we’re getting married. We need time to ourselves. My father will handle the kids—he adores them. This is about us."

About us? A shiver ran down her spine. Something about his tone unsettled her.

Before she could react, he swept her off her feet and carried her inside.

The villa’s floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of the endless ocean, waves crashing against the shore. The interior was fully furnished, every detail meticulously chosen.

Nathan set her down on the plush sofa, his gaze darkening as he leaned in.

Evelyn pressed a hand to his chest. "Your face—you should tend to that bruise first."

He chuckled, low and dangerous. "Fine."

She fetched the first-aid kit—another sign he had planned this long ago. The dark purple bruise on his cheekbone was stark evidence of Theodore’s brutal punch.

As she dabbed at the wound, the sea breeze fluttered through the open windows, lifting the sheer curtains. The scent of her shampoo teased his senses, and his gaze dropped to her slightly parted lips.

His throat tightened.

A finger traced her jawline before he captured her mouth in a searing kiss, pushing her back against the cushions.

"Mmm—Nathan, your injury—"

"I missed you," he murmured against her skin, his grip firm.

Heat flooded her cheeks.

Damn him. Always taking advantage.

She tried to wriggle free. "I have work later—"

But he held her tighter, teeth grazing the buttons of her blouse. "You’re staying right here while I recover."

By the time she woke, dusk had fallen. One lesson was clear—never provoke a man who’d been deprived too long.

Wrapped in a sheet, she padded to the closet—only to find it stocked entirely with his tailored suits and dress shirts.

That bastard planned this.

Downstairs, Nathan was cooking. The aroma of food made her stomach growl as she descended in oversized slippers, her body still humming from the afternoon’s intensity.
###Chapter 307

Nathan turned his head, his breath catching in his throat when he saw her.

Evelyn stood there wearing nothing but his oversized white dress shirt, the hem barely skimming her thighs. Her dark waves tumbled freely down her back, while the sleeves swallowed her delicate hands whole. She'd left the top buttons undone, offering him a tantalizing glimpse of what lay beneath.

He'd always known his wife was a temptress, but seeing her draped in his clothing ignited a fire in him that threatened to consume all reason.

"Is dinner ready, Nathan?" Evelyn's voice was honeyed as she padded barefoot toward the table, the sleeves flapping comically with each movement. "I'm starving."

Nathan clicked his tongue and turned down the stove's flame. In three strides, he had her pinned against the counter, his hands framing her waist. "Hungry again, sweetheart?" he murmured, raising an eyebrow.

The glass trembled in Evelyn's grip.

Only when her stomach growled loudly did Nathan chuckle, releasing her to ruffle her hair. "Just teasing you, love. Dinner's served."

He carried their meal to the table - a rich tomato bisque and perfectly al dente spaghetti carbonara. Evelyn studied her husband across the table. Even with the healing cut along his jawline, he looked every inch the aristocratic CEO. Cooking in their villa's kitchen hadn't diminished his commanding presence; if anything, the domesticity made him more devastatingly attractive.

Evelyn was convinced Nathan was heaven's favorite creation - sculpted to perfection in every conceivable way.

"You deliberately didn't pack any clothes for me, didn't you?" Evelyn accused around a mouthful of pasta, pouting adorably.

Nathan's lips curved into that wicked smile she knew too well. "I did warn you this was a convalescence retreat, Mrs. Goldmann. Your sole responsibility is keeping this patient... entertained."

"It's been two weeks since I last checked on the studio," Evelyn fretted, worrying her bottom lip. "I hope Uncle Gregory isn't overwhelmed."

Nathan dabbed his mouth with a napkin. "Soul Jewelry is in capable hands. I've made arrangements."

Evelyn's fork stilled mid-air. "Does that mean... you're not returning to the Goldmann estate?"

"I've wanted my own space for years," Nathan admitted, his gaze darkening. "Privacy is rather essential for certain... marital activities, don't you think?"

That dangerous glint in his eyes sent shivers down Evelyn's spine.

What followed were three days Evelyn would remember in vivid detail - and three nights that left her barely able to stand. Nathan carried her to the ensuite bathroom each morning, their modesty long since abandoned. By the third day, she didn't even blush when he toweled her dry before carrying her back to bed.

Seated on the mattress's edge with Evelyn cradled in his lap, Nathan carefully dried her hair with a towel. His fingers carded through the silken strands, inhaling the floral scent of her shampoo. She'd clearly invested in premium haircare - not a single split end marred the chestnut cascade.

Noticing her drowsy blinking, Nathan slowed his ministrations. This newfound vulnerability from his usually guarded wife was intoxicating. She'd lowered every defense, embracing both their intimacy and her own femininity. If he could freeze time, this would be the moment he'd preserve forever.

The shrill ringtone shattered the tranquility. Evelyn startled as Nathan reached for his buzzing phone.

Seeing his father's caller ID, Nathan answered tersely, "Yes?"

"Have you absconded with my daughter-in-law?" Theodore Goldmann's voice boomed through the speaker.

Nathan massaged his temples. "We've relocated. Temporarily."

The older man harrumphed. "Put Zoe on."

Evelyn's eyes widened when Nathan handed her the phone. "Mr. Goldmann?"

"Zoe, I've been briefed on everything." Theodore's tone softened considerably. "Please find it in your heart to forgive Nathan's grandfather. His prejudice against the de Armas runs deeper than I realized - a relic from conflicts long past."

He sighed heavily before continuing, "Though your mother was a de Arma, you are your own person. The Goldmanns' feud with that family shouldn't define your marriage. Regardless of what the old man says, you'll always have my support. You're the only daughter-in-law I'll ever acknowledge."
###Chapter 308

"Since Nathan wants no one but you, I hope that no matter what happens, you will stay by his side forever."

Evelyn froze. She didn't understand why, but she felt as though Mr. Goldmann Sr. was entrusting his son's future to her.

Forcing a smile, she replied, "Don't worry, Mr. Goldmann, I—" She glanced at Nathan, who sat beside her, unusually quiet and well-behaved, before finishing, "I won’t leave him alone."

Nathan’s lips twitched slightly. Given how concerned his father was about their relationship, he supposed he ought to treat the old man a little better in the future.

Theodore Goldmann nodded in satisfaction. "Good, good. I’ll handle his grandfather. As for you two, take your time and enjoy yourselves. I’m sure the old man will come around eventually."

Once the call ended, Evelyn handed the phone back to Nathan.

A smug grin spread across his face as he pulled her into his arms. "You heard him, didn’t you? My father wants you to stay with me forever."

Evelyn scowled and lightly punched his shoulder. "Don’t get ahead of yourself. Yes, I promised Mr. Goldmann, but if you ever hurt me, I’ll take the kids and marry someone else!"

Marry someone else?

Nathan stiffened. When the words finally registered, his chest swelled with warmth and amusement. Even though they weren’t officially engaged yet, she had already acknowledged being his.

He seized her hand and pressed a kiss to her knuckles, his voice low and possessive. "I won’t give you the chance."

After a few days of "rest," the bruise on Nathan’s cheek had faded. He draped his jacket over his arm and strolled downstairs toward the kitchen.

Leaning against the doorway, he watched Evelyn’s slender figure move gracefully between the stove and counter. A faint smirk tugged at his lips.

Too absorbed in adjusting the flame, Evelyn didn’t notice his presence—until strong arms wrapped around her from behind. Before she could protest, his lips captured hers in a searing kiss.

"Mmm—Nathan, stop—" She squirmed, but he pinned her against the wall, his mouth relentless. Slowly, the fight drained from her, and she melted into him.

What had started as a simple kiss quickly spiraled into something deeper, more demanding.

The doorbell shattered the moment.

Flushed, Evelyn shoved him away. "That must be the delivery for the clothes."

As she turned to leave, Nathan yanked her back and wrapped his jacket around her shoulders. "You’re not answering the door like this."

If it was a woman, fine. But if it was a man? He’d gouge their eyes out.

Evelyn blinked, then glanced down at herself—wearing nothing but his oversized shirt. And whose fault was that?

Shooting him a glare, she tightened the jacket and marched to the door.

A uniformed woman stood outside, smiling politely. "Mrs. Goldmann? Mr. Goldmann reserved our entire limited collection for you. We’ve brought everything today."

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathan appeared behind her, his arm possessively around her waist. "Bring them in," he ordered.

The saleswoman signaled her team, and soon, the living room was filled with glossy gift bags—dozens of them, all bearing the logos of luxury brands like T&M, Armani, Tia, and Estee.

Evelyn’s jaw dropped. She knew Nathan was wealthy—he could buy a villa without blinking—but she hadn’t expected him to order an entirely new wardrobe instead of just retrieving her things from the Goldmann mansion.

Even as someone who enjoyed spending, this was excessive.

Noticing her expression, Nathan pulled her close and kissed her cheek. "Don’t feel guilty. All my money is yours. Spend it however you like."
###Chapter 309

Evelyn finally understood everything now.

No matter how much money she earned, her three children always complained it wasn’t enough.

Compared to a ruthless capitalist like Nathan, she was practically broke.

Just then, Nathan’s phone rang. He pulled it out without hesitation, and the caller ID flashed—Theodore Goldmann, his grandfather.

Instead of stepping away, he answered right in front of Evelyn.

“Yes?”

Theodore’s voice crackled through the line, and Nathan’s expression darkened instantly. He let out a cold scoff.

“So now you’re interfering with the people around me? Where’s Oliver?”

Theodore’s reply was smooth. “I’ve sent Oliver on a business trip. Is Rosalind not qualified enough to take his place?”

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Theodore had deliberately removed Oliver and replaced him with Rosalind. It was obvious—he was forcing Rosalind into Nathan’s life.

“Goldmann Group isn’t Night Banquet. You don’t have the authority to make that decision.”

Theodore’s tone turned sharp. “Listen carefully, boy. If you don’t want me to make life difficult for the Vanderbilts, you’ll let Rosalind stay by your side and learn from you.”

The call ended abruptly.

Nathan’s grip on the phone turned white-knuckled, his expression icy.

Evelyn noticed the shift immediately. She stepped closer and wrapped her fingers around his cold hand.

“If your grandfather insists on Rosalind being your assistant, just accept it.”

“Zoe…” His voice was low, laced with frustration. “Aren’t you even a little worried?”

Evelyn arched a brow, a teasing smirk playing on her lips. “If you can’t resist temptation, then I’ll just have to marry someone else.”

Nathan’s eyes flashed dangerously. “You want to marry someone else?”

She tugged lightly on his tie, her smile turning wicked. “That depends entirely on your performance.”

Nathan chuckled despite himself. This woman had him wrapped around her finger.

Mischievous little minx.

At a cozy café downtown…

Sophia propped her chin on her hand, chewing absently on her straw as she studied Evelyn. “I thought you’d vanished off the face of the earth. Turns out you were in some secret training camp.”

Evelyn laughed but didn’t elaborate.

She couldn’t tell Sophia everything—her best friend was terrible at keeping secrets, and the kids would find out in no time.

“Oh, by the way,” Sophia added, “Mrs. Laurent has been asking about you a lot lately. She is your aunt, you know. Are you really going to keep avoiding her?”

Evelyn lowered her gaze. “I suppose it’s time I met her.”

The Laurent family mansion was as grand as ever.

Lillian sat in the living room, flipping through an old photo album with such intensity that she didn’t even notice the doorbell. A maid hurried to answer it.

Recognizing Sophia but not Evelyn, the maid hesitated. “Miss Hill? What brings you here today?”

“Is Mrs. Laurent home?”

“Yes, she is.”

The maid stepped aside, and Sophia strode in with Evelyn trailing behind. “Mrs. Laurent!”

Lillian finally looked up, her breath catching when she saw Evelyn standing there.

Sophia nudged Evelyn forward. “Mrs. Laurent, Zoe wanted to see you, so I brought her.”

Lillian’s fingers tightened around the album.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to it before she spoke softly. “Mrs. Laurent, I came to ask you something.”

Lillian stood abruptly. “Let’s talk in the study.” She glanced at Sophia. “You stay here. Let the maid know if you need anything.”

Sophia nodded, watching as Evelyn followed Lillian upstairs.

Why the secrecy?

Was whatever Evelyn wanted to ask that confidential?
###Chapter 310

Evelyn settled onto the plush couch, her fingers tracing the intricate embroidery on the armrest. Lillian studied her for a moment before gesturing to the seat opposite. "Sit. You're here about your mother, aren't you?"

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. She took the offered seat, her posture straight but not rigid. A silent nod confirmed Lillian’s assumption.

"Miranda was my sister," Lillian began, a wistful smile touching her lips. "You have her eyes. And her stubbornness." She chuckled softly, as if recalling something private. If she had met Evelyn sooner, perhaps she wouldn’t have been so quick to believe Vivian’s poisonous words.

A pause. Then, sharper: "Did she ever tell you why she came to Zlokova?"

Evelyn shook her head.

Lillian frowned. "She never told me either. If not for that bracelet Vivian wore, I wouldn’t have known she was here at all."

"You didn’t know?" Evelyn’s voice wavered slightly. Miranda fled the de Armas, changed her name, vanished—and even her own sister didn’t know why?

"Don’t look so shocked," Lillian sighed. "When she left, I assumed she’d gone to Morwich."

"Morwich?" Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Nathan’s from Morwich.

Lillian leaned forward, her gaze piercing. "Before I tell you more, answer me this—what’s between you and Nathan Goldmann?"

Evelyn met her stare evenly. "You already know."

The unspoken truth hung between them—children, a life entwined, everything but the ring. The thought of marriage sent an unexpected warmth through her chest.

Lillian’s expression darkened at the faint blush on Evelyn’s cheeks. "I see."

Evelyn exhaled. "Your turn. Why did my mother leave the de Armas?"

Lillian’s fingers tightened around her teacup. "She was ill."

"Cancer?"

"No." A bitter laugh. "Something far stranger. She was healthy—until she wasn’t. One day, I found her coughing blood. She begged me not to tell our father."

Miranda hadn’t wanted to worry him.

Lillian’s voice dropped to a whisper. "She never explained. Just left a letter and disappeared with Sebastian."

"Sebastian?" Evelyn’s breath caught.

"Her lover."

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered. Richard had once confessed that Miranda loved someone else—someone who wasn’t him. Sebastian.

But Richard had sworn Miranda died of cancer. Had he lied? Or had he never known the truth?

Evelyn steeled herself. "Mrs. Laurent, what about the feud between the Goldmanns and the de Armas? Nathan’s grandfather claims our family tried to kill his great-grandfather. Is it true?"

Lillian’s face shuttered. "Ask your grandfather. The de Armas’ affairs are not mine to discuss."

The dismissal was absolute.

Evelyn’s nails bit into her palms. Another dead end.

But she wasn’t done yet.

###Chapter 311

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the tall windows of the Laurent estate, casting long shadows across the marble floors. Sophia Hill sat in the plush living room, swirling a glass of fresh milk absentmindedly. Twenty minutes had passed since Zoe Vanderbilt disappeared upstairs with Lillian de Arma, and the silence was beginning to weigh on her.

Just as she took another sip, the sound of polished shoes clicking against the floor made her look up. Her lips instantly flattened into a thin line.

Lucas Laurent stood before her, his dark eyes scanning her with obvious disdain. "You?"

Sophia wiped the milk mustache from her upper lip, unimpressed by his judgmental stare. She knew exactly what he was thinking—another desperate woman his mother had dragged home in hopes of matchmaking.

"Trust me, I wouldn't be here if Zoe hadn't insisted," she shot back, just as footsteps descended the staircase.

Zoe appeared, her expression unreadable. Sophia immediately set her glass down and stood. "Zoe, what did Lillian say?"

Zoe barely glanced at Lucas before responding, her voice steady but distant. "Enough."

Lucas stepped closer, his gaze lingering on Zoe's face. "I didn’t expect you to seek out my mother after all this time."

"I came for answers about my mother," Zoe replied coolly. "Now that I have them, I'm leaving."

Sophia shot Lucas a glare before following Zoe out. The moment they stepped into the car, Zoe's composed façade cracked.

The city blurred past the window as Zoe stared blankly, lost in thought.

Lillian confirmed Mom didn’t die of illness. But even she doesn’t know the full truth about the de Armas and the Goldmanns.

Nathan warned me about the danger tied to his bloodline—how his great-grandfather's affair with a Stoslo princess marked them as enemies of the crown.

If I stay with him, will I really be putting myself at risk?

"Zoe!" Sophia's sharp voice snapped her back to reality.

The car had pulled over. Sophia studied her with concern. "You zoned out completely. I asked where you wanted to go next—back to the studio?"

Zoe exhaled shakily. The studio? With everything swirling in her mind, she couldn’t focus on work.

"Let’s get a drink," she muttered.

Dusk Lounge

The bass thrummed through the air, vibrating under their feet. Neon lights flickered over the packed dance floor, where bodies moved in sync with the pulsing rhythm.

Sophia guided Zoe to the bar, frowning as her friend downed her first glass too quickly. "You never drink like this. What did Lillian say to shake you up?"

Zoe twirled the empty glass between her fingers. "My mother didn’t die of cancer. But even Lillian doesn’t know how she really died. And the history between the de Armas and the Goldmanns?" She laughed bitterly. "Too tangled for anyone to unravel."

Sophia's grip tightened around her own drink. "Then we’ll figure it out. Together."

Zoe didn’t answer. The music drowned out her thoughts, but not the fear creeping in.

If the past is this dangerous… what does that mean for my future?
###Chapter 312

Evelyn froze for a heartbeat. Rosalind's question had clearly caught her off guard.

"Okay, I genuinely don't get it."

Rosalind placed her hands on Evelyn's shoulders with an intoxicating smile. "Zoe, I've realized you're my only true friend. You never abandoned me - not when I was being insufferable, not when others set me up. I don't know where I'd be without your help back then."

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "Are you drunk?"

"Must you always be so irritating? Do I look intoxicated to you?" Rosalind wrapped her arms around Evelyn's neck. "Sometimes I envy you. Your father protected you so fiercely growing up that you became this beautifully unjaded woman. Nobody dares give you unnecessary trouble either. Must be nice being the carefree young socialite."

'At least she'll never face the demons I battle daily.'

"When have you ever seen me carefree? You just haven't witnessed my father's dramatic episodes!" Evelyn lowered her voice. "If anything, I'm the envious one. You got to sleep with Bassburgh's most coveted bachelor - a man who's not only devastatingly handsome but absurdly loyal too. Plus three adorable children."

Rosalind chuckled. "Then why don't you find yourself one?"

"Please, as if any woman could replicate your luck in landing someone like Nathan Goldmann."

The phone on the table suddenly vibrated.

Evelyn glimpsed the caller ID flashing "Nate" and gasped.

Rosalind answered, "Nate?"

The deafening club music made Nathan's voice turn icy. "Where are you?"

"At a bar," Rosalind purred. "Care to join me?"

A beat of silence. Then clipped: "Address."

Ten minutes later, Nathan materialized in the club with supernatural speed.

His stormy expression darkened further. "Are you trying to get punished? Coming to a place like-"

Before he could finish, Rosalind launched herself into his arms. Even Nathan seemed startled by the sudden embrace.

She nuzzled his neck with a tipsy smile. "Handsome stranger, I'm done drinking. Take me home?"

'Handsome stranger?'

Nathan's jaw tightened. He tilted her chin up. "Who am I?"

"Nathan Goldmann," she answered with exaggerated clarity.

"Ahem, Mr. Goldmann," Evelyn interjected, grabbing her purse, "I'll leave Zoe in your capable hands." She bolted like a startled rabbit.

Nathan studied the woman in his arms - simultaneously drunk and lucid. "Explain this bar visit."

Rosalind played with his tie. "Needed to drown my sorrows."

His grip tightened. "Clearly you require more thorough... drowning." He scooped her up. "I'll see to it personally at home."

At the Blue Bay villa, Nathan carried her straight to their bedroom. Pinning her against the wall, he claimed her lips in a searing kiss.

Rosalind melted into him as his arms encircled her waist. "Zoe," he growled between kisses, "you belong to me."

The next morning at Blackgold Group...

Evelyn wore a cashmere turtleneck dress accentuated with pearl accessories and sapphire silver ornaments, radiating understated elegance.

As she approached the elevator, a voice called, "Ms. Vanderbilt."

Turning, Evelyn saw Rosalind approaching. Her smile turned guarded. "What a coincidence, Ms. Summers."
###Chapter 313

Rosalind's makeup was flawlessly understated today, her gown radiating elegance. "Didn't Nathan mention anything to you?"

Evelyn hesitated for a fraction of a second. "What exactly should he have told me?"

Rosalind studied her with a knowing smile. "I'm now Nathan's assistant. Hmm? He didn't inform you?"

Evelyn let out a light chuckle, crossing her arms. "Oh, is that all? I thought you were about to drop some earth-shattering news."

'She’s already flaunting this the moment she becomes his assistant?'

"Ms. Vanderbilt, don’t misunderstand. This was Grandfather Theodore’s arrangement. He wants me to learn from Nathan, so I’m sure you wouldn’t object, right?" She deliberately invoked the old man’s name, making it clear to Evelyn that she still held Theodore’s favor.

'As long as Grandfather supports me, you’ll never set foot in the Goldmann family!'

Unfazed, Evelyn flashed a dazzling smile. "Why would I misunderstand? You’re just his assistant, after all. A purely professional relationship—hardly something that requires my approval, don’t you think?"

The word professional made Rosalind’s smile stiffen. She forced a brittle grin. "I’m curious, Ms. Vanderbilt. Given your ties to the de Armas, you could easily establish your own company with their backing. Why lower yourself by opening a jewelry studio under Blackgold Group?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Are you implying Blackgold isn’t worthy of me?"

"Not at all. But you clearly don’t need Nathan’s help. So why bother?" Rosalind’s gaze turned icy, her patience for pretense wearing thin.

Evelyn arched a brow, unfazed. "I hate to disappoint you, Ms. Summers, but I never asked for Nathan’s support. He insisted I rely on him."

She leaned in slightly, her smile sharp. "And the person who suggested I open my studio at Blackgold? That was your direct superior, Nathan."

With that, she stepped into the elevator, leaving Rosalind seething as the doors slid shut.

'That conniving little—!'

At Soul Jewelry Studio

Despite Evelyn’s two-week absence, the studio had run smoothly under Gregory’s management.

Employees greeted her warmly as she walked in, and she returned each smile.

Spotting Gregory, she beamed. "Uncle Gregory."

He stood, relief washing over his face. "Zoe, you’re finally back."

"Did those two weeks feel like an eternity?"

He waved a hand. "Thankfully, Mr. Goldmann assigned extra staff when things got hectic. And you’ve returned just in time—Adrian Boucher’s drama teaser featured our jewelry, and the studio’s been flooded with calls ever since."

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled. "The response has been overwhelming?"

"Beyond overwhelming. Orders are booked solid until next year. Another week, and I’d have run out of ideas."

Gregory handed her a stack of contracts as she settled at her desk—all custom orders for the studio.

"Adrian’s influence is staggering. I’d wager most of these clients are his fans."

Mid-praise, Gregory suddenly frowned. "By the way, Adrian promoted us for free. Zoe, are you two… close?"

Evelyn blinked, then laughed. "It’s probably because of Liam and Daisy. They’re filming with him, and he adores them."
###Chapter 314

The two little troublemakers had perfected the art of sweet-talking.

Gregory nodded abruptly. "In that case, Mr. Boucher is truly going above and beyond to help promote our products. While we're benefiting from this partnership without any prior conditions, we can't simply exploit his generosity without showing proper gratitude."

"I know," Evelyn murmured, crossing her arms with a thoughtful smile. "Perhaps I'll treat Mr. Boucher to dinner when I have some free time soon."

Most people wouldn't dare dream of buying Adrian Boucher a meal, but Evelyn couldn't accept his favors without reciprocation. A dinner invitation seemed the most appropriate way to express her appreciation.

The thought made her recall Felix from the training camp as well.

'How did I end up indebted to both Boucher brothers?' she wondered with mild exasperation.

At noon, the office emptied as everyone left for lunch, leaving Evelyn alone sketching jewelry designs.

Frequent distractions shattered her concentration, leaving her inspiration in tatters. She crumpled another failed sketch and tossed it into the overflowing wastebasket.

Rubbing her temples, she sighed. "Two weeks at that camp, and I still can't recapture my creative flow since returning."

A Facebook notification interrupted her thoughts.

[J has sent you a friend request.]

Evelyn tapped the alert, scanning the sparse profile.

'This looks like some elderly gentleman's first attempt at social media. Probably a spam account.'

She rejected it without hesitation.

Moments later, her phone buzzed with a text from Nathan: "You rejected me?"

Evelyn's lips twitched.

'That was Nathan's account? Well, he does behave like a cranky old man sometimes.'

Before she could reply, her phone rang. Startled, she nearly dropped it before answering.

"Hello?"

Nathan's deep voice rumbled through the receiver. "Why did you reject my friend request?"

She gritted her teeth. "Accidental misclick."

"Send one back." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn reluctantly sent the Facebook friend request.

'No wonder it seemed odd - he probably hasn't logged in for years.'

Nathan added, "I'm waiting in my office."

Arriving at the administrative suite, Evelyn knocked before entering at his permission.

Her breath caught at the lavish lunch spread across his coffee table.

Nathan set aside his documents, unfolding his long legs as he rose. "You haven't eaten. Join me."

Without waiting for confirmation, he captured her wrist, guiding her to the sofa.

Evelyn sat rigidly beside him, last night's intimate memories flooding back. Heat prickled across her skin, her pulse accelerating.

Noticing her discomfort, Nathan smirked. "What's wrong? Has your affection cooled so quickly?"

"Must you always talk?" she hissed.

'He's infinitely more tolerable when silent.'

Nathan's eyes glinted as he leaned closer. "Shall we revisit last night's enthusiasm then?"

When his lips brushed her neck, Evelyn gasped, her protests dissolving into weak shivers.

"You were quite eager last night," he murmured against her skin, fingers tilting her chin up. "Don't tell me you've forgotten?"

Evelyn trembled as his proximity overwhelmed her senses. With effort, she shoved him away. "Nathan! Be serious!"
###Chapter 315

Nathan's tender gaze lingered on Evelyn, a deep sense of satisfaction curling in his chest.

I've tamed my little wildcat perfectly.

He pulled her fingers to his lips, pressing a soft kiss against them. His eyes darkened with a dangerous glint of desire.

"Would you ever step foot in a bar again?" His voice was low, teasing.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "No, I won’t."

"Promise?"

She yanked her hand away with an exasperated huff. "Yes, now can we eat?"

A sharp knock interrupted them.

Nathan’s expression cooled instantly. "Come in."

Rosalind stepped inside, clutching a stack of documents. The moment her eyes landed on Evelyn seated beside Nathan, a flicker of disgust twisted her features before she schooled them back into neutrality.

"Is there something urgent?" Nathan’s tone was ice.

Rosalind forced a tight smile. "The meeting with Gleaming Mountain Inc. is starting soon."

Nathan turned to Evelyn, his gaze softening. "Zoe, want to join me?"

Evelyn blinked. What?

Rosalind’s nails dug into her palms. "Nathan," she interjected, voice strained, "Ms. Vanderbilt isn’t a Luxe employee. It’s highly unprofessional for her to attend."

Nathan smirked, ruffling Evelyn’s hair like she was a pampered pet. "Zoe adores being by my side. I want everyone to know she’s mine. That way, no one dares disrespect her."

Evelyn’s jaw dropped.

You’re the one who can’t let go!

Nathan’s teasing grin only widened, completely ignoring Rosalind’s presence.

The sight of their intimacy shattered the icy mask Rosalind wore.

All of this should have been mine.

News of Nathan bringing Evelyn to the meeting spread like wildfire through Luxe.

Every executive had witnessed it firsthand—Nathan Goldmann, the untouchable CEO, declaring to the entire boardroom that Evelyn Vanderbilt, owner of Soul Jewelry, was his fiancée and part of his family.

Though rumors had circulated before, nothing compared to the shockwaves this caused.

"Did you see how Ms. Summers looked? I bet Ms. Vanderbilt only tagged along because she’s threatened by her."

"That’s not what I heard. Mr. Goldmann insisted she come!"

"Honestly, it’s obvious. Ms. Zoe doesn’t seem the clingy type. If anything, it’s him who can’t let her go."

"I envy her so much. No one else gets that kind of treatment from Nathan Goldmann."

The whispers died the second Rosalind appeared.

Everyone knew she was temporarily filling in as Nathan’s assistant. No one dared cross her.

Rosalind’s eyes darkened.

Evelyn won’t get to play the victor for long.

"That bastard!" Theodore Goldmann slammed the newspaper onto his desk, fury radiating off him.

Rosalind watched, satisfaction curling in her chest, but she kept her voice gentle. "Grandfather, Nathan clearly adores Ms. Vanderbilt. Maybe we should respect his choice?"

She feigned reluctance. "Even if you prefer me, forcing them apart isn’t right."

"Adores her?" Theodore scoffed. "He could have anyone, yet he chooses the daughter of that Armas scum? That woman will bring ruin to the Goldmanns!"
###Chapter 316

If this had happened years ago, Nathan would have been nothing but a worthless king! And that useless son of his—the apple didn't fall far from the tree. They even joined forces to rebel against the family!

Rosalind whispered cautiously, "Grandfather, please don't be upset. I believe the real issue lies with Ms. Vanderbilt, not Nathan."

Theodore's brows furrowed. "Explain yourself."

Rosalind bit her lip dramatically. "If I tell you, Nathan might accuse me of poisoning your mind against her."

"Speak freely," Theodore assured her with a pat on her shoulder. "You have my full support."

Taking a deep breath, Rosalind continued, "Ms. Vanderbilt has been relentlessly pestering Nathan, demanding he bring her to important meetings. Her behavior toward me has been utterly disgraceful—she clearly sees me as competition."

"She targeted me without provocation during training camp. On assessment day, Nathan suddenly showed up with me. I suspect she fed him lies about me, destroying his trust."

Every word dripped with calculated malice, painting Evelyn as the mastermind behind Nathan's defiance.

Theodore's expression darkened like storm clouds gathering.

His grandson couldn't possibly be this rebellious on his own. That woman had clearly overstayed her welcome.

Outside the study, Liam's small fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. Silently, he retreated down the hallway.

#Mr. Goldmann Spoils His Fiancée#

Scrolling through Twitter during her break, Evelyn froze when she saw the trending hashtag. Clicking through revealed dozens of posts about their "office PDA spectacle."

#Woody: The CEO's gorgeous fiancée is giving me serious envy.#

#OrangeFTW: When Mr. Goldmann—usually only seen in financial news—trends, it's always couple goals that murder singletons.#

#DayDreamer: The 1% have next-level ways of pampering their partners.#

Evelyn set her phone down with a thud. Now all of Zlokova knew she was Nathan's fiancée. Would they even let her keep working here?

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called. Gregory entered, followed closely by Chloe. "Evelyn!"

Evelyn rose slowly. "Chloe. This is unexpected."

Chloe strutted in, tossing a small velvet pouch onto the desk. "Rachel asked me to deliver this. Said you probably left it behind."

Evelyn's smile faltered as she opened the pouch to reveal the jade ring she'd lost during training camp.

"How is Rachel?" she asked, running her fingers over the cool stone.

Chloe shrugged. "Weirdly motivated lately. No clue why."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly before her expression sobered. "Tell me honestly—do you really believe Winifred committed suicide?"

Chloe stiffened. "Why ask now?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered like trapped butterflies. "It doesn't add up. She wasn't the type."

After a heavy pause, Chloe admitted, "When Mr. Goldmann ordered the investigation, I thought the same. We confiscated all her belongings during detention—there was no way she had a blade in that interrogation room."

Evelyn leaned forward. "Did you find anything conclusive?"
###Chapter 317

Evelyn shook her head. "No. Everyone who saw Winifred said she was fine. No one knew how she got the knife."

"Wasn't there a guard?"

"No."

Evelyn had her answer, and her mind raced. Someone must have slipped into the interrogation room without supervision.

Seeing her still troubled, Chloe smiled reassuringly. "Relax, Zoe. We’ll handle it."

Once Chloe left, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, picking up the shattered jade ring. Though she suspected Rosalind had damaged it, Nathan had given it to her—so she resolved to restore it.

That evening, Evelyn headed to the underground garage. Just as she reached her car, a figure stepped into her space. She instinctively raised her hand, only to be swiftly pinned against the car by a familiar grip.

Nathan smirked. "Trying to ambush me?"

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "You’re the one sneaking up on me."

He dipped his head, brushing his lips against hers, amusement in his eyes. "What kind of spell did you cast? It’s only been a day, and I already missed you."

He had seen their names trending together all day—finally, they were publicly acknowledged as fiancés.

Evelyn pushed him lightly. "Stop fooling around. Someone might see."

"Nobody’s here." Nathan took her hand, his gaze landing on the repaired jade ring. Surprise flickered across his face.

"Zoe, you didn’t—"

He hadn’t expected her to fix it. Though altered from its original form, the restoration was flawless.

Pride swelled in his chest.

Evelyn turned her face away, feigning annoyance. "Even if I didn’t like that someone else wore it first, you bought it for me. I had to keep it."

Nathan’s expression softened. He tilted her chin up. "Next time, I’ll get you one only you’ll wear."

She smirked, then remembered something. "Aren’t you worried your grandfather will be furious about the news?"

Theodore Goldmann disapproved of her ties to the de Armas family—hence Rosalind’s presence. Evelyn wasn’t a Luxe employee, yet Nathan had brought her to the meeting. If she knew Theodore, he was probably seething.

Nathan chuckled. "That’s what’s bothering you?"

Evelyn huffed. "I have enough problems. I don’t need another."

Their last confrontation with Theodore had already been tense.

Nathan scoffed, tracing the corner of her eye. "Since when does the Zoe I know back down from trouble?"

At the Goldmann Mansion

Theodore glowered at the untouched plates before the three children. "Have you forgotten how to eat without your father and grandfather here?"

Rosalind offered helpfully, "What would you like? I’ll serve you."

But as she handed a bowl to Daisy, the child "accidentally" knocked it over—scalding soup splashing onto Rosalind’s hand.

Mr. Chester gasped.

Theodore’s expression darkened. These children had been spoiled for too long. He snapped at Daisy, "Apologize to Aunt Rosalind!"
###Chapter 318

Daisy's eyes welled up with tears, but she remained silent.

Liam wrapped his arms around his little sister protectively, glaring at Theodore. "We don't want anything from this woman."

To the Vanderbilt children, anyone who threatened their mother's happiness was automatically the enemy.

Rosalind maintained her gracious smile despite the rejection. "It's quite alright, Mr. Goldmann. Please don't scold them on my account."

Her polite words masked the simmering resentment in her heart. These insolent children would learn their place soon enough.

Theodore slammed his fist on the table, the sudden noise making everyone jump. "I am not your doting grandfather! If your parents spoiled you rotten, I'll be the one to correct that behavior. Apologize to Miss Summers immediately!"

Caleb and Daisy flinched at his outburst but stood their ground, their small chins jutting out stubbornly.

Liam's voice cut through the tension like a knife. "We have nothing to apologize for."

Mr. Chester nearly choked on his own breath at the child's audacity.

Theodore's eyes widened in shock. This level of defiance from a child was unheard of in the Goldmann household. "No supper for any of you until you apologize!"

"Fine by us."

Without hesitation, Liam pushed back his chair and marched away, his siblings following close behind.

Watching Theodore's thunderous expression, Mr. Chester ventured carefully, "The children are just—"

"Spare me your excuses!" Theodore snapped. "Their behavior is unacceptable. Hunger will teach them manners."

Rosalind's eyes gleamed with barely concealed malice. Once she became Mrs. Goldmann, she'd make sure these brats regretted their insolence.

Later that night...

Theodore tossed and turned in his bed, unable to sleep. The children's defiance reminded him painfully of Nathan's stubbornness at their age.

Despite his anger, a nagging worry gnawed at him. The Vanderbilt children shared their father's iron will—would they really go hungry all night?

He threw off his covers and headed to check on them.

As he entered the living room, he noticed light spilling from the kitchen. Anger flared—had that soft-hearted butler disobeyed his orders?

What he saw when he entered the kitchen stopped him dead in his tracks.

Daisy and Caleb sat at the counter, rubbing sleep from their eyes while Liam stood on a step stool, expertly maneuvering a frying pan.

Theodore's jaw dropped. These children could cook?

Noticing his presence, Caleb and Daisy immediately sat up straighter.

"What," Theodore demanded, "do you think you're doing?"

Caleb turned with a cheeky grin. "What does it look like? Making midnight snacks."

Theodore's voice turned stern. "At your age? Who taught you this?"

The thought of children handling hot stoves sent a chill down his spine. What was Nathan thinking allowing this?

Daisy piped up proudly, "Liam's been cooking since he was four and a half. He's amazing at it!"

Liam calmly turned off the burner, his movements precise and practiced. The aroma of perfectly cooked spaghetti filled the kitchen, making his siblings' stomachs growl audibly.

They'd planned to sneak a meal, never expecting to get caught by the family patriarch.

Theodore examined the perfectly al dente pasta with growing astonishment. His gaze lingered on Liam—this child was different. The quiet intensity in his eyes, the way he carried himself... it reminded Theodore uncannily of his younger self.
###Chapter 319

Liam was destined for greatness.

The rich aroma of spaghetti wafted through the air, making the elderly gentleman's stomach growl.

Daisy noticed immediately. She carried her plate over with wide, innocent eyes. "Great-grandpa, would you like some?"

Theodore froze. He'd scolded this child just hours ago, yet here she was offering to share her meal?

Pride made him clear his throat and turn away. "Don't think this small gesture will make me forgive you."

Daisy's face fell as she withdrew her plate. "We know you don't love us."

The old man's eyes widened. "Who said such nonsense?"

"There's more in the kitchen if you want it. Your choice." Liam's interruption left Theodore speechless.

Had age weakened his authority? How had these children so easily dismantled his fearsome reputation?

Theodore grabbed a plate. He needed to taste Liam's cooking. It wasn't often he shared a peaceful meal with the children.

The first bite silenced him completely.

Daisy beamed, eyes sparkling. "Isn't my brother's spaghetti amazing?"

"Hmph. Who taught you to cook? It's... adequate."

"Mommy." Liam's simple answer made Theodore's hand tremble. Suddenly the food lost its appeal.

"That woman taught him?"

He set down his fork with a clatter. "What kind of mother lets children cook at your age? First she fails at parenting, now she encourages this recklessness."

"You have no idea what she endured for us!" Liam's voice cracked with emotion.

Daisy pouted. "Mommy raised us alone overseas. She worked so hard to feed us. Shouldn't we help her?"

"She was alone abroad?" Theodore's eyebrows shot up. He knew nothing of Evelyn and the children's past.

Caleb nodded solemnly. "No one helped when she was pregnant. She suffered everything alone."

Daisy added softly, "No one can replace Mommy in our hearts. She comes first, then Daddy."

Theodore fell silent.

Abandoning his meal, he retreated to his chambers.

The children's bond with their mother was unbreakable. Having been by Evelyn's side since birth, their loyalty ran deep.

Pity their mother was a Vanderbilt. He'd never allow his grandson to become that family's pawn.

The three exchanged glances. Their great-grandfather had clearly stopped listening. No amount of persuasion would change his mind.

The next morning...

Mr. Chester escorted Liam and Daisy to the front gates. They waved from the car window. "Bye, Liam!"

Liam waved back.

With his filming complete, he'd be staying home for now.

As he turned to re-enter the mansion, he collided with Rosalind exiting the building.

Though Rosalind despised the children, Theodore's presence kept her in check. They were just kids - she could handle them easily.
###Chapter 320

Rosalind smiled coyly and stepped closer to him. "Liam, weren't you supposed to be out with your sister today?"

The little boy's icy glare stopped her in her tracks. As he brushed past, his voice dripped with contempt. "Stop pretending."

"Even if you poison Great-grandpa Theodore's mind, you'll never replace Mommy."

Rosalind froze. Her fingers curled into tight fists as she watched the five-year-old ascend the stairs. How did this child see through her schemes? Those piercing eyes held unsettling intelligence for his age.

Her nails dug deeper into her palms. These Vanderbilt brats were just like their mother - infuriatingly perceptive.

A vibration in her pocket interrupted her thoughts. The unknown number displayed a chilling message:

[You promised to extract me from the Underground Freeway. I've told you everything. When do I get my freedom?]

Rosalind's lips curled. Vivian. She'd almost forgotten about this disposable weapon in her arsenal.

Flashback to three days prior:

Vivian stumbled toward the parked black sedan on South Street, her ragged breaths fogging the chilly air. The tinted window descended to reveal Rosalind's masked face.

"I've honored my word," Rosalind purred. "Now it's your turn."

Vivian's calculating gaze assessed the mysterious benefactor. "What should I call you?"

"Lady Wolfsbane will suffice."

"Very well, Lady Wolfsbane." Vivian's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Consider me at your service."

Rosalind's laughter held no warmth. "All I require is Evelyn Vanderbilt's permanent removal."

Vivian's eyebrow arched. "What's your grudge against her?"

"She stole what was rightfully mine." Rosalind's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "She needs to disappear."

The confirmation of mutual hatred satisfied Vivian. "Then we understand each other. That gold-digging socialite's days are numbered."

Present day:

Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch for the third time. The private dining room at Le Cirque remained conspicuously empty.

Gregory sighed. "It's 9:45. Should we assume Mr. Boucher isn't coming?"

Evelyn smoothed her Valentino dress. "Celebrities keep their own schedules." She wouldn't have requested this meeting if not for Adrian Boucher's unexpected kindness during the Viana Jewelry crisis.

The door burst open. "Mommy!"

Daisy's tiny arms wrapped around Evelyn's knees before she could rise. The scent of strawberry shampoo filled the air as Evelyn showered kisses on her daughter's forehead. "My precious girl, I've missed you so much."

Daisy's lower lip trembled. "Great-grandpa Theodore's being mean! He yelled at us and wants Daddy to marry that scary lady!" Her whisper carried childlike urgency. "Liam says she's putting bad thoughts in Great-grandpa's head to make him hate you!"

Evelyn's champagne flute clattered against the table. The room seemed to tilt as her daughter's words painted a terrifying picture. Theodore Goldmann wasn't just disapproving - he was being manipulated.

And Rosalind Summers had just crossed a line no one could uncross.
###Chapter 321

Evelyn knew the three children had no reason to lie. She was well aware that Rosalind was a hypocrite. Since Theodore trusted Rosalind so blindly, it would be effortless for her to drive a wedge between them.

Before she could ask further, Adrian appeared at the door with his two assistants.

Daisy rushed forward and tugged at Adrian's sleeve. "Uncle Adrian! Come meet my mommy!"

But Adrian had already been briefed about the situation.

He smiled warmly at Daisy and ruffled her hair before turning to Evelyn. "I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long."

Evelyn returned his smile. "We just arrived ourselves."

Once seated, Daisy immediately claimed the chair beside Evelyn. Today, her mother belonged solely to her, and she'd make sure her brothers got their fair share of attention too.

"Liam mentioned you've been looking after them on set, Mr. Boucher. I hope they haven't been too much trouble."

Daisy puffed out her cheeks indignantly. "I never cause trouble for Uncle Adrian!"

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll.

'Could've fooled me,' she thought wryly.

Adrian chuckled. "They're delightful company – clever and full of energy. I've grown quite fond of them."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Actually, I wanted to thank you for promoting Soul Jewelry's collection. Without your endorsement, we wouldn't have achieved such success. Consider this dinner my way of showing gratitude."

Adrian leaned back, steepling his fingers beneath his chin as he studied her. "Just one dinner?"

"Pardon?" Evelyn blinked.

'Should I offer two dinners instead?' she wondered.

Amused by her puzzled expression, Adrian smirked. "If you're repaying favors, don't bother spending your own money. Nathan owes me one too – let's charge it to his account."

Evelyn's smile turned strained.

'Nothing like friends throwing each other under the bus,' she mused.

When the food arrived, Evelyn found herself relaxing. Despite Adrian's elite background and A-list celebrity status, he was surprisingly down-to-earth with an easygoing charm.

Their conversation turned to Felix, prompting Evelyn's curiosity. "By the way, why is Felix attending the training camp?"

Adrian's expression turned wry. "So you've met my cousin. He's my uncle's son – the family black sheep. My uncle hoped military discipline might curb his... carefree lifestyle."

Evelyn nodded understandingly. Felix did radiate that irresponsible playboy aura.

"He's the one who called me after your viper bite. That's how Professor Lennox and I reached the camp so quickly."

Evelyn froze.

'They were my rescuers?'

"Mommy!" Daisy's voice trembled. "You got bitten by a snake?"

"Why didn't you tell me?" Her lower lip quivered dangerously.

Evelyn hastily shoved fries into Daisy's hands as distraction.

Gregory looked equally shocked – he'd known nothing about the camp incident. A viper bite? That was terrifyingly dangerous.

After dinner, they descended to the parking garage. Evelyn knelt before Daisy, pressing a kiss to her cheek. "Be good on set, sweetheart."

Daisy nodded solemnly. "Promise."

Standing, Evelyn handed Daisy to Angela, who guided the girl into Adrian's car.

"Take care of yourself," Evelyn said.

Adrian, standing beside her, suddenly chuckled. "Don't look back. Just get in your car. Now."
###Chapter 322

Evelyn froze for a split second at Adrian's words. Then, the realization hit her like a bolt of lightning.

Someone was lurking in the shadows, snapping photos of them.

She didn’t turn around. Instead, she walked calmly to her car with Gregory, just as they had anticipated. The moment they parted ways was captured by the hidden paparazzo.

The photographer licked his lips as he scrolled through the shots on his camera. A smug grin spread across his face.

These photos would be explosive. The editor-in-chief would definitely reward him handsomely.

Back at Soul, Evelyn suddenly remembered something and turned to Gregory. "Uncle Gregory, keep an eye on the news for me these next few days."

"News? Why?"

"Yes. Adrian warned me there were paparazzi nearby. They probably got pictures of us."

Truthfully, Evelyn wasn’t worried about the rumors they might spin about her and Adrian. She just didn’t want her daughter dragged into the spotlight. The last thing she needed was for Daisy to face internet vitriol at such a young age.

Gregory nodded. "Consider it done."

The moment she stepped into her office, strong arms wrapped around her from behind, pulling her into a tight embrace. The door clicked shut as Nathan leaned against it, his gaze darkening as he looked down at her. "Where have you been this time? Care to explain?"

Evelyn didn’t even need to turn around to know who it was. A helpless smile tugged at her lips. "I just had lunch with Adrian."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. "Lunch with Adrian?"

"Yes. I wanted to thank him for his help," she replied, tilting her head up to meet his gaze. "Sir, you’re the CEO of Luxe. Aren’t you worried about the gossip if you keep showing up at my studio every day?"

He leaned in, pressing his forehead against hers. "Do you really think anyone would dare talk about me behind my back?" His voice dropped lower. "Besides, I own Luxe. I go wherever I please. Even if I come to see my sugar baby every day, no one’s going to say a word."

Evelyn fought the urge to roll her eyes.

If I’m the sugar baby, then what does that make you? A trophy boyfriend? With that face of yours?

She studied his features—sharp jawline, piercing eyes, lips that always seemed to smirk at the most inconvenient times.

If she were a wealthy woman looking for a kept man, she’d pick him without hesitation.

Her fingers lifted his chin, her smile turning playful. "Then I suppose spending a night with you would cost a fortune, wouldn’t it, Mr. Goldmann?"

Nathan’s lips curved as he closed the distance between them. "Don’t worry. I’ll cover the rest of the bill."

Before she could respond, his mouth crashed onto hers. The heat in his gaze was undeniable, and Evelyn knew she should stop him—but she didn’t.

Every time footsteps echoed outside the door, her heart skipped a beat, terrified someone might knock.

Meanwhile, Rosalind strode into the administrative office, knocking sharply. When no one answered, she pushed the door open—only to find Nathan missing.

She stopped a passing employee. "Where’s Nathan?"

The woman smiled knowingly. "If Mr. Goldmann isn’t here, try the 16th floor."

Everyone in the office knew exactly where Nathan disappeared to these days.

The 16th floor? That’s where Evelyn’s studio is.

Rosalind’s expression darkened. She spun on her heel and marched toward the elevator.

Stepping onto the 16th floor, she approached the receptionist. "Is Nathan here?"

The woman hesitated before nodding. "Yes. Mr. Goldmann has been in Ms. Zara’s office."

Rosalind’s nails dug into her palms as she stormed toward Evelyn’s office. The thought of them together made her blood boil.

Titus had placed her beside Nathan for a reason—to drive them apart.

Just as she raised her hand to knock, a muffled sound from inside made her freeze.
###Chapter 323

"Ouch! That hurts, Nathan. Can't you be more gentle?"

"My apologies. I'll adjust my touch."

Rosalind's expression darkened instantly.

How... How shameless! Doing something so intimate in the office? Evelyn, you truly are a wicked temptress!

Blinded by fury, she shoved the door open—only to freeze in shock.

Evelyn sat on the couch while Nathan knelt before her, carefully massaging her ankle.

Nathan turned his head, his gaze sharp as ice. "Did knocking escape your manners?"

Rosalind stiffened, her face flushing. "I—I thought something was wrong in here."

Evelyn's cheeks burned with embarrassment.

Thank goodness he didn’t take too long this time. Otherwise, I’d need to dig a hole and disappear into it.

"And if something were happening here," Nathan said coldly, "what concern is it of yours? Unless you have business, get out."

Rosalind hadn’t expected to be dismissed so harshly—again. She bit her lip, shooting Evelyn a lingering glare before storming out.

Evelyn sighed, nudging Nathan lightly. "Must you be so cruel? She’ll probably cry over this."

Nathan lifted his gaze, fingers tightening abruptly around her ankle.

"Ah—!" She yanked her foot back, wincing. "Nathan Goldmann, that hurt! No more massages for you!"

He braced an arm on the couch behind her, leaning in. "Why should I care if she cries? She’s not my woman."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

With Nathan, indifference was a privilege—he only bothered with those who mattered. She’d learned that the hard way. Still, she couldn’t help but tease.

"True, but wasn’t Vivian technically your woman too? Why didn’t you—"

"Evelyn." His voice dropped dangerously. "Mention her again, and I’ll ensure you don’t leave this bed tomorrow."

#AdrianBoucher Spotted with Mystery Woman#

As predicted, the headline dominated Google Trends. Given Adrian’s A-list status, it skyrocketed to the top search.

Evelyn scrolled through the article on her tablet. The paparazzi’s angle made their interaction look far more intimate than it had been.

The only saving grace? She’d been kissing Daisy in that moment. The photo had conveniently obscured her daughter’s face.

Gregory chuckled at her tense expression. "Relax. The comments aren’t even about the kid. Most of them are just... oddly supportive."

Adrian’s fans had flooded his social media.

#Adrian’sBiggestFan: Bro, stop lurking in shadows. Just announce it already. We’re begging.#

#LoveIsBlind @AdrianOfficial: [Crying] Is she your girlfriend? At this point, we’re just worried you’ll die alone.#

#RosalindWho: LMAO. Expected a fan war, got a marriage petition instead. Never change, Boucher stans.#

#AdrianOrBust: Honestly? We’ve given up. If she’s breathing, we approve.#

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. Adrian’s fanbase was... unique.

In his office, Nathan’s scowl deepened as he skimmed the trending scandal.

Those paparazzi have a death wish.

Spreading rumors about his woman and the Bouchers? Unforgivable.

Just then, Theodore’s booming voice echoed outside. "Is that stubborn grandson of mine refusing to see me again?"
###Chapter 324

Nathan frowned. He had anticipated Theodore Goldmann's arrival today—that was precisely why he'd instructed the receptionist to claim he wasn't in the office. Yet here the old man was, barging straight into his private space.

The door swung open with force. Theodore stood there, his expression thunderous. "Hmph! What's this? Cutting off your own grandfather now?"

Nathan lowered his legs from the desk, set his phone aside, and leaned back in his chair. His voice was ice. "You know I wouldn't."

"Wouldn't you?" Theodore's face darkened further. "You refuse to step foot in the mansion because of that woman, and now you dare claim loyalty?"

A cold smirk curled Nathan's lips. "If I recall correctly, you were the one who threw me out. If my presence disgusts you so much, why demand I return?"

"Nathan!" Theodore's grip tightened on his cane. "That Vanderbilt girl has poisoned your mind. Do you think I didn't recognize her in those photos? Sneaking Daisy off to meet Adrian Boucher—what was she thinking?"

His opinion of Evelyn had plummeted further.

Even if the meeting was innocent, how reckless to be photographed with another man while married to a Goldmann! The internet was already ablaze with speculation. Did she care nothing for the family's reputation?

Nathan's smirk didn't waver. "I knew about the meeting. And if you'd bothered to look closely, you'd see half a dozen staff members in the background."

"Theodore." Nathan exhaled sharply. "You've never interfered in my life before. Why this obsession with tearing me away from Evelyn? There are countless women in the world—why must you fixate on her?"

His grandfather's jaw clenched. "You know what the de Armas did to us. I won't watch history repeat itself—won't let you become their pawn like your mother did!"

Nathan shot to his feet, his chair slamming against the wall. "Don't you dare speak of her!"

Theodore froze. The fury in Nathan's eyes was volcanic.

The older man's voice softened. "We tried to save her, Nathan. By the time we got the tip—"

"Save your excuses." Nathan's laugh was bitter. "You never approved of Mother's career. Your spies blanket Stoslo—yet you expect me to believe you 'didn't know' she'd been missing for twenty-four hours?" His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Or did you simply not care?"

Theodore paled. This wound had festered for fifteen years.

Nathan had been seventeen when his mother, Victoria Knowles, traveled to Stoslo for Fashion Week. It was her final public appearance before her tragic death.

Theodore struggled to maintain composure. "But it was the de Armas who kidnapped her!"

"And I blame you more."

This was why Nathan had refused to inherit Night Banquet. The organization that had failed his mother didn't deserve his loyalty.

Their negligence made them complicit in her murder.

Theodore looked stricken. When he finally spoke, his voice was hollow. "I won't pretend we were perfect. But we searched every corner of that city. The trail went cold too quickly."

Nathan turned away. He was done with explanations.

Outside the door, Rosalind Summers stood frozen. The revelations about Victoria's death drained the color from her face—and a terrible realization took root in her gut.
###Chapter 325

The office remained thick with tension long after Elder Master Goldmann's departure. Nathan pulled a cigarette pack from his desk drawer.

He hadn’t smoked in ages, yet an inexplicable craving seized him.

Placing the cigarette between his lips, he flicked the lighter open and inhaled deeply.

Standing before the floor-to-ceiling window, he exhaled a slow stream of smoke, watching it curl into the air.

His fingers tightened around the cigarette.

The hatred he harbored for those responsible for his mother’s death was bone-deep.

Yet, if not for his great-grandfather’s actions, she might never have been dragged into that nightmare.

Even if the de Armas were the masterminds, Evelyn had no part in it.

Lost in thought, he barely noticed the cigarette burning down to his fingertips.

He tapped the ashes into the tray, deciding this secret would stay buried—Evelyn must never know.

Rosalind splashed cold water on her face in the restroom, trying to steady her racing heart.

No one knew the truth of that night.

As long as she stayed silent, it would remain hidden forever.

She had no connection to it—none at all.

"Help me!"

The memory flashed before her eyes, vivid as yesterday.

Victoria’s desperate plea, the two men dragging her away, the distinct tattoos on their hands—she remembered everything.

It had been his people.

Rosalind had been there. She could have intervened.

But fear had paralyzed her.

Fear of expulsion from the Night Banquet. Fear of Theodore and Nathan’s disappointment.

So she lied.

And because of that lie, Victoria was lost forever.

That man had found her afterward.

His voice slithered into her mind like poison. "You saw everything, didn’t you, Rosalind? But it doesn’t matter. Without your silence, we wouldn’t have succeeded."

Her reflection in the mirror was ghostly pale.

A sudden touch on her shoulder made her jolt.

The female staff member recoiled at her reaction. "Ms. Summers, are you alright?"

Rosalind forced a brittle smile. "Just a bit lightheaded. I’m fine now."

Stepping out, her eyes darkened with resolve.

Nathan’s hatred for his mother’s killers was absolute.

No one could ever discover her role in it.

Victoria’s death had nothing to do with me. If the world blames the de Armas, then let them.

#BREAKING: Evelyn Vanderbilt, Nathan Goldmann’s fiancée, identified as the mystery woman seen with Adrian Boucher.

#EXCLUSIVE: Sources reveal Evelyn Vanderbilt is Zara, the elite jewelry designer. Whispers of illegitimate children surface—father’s identity unknown.

By afternoon, the internet exploded again.

Sharp-eyed netizens recognized the child in the photos as the girl who played Adrian’s daughter in the show.

Some claimed the twins were Evelyn’s.

Speculations about the father ran wild. Many believed Nathan had secretly fathered them, pointing to his past sightings with the children.

But skeptics flooded Liam and Daisy’s social media with venom.

#Fatherless kids? How tragic.

#Not Mr. Goldmann’s. He’s never confirmed having children. Probably some random guy’s, and now she’s pinning it on Adrian.
###Chapter 326

The screen glared back at Evelyn with venomous words:

#I heard the mother of those two kids is a gold-digging slut who had them out of wedlock. And Nathan Goldmann wants to be with trash like that?

#She’s using her kids to latch onto Adrian Boucher for clout. Disgusting! Get out of Cornelia, you don’t deserve either Adrian or Nathan!

Evelyn’s fingers trembled as she scrolled through the hateful comments targeting her children. Her chest tightened, a cold fury settling in her bones.

Gregory noticed her expression darken. "Zoe, these are just paid trolls. Look—all anonymous accounts."

"Can you trace them?" Her voice was dangerously low.

Gregory nodded. "I’ll do my best."

The moment he left, Evelyn clenched her fists so hard her nails bit into her palms.

Whoever did this will pay.

In a dim internet café, Vivian smirked as she transferred another batch of payments to the hired trolls.

She had spent nearly $50,000 so far, but it was worth it.

Watching the online mob tear into Liam and Daisy filled her with vicious satisfaction.

Let those little brats drown in the hate. Evelyn deserves to suffer.

By morning, Liam and Daisy’s names were trending.

The internet had split into warring factions—some defending the children, others spewing vitriol. Even Adrian Boucher’s fanbase fractured under the chaos.

Nathan slammed his tablet onto the desk and grabbed his phone. "Take down those trending tags. Call every major media outlet—I’m making an announcement."

That evening, as Liam and Daisy stepped out of the studio, a mob descended.

Angela and the bodyguards shielded them, but the crowd screamed:

"You little bastards! Go to hell!"

"Your whore mother thinks she can trap Adrian with you? Quit acting!"

Angela snarled, "You sick freaks! How dare you say that to kids?"

Liam pulled Daisy close, his small frame rigid with fury.

Then—a water bottle hurtled toward them.

Evelyn lunged, shielding them. The bottle struck her back with a hollow thud.

"Mommy!" Liam’s eyes burned with rage.

She smoothed their hair. "Stay here."

Then she turned, grabbed the woman who threw it, and slammed her to the ground.

Silence.

Evelyn’s voice cut like ice. "Choose: hospital or police station?"

The bodyguards cracked their knuckles.

The crowd scattered, hurling curses over their shoulders.

Evelyn dropped to her knees, pulling Liam and Daisy into a tight embrace. "Are you okay?"

Liam touched her back gently. "Mommy… does it hurt?"

Her heart shattered.

Maybe I never should’ve let them into this world.
###Chapter 327

"Did it hurt badly?"

Evelyn froze, an unexpected sting prickling behind her eyes. She rose abruptly, swallowing the lump in her throat. "I'm fine. Your safety is all that matters to me."

Angela's jaw tightened. "These lunatics had the audacity to pose as Mr. Boucher's fans while attacking children." She knew genuine Adrian Boucher fans would never stoop to such depravity, despite their notorious online behavior.

Evelyn offered a tired smile. "Thank you for handling them. I'll take it from here."

Angela nodded in relief.

At Blue Bay Villa—

The change of scenery worked wonders. Liam and Daisy buzzed with excitement, their earlier ordeal seemingly forgotten. "Mommy, look! We can see the ocean from our balcony!" Daisy squealed, pressing her tiny hands against the glass.

Their previous beach house had been miles from actual shoreline. Watching her daughter's delight, Evelyn set down her purse and gathered both children in a tight embrace. "If you love it here, we'll extend our stay."

Her chest eased seeing their radiant smiles.

Liam turned with startling maturity. "Don't worry about us, Mommy. We'll be good."

The words twisted Evelyn's heart. His premature wisdom always cut deeper than any complaint.

"Daddy hasn't come home yet." Daisy's innocent observation made Evelyn's hands still mid-motion.

'Nathan always rushes back when free...' She forced a smile. "Daddy's busy today. Let me make your favorite pasta."

She ruffled their hair before retreating to the kitchen, rolling up her sleeves like armor.

—

Moonlight silvered the villa when Nathan finally returned. Expecting silence, he instead found Evelyn mid-dress change, the lurid bruise marring her back stopping him dead.

"You're back." She startled, hastily pulling on a silk robe.

Nathan crossed the room in three strides, fingers hovering over the injury. "What happened?"

"Just bumped into something." She shrugged, then narrowed her eyes. "The children are here. Behave."

His response was to bury his face in the curve of her neck. "Soundproofing here is excellent."

Evelyn shivered, shoving at his chest. "You incorrigible—"

Morning brought a very public appearance at Goldmann Group. A junior executive approached nervously. "Sir, the press conference is ready."

"Press conference?" Evelyn shot Nathan a questioning look.

He laced their fingers together. "After yesterday's online attacks, it's time the world knows about our children."

Her breath caught.

'Is this his way of protecting them?'

The conference room buzzed with journalists. Cameras whirred to life as a poised reporter began: "Mr. Goldmann, regarding recent allegations about Ms. Vanderbilt's out-of-wedlock pregnancy..."
###Chapter 328

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, his expression unreadable. "It's true," he admitted, his voice steady. "But this burden is mine to bear. Had I known she was pregnant back then, I would never have let her walk away."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Is Nathan really taking responsibility for what happened six years ago? He didn't even know me back then...

The female reporter pressed on. "So, have the two of you ever dated?"

Nathan's fingers intertwined with Evelyn's, his lips curving into a confident smile. "We never had the chance to date properly, but I fell for Zoe the moment I saw her. She's the only woman for me."

Thump. Thump.

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

The reporter's eyes gleamed with curiosity. "Does that mean the children are yours?"

Nathan's grip on Evelyn's hand tightened. "Yes, but you're mistaken. There aren't just two—Zoe has given me three beautiful children."

The reporter blinked in surprise. "Why keep it a secret until now?"

Nathan's tone turned firm. "Because we wanted to protect them from unnecessary scrutiny. I won't tolerate anyone slandering my wife or my children online."

The reporter hesitated before asking, "But you two aren't married yet, are you?"

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "We've already set a date. We simply chose to keep it private. I expect the media to respect our boundaries."

The live broadcast ended, sparking a wave of sympathy across social media. Netizens rallied behind Evelyn, condemning the harassment she and the children had endured. Even the viral clip of Evelyn slapping the fan resurfaced, drawing heated debates.

Back at Soul Jewelry Studio, Gregory approached Evelyn with a tablet. "Zoe, I've identified the ringleaders of the hate group. They've organized over a thousand members."

Evelyn accepted the tablet with a grateful smile. "Thank you, Uncle Gregory. I'll handle the rest."

Once alone, Evelyn scrolled through the list of names before forwarding it to Edmund. Within minutes, he traced every IP address, attaching detailed personal information.

Evelyn drove to an internet café near Nancy Street. The manager frowned when she asked, "Does a young man named Tyler Lawrence frequent this place?"

"Tyler? That troublemaker?" The manager scoffed. "He's usually here causing problems. Who's asking?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I'm his cousin."

The manager's expression shifted. This delinquent has a cousin like her?

"He's not here today," he admitted. "Probably at the arcade across the street."

Evelyn thanked him and crossed the road.

Two teenagers with dyed hair stumbled out of the arcade, laughing.

Evelyn stepped in their path.

They blinked at her. "You talking to us?"

Did a goddess just stop us?

Evelyn tilted her head. "Do you know Tyler Lawrence?"

The blond one stiffened. "I'm Tyler. What do you want?"

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "So, you're the admin of that hate group?"
###Chapter 329

Tyler's face paled instantly.

"I'm the mother of the children your hate group tormented. I finally tracked you down."

Evelyn arched a brow.

Tyler spun on his heel to flee, but her fingers clamped around his wrist like steel. She barely applied pressure, yet he howled. "Ah—stop! It hurts!"

His friend froze, gaping as Tyler crumpled under her grip.

"I—I swear, I'm just the admin! They were the hired ones! This isn't on me!" Tyler whimpered, his arm throbbing.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "You led them. That makes you most accountable. Fair, no?"

He choked on his breath, pain silencing him.

"Name your employer, and I’ll release you."

"I don’t know! But I can ask! The mods might—"

She loosened her hold.

Clutching his arm, Tyler fumbled for his phone and frantically messaged his contacts.

A ping. Multiple replies flooded in. He handed it over with a shaky breath.

Evelyn skimmed the chat. One response stood out: "Some Vanderbilt woman hired us. First name’s fuzzy—Vivian? Did she rat us out?"

Her lips curled.

Vivian.

She tossed the phone back. "Lure her out. Now."

Tyler gulped. "W-What’s your plan?"

Evelyn patted his shoulder, smiling sweetly. "Forward every chat with her. Then set a meetup. Don’t worry—I’ll cover your losses."

Twenty minutes later, Vivian stormed into the alley, suspicion flickering as she eyed the lone figure. Recognition struck like lightning.

"Evelyn Vanderbilt?" Her snarl dripped venom. "You scheming witch!"

Evelyn turned, unfazed. "I arranged this reunion. Surprised?"

Vivian trembled—then scoffed. "Miss me that much? Or still crying over your brats getting roasted online?"

Evelyn’s voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Say that again."

"Gladly! Those little bastards—"

Crack!

The slap sent Vivian crashing into the wall. She clutched her burning cheek, eyes blazing. "You dare—?"

She lunged, nails aimed for Evelyn’s face—only to be slammed onto the pavement.

Evelyn yanked her up by the hair, their noses inches apart. "Your mother’s rotting in jail for murder. Half a month since I last educated you, and you’re still this stupid?"

Vivian spat through gritted teeth. "Because of you! I was sold to the Underground Freeway—forced into that life! You ruined me!"
###Chapter 330

"Everything is ruined because of Evelyn. None of this would have happened if she'd just stayed away from Zlokova!"

Evelyn's expression darkened, shadows swirling in her stormy gray eyes. "Don't blame me for your mistakes. You dug your own grave when you decided to hurt innocent people. If you're bold enough to play with fire, at least have the spine to face the consequences."

She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Listen carefully, Vivian. If you don't start valuing what little humanity you have left, I'll make sure your life becomes a living hell."

With a sharp push, Evelyn sent Vivian sprawling onto the cold marble floor.

Vivian's once-perfect hair now tangled around her tear-streaked face, her designer dress ripped at the seams. She clawed at the ground, shooting Evelyn a venomous glare. "You think this ends with me? There are others who want you destroyed!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, lips pressed into a thin line.

Vivian's laughter rang hollow. "Someone far more powerful than me hates your guts. And they won't stop until you're crushed."

"Is that so?" Evelyn tilted her head, feigning curiosity. "Tell me, who's pulling your strings?"

Vivian's eyes darted away.

"Like I'd ever tell you anything!"

When Vivian remained silent, Evelyn didn't press further. Instead, she crouched down to eye level and flashed her phone screen. "Vivian Vanderbilt, you've run out of chances."

"W-What are you doing?" Vivian's face drained of color.

'Damn it! Is she leaking everything?'

Evelyn's smirk sent chills down Vivian's spine. "Your little hate group must be quite the spectacle. But why keep the fun to yourself? Let's share it with the world."

She tapped her phone and spoke calmly. "Gregory, release everything now."

"Evelyn, you bitch—" Vivian lunged, but Evelyn sidestepped effortlessly.

Watching Vivian collapse in a heap of designer fabric and smeared makeup, Evelyn offered a mock salute. "Enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame."

She turned on her heel without another glance.

Vivian's nails scraped against marble as she screamed at Evelyn's retreating back.

'This isn't over! I'll make you pay for this!'

The internet exploded when screenshots from the hate group flooded Twitter and Instagram.

@GraceGreen: These trolls deserve life in prison! #JusticeForKids

@VeronicaStyles: Paid bullies attacking children? Disgusting! #CancelHateGroups

@SimonBlake: So the rumors were true all along. #ExposeThemAll

@BiancaChase: Someone get the FBI involved ASAP.

Vivian's phone buzzed relentlessly with incoming calls. She answered one only to be met with furious shouting. "You stupid cow! Did you leak our private chats? Are you trying to get us all arrested?"

"Me? This is your fault!" Vivian shrieked. "Your pathetic security let them track everything!"

"Working with you was the worst mistake of my life!" The caller disconnected abruptly.

When Vivian saw the trending hashtag #HateGroupExposed, she hurled her phone against the wall, shattering it. "Evelyn Vanderbilt! I swear I'll destroy you!"

'How did she uncover everything so fast? Did Nathan help her?'

A cold dread settled in her stomach.

'If Nathan finds out I escaped...'

She couldn't go back to that nightmare. Desperate, she remembered her only lifeline—Lady Wolfsbane.

'She's my only hope now.'

Typing frantically, Vivian sent a distress message.

The reply came instantly, along with a $100,000 transfer.

Before Vivian could thank her, another message appeared: [This isn't charity. I need you to do something for me.]

At Soul Jewelry Studio...

Gregory rubbed his temples. "I suspected hired trolls, but Vivian? That's low even for her."
###Chapter 331

Evelyn had assumed that after everything that happened to Laura, Vivian would finally back off.

But clearly, she was wrong.

It had barely been two weeks, and Vivian was already stirring up trouble again.

Evelyn frowned, tapping her fingers against the desk. "I doubt Vivian will stop anytime soon. Uncle Gregory, could you ask Angela to keep a close watch on the kids?"

Right now, the children were her only concern.

Gregory nodded.

Alone in her office, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, lost in thought. Vivian had claimed Nathan sold her to the Underground Freeway. If that were true, how had she escaped from a place like that?

The answer, Evelyn realized, lay with Nathan.

She stood abruptly and headed for the administrative office.

Her knuckles rapped against the door—once, twice. No response. Just as she reached for the handle, a voice cut through the silence.

"Nathan is downstairs discussing a project with a client. What do you need him for?"

Evelyn turned, meeting Rosalind's cool gaze. She forced a smile. "Just here to invite my fiancé to lunch. But since he's busy, I'll wait for him in my office."

She turned to leave, but Rosalind's hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Ms. Vanderbilt, a moment of your time?"

Evelyn glanced at the fingers wrapped around her arm before nodding. "Of course."

Rosalind released her, stepping back. "Aren’t you curious about the history between the Goldmanns and the de Armas?"

They moved to the stairwell, the emergency exit door clicking shut behind them. Evelyn crossed her arms. "What exactly are you trying to tell me?"

Rosalind’s expression remained unreadable. "The reason the Goldmanns despise the de Armas is simple—they allied with the hypocrites of the royal left-wing faction. It’s not just dislike. It’s hatred. These families were always destined to be enemies."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "And what does that have to do with me?"

Rosalind stepped closer, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Don’t play dumb, Evelyn. Harrison de Arma is your grandfather. And your grandfather is the man who murdered Nathan’s mother."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "What?"

"You didn’t know?" Rosalind tilted her head. "Interesting. Nathan really kept you in the dark."

Long after Rosalind left, Evelyn remained in the stairwell, her heart sinking like a stone.

She knew Nathan’s mother had been kidnapped and killed. But she never imagined her own grandfather was responsible.

Why hadn’t Nathan or Gregory told her?

Given Rosalind’s nature, Evelyn knew this wasn’t out of kindness. Still, she needed to hear Nathan’s side.

Her phone buzzed sharply in her pocket.

She answered, and her face paled. Without returning to her office, she sprinted out.

The hospital corridor stretched before her, sterile and silent.

A doctor stepped out of a ward just as Evelyn arrived. She rushed forward. "How is my father?"

The doctor glanced at his chart. "You’re Richard Vanderbilt’s family?"

"Yes."

"He’s stable, but he suffered a severe blow to his cervical spine. We’ll need to keep him under observation for a few days."

Once the doctor left, Evelyn pushed open the door.

Richard lay on the bed, his face drawn with exhaustion.

She approached, her voice soft. "How are you feeling, Dad?"

He managed a weak smile. "I’m fine."

Her fingers curled into fists. "What happened?"

The injury wasn’t an accident. Someone had attacked him.

Richard hesitated, his gaze dropping.

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Dad, how long are you going to keep hiding things from me?"
###Chapter 332

"Zoe, Theodore didn't approve of your relationship with Nathan, did he?"

Evelyn froze, her gaze dropping to the floor.

Richard understood everything from her reaction. "It's because your mother was a de Arma, isn't it? The Goldmanns have always despised that family."

"Dad, who told you this?" Her voice came out sharper than intended.

Richard hesitated before speaking slowly. "Theodore himself. He demanded I tell you to stay away from Nathan. Claimed terrible things would happen if you remained together." His fingers tightened around the bedsheet. "After they left, a masked man attacked me at our doorstep. He threatened that if you didn't leave Mr. Goldmann—"

The words caught in his throat. He couldn't bring himself to finish. No father should have to force his daughter to abandon love.

Evelyn's jaw clenched. After a weighted silence, she stood abruptly. "Rest well, Dad. I'll visit tonight."

She strode from the ward, face set like stone.

Back at Soul Jewelry, she summoned Gregory to her office. Turning from the window, she spoke with chilling calm. "I'm merging Viana Jewelry with Soul. We're relocating headquarters there immediately."

Gregory blinked. "Immediately? But why the sudden move?"

A muscle twitched in Evelyn's cheek. "Father entrusted Viana to me. I won't disappoint him." Her fists clenched unconsciously at her sides.

The attacks on her children online. The ambush on her father. The pieces were falling into place with terrifying clarity.

She'd been present when Theodore called Nathan. Never had she imagined the old man would go this far to separate them.

In the executive office...

"She's moving Soul to Viana?" Nathan's pen stilled mid-signature as Gregory delivered the news.

Gregory nodded. "Apparently so. I assume Ms. Vanderbilt wants to expand operations. Viana's been underperforming lately..."

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. If Evelyn planned such a major move, why hadn't she discussed it with him personally?

As Gregory exited, Rosalind entered. "Nathan." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. She'd overheard everything—Vivian had earned her payment.

'Perfect,' she thought. 'Once that bitch leaves the city without Nathan's protection, eliminating her will be child's play.'

"The Eastern Inc. banquet tonight," Rosalind said smoothly. "Grandfather insists we attend together."

"Not interested," Nathan replied without looking up.

Rosalind's smile sharpened. "The current CEO was Madam Goldmann's personal manager. Grandfather thought you'd want to pay respects."

Nathan's shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly.

That evening, Evelyn brought the children to the hospital. Their arms overflowed with gifts—fruits, snacks, handmade cards.

Richard chuckled at their enthusiasm. "Your visit is present enough! Save these treats for yourselves."

Daisy approached the bedside with solemn concern. "Grandpa, who's feeding Rusty while you're here? Will he starve?" The horror in her voice suggested this was the gravest possible tragedy.

Richard ruffled her hair. "The automatic feeder will keep him full for days, sweetheart."

"Rusty?" Evelyn blinked.

Daisy's face lit up. "Grandpa's new puppy! He's got the fluffiest ears and waggiest tail!" Her hands demonstrated the wagging with enthusiastic sweeps.
###Chapter 333

Evelyn's lips curved into a gentle smile.

During her time at the training camp, Angela would occasionally bring the three little troublemakers to visit Richard. To her surprise, they had formed an unexpected bond with their grandfather - even adopting pets together.

Caleb, Liam and Daisy were playing nearby. Richard observed Evelyn sitting quietly by his bedside. "Zoe," he said softly, "don't worry about me. If you and Mr. Goldmann truly love each other, I won't stand in your way."

Evelyn bit her lower lip before responding, "Please don't concern yourself with me, Dad. Actually, I've been considering merging Soul Jewelry Studio with Viana Jewelry to create Soul Jewelry. What are your thoughts?"

Richard appeared momentarily stunned that she sought his opinion. After a brief pause, he replied, "The decision is yours. Viana was your mother's legacy. I entrusted it to you, so you have full authority."

After spending quality time with her father, Evelyn returned with the children to their villa at Blue Bay.

During dinner, Caleb scooted closer to Evelyn. "Mommy," he asked with wide eyes, "is Daddy coming home for dinner tonight?"

Daisy chimed in, "Daddy missed dinner yesterday too."

Evelyn simply lifted her gaze from her plate. "Your father has important work commitments," she explained gently. "We need to be understanding."

The trio exchanged glances but remained silent.

That evening, Evelyn sat on the edge of their beds, reading bedtime stories. Once their breathing became steady with sleep, she carefully closed the book and placed it on the nightstand. After adjusting their blankets, she quietly turned off the lights.

Instead of retiring to bed after her shower, Evelyn found herself drawn to the floor-to-ceiling windows. She gazed at the moonlit landscape, lost in thought.

Suddenly, strong arms encircled her waist, pulling her against a familiar warmth. Nathan's deep voice murmured near her ear, "Why are you still awake?"

Evelyn remained silent, her body tense.

"Zoe?" When she didn't respond, Nathan nuzzled against her neck, his breath warm against her skin.

Evelyn instinctively pulled away, catching the faint scent of alcohol. "You've been drinking?"

Nathan chuckled softly. "The CEO from Eastern Inc. hosted a dinner. I ran into an old acquaintance and had a few drinks." His hands settled on her slender waist. "Zoe, why the sudden decision to relocate your studio?"

Evelyn kept her eyes downcast. Instead of answering, she gently pushed him away. "It's late. We should sleep."

"Zoe—" Nathan tightened his grip, turning her to face him. "What's wrong?" His sharp eyes immediately detected her unusual behavior.

"Nothing," Evelyn replied tersely.

"Don't lie to me." Nathan's brow furrowed. He wasn't blind to her distress - it showed in every tense line of her body.

Finally, Evelyn met his gaze. "Nathan, if I told you my father was hospitalized because your grandfather wants to separate us, and he was beaten for interfering... would you believe me?"

Nathan's expression darkened.

After a weighted silence, he spoke carefully. "Zoe, I know my grandfather has a temper, but he would never harm innocent people."

"That's exactly what I thought." Evelyn's voice turned brittle. "If I'm Elder Master Goldmann's target, he should come after me directly. Why involve my father?"

Shrugging off his touch, Evelyn spoke with chilling calmness. "I understand your grandfather's rejection. But I can't risk my father getting hurt again." She turned away, avoiding his eyes. "We should take some time apart." Without waiting for a response, she slipped into bed, leaving Nathan standing alone in the moonlight.
###Chapter 334

Nathan stood motionless, his expression darkening by the second.

The following morning at the Goldmann estate...

Nathan strode into the grand living room where Theodore sat reading the morning paper. Without preamble, he demanded, "Did you visit Richard Vanderbilt yesterday?"

Theodore's newspaper crinkled as he lowered it, his lips curling in displeasure. "I merely had a conversation with him. What of it? Has Evelyn been complaining to you?"

"Then you had him followed?" Nathan's voice turned icy.

"Followed?" Theodore set the paper aside entirely, his bushy eyebrows drawing together. "Explain yourself."

He'd simply warned Richard about the consequences should Evelyn refuse to end things with his grandson. Standard procedure to eliminate potential threats.

But sending thugs? Never!

"After your little visit yesterday, Richard was brutally assaulted and hospitalized. Was that not your doing?" Nathan's knuckles whitened as he clenched his fists.

Theodore's face drained of color.

Someone had attacked Richard and framed him for it? The audacity!

"Absolutely not!" Theodore's cane struck the marble floor with a sharp crack. "If I wanted to teach that man a lesson, I'd do it openly, not through such cowardly means!"

This reeked of Vanderbilt scheming - turning his own grandson against him.

"Preposterous!" Theodore spat.

After a tense silence, Nathan chose to believe his grandfather. Theodore Goldmann didn't operate through back-alley beatings. But if not him... then who?

At Viana Jewelry Studio...

Evelyn froze mid-step when she entered her office to find Nathan waiting on her designer sofa. Her breath hitched before she schooled her features into careful neutrality.

"What are you doing here?" Her voice held practiced calm.

Nathan rose slowly, his tailored suit stretching across broad shoulders as he approached. "Zoe, I confronted my grandfather. It wasn't him."

Evelyn remained silent, her gaze fixed on the abstract painting behind him.

His hands gripped her shoulders gently but firmly. "You don't believe me?"

"I believe you," she murmured, still avoiding his piercing amber gaze. "But that changes nothing."

When she finally looked up, her eyes were hollow - a marionette going through motions. "Perhaps your grandfather's right about us."

"Evelyn Vanderbilt!" Nathan's roar shook the glass display cases. He only used her full name when pushed beyond limits.

Her indifference shattered his control. "I've told you before - even if the entire Goldmann family opposes us, I won't let you go. I'll get to the bottom of this."

"Isn't the de Arma family responsible for your mother's death?" The quiet question landed like a grenade.

Nathan recoiled as if struck.

His stunned expression confirmed everything Rosalind had revealed.

"Maybe we really shouldn't—"

"Enough!" Nathan crushed her against his chest, his heartbeat erratic against her cheek. "You're not leaving me. Not ever."

When she remained stiff in his arms, he realized his outburst had frightened her. His voice dropped to a rough whisper. "Trust me, Zoe."

Cradling her face, he forced her to meet his gaze. "The de Armas have nothing to do with you. I kept this from you because I wanted to protect you."

Evelyn's jaw tightened, her silence more painful than any words.

Nathan rested his forehead against hers, their breaths mingling. "Just... believe in me this once."

Against all logic, Evelyn felt her resolve crumbling. Like Gregory had advised - perhaps she should listen to her heart.

Her lashes fluttered shut as she whispered, "Okay. I trust you."
###Chapter 335

Nathan's eyes softened with warmth when Evelyn expressed her trust in him. He leaned in, his lips inches from hers.

Then, a sudden thought struck her. She pressed a hand against his chest, stopping him.

Nathan frowned, his gaze darkening. "What's wrong?"

"Did you have anything to do with Vivian being sent to the Underground Freeway?"

His grip tightened around her wrist. "She deserved it. I wouldn't have done it otherwise. Why?"

Evelyn's lips thinned. "Do you remember when Liam and Daisy were attacked online? She was behind it."

Nathan's expression turned icy. "You went to the Underground Freeway?"

Alone? His jaw clenched. What if something had happened to her?

Evelyn arched a brow. "She's not there anymore."

Nathan stiffened. "She escaped?"

"Exactly." Evelyn crossed her arms. "I asked Gregory to track the IP addresses of the trolls. One led me to Vivian. While questioning her, I suspected someone was helping her again."

Nathan pulled her into his arms, his voice low. "You went to another man for help instead of me?"

She hesitated. Truthfully, she didn’t know why she avoided relying on him.

"Zoe," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "I’m your husband. I’ll always stand by you. I just wish you’d trust me more."

Evelyn looped her arms around his neck, catching him off guard as she rose onto her toes and kissed him.

Her cheeks flushed as she pulled back. "I will. I promise."

Nathan’s breath hitched. Then, with a growl, he cupped the back of her head and claimed her lips in a searing kiss.

I can never get enough of her.

Rosalind stood outside the door, her back pressed against the wall. She had come to speak with Nathan but hadn’t expected this.

She bit her lip. Vivian was exposed already? Useless.

Since Evelyn hadn’t taken her earlier words seriously, Rosalind just needed to push harder.

Cyberbullying had backfired spectacularly—Liam and Daisy had gained fame instead. Not only were they starring in a show with Adrian Boucher, but their connection to the Goldmann family had also been revealed. Offers poured in, though their manager, Angela, had to decline most due to their age.

Now, Liam and Daisy sat in a dressing room, preparing for a commercial shoot for Gemini Reading Machine. Scripts in hand, they followed Angela and two bodyguards onto the set.

As Daisy passed a cluster of equipment, a heavy light fixture suddenly crashed toward her.

"Daisy!"

Angela yanked her aside just in time—but the fixture landed on Angela’s foot with a sickening crunch.

Daisy gasped, trying to help, but the bodyguards pulled her back.

"Get it off her!" Crew members rushed forward, lifting the fixture.

Angela’s face was pale, her foot fractured. She forced a weak smile. "I'm fine—"

Then she collapsed.

Amid the chaos, Liam slipped behind the equipment. His sharp eyes caught something suspicious—a loosened bolt on the stand.

Emperor Entertainment Inc.

"How could this happen on set?" Nathan’s voice was dangerously calm. "If anything had happened to them—who would answer for it?"
###Chapter 336

Ethan Lynch snatched up the ringing phone from Gemini Advertising Inc., his voice dripping with irritation. "Figure out who's responsible for the equipment, or don't bother calling back."

He slammed the phone down. The situation was already clear.

Angela had been injured and rushed to the hospital. At least the kids were unharmed.

Adrian Boucher appeared in the doorway, his sharp gaze narrowing. He must have overheard. "What about Liam and Daisy?"

"They're with Angela at the hospital."

Adrian turned on his heel and strode out before Ethan could say another word.

At the hospital...

The two children hovered near Angela's bedside, their small faces tense.

Daisy clutched Liam's sleeve, her voice trembling. "Liam... is Angela going to be okay?"

Liam squeezed her hand reassuringly. "She'll be fine."

But his tiny brow furrowed.

The evidence at the scene was clear—this wasn't an accident. Someone targeted us.

Adrian arrived outside the ward, flanked by a bodyguard.

Daisy rushed to him, her usual bright smile replaced by fear. "Uncle Adrian... are we in trouble?"

She blamed herself for Angela getting hurt. Adrian ruffled her hair gently. "No, sweetheart. It was just an accident."

Liam cut in sharply, his voice eerily calm. "It wasn't an accident."

Adrian's gaze snapped to the boy, startled by his certainty.

"Someone planned this," Liam continued. "If Angela hadn't pushed Daisy away, she would've been hurt instead."

A pause. "Or both of us."

Adrian studied him, impressed despite himself. How is a five-year-old this perceptive?

"How do you know it wasn't an accident?" he challenged.

Liam crossed his arms. "I checked the tripod. The leg was sawed—clean, diagonal cut. If it hadn't collapsed early, it would've fallen when we were on stage. Meaning someone was backstage at the time."

Adrian smirked and ruffled his hair. "You're too smart for your age."

Liam scowled, thinking Adrian didn't believe him.

Just then, Adrian's phone buzzed—Gemini Advertising's investigation report.

The findings matched Liam's analysis exactly.

At Goldmann Group...

Nathan Goldmann stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, phone pressed to his ear. His voice was ice. "Did you find the person behind this?"

The response darkened his expression.

"Tell Gemini Advertising they have three days," he said coldly. "If I don't get answers by then, bankruptcy will be their only option."

He ended the call.

How dare they target my children.

His mind raced. The pattern was too obvious—the training camp incident, Evelyn's snakebite, Winifred's sudden death in custody, even his grandfather learning about Evelyn's connection to the de Armas.

All of it, too convenient.

Someone's pulling the strings.

And now, his kids were nearly crushed on stage.

His grip tightened on the phone.

This ends now.
###Chapter 337

The pieces of this puzzle all pointed to one person—Evelyn Vanderbilt. Every incident appeared to be meticulously orchestrated against her.

Nathan dialed Oliver again, his voice sharp. "Get your ass back here immediately."

Oliver hesitated. "But Mr. Theodore Goldmann said—"

Nathan's expression darkened. "He won't find out. I need you to investigate something."

Evelyn only learned about the accident involving Liam and Daisy when she saw the news alert. They had been filming a commercial when disaster struck.

She had been overseeing renovations at Viana Jewelry and rushed to the hospital straight from the company.

Seeing the children safe in the ward with Adrian eased some of her panic.

"Mommy!" Daisy sprinted into her arms.

Evelyn noticed her daughter's red-rimmed eyes and felt her heart clench. "Sweetheart, were you and Liam scared?"

"Angela saved me." Daisy's lower lip trembled. "Did I hurt her?"

Evelyn's gaze shifted to the unconscious woman on the hospital bed. Her throat tightened.

Angela had risked herself for her children. Gratitude swelled in Evelyn's chest.

I'll thank her properly when she wakes up.

"My brave girl," Evelyn smoothed Daisy's hair, "the best way to repay Angela is to remember her kindness and pass it forward when you're older."

Taking Daisy's hand, Evelyn approached Liam and turned to Adrian. "Mr. Boucher, thank you for watching over them."

Adrian gave a tired smile. "Of course. Someone targeted these kids—I couldn't leave them unprotected."

"Targeted?" Evelyn's blood ran cold.

This was no accident.

Adrian glanced at Liam. "Your boy's sharp. He noticed tampered equipment on set. Gemini Advertising confirmed it was sabotage."

Evelyn's face paled.

Not an accident. A calculated attack. They're coming after my children to get to me—just like what happened to Dad.

But even if Theodore wants to force me away from Nathan, he wouldn't harm innocent kids.

Unless...Vivian's behind this?

As Evelyn and Adrian stepped out with the children, they collided with Theodore and Rosalind entering the hallway.

Theodore's face darkened when he saw Evelyn with the Boucher heir. His opening words were laced with venom. "What kind of mother allows her children into the entertainment industry? Look what your negligence almost cost them."

Evelyn remained silent.

Maybe I was wrong to let them pursue acting.

Rosalind intervened with practiced grace. "Grandfather, Ms. Vanderbilt clearly cares deeply for her children."

"If she cared, they wouldn't be in this situation," Theodore snapped.

Liam suddenly stepped forward, small fists clenched. "We chose acting! Don't yell at our mommy!"

Theodore froze. The boy's defiant protection reminded him painfully of Nathan at that age—both willing to defy the world for this woman.

Evelyn placed a gentle hand on Liam's shoulder. "We don't speak to elders that way."

"I don't need a great-grandfather," Liam declared, glaring at Rosalind, "but I'll always need Mommy."

Though young, the boy understood life's true priorities. No one could replace his mother's place in his heart.
###Chapter 338

Evelyn noticed the defiant glare from the child and felt Rosalind's concealed fist tighten behind her back.

The older woman's pleading gaze darted toward Theodore, silently begging for his support.

Though Theodore's expression darkened, he maintained remarkable composure for a man being challenged by a child.

Adrian observed the growing tension between Theodore and Evelyn within mere minutes.

A knowing smile played on his lips. "While I understand your distaste for show business, Mr. Goldmann, these children made their own choices. Surely you don't believe they're incapable of independent thought?"

Rosalind's eyes gleamed with cunning when Adrian defended Evelyn.

'How convenient,' she thought bitterly. 'First she ensnares Nathan, now she's wrapped Adrian around her finger too.'

She smirked. "Mr. Boucher, I wasn't aware you and Ms. Vanderbilt were so... close."

Theodore's scowl deepened, recalling previous rumors about Evelyn and Adrian.

'A mother of three should know better than to invite scandal,' he fumed silently.

Adrian responded before Evelyn could speak. "Our acquaintance is irrelevant."

His tone remained measured. "Nathan and I grew up together. I'm fond of these children, and Ms. Vanderbilt is a remarkably talented woman worthy of respect. Though I assure you," his gaze sharpened, "I maintain proper boundaries with a friend's wife."

Rosalind's smile faltered. The implied rebuke wasn't lost on her.

'Is he suggesting I lack propriety?'

Satisfied the children were unharmed, Theodore turned abruptly. "We're leaving," he told Rosalind, cutting the confrontation short.

Rosalind shot one last venomous glance at the group before following.

Evelyn's eyelid twitched as she watched Theodore's retreating figure. His misconceptions about her seemed to deepen daily.

She turned to Adrian. "Thank you, Mr. Boucher."

He nodded. "Just speaking the truth."

Daisy tugged Adrian's sleeve. "Uncle Adrian, why does Great-grandfather hate show business?"

Liam crossed his arms. "His opinion doesn't matter."

Adrian's expression darkened. "Because your grandmother was in the industry too."

Evelyn startled. Though Adrian and Nathan grew up together, their interactions seemed limited. "Mr. Boucher, did you know Nathan's mother?"

Adrian hesitated. "She was... an extraordinary artist. A born actress."

Evelyn studied him closely.

When Adrian spoke of Victoria Knowles, genuine reverence lit his eyes.

'Could Victoria have been Adrian's idol?' Evelyn marveled.

'The entertainment kingpin has an idol of his own!'

Later that evening at Blue Bay Villa...

The three children buzzed with excitement, reunited with their parents at last.

"Mommy's cooking is still the best!" Caleb and Daisy declared between enthusiastic bites.

Nathan observed the scene with crossed arms. His offspring had claimed every inch of space beside Evelyn the moment they arrived.

Again.
###Chapter 339

Evelyn glanced at Nathan, who had been left out on the opposite side of the dining table, looking sullen and jealous. She kindly fetched a piece of meat and placed it on his plate. "Good boy, we still love you."

Nathan was rendered speechless.

This sounds oddly familiar.

Daisy scooped a large spoonful of mashed potatoes and looked at Nathan with wide, curious eyes. "Daddy, Uncle Adrian said today that Grandma was also from the entertainment industry. Why haven’t we met her?"

The moment the question left Daisy’s lips, the atmosphere at the table shifted abruptly.

Evelyn lowered her gaze.

He probably doesn’t want to talk about his mother.

But to her surprise, Nathan answered calmly, "Yes, but your grandmother isn’t here anymore."

The three children froze.

That statement could mean two things—either she wasn’t with them physically, or she was no longer in this world.

After dinner, Evelyn was washing dishes in the kitchen, lost in thought.

Her mind wandered, and a plate slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor.

As she crouched to pick up the pieces, a sharp shard sliced her finger, drawing blood.

Nathan, hearing the commotion, immediately set Daisy down on the couch and rushed into the kitchen.

Seeing Evelyn crouched on the floor, injured, his brow furrowed. He strode forward, pulling her up. "Are you trying to hurt yourself? Let me see."

"It's just a small cut," Evelyn murmured, trying to pull her hand back, but Nathan held it firmly.

"Don’t move," he commanded.

Liam, ever the quick thinker, appeared with the first-aid kit. "Daddy, here."

Nathan took it without a word, carefully wrapping the small wound.

The other two children peeked into the kitchen, eyes wide with curiosity.

Daddy and Mommy look so close!

Evelyn stole a glance at Nathan—peeking, really.

He’s unfairly attractive when he’s serious.

Suddenly, her feet left the ground.

Before she could react, she was swept into Nathan’s arms.

"Liam, clean this up," Nathan ordered, carrying Evelyn out of the kitchen.

Evelyn blinked in surprise as Liam sighed dramatically but obediently grabbed the broom.

The other two children exchanged glances.

So unfair.

Back in the bedroom, Evelyn, now deposited on the bed, lightly smacked Nathan’s shoulder. "You made Liam clean up?"

Since when does he use our son for chores?

Nathan smirked. "Worried he can’t handle it? He’s smarter than you."

"Nathan, you—"

"Why are you so distracted tonight?" Nathan interrupted, his gaze sharp. "Is it because Daisy mentioned your mother-in-law earlier?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Has he really stopped seeing me as just—

"Am I wrong?"

She mumbled, "We’re not even married yet."

Nathan stepped closer, tilting her chin up with a smirk. "Are you saying you want to marry me now?"

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. Why is my heart racing like this?

"Zoe," Nathan murmured, his knees pressing into the mattress as he caged her between his arms. "Tomorrow’s an auspicious day. Let’s get married."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "You believe in superstitions like that?"

Nathan grinned. "It’s February 14th tomorrow. Valentine’s Day."

Her pulse skyrocketed.

I never cared about marriage before… but with him, I suddenly do.
###Chapter 340

"But if we suddenly got married, what about your grandfather—"

"Have a stroke from rage?"

Before Evelyn could finish her sentence, Nathan pinned her down, his muscular arm wrapping possessively around her slender waist.

His lips curved into that infuriating smirk. "That's why we need to give him a fourth great-grandchild immediately. Better yet, three more. Keep the old man busy chasing toddlers so he won't have time to disapprove of you."

"Mmm—" Just as the mood turned tender, Evelyn suddenly clung to him fiercely. That desperate embrace shattered his last shred of self-control.

The next morning—

Nathan awoke to find Evelyn still curled against his chest. He couldn't resist tweaking her adorable nose. "Rise and shine, sweetheart."

His morning voice was unfairly seductive, especially with that endearing "sweetheart." Even half-asleep, Evelyn felt her pulse quicken.

"Five more minutes..." she mumbled, burrowing deeper into the sheets.

The dark intensity in Nathan's eyes melted as she nuzzled against him. A wicked grin played on his lips.

"Then I'll join you." He yanked the covers up—

Evelyn's eyes flew open!

Nathan lounged beside her, propped on one elbow with a predatory gaze.

Her cheeks burned crimson.

'This bastard is toying with me!'

"Beg me." His smirk turned downright devilish.

Evelyn bit her lip, then flipped their positions in one swift motion.

Downstairs, the trio was already demolishing breakfast. Caleb and Daisy inhaled their sandwiches while sighing dramatically. "Thank heavens Liam can cook. We'd have starved waiting for Mom and Dad."

Evelyn shot Nathan an accusatory glare.

'This is entirely your fault.'

Nathan merely chuckled, looking far too pleased with himself.

"I'm so sorry, sweetheart." Evelyn ruffled Liam's hair guiltily. "You shouldn't have to take care of us like this."

Liam side-eyed his ravenous siblings. "Someone has to be the responsible one."

Nathan tousled his hair. "Today's the big day. Mommy and Daddy are getting our marriage certificate."

Caleb tilted his head. "What's that?"

Evelyn pinched Nathan's arm.

He captured her hand, laughing. "It means Mommy's officially mine now. Good news, right?"

"Amazing!" Daisy cheered.

Caleb clapped. "That nasty woman can't interfere anymore!"

Daisy stood on her chair, hands on hips. "If that ugly witch tries to steal Daddy again, I'll show her what happens!"

Liam began drumming his utensils against the table for dramatic effect.

Evelyn facepalmed while Nathan looked ready to disown them all.

'Maybe boarding school isn't such a bad idea...'

The gleaming Maybach drew every eye as it pulled up to City Hall. When Nathan and Evelyn emerged, whispers exploded through the crowd.

"Is that Nathan Goldmann?"

"Oh my God! They're actually getting married today!"

"How lucky to witness this!"

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably under the sudden attention.

'Could we be any more conspicuous? Was a lowkey courthouse visit too much to ask?'

Then she mentally kicked herself.

'Since when do Goldmanns do anything discreetly?'

Nathan effortlessly reeled her in when she lagged behind, his arm claiming her waist. The onlookers sighed enviously.

"Everyone's staring," Evelyn muttered.

"Let them." His grip tightened. "We're about to be husband and wife. Showing off is practically required."

After the paperwork, they stood stiffly before the photographer. Evelyn's nervous smile made Nathan chuckle as he pulled her closer. "Relax, Mrs. Goldmann-to-be."
###Chapter 341

Nathan turned his head to study Evelyn's rigid posture, her spine straight as a soldier standing at attention. A sudden burst of laughter escaped his lips before he could stop it.

The moment was perfectly captured by the photographer's lens. Anyone with half a brain could see the undisguised adoration shining in Nathan's smile.

After reviewing several shots, Nathan unhesitatingly selected their very first photograph from the options.

Emerging from city hall, Evelyn let out an exasperated laugh when she saw his choice. "You picked THAT one? I look absolutely ridiculous!"

Nathan ruffled her hair affectionately. "Not ridiculous - adorable."

Truth be told, Evelyn was far from unattractive. Their first meeting had already proven that. But as their relationship deepened, Nathan discovered even the most stunning woman could reveal unexpectedly sweet vulnerabilities.

'Who knew such a brilliant mind could be so endearingly clumsy at times?'

Evelyn pouted dramatically.

That infuriatingly perfect face of his looked divine as always in the photo. Meanwhile, she resembled a nervous recruit on her first day of boot camp. The contrast grew more ridiculous each time she looked at it.

#MrGoldmannAndEvelynVanderbiltTieTheKnot trended explosively across social media. Among Bassburgh's elite, only Nathan commanded this level of public fascination without being a celebrity.

Several citizens who'd coincidentally been at city hall that day posted candid shots of the newlyweds:

[Photo of Nathan laughing while Evelyn stands stiffly]

The comments section overflowed with both congratulations and envy. When Vivian saw the news alert, she shot up from her couch so violently she nearly overturned the coffee table.

Married? Already?

'Damn it! Why does that bitch always get everything I want? Why can't I beat her at anything?!'

Her phone's sudden ringing startled her.

Seeing "Lillian de Arma" on the caller ID, Vivian composed herself before answering. "Yes?"

The aristocratic woman's voice dripped with false calm. "I assume you've seen?"

Vivian's nails bit into her palm. "That whore actually married Nathan."

A thought struck her. "You swore Theodore Goldmann would never approve this. What happened to your grand plans?"

She'd been counting on the Goldmann patriarch's opposition.

'If I can't have him, why should she get to be happy?'

"Since when do you question me, little girl?" The icy rebuke made Vivian flinch.

She caught herself - she'd overstepped.

'If not for this woman's money and connections that got me out of that hellhole, I'd never tolerate her condescension.'

Lillian's tone turned calculating. "If you truly want Nathan, eliminate Evelyn permanently. Harassing her associates achieves nothing. Think carefully."

Rosalind Summers ended the call in a corporate restroom, her grip threatening to crack her phone screen.

'Married. The man I love belongs to another woman now.' Her reflection showed a twisted smile. 'But marriage certificates can be amended. From "married" to "widowed"...'

The sound of a trash can clattering interrupted her thoughts. Rosalind's expression smoothed into practiced calm as she exited the stall.

A terrified junior employee stood frozen, her ID badge clearly displaying: [Strategic Department - Meryl Yates]

Rosalind approached with predatory grace. "Did you hear something interesting, dear?"

"N-nothing! I didn't hear anything!" The girl's trembling hands betrayed her.

Rosalind's manicured fingers brushed the employee's shoulder as she memorized the name tag. Her voice dropped to a honeyed whisper. "How would you like a promotion? Everyone has their price... and their secrets."
###Chapter 342

Meryl Yates swallowed hard when the words "promotion" and "raise" reached her ears. Her pulse quickened with excitement.

"Seriously... You mean it?" Her voice trembled slightly.

Rosalind Summers' dark eyes gleamed with sincerity as she smiled. "I never make empty promises. It's yours if you want it."

Meryl nodded eagerly, fingers twisting together. "My lips are sealed. No one will hear a word from me."

Working at ckgold Group already provided excellent benefits. A promotion with increased salary? That was beyond her wildest dreams!

As Meryl exited the office, Rosalind's pleasant expression melted away. Cold determination replaced it.

She picked up her phone with deliberate calmness and typed a message.

(Shane, I need someone taken care of. Details to follow. Make it quick.)

At Viana Jewelry Studio...

"Zoe, the renovations at Viana might need another week," Gregory Fannon reported, checking his tablet.

Evelyn Vanderbilt simply smiled. "No rush. We'll discuss it when everything's finished."

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "Funny how you were so eager to move before, but now you're perfectly content to wait?"

Evelyn pouted, caught red-handed. "What? I'm just being reasonable. Viana's a massive space - renovations take time."

'And maybe I'm not quite ready to leave yet,' she thought silently.

Gregory chuckled knowingly but said nothing further.

Evelyn's phone buzzed unexpectedly. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

After a moment's hesitation, she answered. Theodore Goldmann's voice demanded her presence at the mansion immediately.

During the drive, Evelyn mentally prepared herself. 'This must be about mine and Nathan's marriage.'

The mansion's grand doors swung open as she arrived. Theodore sat stiffly in the parlor while Mr. Chester poured tea.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn approached calmly.

Theodore slammed his teacdown, the china rattling. "So you went through with marrying Nathan after all."

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Sir, I understand your concerns about my connection to the de Armas family. But I need to make something clear - the feud between our families has nothing to do with me."

She took a steadying breath. "My mother was never involved, and neither will I be."

"Pretty words," Theodore scoffed. "Do you know why Nathan's mother was kidnapped fifteen years ago? The de Armas wanted leverage against our family."

His piercing stare made Evelyn's skin prickle. "Now Harrison de Armas knows you're married to my grandson. What do you think will happen?"

Evelyn frowned. "What could he possibly do?"

Theodore's laugh was bitter. "If Harrison ever uses you to manipulate Nathan, how far do you think my grandson would go to protect you?"

Evelyn's hands clenched at her sides. The possibility chilled her.

"The de Armas..." she murmured.

'Would my grandfather truly use me as a pawn against Nathan?'

"You don't need to worry," Evelyn said firmly. "I won't allow myself to become a weapon against Nathan."

She straightened her shoulders. "My only family is Richard Vanderbilt. Even if I'm biologically related to the de Armas, they mean nothing to me."

Her voice grew stronger. "I was raised a Vanderbilt. After my mother died, my father was my whole world. Blood doesn't make family - love does."
###Chapter 343

The longstanding feud between the de Armas and Goldmann families made it utterly impossible for me to acknowledge the de Armas name so casually.

Nathan's grandfather Theodore looked momentarily surprised by Evelyn's firm stance, though his expression quickly smoothed over.

After a long pause, he spoke gravely. "Remember your words today, girl. If you go back on them, I'll make you regret it—even if it costs me my grandson's affection forever."

Evelyn blinked in shock.

'Is he actually reconsidering his position?'

She offered a small smile. "I won't forget."

Mr. Chester escorted Evelyn to the mansion's entrance. Hearing that Theodore had tacitly approved the marriage brought him visible relief for both Evelyn and Nathan.

"How are the children these days?" the butler inquired warmly.

Evelyn's smile widened. "They're thriving."

Mr. Chester leaned closer, his voice dropping to a confidential tone. "Between us, the elder Mr. Goldmann adores those three. He simply doesn't know how to show it."

"The man spent his youth buried in work—neglected raising his own son, barely saw his grandson. Now that he's got great-grandchildren..." The butler shook his head. "Love isn't the issue. He's forgotten how to be family."

Understanding dawned in Evelyn's eyes. She recalled Theodore's secret hospital visits whenever the children were ill—proof the stern patriarch cared more than he'd ever admit.

As Evelyn drove away from the Goldmann estate, a sedan suddenly swerved into her path at an intersection. She jerked the wheel and slammed the brakes. Tires screeched, but impact was inevitable.

The collision wasn't severe—both vehicles had slowed considerably—but the damage was done. Heart pounding, Evelyn took a moment to steady herself before engaging the parking brake and stepping out.

The other driver remained inside his car.

She approached and rapped on the window. The young man inside slowly lowered it.

Before she could speak, an arm snaked around her throat from behind. A chemical-soaked cloth clamped over her nose and mouth.

Evelyn clawed at the attacker's sleeve, but the chloroform's sickly sweetness overwhelmed her. Her limbs turned leaden.

Two more men emerged from the sedan's backseat, hauling her limp form inside. Doors slammed. The car sped away.

Meanwhile, Nathan arrived at Soul Jewelry Studio, his brow furrowing at the empty office.

'Where has that woman disappeared to now?'

"Mr. Goldmann?" Gregory approached, recognizing the CEO's imposing silhouette. "Looking for Zoe?"

Nathan turned sharply. "Her location."

"She received a call and left for the Goldmann mansion. Didn't she inform you?"

'The mansion?'

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously.

'Grandfather's doing?'

Without answering, he strode out, nearly colliding with Rosalind in the hallway.

"Nathan, darling—"

He brushed past without acknowledgment, leaving her clutching her phone. A new message notification glowed on the screen. Rosalind's lips curled as she read it.

Back at the estate, Mr. Chester startled at Nathan's abrupt return. The CEO's stormy expression promised trouble. "Sir, is everything—"
###Chapter 344

"Where's my grandfather?"

"Elder Master Goldmann just retired for his afternoon rest," Mr. Chester replied.

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "And Evelyn? Didn't he summon her?"

A knowing smile curved Mr. Chester's lips at Nathan's concern. "Indeed, he did call Ms. Vanderbilt here. But you needn't worry—he didn't oppose your union. In fact, he's given his blessing."

Surprise flickered in Nathan's eyes, quickly replaced by suspicion. "What were his terms?"

Knowing Grandfather, he wouldn't yield without conditions.

Mr. Chester nodded. "Elder Master Goldmann only relented after witnessing Ms. Vanderbilt's unwavering loyalty to the Goldmann family. His primary concern was the de Armas using her against you."

He paused before continuing, "Ms. Vanderbilt assured him she wouldn't allow that. She gave her word, and only then did the Elder Master concede."

A shadow crossed Nathan's face as Mr. Chester added, "Incidentally, how is Ms. Vanderbilt's father faring? The Elder Master only recently learned of his injuries after speaking with him. Quite the coincidence, really."

Nathan's expression darkened, but he had no time to dwell on it. "Where is Zoe now?"

"She departed shortly before your arrival."

Nathan strode out of the mansion, the crisp air doing little to cool his rising unease. His phone buzzed—Oliver's name flashed on the screen.

The moment Oliver's words reached his ears, Nathan's face turned glacial, the atmosphere around him dropping several degrees.

Evelyn's consciousness returned slowly, her vision blurry as she took in her surroundings—an abandoned, unfinished building.

Her wrists ached from the rough ropes binding them. No matter how she twisted, escape seemed impossible.

Footsteps echoed.

"Evelyn Vanderbilt." The voice was sharp, triumphant. "Finally, I have you where I want you."

Vivian stepped into view, flanked by two men—one of whom had been driving the car earlier.

Realization struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

The accident was staged.

She inhaled deeply, steadying herself before meeting Vivian's gaze. "You orchestrated this?"

Vivian smirked, crossing her arms. The cruelty in her eyes was unmistakable. "Does it matter?"

She closed the distance between them, her hand lashing out to strike Evelyn's cheek. The sound of the slap echoed in the empty space.

"Always so proud, aren't you?" Vivian sneered. "How does it feel to be at my mercy now?"

Another slap followed, leaving twin marks blooming across Evelyn's face.

Evelyn licked the inside of her stinging cheek, then chuckled darkly. "You went through all this trouble just to slap me twice?"

The laughter ignited Vivian's fury. Her hand flew out again, nails raking Evelyn's skin, drawing a thin line of blood.

Vivian yanked Evelyn's hair, forcing her head back. "Did you ever imagine you'd end up like this? That bitch of yours survived last time, but I won't make the same mistake again."

Despite her predicament, Evelyn's demeanor remained unbroken, her defiance radiating like an unyielding frost.

The admission confirmed Evelyn's suspicions. "So it was you behind the accident."

Vivian's laugh was shrill. "Yes! And what will you do about it? Pity I didn't finish off those brats of yours."

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial.

It really was her.

"Oh, and about Dad—" Vivian's lips twisted. "Oh wait, he's not my father anymore, is he? The accident that put Richard in the hospital? That was me too."
###Chapter 345

Vivian confessed everything without hesitation, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"You can't change anything now even if you know the truth." Her voice dripped with venom. "Evelyn, if I can't be happy, neither will you."

The bitter thought clawed at her mind like a trapped animal. 'Why wasn't I born as Richard Vanderbilt's real daughter? Why does Evelyn get everything - the luck, the status, the perfect life?'

Her fingers tightened around the knife handle. "I'll make sure you vanish forever. Once you're gone, no one will ever dare cross me again!"

'What do I have left to lose?' Vivian's manic laughter echoed in the abandoned warehouse. 'Mother's in prison. I've lost my home, my reputation. There's nothing holding me back now.'

Evelyn studied the deranged woman before her without an ounce of sympathy. Only pity. "Vivian Vanderbilt, when will you ever take responsibility for your own choices?"

"Who gave you the right to judge me?" Vivian shrieked, her grip tightening painfully on Evelyn's arm. "This is all your fault!"

A sharp pain shot through Evelyn's wrist, but she refused to give Vivian the satisfaction of seeing her wince. "Tell me, when have I ever wronged you? Or have you forgotten what you did six years ago?"

Her voice turned icy. "You were the one who betrayed me first. You've been scheming against me at every turn. And now you dare play the victim?"

"You deserve everything that's happened to you!" Evelyn nearly shouted, her composure cracking.

Vivian's face twisted in rage. She raised her hand to strike - only to find her wrist caught midair.

In one fluid motion, Evelyn twisted free from the loosened ropes and pinned Vivian against the wall. The sharp edge of her diamond ring pressed against Vivian's jugular.

"Move and she dies," Evelyn warned the two hired thugs, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. The ring had been her secret weapon, slowly sawing through the ropes while Vivian monologued.

The men froze. They hadn't signed up for murder - especially not without getting paid first.

"Don't listen to her!" Vivian screamed. "She won't dare- AHH!"

A thin trickle of blood ran down Vivian's neck as Evelyn pressed the ring deeper. The men paled, staying rooted to the spot.

"W-what are you doing?" Vivian's bravado cracked as real fear set in. The sting at her neck made her legs tremble. She never imagined Evelyn would actually hurt her.

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "What does it look like? Did you really think I'd hesitate after everything you've done?"

"You'll never make it out alive if you kill me!" Vivian gasped. "I have more men outside. If I die here- URK!"

The ring dug deeper, cutting off Vivian's threat.

"Worry about yourself," Evelyn murmured, her breath cool against Vivian's ear. "These men? They're only here for money. I can pay them double whatever you promised."

She locked eyes with the hesitant thugs. "Name your price. My husband Nathan Goldmann has deeper pockets than she could ever dream of."
###Chapter 346

Evelyn smirked at Vivian and tilted her head. "Instead of begging her for money, why not ask me? It's just cash, after all."

The men hesitated, exchanging uncertain glances.

Vivian's face twisted in panic. "Don't listen to her!"

"Vivian, why struggle when you're already drowning?" Evelyn leaned in, her voice a venomous whisper. "By the time I'm finished with you, they won't get a single cent from you anyway."

At that moment, two guards were thrown into the room. A group of armed bodyguards in black stormed in, swiftly tackling the two men to the ground before they could flee.

Nathan strode through the doorway like a storm descending—cold, untouchable, his presence freezing the air. The sharpness in his gaze softened slightly when he saw Evelyn holding Vivian hostage.

"Nathan, help me! Evelyn's lost her mind—she's going to kill me!" Vivian shrieked the moment she spotted him.

Nathan didn’t spare her a glance. Instead, he signaled the bodyguards, who immediately pulled Vivian away from Evelyn.

Evelyn walked toward him, and Nathan's eyes darkened when he noticed the faint scratch on her cheek.

His fingers brushed the mark, his voice dangerously low. "Who did this?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Who do you think?"

Nathan’s gaze snapped to Vivian, and he extended a hand toward one of the bodyguards, who placed a gun in his palm.

Evelyn blinked. Was he really going to—

Bang.

Vivian’s scream tore through the air.

A bullet hole bloomed in her left arm, blood soaking into her sleeve.

Nathan didn’t hesitate. He fired again—this time into her right arm.

Vivian’s agonized wails echoed through the building. The pain of a bullet tearing through flesh was unbearable, and she crumpled, gasping.

Nathan reloaded with practiced ease, then shot twice more—once in each leg.

Vivian collapsed, her body convulsing. Blood trickled from her lips where she’d bitten her tongue, her limbs now useless, drenched in crimson.

Tears streamed down her face, her expression pure terror.

Nathan handed the gun back to the bodyguard, wiping his blood-splattered hands with a handkerchief before tossing it aside.

"That’s what happens when you lay a finger on Evelyn."

His voice held no emotion, the brutality of his actions sending a chill through the room. The two men on the floor trembled, pressing their foreheads to the ground.

Nathan turned to the nearest bodyguard. "Find her a 'good home' in the countryside. Even with ruined limbs, she can still serve a purpose. I’m sure some desperate farmer won’t mind."

Then his gaze shifted to the two men. "As for these two..."

They begged, their voices cracking. "She forced us! We didn’t do anything!"

Nathan ignored them, addressing the bodyguards instead. "Do whatever you want. Just make sure they stay alive."

With that, he took Evelyn’s hand and led her out. Behind them, the screams of the men filled the air, a symphony of pain.
###Chapter 347

The car ride was silent.

Nathan pulled out the medical kit and carefully tended to the scratch on Evelyn’s face. Though it was minor, even the smallest wound could leave a mark if not treated properly.

Evelyn didn’t speak, her gaze fixed elsewhere.

"Did I scare you?" Nathan’s voice was low, his brows furrowed. He knew his actions had been brutal, but the thought of Vivian harming Evelyn had ignited something uncontrollable inside him.

Evelyn finally turned to him, her lips parting slightly. "It’s fine."

His eyes darkened. "Fine?"

Without another word, Evelyn wrapped her arms around him, pressing her face against his chest. The sudden warmth of her embrace caught him off guard.

"Zoe, you—"

She smiled faintly, nestling deeper into his arms. "Nathan, I know you’d never hurt me. I could never be afraid of you."

Her words melted the ice in his gaze. He lifted a hand, gently stroking her hair before pressing a kiss to her forehead.

"Zoe," he murmured, "I won’t let anyone who dares lay a finger on you walk away unscathed."

That evening, at Blue Bay Villa—

Nathan carried Evelyn into their bedroom, his words still echoing in her mind.

She had never seen that side of him before—ruthless, unrelenting. But it had all been for her.

A thought struck her, and she lifted her head. "How did you know where I was?"

"Do you really think I wouldn’t find you?"

Nathan kissed the back of her hand, but then his expression shifted. A shadow crossed his face. "I was afraid I’d be too late. If something had happened to you…"

He couldn’t finish the sentence. The mere thought was unbearable.

Evelyn chuckled softly, reaching up to ruffle his hair in reassurance. The gesture surprised even her.

Nathan’s eyes darkened further. He cupped the back of her head and pulled her into a searing kiss. When they finally broke apart, Evelyn gasped for air, her cheeks flushed.

"Nathan, we have to pick up the kids from school—mmph!"

He swept her onto the bed, his voice a low growl. "Tonight, it’s just us."

"Nathan, you—!"

She barely got the words out before he silenced her again.

The man who had been terrifyingly cold just hours ago was now entirely different—playful, possessive, relentless.

He smirked as he stripped away her clothes. "Yes, I’m a scoundrel."

The night stretched on, uninterrupted by the usual responsibilities of parenthood. By the time dawn approached, Evelyn lay boneless in bed, utterly spent.

Nathan, ever the gentleman (or so he claimed), carried her downstairs "out of kindness."

The dining table was set with an extravagant candlelit dinner, and on the chair beside it rested a bouquet of black roses nearly half her height.

Evelyn blinked. "Since when are you this romantic?"

Black roses were rare—and expensive. This bouquet was so massive she doubted she could even lift it.

"Of course," he said, grinning. "Our first night together deserves nothing less."

She would’ve forgotten if he hadn’t mentioned it.

Nathan wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder. His voice was rough with emotion. "Zoe, I heard your father has finally agreed. From today onward, you’re Evelyn Goldmann—my wife."

He kissed her temple. "We’ll set a date. And it won’t be some small affair. It’ll be grand—so grand that every woman in this city will envy you."
###Chapter 348

Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile as Nathan's promise echoed in her ears. "You said it yourself," she murmured.

The next morning...

Rosalind strode into the office building, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. A cluster of employees huddled near reception immediately caught her attention.

"Have you seen Mr. Goldmann and Ms. Vanderbilt lately? Ever since they registered their marriage, they've been inseparable."

"Of course they're not hiding it anymore - they're legally married now!"

"I swear, the way Mr. Goldmann looks at her... I never knew I could ship a real-life couple this hard."

Rosalind's steps faltered, her expression darkening.

She hadn't heard from Vivian since yesterday. The failed mission didn't surprise her. At least she'd been smart enough to use a burner phone - even if Nathan investigated, there'd be no trail leading back to her.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Evelyn clinging to Nathan's arm like some lovesick puppy. Just as those gossiping women had described.

Spotting Rosalind, Evelyn deliberately tightened her grip on Nathan's arm and flashed a saccharine smile. "Darling, I want a date today."

Nathan's amber eyes crinkled in amusement at her sudden endearment - until he noticed Rosalind's presence.

Ah. His feisty little wife was marking her territory. He turned to Evelyn with exaggerated interest. "Hmm? Where did you have in mind?"

"Somewhere thrilling," Evelyn purred, arching an eyebrow.

Rosalind's icy glare burned into them as they carried on their shameless display.

She marched forward, her face a mask of professionalism. "Nathan has an important meeting this afternoon. Surely you wouldn't want to interfere with his work?"

"Oh really?" Evelyn blinked up at Nathan with exaggerated innocence. "But you told me your schedule was clear today."

Nathan nodded. "It is."

Rosalind pressed her lips into a thin line. "Nathan, the quarterly review-"

"Ms. Summers," Evelyn cut in sweetly, "as Nathan's special assistant, shouldn't you be capable of handling a simple meeting? After all, Oliver managed much more complex tasks during his time."

Rosalind's fists clenched at her sides.

"Quincy worked tirelessly for Nathan. I know how hard my husband has been working - doesn't he deserve one day off?"

She stepped closer, her smile turning razor-sharp. "And really, you should stop calling him by his first name. People might get... the wrong idea."

The deliberate jab hit its mark - Evelyn had always hated how casually Rosalind addressed her husband.

Rosalind forced a tight smile. "We've known each other since childhood. It's force of habit."

"Break it." Evelyn's voice turned steely. "Nathan isn't single anymore. I'm his wife now, and I don't appreciate other women being so familiar with him."

She tilted her chin up defiantly. Normally she wouldn't care, but things were different now.

"Nathan-" Rosalind began.

"Didn't you hear my wife?" Nathan interrupted coldly. "That's Mr. Goldmann to you now."

Without another glance at Rosalind's stricken expression, he guided Evelyn away, his arm possessively around her waist.

Rosalind stood frozen, her teeth sinking into her lower lip until she tasted blood. She'd make Evelyn regret this. Soon.

In the underground parking garage, as Evelyn moved to enter the car, Nathan suddenly pulled her back. Pinning her against the vehicle, he traced a finger along her jawline.
###Chapter 349

Evelyn blinked up at him, her long lashes fluttering. "What are you doing, Nathan?"

His fingers tightened slightly around her waist. "Weren’t you just calling me 'honey' a second ago? Why the sudden change?" His voice was low, tinged with displeasure.

She bit her lip, cheeks flushing. "I was just messing with her because she was eyeing my man."

Her man.

Nathan’s lips curved into a satisfied smirk.

He pulled her closer, his breath warm against her ear. "And what kind of excitement were you referring to earlier?"

A shiver ran down her spine, and she quickly pressed a hand against his chest. "Nathan, not here. I didn’t mean that kind of excitement."

This insatiable man—didn’t he ever worry about exhausting himself?

Nathan chuckled darkly but said nothing.

Evelyn grinned up at him, mischief dancing in her eyes. "You promised me the whole day, remember? That means you’re agreeing to whatever I want to do."

He arched a brow, amused. "Go on, then. What’s on your mind?"

She beamed. "Everything. A movie, shopping—just like a normal couple."

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly, but Evelyn tugged at his sleeve, pouting. "I want to experience what it’s like to go on a real date with my boyfriend."

He hesitated. He had never indulged in such mundane activities before—they were unnecessary.

But for her? He couldn’t refuse.

The cinema was bustling when they arrived. A striking couple like them instantly drew attention.

Evelyn turned to Nathan. "I’ll get the tickets. Wait here." She strode toward the kiosk, leaving him standing near the entrance.

Whispers followed in her wake.

"Did you see that guy? He’s gorgeous."

"He’s alone—should we go talk to him?"

A group of giggling girls approached, one boldly stepping forward. "Hey, can we get your number?"

Nathan regarded them coolly before a slow, devastating smile curved his lips. "Sorry. I’m married."

Their hearts sank. Married? Who was the lucky woman?

Just then, Evelyn reappeared, sliding her arm possessively through his. "Honey," she purred, shooting the girls a pointed look. "Sorry, but my husband doesn’t give out his number."

The girls flushed and scurried away.

Evelyn huffed as she dragged Nathan toward the theater. Maybe bringing him out in public was a mistake. The man was a magnet for attention.

Nathan smirked, thoroughly enjoying her jealousy.

Goldmann Mansion

Theodore set down the delicate china he’d been polishing, frowning. "Nathan skipped work?"

Rosalind lowered her gaze. "Grandfather, I fear I’m not a very effective assistant."

"Did he give you trouble?"

Theodore wasn’t blind—Nathan had been displeased when Rosalind replaced Oliver. It was no surprise he wasn’t cooperating.

She shook her head. "No. I just… couldn’t convince him to focus."
###Chapter 350

Rosalind lifted her gaze, her voice laced with frustration. "Ms. Vanderbilt was fully aware of the afternoon meeting, yet she insisted Nathan spend time with her instead. He refused to listen, no matter how much I tried to reason with him."

She exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around the edge of the table. "Nathan acts as if everything I do is wrong. If this continues, I might as well leave the company."

A flicker of coldness passed through Rosalind's eyes as Theodore paused in polishing the antique china.

Theodore had never been fond of Evelyn to begin with, and Rosalind's words only reinforced his belief that she was the reason Nathan was neglecting his responsibilities.

How could someone so cunning ever belong to the Goldmann family?

Yet, to Rosalind's surprise, Theodore didn’t react with anger. Instead, he handed the delicate porcelain to Mr. Chester and said calmly, "Rosalind, you must understand—Nathan is the CEO of ckgold. If he had to handle everything himself, what would be the point of having Oliver as his assistant?"

Rosalind’s expression stiffened.

"Besides," Theodore continued, his tone measured, "Nathan simply wanted some time off with his wife. There’s nothing wrong with that."

Rosalind was stunned. "Grandfather, I thought you disapproved of Ms. Vanderbilt. Why—"

Theodore pressed his lips together, cutting her off. "Enough. Evelyn has already clarified her past with me. If I’ve chosen to trust her, I won’t go back on my word."

He had already broken his promise once—first agreeing to their marriage after she passed the military assessment, then refusing when he learned of her connection to the de Armas family.

He wouldn’t make the same mistake again.

Rosalind bit her lip, frustration simmering beneath the surface. Why was this happening?

If Theodore accepted their marriage, did that mean he had also accepted Evelyn as his granddaughter-in-law?

No. She wouldn’t allow it.

Meanwhile, Evelyn strolled down the bustling street, licking an ice cream cone. She glanced at Nathan, who had spent the last two hours trailing behind her through countless shops, and smirked.

"Nathan, how does it feel to go shopping with a woman for the first time?"

Nathan chuckled, shaking his head. "It’s... an experience."

Evelyn stopped abruptly, turning to face him with a raised brow. "Are you tired?"

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "Why do you ask?"

"Should I treat you to a nice massage?" She pointed playfully toward a nearby spa.

Nathan’s expression darkened, but Evelyn only laughed.

Before she could react, he swept her off her feet, carrying her effortlessly in his arms. Evelyn gasped, her cheeks flushing as passersby turned to stare.

"N-Nathan! Put me down!" She squirmed, mortified.

Nathan smirked. "You offered me a massage. If your service is unsatisfactory, you won’t be sleeping tonight."

Evelyn groaned, burying her face in his shoulder.

The next morning, Evelyn winced as she stretched, her back aching.

She had only been joking about the massage, but Nathan had taken it as a challenge—one that left her thoroughly exhausted.

Elsewhere, whispers spread like wildfire.

"Is it true? Mr. Goldmann skipped an important meeting just to spend time with Ms. Vanderbilt?"

"They’re married—what’s the big deal?"

"Still, he’s the CEO. Shouldn’t business come first?"

The rumors swirled, but none of it mattered to Nathan.

He had made his choice.
###Chapter 351

The female employee trembled when she saw Evelyn standing there after overhearing their conversation.

"Ms.—Ms. Vanderbilt—"

Evelyn tilted her head, a playful smile curling on her lips. "What were you two discussing?"

The women exchanged nervous glances, their faces flushing with embarrassment.

"Relax, I won’t scold you." Evelyn’s tone was light, but her gaze sharpened. "I just want to know who started these rumors."

One of them hesitated before stammering, "W-We heard it from the administrative office. They said… you refused to let Mr. Goldmann attend the meeting yesterday."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "The administrative office?"

The woman nodded quickly, then added in a hushed voice, "I think… Ms. Summers might have said something to them first."

A knowing glint flashed in Evelyn’s eyes. "Thank you." She smiled before turning on her heel.

In the administrative office, gossip was in full swing.

"Honestly, what man could resist Ms. Vanderbilt? If I were in Mr. Goldmann’s place, I’d skip meetings for her too."

"Please, beauty fades. Even if they’re madly in love now, what happens when she’s old and wrinkled? You think passion lasts forever in these elite circles?"

"Exactly! Have you not heard the scandals in those wealthy families?"

The chatter continued, none of them noticing Evelyn’s presence—until one male employee cleared his throat loudly.

Silence fell instantly.

Evelyn smiled, scanning the room. "I assume you all know where Ms. Summers is?"

"Sh-She’s—"

"Looking for me, Ms. Vanderbilt?" Rosalind stepped out of her office, her expression darkening at the sight of Evelyn.

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. "I heard some interesting rumors today. And a little bird told me you were the one spreading them. What do you think I should do about that?"

The room tensed.

Rosalind crossed her arms, lifting her chin defiantly. "I only spoke the truth. If you didn’t do anything wrong, why should you care?"

In Rosalind’s mind, Evelyn was nothing more than a distraction—a pretty face unworthy of Nathan’s time.

Evelyn stepped closer.

Then—

Slap.

The sharp sound echoed through the office.

Rosalind staggered, her cheek burning. The others gasped, frozen in shock.

"You—!" Rosalind seethed, her eyes blazing.

Evelyn smirked. "I told Winifred the same thing once. People who can’t control their tongues deserve consequences."

A flicker of unease crossed Rosalind’s face at the mention of Winifred, but she quickly masked it.

"Evelyn, we’re in ckgold. Do you really think you can get away with this?"

Evelyn laughed. "Why wouldn’t I?" She gestured to the stunned onlookers. "They all saw what happened. Do I look worried about rumors?"

She leaned in, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Let me remind you—you’re just a secretary. Nathan is the CEO. If he has to handle everything himself, what’s the point of you being here? Do you expect him to babysit you after paying your salary?"

Evelyn stepped back, her smile widening. "Now I understand why Nathan trusts Oliver so much more."
###Chapter 352

Rosalind's fists clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white as she glared at Evelyn. Her eyes burned with pure, unadulterated hatred.

The office had fallen into stunned silence.

The truth was, Oliver had been the one handling most of the company's affairs, and Nathan had indeed entrusted him with significant responsibilities.

But ever since Oliver had been reassigned and Rosalind had taken over as Nathan's secretary, something had shifted.

Nathan, their employer, had somehow become busier than ever.

And when he couldn't attend meetings, Rosalind—his secretary—was supposed to step in.

Yet now, everyone realized she had been misleading them all along.

And Evelyn? She was no pushover.

A collective sigh of relief swept through the room—at least they weren’t the ones who had just been slapped.

Evelyn kept her smile sweet, almost innocent. "Ms. Summers, if you're struggling with your duties, perhaps we should have Oliver take over again. He’s far more competent, and he doesn’t need his boss to clean up his messes."

She’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

That was the thought flashing through everyone’s minds.

Just then, Nathan strode into the office. His sharp gaze swept over the crowd before landing on Evelyn, who stood directly in front of Rosalind.

"What’s going on?"

The employees scattered instantly.

Rosalind’s eyes brightened at the sight of him. She bit her lip, her voice trembling. "Nathan, I—"

"I slapped her," Evelyn turned, her expression shifting into one of wounded innocence.

The crowd gaped at her sudden transformation.

Evelyn held out her delicate hand toward Nathan, her lower lip quivering slightly.

Nathan took it without hesitation, his fingers gently massaging her palm. "Does it hurt?"

She tilted her head, mischief glinting in her eyes. "Only if you kiss it better."

A slow smirk curled his lips. "Later. At home."

The room collectively choked on disbelief.

As Nathan turned to leave with Evelyn, Rosalind finally snapped. "Nathan! She was the one who slapped me for no reason!"

Nathan paused.

He turned back, his expression icy. "Good. I’d have done it myself if she hadn’t."

Rosalind froze.

The realization hit the others like a lightning bolt—Rosalind had been pining after Nathan, but he despised her.

Humiliation burned through Rosalind as she watched Nathan walk away with Evelyn.

She had never been so publicly shamed before.

Back in the Night Banquet, she had commanded respect as Titus’s direct subordinate.

But now? Nathan had just torn her dignity to shreds—for Evelyn.

Had their childhood friendship meant nothing?

Her eyes darkened with cold fury.

In Nathan’s office, he lifted Evelyn onto his desk, caging her in with his arms. "Aren’t you afraid she’ll run to my grandfather?"

Evelyn scoffed. "What’s done is done. If she tattles, so be it."

Nathan shook his head, amused by her boldness.

"There’s something I’ve been wondering," Evelyn mused, tracing idle patterns on his chest. "Rosalind was close to Winifred, but after her death, she never mentioned her again."

She met his amber gaze. "When I brought Winifred up earlier, her reaction was… strange."

Nathan frowned. "And?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "If Felix was the reason Winifred targeted me at camp, how did you find out about what happened between him and me? You weren’t even there."
###Chapter 353

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. So it had been Rosalind who brought him that photo back then.

"Winifred took that picture?" The realization hit him like a cold splash of water.

"Nathan?" Evelyn's voice pulled him from his thoughts.

He blinked. "Yes?"

Her clear eyes searched his face, concern flickering in them. "What's wrong?"

A frown creased her forehead as suspicion crept in. "You didn't have someone spying on me at the training camp, did you?"

His thumb brushed her cheek gently. "Chloe and Harrison kept me updated about everything that happened there. But Rosalind was the one who told me about... you and Felix."

"Rosalind?"

Evelyn's gaze dropped.

So Winifred had been Rosalind's informant inside the camp.

Now it made sense—why Rosalind had won the ring and sought her out. She had deliberately planted that misunderstanding between Evelyn and Nathan, using Felix as leverage.

"Winifred's death... could it be connected to her?"

Evelyn didn't have proof, but the way Rosalind had distanced herself from Winifred after her death was unsettling. She acted as if Winifred had never existed.

And if Winifred hadn't been the one to release the pit viper, then someone else had framed her. Someone who knew about their feud and wanted Evelyn dead—while making it look like Winifred's doing.

Who stood to gain the most from Evelyn's death?

No one else came to mind except the woman who had been tirelessly trying to tear her and Nathan apart.

Nathan studied her expression. "You suspect Rosalind, don't you?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions without evidence. But too many things don't add up. Winifred's death is suspicious, and when I piece it all together..."

Nathan's jaw tightened. Winifred had died in a restricted area of the camp. Whoever killed her must have known the layout well—someone like Rosalind, who had full access.

"Even if she is involved, we can't act without proof," he said quietly. "My grandfather trusts her. The Summers have been allies to the Goldmanns for generations."

Evelyn bit her lip, her lashes casting shadows over her eyes.

He was right.

Even if Rosalind was guilty, Theodore would never allow her to face consequences. Not with the history between their families.

"But there's one thing that might be connected to her," Nathan murmured.

Evelyn looked up. "What?"

"It was Rosalind who convinced my grandfather to visit your father that day. She must have poisoned his mind against you." His voice darkened. "And right after he left, your father was attacked. Vivian confessed—a woman put her up to it."

After Nathan had shot Vivian in the limbs, she had spilled everything to avoid exile.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Vivian had claimed full responsibility before, but now the truth was clear—someone had been pulling her strings.

"So that woman is—"

"Zoe," Nathan cut in, his grip firm on her hand. "You don't need to worry. I have a plan."
###Chapter 354

Nathan gently stroked Evelyn's face. Vivian's confession had confirmed his earlier suspicions.

His grandfather had discovered the connection between Evelyn and the de Arma family the moment she returned from the training camp. Both his father and he had gone to great lengths to keep it hidden.

Even Richard and the others knew nothing about it—except for Vivian, who had attempted to expose Evelyn as a descendant of the de Armas.

Nathan studied her for a moment before speaking. "Starting tomorrow, I'll send Chloe to stay with you, just in case. She can assist you with anything. As for the kids, my father and grandfather will watch over them. The only one I'm truly worried about is you."

A wave of warmth spread through Evelyn's chest. She could see the genuine concern in his eyes.

She reached for his hand and pressed it against her cheek. Nathan blinked in surprise, but she only laughed softly. "As long as you're with me, I don't feel afraid."

That evening, at the Royal Academy of Music...

Caleb stepped out of the academy's main entrance, his small backpack slung over one shoulder. Two foreign-looking bodyguards emerged from a sleek black car and blocked his path.

"Are you Caleb Vanderbilt?" one asked in flawless English.

Caleb nodded cautiously.

The bodyguard bowed slightly and gestured toward the car. "Our master wishes to speak with you."

Lucas Laurent had just pulled up in his own car when he spotted Caleb being escorted into the unfamiliar black vehicle. His grip tightened on the steering wheel.

That's not the usual Goldmann car that picks him up...

A terrible thought struck him. He jerked the wheel and followed.

Evelyn and Nathan arrived at the underground parking lot. Just as they reached their car, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number.

Her face paled instantly.

"What's wrong?" Nathan asked sharply.

"Caleb's been taken."

Nathan immediately ordered Harrison to track Caleb's location using the device embedded in the car.

Within minutes, they had their answer—the Siberian Palace Hotel.

Nathan's expression darkened. He turned the car toward the hotel without another word.

When they pulled up outside the entrance, Evelyn grabbed his arm. "Wait here. They only want me. I'll be fine—trust me, okay?"

Nathan studied her for a long moment before finally exhaling. "Call me the second anything happens. I'll be right here."

Evelyn leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek before stepping out of the car.

Nathan touched the spot where her lips had been, shaking his head with a faint smile. Still, from her reaction, he had a strong suspicion about who had taken Caleb.

Inside the Siberian Palace Hotel's restaurant...

Caleb sat across from Lucas, eyeing the older man curiously. Lucas was usually fearless at the academy, but right now, he looked tense—almost intimidated—by the elderly man before them.

"Is the food not to your liking?" Harrison de Arma asked, picking up his fork with a faint smile. "I wasn't sure what you boys preferred, so I took the liberty of ordering."

Caleb frowned. "Why did you bring me here? Do I know you?"

His mother had always warned him never to accept food from strangers.

Harrison's sharp gaze flicked to Caleb, but he ignored the question. Instead, he turned to Lucas. "No greeting? Where are your manners?"

Lucas swallowed hard. "Grandfather."

Caleb's eyes widened.

He's Mr. Laurent's grandfather?

"So this boy is your cousin's son?" Harrison asked coldly.

Lucas took a deep breath. "Grandfather, what exactly do you want with him?"
###Chapter 355

Lucas Laurent scoffed, his piercing gaze fixed on Harrison de Arma. "And why exactly shouldn't I be concerned? You've crossed lines before."

Harrison's lips curled into a cold smile as he adjusted his cufflinks. "The boy carries de Arma blood. That makes him family."

Little Caleb tilted his head, confusion clouding his bright eyes. "You're really my great-grandfather?"

Harrison's expression softened momentarily as he studied the child. "Through your mother's lineage, yes. The de Arma lineage."

Caleb's small brows furrowed. "But Mommy never mentioned you."

The tense silence was shattered by commotion at the entrance.

"Ma'am, this is a private event—"

"Move. Now."

Evelyn Vanderbilt pushed past the startled staff, her heart pounding. When her gaze landed on Caleb sitting unharmed between Lucas and the imposing older man, her shoulders sagged with relief.

Harrison waved off his security detail. "Let her approach. She's... family."

The word tasted bitter on his tongue.

Evelyn's heels clicked sharply against the marble as she strode forward. "Mr. de Arma, I presume?"

Harrison studied her with unsettling intensity. "You have Miranda's eyes. Sit. We were just getting acquainted with your son."

"I'm here for Caleb." Evelyn's voice held steel. "Nothing more."

Lucas shifted uncomfortably, his knuckles whitening around his wine glass.

Harrison chuckled darkly. "So defensive. Do you truly believe I'd harm my own blood?"

Evelyn didn't blink. "Given your history with the Goldmanns, can you blame me?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Harrison's smile vanished. "Ah yes, the Goldmanns. That parasitic family that soiled royal bloodlines and murdered without consequence."

"That was generations ago," Evelyn countered. "Nathan Goldmann is my husband. A good man."

Harrison's fist slammed onto the table, making the silverware jump. "Good? Their entire fortune is built on corpses! Your precious father-in-law's hands will never be clean!"

Caleb flinched at the outburst. Evelyn instinctively moved to shield him.

Harrison regained his composure with visible effort. "You stand with them so readily? After everything?"

Evelyn lifted her chin. "They accepted me without hesitation when they learned of my heritage. That's more than I can say for the de Armas."

A dangerous glint entered Harrison's eyes. "Tell me, Evelyn... are you certain the Goldmanns' affection isn't merely... convenient?"
###Chapter 356

Evelyn didn’t hesitate for even a second. "I believe in Nathan."

As she led Caleb away, she paused, turning back with a hardened expression. "I know about Nathan’s mother. If the de Armas truly did what I think they did, I’ll never forgive them."

With that, she left, Caleb’s small hand clasped tightly in hers.

Lucas remained seated, his face unreadable. His gaze flickered to Harrison’s slightly embarrassed expression before he stood. "Grandfather, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave."

"Did you warn her?" Harrison’s voice was icy.

Lucas nodded. "Yes. I didn’t know your intentions when you sought out that child. Mother has always said the past should stay buried. Why can’t you let it go?"

Harrison slammed his fist on the table, his voice trembling with fury. "The Goldmanns don’t deserve to be forgotten! Every last one of them deserves to pay!"

Lucas exhaled sharply. It was clear—no matter what he said, Harrison’s hatred for the Goldmanns ran too deep.

‘There’s no reasoning with him.’

Downstairs, Caleb glanced up at Evelyn. "Mommy, is that man really your grandfather?"

Evelyn hesitated, forcing a smile. "Yes."

"But why does Great-grandpa hate the Goldmanns?" Caleb might not understand the history between the two families, but even at his age, he could sense the venom in Harrison’s words.

Evelyn didn’t know how to explain it to him. Just then, she spotted Nathan standing by the car, phone pressed to his ear.

"Daddy!" Caleb sprinted toward him.

Nathan ended the call and turned, effortlessly scooping the boy into his arms. "Did you and Mommy come to pick me up?"

Nathan nodded, his eyes shifting to Evelyn as she approached. "The butler went to get Caleb and realized he wasn’t there. I’ve already informed him so the old man won’t suspect anything."

Evelyn blinked, then nodded. "Thank you."

As Nathan carried Caleb to the car, the boy leaned in and whispered, "Daddy, Mommy defended you in front of her grandfather!"

Nathan’s brows lifted slightly. "Did she now?"

Caleb nodded eagerly, his amber eyes gleaming.

Evelyn slid into the car, frowning at their hushed exchange. "What are you two whispering about?"

Caleb grinned. "It’s a secret between me and Daddy!"

Evelyn sighed.

‘Since when did these two start keeping secrets from me?’

Back at the Goldmann mansion, the butler smiled warmly as Caleb bounded inside. "Master Caleb, you’re home!"

"Mm-hmm!" Caleb nodded.

Liam and Daisy hurried down the stairs, Daisy immediately latching onto her brother. "Caleb, why are you back so late?"

Caleb hesitated, then grinned. "Oh, uh… I went out to dinner with Professor Lucas."

He was smart enough not to mention being taken away—he didn’t want his great-grandfather blaming his mother.

Just as they were about to leave, an elderly voice boomed from the top of the stairs. "What’s this? Is our home-cooked food not good enough? Why the rush?"

Theodore and Rosalind descended, Rosalind’s expression darkening the moment she spotted Evelyn. But she held her tongue.

Nathan wrapped an arm around Evelyn’s waist, his voice teasing. "Well, since we’re here, why don’t we stay for dinner?" He glanced at her. "What do you think?"

Evelyn hesitated, but Nathan squeezed her hand.

"Let’s go back to the villa."
###Chapter 357

Evelyn met his smiling eyes and nodded. "Since my husband wants to stay for dinner, then we’ll just stay."

The three little troublemakers exchanged exasperated glances.

Ugh, so gross!

During dinner, the maid stood nearby, serving each dish with practiced ease.

Nathan hadn’t returned for a meal since moving out, making tonight his first time back at the table.

Caleb, Liam, and Daisy sat beside their parents, devouring their food as if it had been prepared by a world-renowned chef.

Theodore observed them with amusement.

Normally, the kids weren’t this enthusiastic about eating.

Clearly, they’re happiest when their parents are around.

"Ahem," Theodore cleared his throat. "Since you’re here, you might as well move back in."

Nathan glanced up, his tone casual. "It’s inconvenient. We’re planning for another child."

Evelyn’s hands froze mid-air, her eyes widening in shock.

Even Theodore was taken aback. "You—you want another baby?"

"Daddy, is Mommy going to have a baby?" Daisy’s face lit up with excitement. "That means I won’t be the youngest anymore! I’ll be a big sister!"

Daisy had always hated being the youngest—she wanted someone to boss around.

Evelyn was speechless.

I never agreed to this!

Theodore looked at the three eager faces and thought, More Goldmann heirs wouldn’t be a bad thing.

"I’ll leave it to you two. I’m too old to interfere."

His words were a clear signal—he wouldn’t stand in their way.

Rosalind, who had been silently eating, clenched her fork. A dark glint flashed in her eyes.

It was hard enough making Grandfather doubt Evelyn. But now, things are slipping out of my control.

If this continues, she’ll win him over completely. And my position in this family will mean nothing.

Damn it. I underestimated her. I can’t just sit back and watch my downfall.

A few days later...

The renovations at Viana Jewelry were nearly complete. Evelyn and Gregory visited the site to check on the progress.

The interior design mirrored Soul Jewelry Studio’s aesthetic, but the space was significantly larger.

They would be able to relocate in three days. Once merged, Soul and Viana would become one powerhouse company.

"Uncle Gregory, our team at the studio already understands the market well. They’ll guide the new hires when the time comes."

"Director Xavier will be promoted to general manager, overseeing the purchasing department. And you’ll handle administration. How does that sound?"

Gregory smiled warmly. "Xavier and I have worked together for years. Coming back here feels like coming home—whether it’s called Viana or Soul doesn’t matter. We’ll support whatever decision you make."

His words touched Evelyn deeply. Finding loyal allies in this cutthroat world was rare.

Gregory and Director Xavier had chosen to return when Viana was at its lowest. She would never forget that.

After assigning Gregory to supervise the final renovations, Evelyn returned to Vanderbilt Manor.

A small, reddish-brown terrier dashed toward her, tugging at her pant leg before rolling onto its back, belly exposed.

"Rusty, you’re being naughty again." Richard sighed. The dog was bold but endearingly simple-minded—it adored strangers.

Evelyn chuckled, scooping up the puppy and giving it a sniff. "Dad, did you give him a bath?"
###Chapter 358

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows, casting golden light across the living room.

Rusty, the scruffy little terrier, wagged his tail excitedly as Evelyn scratched behind his ears.

"Yeah, this little troublemaker loves digging up my flowerbeds," Richard chuckled, shaking his head. "I have to give him a bath every few days just to keep him from tracking dirt everywhere."

"Woof!"

Rusty barked happily, his big brown eyes fixed on Evelyn as if she were his new favorite person.

Nathan set down his teacup with a soft clink. "I found him wandering the streets a few months ago. Poor thing was all skin and bones."

He reached down to pet the dog. "Took him to the vet—turns out he’s perfectly healthy, just had a sensitive stomach. His previous owners probably dumped him because they couldn’t handle it."

Evelyn ran her fingers through Rusty’s soft fur.

No wonder kids adored him. There was something irresistible about his scruffy charm.

"Zoe," Richard began, his expression turning serious. "What brings you here today?"

Evelyn set the dog down and took a seat across from him. "The renovations at Viana Jewelry are almost finished. I wanted to ask—if you’re still willing, the chairman’s position is yours."

Richard froze, his gaze darkening. "Evelyn, I handed Viana over to you. I never planned to interfere—"

"You wouldn’t be interfering," she cut in gently. "The board still needs your leadership. And… I need you there too."

Richard glanced at Rusty, who had curled up at his feet with a sleepy yawn. "But who’ll take care of him?"

"Hire a housekeeper," Evelyn suggested. "Like before. You won’t have to worry about the cost—I’ll handle it. Honestly, I’d feel better knowing someone’s here looking after you."

A slow smile spread across Richard’s face at her concern. "Alright. I’ll leave it to you."

Then his expression sobered. "The day after tomorrow… it’s your mother’s death anniversary. You should visit her."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

She had nearly forgotten.

Swallowing hard, she nodded. "I will."

At Goldmann Group’s headquarters, Rosalind Summers stepped out of the executive office, only to nearly collide with Chloe Lawson.

Rosalind forced a smile. "Did Nathan call you in?"

Chloe nodded without hesitation. "Yeah. He wants me to stick close to Evelyn from now on."

Rosalind’s grip tightened on her tablet.

Nathan assigned Chloe to protect Evelyn? That woman really has him wrapped around her finger.

Chloe tilted her head. "Rosalind? You okay?"

Rosalind quickly smoothed her expression. "Of course. Just surprised. You’ve always valued your freedom—why agree to this?"

Chloe grinned, scratching her cheek. "Well, Mr. Goldmann’s paying me. And honestly? I like Evelyn. This gig’s a win-win."

Rosalind said nothing as Chloe walked away, her smile fading into something colder.

Those two better not disappoint me.

Back at Soul Jewelry, Evelyn found Chloe lounging in her office, flipping through a magazine.

Chloe sprang up the moment Evelyn entered. "Evelyn! You’re back!"

Evelyn laughed. "Nathan really sent you?"

"Yep! So, what’s my job?" Chloe rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly. "Fair warning—I’m kind of a disaster."

Evelyn sank into her chair. "No tasks. Just do whatever you want."

Chloe’s eyes lit up. "Seriously? You’re the best! Getting paid to hang out? This is the dream!"

Evelyn shook her head, amused.

If only everything in life were this simple.
###Chapter 359

Evelyn's lips curved into an awkward smile.

'This girl's innocence is almost endearing.'

Just then, a frantic female staff member burst through the door. "Ms. Zara!" she gasped. "There's a furious couple outside demanding to see you!"

"Me?" Evelyn's brows knitted together as she rose from her seat, with Chloe following closely behind.

"Bring out whoever's in charge right now!" The middle-aged couple standing near the reception area wore expensive but understated clothing. Though not extravagantly wealthy, their attire screamed upper-middle class. Evelyn approached them calmly. "You were asking for me?"

The woman sized her up with narrowed eyes. "We're Winifred's parents."

Both Evelyn and Chloe visibly stiffened at the revelation.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore. Perhaps we should discuss this privately?"

"Absolutely not!" Mrs. Whitmore snapped, crossing her arms. "We'll have this conversation right here, where everyone can hear the truth about what happened to our daughter!"

"We went to that damned training camp," Mr. Whitmore interjected, his voice shaking with rage. "They claimed our Winifred attempted murder then killed herself out of guilt. But we know that's a lie!"

Chloe stepped forward. "Mrs. Whitmore, you can't possibly blame Ms. Vanderbilt for-"

"She was driven to suicide!" The woman's shrill voice cut through the studio. "My daughter never harmed anyone in her life! Suddenly she's accused of violence and locked up until she takes her own life?"

Mrs. Whitmore's finger trembled as she pointed at Evelyn. "We've been to every police station demanding justice. But they're too cowardly to touch this case - because she's married to Nathan Goldmann! Does money make you above the law?"

The studio staff exchanged shocked glances. While they'd noticed Evelyn's recent absence, none had known the details.

Chloe positioned herself protectively in front of Evelyn. "As parents, your grief is understandable. But Winifred's case remains under investigation."

"We never wanted this tragedy," she continued firmly. "But your daughter initiated every conflict with Ms. Vanderbilt. Despite being framed repeatedly, Ms. Vanderbilt is still trying to find Winifred's real killer. Isn't that enough?"

Mrs. Whitmore scoffed. "Framed? My daughter was the victim here!"

Evelyn raised a hand to silence Chloe. She met the grieving mother's gaze steadily. "Mrs. Whitmore, I understand your pain. But tell me this - who claimed Winifred was murdered?"

The woman's eyes darted sideways briefly before hardening. "That's irrelevant! We know you pressured our daughter to her death, and we won't rest until you pay!"

Evelyn's expression darkened. Her voice remained measured but carried new steel. "If you'd like to discuss this rationally, I'm willing to cooperate."

"But if you continue these baseless accusations," she continued, her tone dropping dangerously, "let me make something clear. I owe Winifred nothing. And I certainly didn't harm her."
###Chapter 360

The sun cast long shadows across the marble floor as Evelyn Vanderbilt stood tall, her voice cutting through the tense silence.

"First," she began, her tone icy, "Winifred had repeatedly targeted me during training, even going so far as to frame me. I chose to let those incidents go."

She paused, letting the weight of her words settle.

"Second, the circumstances of Winifred’s death remain unclear. The authorities are still investigating whether it was suicide or murder."

Her gaze hardened.

"But if you insist on blaming me, I suggest you hire a lawyer before speaking to me again. Though I doubt the courts will favor you—because I am just as much a victim here as the deceased."

A murmur rippled through the room.

She wouldn’t sound this confident if she were guilty.

Mrs. Whitmore stiffened, her face twisting in fury. "You think you’re untouchable because you’re Nathan Goldmann’s wife, don’t you?"

Her husband tugged at her sleeve. "Let’s discuss this rationally—"

"Rationally?" Mrs. Whitmore snapped. "Our daughter is dead. What do I have left to lose?"

She turned back to Evelyn, venom dripping from her words. "You hide behind your status, thinking no one can touch you. But we’ll make sure the world knows the truth!"

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "If you’re not here for legal action, then what do you want?"

Mr. Whitmore bowed slightly, forcing a conciliatory tone. "Ms. Vanderbilt, we’re not here to accuse you. But our daughter died in your training camp. Surely you understand our need for… compensation."

Chloe Lawson scoffed. "The camp already compensated you. Now you’re here demanding more from Evelyn?"

Mrs. Whitmore’s eyes flashed. "That paltry sum was nothing compared to what we spent raising her!"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Before we discuss compensation, perhaps you should pay me for the psychological trauma your daughter caused."

The room fell silent.

"She lured me into a restricted zone—I nearly died. She sabotaged my relationship with Nathan, turning the public against me."

Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

"So tell me, Mrs. Whitmore… who owes whom?"
###Chapter 361

"Why don't you compensate me for emotional damages first? Then maybe I'll consider compensating for your so-called loss."

Evelyn's tone was icy, her gaze sharp enough to cut glass.

Mrs. Whitmore choked on her words. Why was this woman so impossible to deal with?

"Money doesn't fall from the sky. Everyone works for it. Did you really think you could extort me just because of your daughter’s unfortunate fate?"

Evelyn’s expression darkened, her patience wearing thin. "If you’re looking for trouble, go ahead. I won’t stop you. But don’t blame me for the consequences. If I let people like you walk all over me, they’ll think I’m weak. And I’m not."

She turned to Chloe and said, "Escort them out."

Chloe nodded. "Of course."

Stepping forward, Chloe addressed the couple with a polite but firm tone. "I’m sorry, but if you’re done here, it’s best you leave before this gets embarrassing for you."

She wasn’t just protecting Evelyn—she was sparing them the humiliation of being dragged out by security.

The Whitmores scowled but had no choice. They stormed out, their pride wounded. Chloe followed them to the door before returning to the office.

Nathan had heard about the Whitmores' visit, and his expression turned stormy. "How did they even know Zoe was here?"

Chloe shrugged. "No idea. They just showed up out of nowhere."

Nathan’s frown deepened.

Someone had tipped them off. There was no other way they would’ve known Evelyn was in ckgold.

"Mr. Goldmann, what if they escalate this? Even if Evelyn doesn’t care, it could damage her reputation," Chloe pointed out, concern lacing her voice.

Seeing her genuine worry, Nathan realized Evelyn needed someone reliable by her side.

He smirked. "Just focus on keeping her safe. I’ll handle the rest."

"You’re really good to her, Mr. Goldmann. She must’ve accepted you by now, right?" Chloe suddenly grinned, unable to resist teasing.

Nathan’s smile vanished. "If you’d rather not have this job, I can always reassign it to Oliver."

"Wait—no! I’ll stop asking. I’m leaving right now!" Chloe hurried out, shutting the door behind her.

Outside, the Whitmores approached a sleek black car and spoke to the shadowed figure inside.

"We confronted Ms. Vanderbilt, but it was pointless. She didn’t budge."

The window rolled down slightly, revealing a woman’s cold, calculating eyes. "Then make it public. Someone will guide you on how to do it properly."

Mrs. Whitmore nodded eagerly. "Understood."

A gloved hand extended from the car, passing them a thick envelope. The moment they took it, the car sped off.

Mr. Whitmore hesitated. "Honey… this feels wrong. Using our daughter’s death like this—"

"This isn’t wrong!" Mrs. Whitmore snapped. "Our daughter died because of that Vanderbilt woman! Everyone at the camp said she provoked her!"

"If she hadn’t, Winifred would still be alive. I’m just getting justice for her."

Though her words calmed him slightly, Mr. Whitmore couldn’t shake the feeling that the woman helping them had ulterior motives. He needed to be careful.

The next day…

As expected, Winifred’s death made headlines.

In the televised interview, Mrs. Whitmore sobbed dramatically, pointing fingers at Evelyn.

"She’s the reason my daughter is dead! She bullied her, humiliated her—and now my baby is gone!"

The media frenzy had only just begun.
###Chapter 362

The internet exploded with accusations directed at Evelyn Vanderbilt's Twitter. Some netizens questioned her involvement, while others speculated the grieving couple was simply capitalizing on her fame. The recent media frenzy surrounding Evelyn and Nathan's marriage registration made them easy targets.

"Do you honestly believe Ms. Vanderbilt could be responsible for someone's death?"

"Let's not jump to conclusions. Every scandal about her gets debunked within days."

"But what if it's true this time?"

Employees whispered among themselves when Evelyn entered Soul Corporation. The rumor about her slapping Rosalind Summers for spreading false information had spread like wildfire. The fact that Mr. Goldmann had allowed it sent a clear message—no one dared cross her now.

Chloe followed closely behind, catching snippets of the conversation. "Don't stress, Evelyn. Nathan said he'd handle everything."

Evelyn turned, lowering her voice. "Chloe, I need your help with something."

Chloe's brows lifted. "What is it?"

Inside the elevator, Evelyn tapped her shoulder. "Go talk to that couple. Tell them I'm willing to pay—name their price."

Chloe's jaw dropped. "Have you lost your mind?"

Evelyn remained silent.

"They're obviously scamming you! Why would you give them money?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Chloe crossed her arms. "This makes zero sense."

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose, suddenly understanding why Nathan preferred Oliver as his assistant. Chloe's bluntness would probably give him an aneurysm.

She flicked Chloe's forehead. "Do I look stupid to you? I need them to take the bait. Meeting them is the only way to uncover the truth."

Chloe's eyes widened in realization. "Oh. Now I get it."

Evelyn returned to Soul and found Nathan standing by the window, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the city skyline. He turned at the sound of her heels.

Before he could speak, she rushed into his arms, inhaling his rich cologne. "Sending affection this early?"

She tilted her head up with a playful smile.

Nathan arched a brow. "Just making sure today's nonsense doesn't ruin your mood." He leaned in, his lips brushing her ear. "Consider it... motivation."

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks, and she stepped back. "I don’t need motivating. It didn’t affect me."

His warm palm settled on her head. "Then why are you blushing? Unless..." His smirk turned dangerous. "You were hoping for a different kind of encouragement?"

Evelyn's entire face burned. If she didn’t retaliate, he’d tease her mercilessly. She shoved him against the window, a finger pressed to his chest. "You’ve been exhausting me every night. Shouldn’t you be worried about your stamina?"

Nathan's gaze darkened. In one swift motion, he hauled her against him, tilting her chin up. "Sounds like I’m not working hard enough."

Evelyn barely had time to react before his lips crashed onto hers. She pushed him away, flustered. "Stop messing around!"

Nathan pulled her back, his voice a rough whisper. "You started this fire, sweetheart. You’re putting it out."
###Chapter 363

"Someone's coming, let me go just this once—"

Evelyn pleaded softly, her stunning features and mesmerizing gaze working their magic.

Nathan's resolve crumbled. How dare this woman ignite such fire within him only to beg for mercy? No man could withstand that.

He drew a sharp breath and pulled her closer. "Don't move. Just let me hold you."

Evelyn froze, acutely aware of Nathan's restraint. One wrong move, and he might lose control entirely.

"Are you done?"

Silence.

"Nathan, want to hear a joke? I promise it'll calm you down."

A faint, curious "Hmm" came from behind her.

"A sugar cube walked to the North Pole. When it arrived, it got so cold it froze solid—turned into rock sugar."

Nathan stared blankly.

Undeterred, Evelyn grinned. "Here's another! A cabbage started stripping as it walked. After a few steps—poof! It vanished!"

Nathan promptly silenced her with a searing kiss.

"Evelyn, I have—"

The door swung open. Chloe stood frozen, eyes wide. Oh no. She was dead.

"Oops! Sudden blindness! Can't see a thing!" Chloe squeezed her eyes shut, fumbled for the doorframe, and backed out, slamming the door behind her.

Nathan's expression darkened like a storm rolling in.

Evelyn rose on her toes, brushing her lips against his. Seeing his anger ebb, she murmured, "Chloe came for a reason. Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore are waiting for me."

"Why?" Nathan's mood plummeted instantly.

She adjusted his collar. "To settle things, obviously."

His grip tightened around her waist. "Need my help?"

Evelyn chuckled. "I've got this."

As she turned to leave, Nathan pressed her against the wall. "Then they can wait. Mm—"

She halted just shy of his lips. "Tonight. Let's finish this tonight."

The wolfish glint in his eyes was unmistakable. "You promised."

The restaurant's private room hummed with tension.

Evelyn and Chloe entered to find the Whitmores already seated. Mr. Whitmore half-rose, but his wife yanked him down, sneering.

"Only when the scandal explodes do you bother fixing it? Pathetic. People like you only care when your precious reputation's at stake. What skeletons are you hiding now?"

Evelyn sat, unflinching. "Mrs. Whitmore, that's unfair. I'm here to talk. How is that hiding anything? I'm trying to help you."

"Help us?" Mrs. Whitmore scoffed. "You want our daughter to take the fall while we stay silent? After what you did, compensation is the least you owe!"

Her voice dripped venom. Rumors of how her daughter suffered at camp had reached her. If Wynona were alive and crossed "Mrs. Goldmann," a simple apology wouldn't suffice.
###Chapter 364

The Winters' daughter was gone forever. Mrs. Whitmore had once dreamed of her working among the elite, securing a lavish future. Now, all that remained were hollow aspirations.

Evelyn smiled coolly. "How much compensation are you demanding?"

"At least $800,000."

Chloe nearly choked on her coffee. The audacity! Even $800 would have been excessive.

Evelyn's lips curved. "And when that runs out? Will you come crawling back for more?"

Mrs. Whitmore stiffened, as if Evelyn had peeled back her greed like an onion. "What’s that supposed to mean? Are you paying or not?"

"Chloe," Evelyn turned, ignoring her. "What’s the legal term for this?"

Chloe didn’t miss a beat. "Extortion. Minimum three years. But for $800,000? Try fifteen."

The elderly couple paled.

"This isn’t extortion! You’re twisting our words!" Mrs. Whitmore’s voice cracked.

Evelyn slid a document across the table—a law firm’s letterhead gleaming under the café lights.

"Mrs. Whitmore, if you want compensation, let’s do this legally. If the court rules Winifred’s death was my fault, I’ll pay every cent. But if they don’t?" Her gaze sharpened. "Then I owe you nothing."

Mrs. Whitmore’s mouth opened, then shut.

Evelyn leaned in. "If you think I’m hiding behind the Goldmann name, you’re mistaken. Nathan would’ve had you removed already. I’m being generous." Her tone iced over. "I respect the dead. But you? You’re using your daughter’s tragedy to line your pockets. Do I look like a fool?"

Mr. Whitmore stayed silent, gripping his cane.

His wife shot up, chair screeching. "You can’t intimidate us! I’ve lived decades longer than you—"

"And yet," Evelyn stood, towering over her, "you only came now? Who put you up to this?" A pause. "Tell your puppet master I’m not as easily manipulated as you."

She turned to leave, then glanced back. "Oh, and I recorded this entire conversation. Unless you want more trouble, I’d stay quiet."

Outside, Chloe hurried after her. "Did you really record them?"

Evelyn smirked. "Bluffing. But they’ll report it to their handler."

Chloe grinned. "Psychological warfare. Nice."

The autumn wind carried their laughter as they vanished into the city’s pulse.
###Chapter 365

Evelyn studied Chloe's expression carefully. "If they were truly being manipulated, they wouldn't have the courage to act out like this."

If no one had put them up to it, they wouldn’t have known about the feud between Winifred and Evelyn at the training camp.

Nor would they have dared to accuse Evelyn of being responsible for Winifred’s death.

Which meant whoever was behind them had to be someone close to Winifred.

At CKGOLD—

Nathan was on a call, his fingers flipping through a file on his desk. His gaze darkened as he scanned the contents.

"Keep monitoring them. And dig into Winifred’s parents—find out who they’ve been in contact with recently."

The person on the other end responded, and Nathan ended the call.

At the same moment, his phone buzzed with a new message.

From Chloe.

[Mr. Goldmann, Evelyn handled it!]

A flicker of warmth softened the ice in his eyes. His clever wife had already dealt with the two troublemakers.

Now it was his turn to take care of the rest.

The accusations from the Whitmores vanished from the internet almost instantly. Any attempt to access the links led to an error page.

Within hours, a new hashtag began trending.

#EvelynIsInnocent

It sat comfortably at number five—visible, but not suspiciously pushed.

Insiders from the training camp came forward, detailing the toxic dynamic between Winifred and Evelyn.

They painted a clear picture: Evelyn had been the victim, while Winifred was the relentless aggressor.

Evelyn had never laid a finger on Winifred, yet the latter had constantly provoked her, rallying others to ostracize her.

Winifred had even orchestrated a boycott against Evelyn—only to be publicly humiliated in return.

Someone even leaked Evelyn’s training results, proving she had endured the same grueling regimen as everyone else.

No special treatment. No shortcuts.

The post went viral.

#Now I get why Mr. Goldmann married her. Gorgeous AND badass!

#Why did Winifred think she could bully her? Evelyn was just playing along while being the boss’s wife all along.

#While the haters were typing, Zara was busy becoming an internationally renowned jewelry designer.

At Blue Bay Villa—

Evelyn lounged on the couch, scrolling through Twitter on her tablet.

Her gaze flickered toward the kitchen, where her husband was cooking.

A smirk tugged at her lips. "Nathan, did you clean up the Whitmore mess?"

Nathan, clad in a slate-blue cardigan over a crisp white shirt, looked effortlessly elegant.

He plated the freshly seared fish before answering, "I couldn’t let my wife’s reputation suffer, could I?"

Evelyn set the tablet aside and sauntered to the dining table, where Nathan had laid out their meal.

She arched a brow. "I’m starting to think having a husband who cooks isn’t so bad."

Nathan stepped behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist. His breath tickled her ear as he murmured, "Then how will you reward me?"

She shivered slightly, laughing under her breath. "Dinner first."

Nathan pressed a lingering kiss to the curve of her neck. "I’ll share some good news after we eat."

Her curiosity piqued. "What good news?"

He tapped the tip of her nose playfully. "Eat now, or… I might just have to eat you instead."
###Chapter 366

Nathan's lips curled into a wicked grin, leaving Evelyn momentarily speechless.

After dinner, Evelyn returned to their room to find Nathan lounging in an armchair by the window, one leg crossed over the other, his fingers idly tracing the edges of a document.

"What is it you wanted to show me?" Evelyn approached and settled beside him.

Nathan handed her the file, his voice smooth. "The answers you've been looking for."

Evelyn frowned, taking the papers. Her eyes scanned the contents quickly.

Property of N?vel(D)ra/ma.Org.

The images were photocopies, slightly faded but still clear. Then, one photo seized her attention—a security still from a reflexology center.

The woman in heavy makeup was unmistakably Vivian, deep in conversation with three others.

"This is... Vivian?"

"Yes." Nathan's tone was calm. "I had someone retrieve the footage from the Underground Freeway. These are the people who took her."

Evelyn studied the figures—two men and a woman. The woman wore a mask, her presence unsettlingly enigmatic.

Another photo showed a location near the Vanderbilt estate. This time, only one man stood with Vivian.

His face was obscured by a hat and mask, as if he knew the intersection was under surveillance.

"So, this man is one of the two who took Vivian?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. Though Vivian had confessed to orchestrating Richard’s accident, the true mastermind had manipulated her—forcing Evelyn to leave Nathan by implicating Theodore.

They had exploited Theodore’s recent meeting with her father, making it seem like he was responsible.

But Vivian didn’t know about Evelyn’s strained relationship with Theodore. Only one person would dare use him like this.

Was that woman also behind the Winters incident?

Noticing her expression, Nathan pulled her close, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

"Zoe, I think you already know who she is, don’t you?"

Evelyn tilted her head, lips pursed. "She’s helped your family for years. Not to mention, she’s your childhood friend. Aren’t you worried I’ll confront her after this?"

Nathan chuckled. "Are you jealous?"

"I’m not." She huffed.

His arms tightened around her, pulling her onto his lap. "You are. She met me first, and my family adores her."

Evelyn looped her arms around his neck, defiant. "Then I should take comfort in being the first to sleep with you, shouldn’t I?"

Nathan’s eyes gleamed with amusement.

His little wife was growing bolder by the day.

He cupped her chin, smirking. "Oh? And how can you be so sure you were the first?"

Evelyn fell silent. Instantly, Nathan regretted his words.

Would she kick him out now?

But then, her cheeks flushed as she muttered, "If you’d been with other women before, you wouldn’t have been so... inexperienced that night."

Nathan’s expression darkened dangerously.

Before she could react, he hauled her up and tossed her onto the bed.

"Are you saying I was bad that night?" His voice was low, a devilish smirk playing on his lips.

"Then I’ll just have to prove you wrong tonight."

He wouldn’t let her go, no matter how much she begged.

By the time dawn approached, Evelyn’s voice was hoarse, her body limp as if every bone had melted away.
###Chapter 367

Evelyn was so drained that she barely registered when Nathan carried her to the bathroom to wash up.

By the time he tucked her back into bed, his phone buzzed sharply on the nightstand.

Nathan picked it up, his expression hardening as he read the message.

[Harrison: The Whitmores were in a car crash. Mrs. Whitmore died instantly. Mr. Whitmore is in critical condition.]

[Nathan: Secure the hospital. No one gets near him. And keep this from Chloe for now.]

He set the phone down and glanced at Evelyn, already deep in sleep.

He refused to let her blame herself for this tragedy.

Dressing quickly, he slipped out without a sound.

At the hospital…

"Mr. Goldmann." Harrison stepped forward the moment Nathan arrived. "The ICU is under surveillance. No updates on Mr. Whitmore yet."

"What did the police say?" Nathan asked.

Harrison frowned. "According to them, the car lost control on the highway and hit the divider. The driver and Mrs. Whitmore died on impact."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Why were they out so late?"

"The crash happened on the outbound route. They were probably heading home."

After taking hush money, only to meet disaster on the way back. Harrison didn’t believe in coincidences.

Just then, a doctor emerged. "Family of Mr. Whitmore?"

Harrison stepped forward. "How is he?"

The doctor removed his mask. "His ribs punctured a lung. He survived surgery, but his condition is unstable. We can’t predict when he’ll wake up."

Mrs. Whitmore hadn’t been so lucky. And if Mr. Whitmore woke up to that news…

Nathan gripped Harrison’s shoulder. "Handle this."

Harrison nodded. "Understood."

The next morning…

Evelyn stirred, only to be pulled back into warm arms.

Nathan nuzzled her neck, voice rough with sleep. "Stay."

"Did you turn into a thief last night?" she teased, surprised he wasn’t already up.

His lips curved against her skin. "I was busy with you."

Evelyn flushed, speechless.

Then she checked her phone—and bolted upright. "Oh no!"

Nathan sat up. "What?"

"Today’s my mother’s death anniversary. I have to go."

She rushed to the bathroom.

When she emerged, Nathan was fully dressed.

"I thought you wanted to sleep in?"

Buttoning his cuffs, he met her gaze. "I should pay respects to my future mother-in-law."

Evelyn froze.

Her grandfather, Harrison de Arma, was tied to his mother’s death. Yet here Nathan was, offering to go with her.

Cupping her face, he read her hesitation. "I told you before—I don’t hold you or your mother responsible. Stop overthinking."

His thumb brushed her cheek. "This is between me and the de Armas. Not you."
###Chapter 368

Evelyn still felt a pang of guilt for Nathan.

She traced the lines of his palm with her fingertips, her lashes casting shadows as she murmured, "Nathan, no matter what happens... I won't leave you. Unless—"

Unless what?

She hadn’t figured that part out yet.

The words had slipped out before she could stop them. Maybe it was because Nathan had endured so much for her sake. Or maybe it was the way he looked at her—like she was his entire world. She couldn’t explain it.

There was a time when she believed he was just a temporary fixture in her life, that his kindness was only for the sake of their three children.

But now?

Now she knew better.

Nathan had fought harder than anyone to keep them together.

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips, warmth flooding his gaze as he watched her. "Do you really think I’d let you go after everything I’ve done to keep you?" His voice was low, possessive. "The only way you’re leaving me is if I’m dead."

Evelyn scoffed, shattering the intensity of the moment. "Don’t be dramatic. You’ll outlive us all."

She turned on her heel and strode toward the walk-in closet, leaving him standing there, amused.

Nathan exhaled, satisfaction settling deep in his chest as he watched her rummage through her clothes.

She was his.

In every way that mattered.

And he would never let her forget it.

Later that evening, Evelyn and Nathan arrived at the Vanderbilt estate together. Richard blinked in surprise when he saw his son-in-law at the door.

"Dad," Evelyn began, offering an apologetic smile. "Would it be alright if Nathan comes with us to visit Mom?"

Richard chuckled, shaking his head. "Of course. You’re married—it’s only right."

The cemetery was nestled against the mountains, secluded but breathtaking. Richard had chosen it because Isabella had loved irises—symbols of hope and freedom.

Evelyn knelt before the polished marble, arranging the bouquet carefully. It had been too long since her last visit.

"Mom," she whispered, brushing her fingers over the engraved name. "I brought Dad... and my husband."

Nathan’s gaze flickered at the word husband, but he said nothing.

As Evelyn spoke softly to the grave, Richard and Nathan stepped away, giving her privacy.

Richard exhaled, staring at the horizon. "I never imagined Zoe’s mother was a de Arma."

Nathan tensed. His grandfather had already spoken to Richard, then.

"Don’t take his words to heart," Nathan said evenly.

Richard nodded. "I won’t. Even if your grandfather wants me to separate you two, I won’t interfere." He met Nathan’s eyes. "I know how much you love her."

A pause. Then Richard added, voice thick, "When her mother was alive... Zoe spent every day worrying. I failed her in so many ways. But seeing how you care for her now—it eases my guilt."

Nathan inclined his head. "I’ll always protect her. But tell me—do you know why her blood is special?"

Richard frowned. "What do you mean?"

Nathan studied him. It was clear Richard knew nothing.

He changed the subject.

But his mind lingered on one thought—

Professor Lennox better have answers soon.
###Chapter 369

Nathan approached Evelyn, finding her kneeling before her mother's gravestone with a sorrowful expression. He placed his hands gently on her shoulders, his gaze fixed on the marble memorial.

"Don't worry, Mom," he murmured, his voice steady. "I'll protect Zoe with my life. Till death do us part."

Evelyn looked up, startled by his words. Nathan merely arched an eyebrow in response, his usual confident smirk playing at his lips.

As he helped her rise, Evelyn turned to face Richard. "Dad, don't you have anything to say to Mom?"

Richard hesitated, his weathered face shadowed with unspoken grief. After a long moment staring at the tombstone, he gave a bitter smile. "No need. She already knows everything in my heart."

When Evelyn returned to her design studio later, she found Chloe pacing anxiously in the hallway. "What's wrong?" Evelyn asked, catching her friend's arm.

Chloe's eyes widened with urgency. "The police investigation into Winifred's death... It wasn't suicide after all."

'So Winifred was framed - someone's sacrificial lamb.'

Evelyn showed no surprise. "I suspected as much."

"The real culprit is dead too. Suicide." Chloe's voice dropped to a whisper.

Evelyn fell silent, absorbing this new information.

Chloe continued, "We've identified him. Former training camp member who left years ago. Knew the layout perfectly. But here's the mystery - only high-level personnel could've smuggled him in." Her face darkened. "Which means we've got a traitor among the supervisors."

Meanwhile, at the administrative offices...

Rosalind approached Nathan's desk with documents in hand, summarizing the project details professionally. Nathan closed the file abruptly, his piercing gaze locking onto her.

"Was Winifred your friend?" His question cut through the air like ice.

Rosalind stiffened momentarily before schooling her features into calm indifference. "We were acquainted. Why do you ask, Nathan?"

Nathan set the documents aside, his obsidian eyes unreadable. "You were the only one who knew about Winifred's feud with Evelyn, correct?"

Her grip tightened on the files. "Of course not. The entire camp knew about their... complicated relationship."

"Winifred's dead. Her parents too." Nathan's voice remained detached. "As her acquaintance, you don't seem particularly grieved."

He never looked up as he spoke, his tone clinical.

Rosalind lowered her head. "Grief changes nothing."

Nathan's pen stilled. He finally met her gaze, his expression frigid, before signing the documents with a sharp flourish. "Dismissed. Don't disturb me again."

As Rosalind exited, her mask slipped, revealing a storm of emotions beneath.

Passing the strategy department, she overheard staff whispering: "Meryl hasn't reported to work in nearly a week, has she?"

"Rumor says she resigned," another replied.

"Resigned? Then why are her personal effects still here?"

Their eyes drifted to the conspicuously full workstation.

Rosalind hurried to her office, slamming the documents down. A thought struck her, and she hastily typed a message: [Nathan's suspicious. Evacuate Bassburgh immediately.]
###Chapter 370

Golden Lounge

The lounge was nearly empty during daylight hours, with only a handful of patrons scattered across the polished marble floor.

Evelyn followed the waiter through the dimly lit space, her heels clicking softly against the tiles.

At a secluded corner table, Edmund Lincoln waited, his fingers tracing the label of a rare vintage Conti.

"Uncle Edmund."

He looked up, his sharp eyes softening as he set the bottle back into its velvet-lined box.

"Evelyn, you're here."

She slid into the plush chair opposite him, her gaze flickering to the wine. "A gift?"

Edmund chuckled. "An old friend just returned from abroad. He left it for me before heading out."

Leaning forward, he studied her. "So, what brings you to me today?"

Evelyn rested her chin on her palm, a faint smile playing on her lips. "I came to thank you for your help."

Edmund smirked, signaling the waiter for coffee. "Cut the formalities. What do you really want?"

Her smile faded as she straightened. "Today is my mother’s death anniversary."

A shadow crossed Edmund’s face. He exhaled slowly. "I’d forgotten. It’s been so many years."

"Uncle Edmund," Evelyn pressed, "Mrs. Laurent told me my mother died from a rare illness. What kind of illness was it?"

His fingers tightened around his glass. When the waiter returned with coffee, he pushed the cup toward her. "Zoe, I can’t tell you that. Not yet."

"That’s what you always say."

"And it’s always true." His voice hardened. "Your mother made me promise to protect you. Some truths aren’t safe."

Evelyn clenched her jaw, lifting the cup to her lips. The bitterness matched the tension in her chest.

Edmund stared out the window, his expression distant. "I’m serious. There are things you shouldn’t know—especially now."

Especially with Nathan in her life.

"Why?" she demanded.

His sigh was barely audible. "Because your blood isn’t ordinary, Evelyn. And if the wrong people find out—"

"My blood?"

The memory of the hospital flashed through her mind—the doctor’s probing questions after Laura’s attack.

"Is it really that unusual?"

Edmund nodded. "Think about it. Have you ever been seriously ill?"

Evelyn froze.

She hadn’t.

Not even a fever as a child.

When a virus swept through her college dorm, she was the only one untouched.

"Uncle Edmund, why is my blood like this?"

He lowered his voice. "It’s connected to your mother’s illness. But you’re luckier than she was. If you were infected… the survival rate is less than half."

"Infected?" Her fingers trembled around the cup.

Edmund’s gaze darkened. "Genetic infection. And if it happens, Evelyn… there’s no cure."
###Chapter 371: Midnight at Sapphire Cove

The aroma of roasted rosemary chicken filled the air as Evelyn set the dining table. Her fingers paused mid-air, remembering the afternoon conversation with Edmund. The silver fork slipped from her grasp, clattering against the porcelain plate.

The sound snapped her back to reality.

Nathan wasn't downstairs.

She climbed the spiral staircase, her silk robe whispering against the marble steps. The study door stood ajar, revealing Nathan's tense profile illuminated by the desk lamp.

"Engine malfunction? You're certain?" His voice was sharp as shattered crystal.

Evelyn's outstretched hand froze.

What engine failure?

"Mr. Whitmore hasn't regained consciousness?"

"I understand."

"Coordinate with the investigators. Check their recent communications and bank transactions."

Nathan turned abruptly, catching Evelyn in the doorway. The lamplight carved shadows beneath his eyes. "Zoe, you—"

"I heard everything." Her voice remained steady as a metronome. "The Whitmores had an accident?"

His hands settled on her shoulders, warm anchors in the gathering storm. "Police are investigating. Oliver's handling our inquiry."

Evelyn's lashes cast spiderweb shadows across her cheeks. The Whitmores' faces flashed behind her eyelids—their nervous twitches, the way Mrs. Whitmore had clutched her pearls.

Gone. Just like that.

"Mr. Whitmore survived." Nathan's thumb traced her collarbone. "Clever bastard left breadcrumbs when they took him. That's how Harrison's team found him in time."

Her pulse jumped beneath his touch. "Rosalind?"

"Alibi confirmed." Ice crystallized in his tone. "Two suspects fled, but they won't get far. I've had the city sealed."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "Do they know he's alive?"

Nathan tucked a stray curl behind her ear. "Rosalind thinks they're both dead. Only our inner circle knows the truth."

The grandfather clock ticked like a countdown.

"You knew." Evelyn's accusation hung between them. "And weren't going to tell me."

His exhale stirred her hair. "The accident happened hours after your visit. I wanted to shield you."

A hollow laugh escaped her. "I threatened them to smoke out their puppet master. Never imagined—"

Nathan's embrace swallowed her words. His lips brushed her crown. "Not your fault. Their employer was always going to silence them. Whitmore must've realized the trap."

She tilted her head up. "Regretted it?"

"Enough to leave clues." His breath warmed her temple. "He didn't trust them. Found something that scared him."

The puzzle pieces shifted behind Evelyn's eyes.

Of course. The Whitmores were disposable pawns. But Mr. Whitmore turned the tables—too late to save his wife.

Her fingers curled into Nathan's shirt. "If they learn he survived..."

"They'll come for him." Nathan's grip tightened. "Which makes him our best bait."

A spark ignited in Evelyn's gaze. She rose onto her toes, arms encircling his neck. "Then let's make sure the puppet master knows their puppet still breathes. Nothing panics a killer like a witness who won't stay dead."
###Chapter 372

"They won't spare a single soul." Nathan's piercing gaze met Evelyn's. "Are you trying to draw the mastermind into the open?"

A slow, calculated smile spread across Evelyn's lips. "Do you think you can handle it?"

She felt the heat of his palm through the fabric at her waist as he lowered his eyes with a dark chuckle. "Worth every risk."

At Goldmann Corporation headquarters...

The break room buzzed with hushed whispers as employees clustered around takeout containers. "Did you hear? That Whitmore couple who harassed Mrs. Goldmann died in a car crash."

"Obviously. The 16th floor staff said they had the audacity to blame Mrs. Goldmann for their daughter's death and demanded compensation."

"Confirmed days ago. Honestly, Mrs. Goldmann suffered enough injustice. What was that girl's name again? Winifred?"

Rosalind froze mid-step outside the ajar door, her grip tightening on the files until her knuckles turned white.

Through the narrow gap, she spotted three female staff members exchanging gossip over salads.

"Who did Mrs. Goldmann piss off this time? She's been drowning in scandals lately. Serves those greedy parents right - karma's a bitch."

"Enough already. Didn't the husband survive? Wife died instantly, but he's clinging to life. Talk about twisted luck."

Rosalind's manicured nails dug into the folders as her face twisted into something venomous.

'Useless idiots! How could they let that old fool live?'

'He's seen my face. That walking corpse needs to disappear.'

At Viana Jewelry Studio...

Chloe burst into Evelyn's office without knocking. "Evelyn! Emergency! The Whitmores—"

Her words died as she took in the scene: Nathan feeding Evelyn a forkful of pasta with intimate familiarity.

Chloe turned to stone.

'Not this again!'

Evelyn snatched the fork from Nathan's hand, cheeks flaming.

'Thank God we were just eating!'

Nathan's glacial stare pinned Chloe in place, his displeasure palpable. She broke into nervous sweat. "I'll... come back later."

"Get in here. Now."

"Yes sir!" Chloe scurried inside, perching on the sofa edge. "Mr. Goldmann, Evelyn, how can you two be so relaxed? The Whitmore accident is spreading through the company like wildfire!"

"We know." Evelyn sipped her soup calmly. "Let the rumors run their course. We're just waiting for the finale."

Chloe blinked. "What finale?"

Before Evelyn could explain, Nathan massaged his temples. "Go find Oliver. He'll brief you."

"Oh." Chloe stood, backing toward the door.

Evelyn turned to Nathan. "Why not tell her yourself?"

He twirled a lock of her hair around his finger. "Chloe's too trusting with those close to her. She might accidentally warn Rosalind."

Understanding dawned. If Chloe knew the plan and Rosalind questioned her...

'That's why he sent her to Oliver. He'll teach her discretion.'

Evelyn smirked. "Isn't throwing her to the wolves a bit harsh?"

Nathan's gaze darkened. "Some lessons must be learned through pain. But don't worry - between Oliver and Harrison, she'll be protected enough to learn without breaking."
###Chapter 373

Evelyn rested her hand on Nathan's shoulder. "Is Oliver prepared?"

Nathan arched a brow. "What do you think?"

That night—

The ICU ward stood eerily unguarded.

As the night nurse made her rounds, she spotted a doctor passing by and offered a polite nod.

The doctor returned the gesture before striding toward the ICU.

Once the nurse disappeared around the corner, he pushed the door open and slipped inside. The dim glow from the hallway illuminated the figure lying motionless on the bed.

He withdrew a vial and syringe from his coat pocket.

Just as the needle pierced the IV bag, the overhead lights blazed to life.

A fist collided with his jaw before he could react, sending him crashing to the floor.

Chloe stood over him, her expression icy. Behind her, Oliver motioned for the bodyguards to restrain the man.

The mask was ripped away, revealing a face twisted in fury.

"You?" he spat.

Oliver checked his watch, lips curving. "I had a feeling you wouldn't resist the bait."

Realization dawned in the man's eyes.

A trap.

"Take him away," Oliver ordered.

At Blue Bay Villa—

Nathan's phone buzzed with a message.

[Sir, target secured at Summer Pavilion.]

Evelyn emerged from the bathroom, damp hair clinging to her shoulders. A silk robe draped over her frame as she caught him reading the screen. "Did it work?"

Nathan smirked. "Like clockwork."

"If they're this desperate to silence Mr. Whitmore, he must know something explosive." She reached for the hairdryer, fingers combing through her tangled waves.

Exactly.

Nathan's gaze darkened as it trailed over her. The thin fabric of her nightgown clung to every curve, the motion of her arms lifting as she dried her hair hypnotic.

Desire coiled low in his gut.

Before she could finish, he appeared behind her, plucking the dryer from her grasp.

"Nathan, I'm not—"

"Heat damages the strands," he murmured, fingers threading through her locks. His voice dropped to a sinful whisper. "I have a better method."

Evelyn met his reflection's gaze, suspicion flickering. "That's not what you're thinking, is it?"

A low chuckle rumbled against her back as his hands—

"Seems you're learning my tells." His lips traced the slope of her shoulder, teeth grazing sensitive skin.

She gasped as he spun her around, her back hitting the dresser. "Wait—we have to—"

"Plenty of time."

He claimed her with ruthless precision, drinking in every shudder, every breathless gasp. Her nails scored his shoulders as she arched against him—

Summer Pavilion

The captive groaned as another punch landed in his gut, blood speckling the floor.

Nathan draped his coat over Evelyn's shoulders, shielding her from the brutality. "Zoe, wait outside."

She had followed him into the private room, only to witness the interrogation in progress.

The man in black sneered, wiping his knuckles. "Still feeling stubborn, bastard?"
###Chapter 374

Evelyn glanced at him and murmured, "Don't worry about me. I'm not so fragile that I can't handle this."

Some people couldn't stomach bloodshed or brutality. Those with weaker constitutions might find such scenes unbearable. She might not be accustomed to it, but she could endure it.

Nathan merely smirked.

Oliver cleared his throat, and the men in black halted.

The beaten man, his nose broken and face swollen, grinned through bloodied lips. "No matter what you do to me... I won't talk. Go ahead—kill me if you dare."

One of the black-clad men approached Nathan respectfully. "Mr. Goldmann, this bastard's stubborn as a mule. We've beaten him senseless, but he refuses to name anyone else."

Nathan's icy gaze settled on the man as he replied coolly, "If he enjoys suffering so much, let's indulge him."

Nathan guided Evelyn to the couch, sat down, and leisurely accepted a glass of wine from a servant.

One of the men hesitated, glancing at Evelyn. "Sir, with Mrs. Goldmann present... if we're too ruthless..."

They worried their brutality might frighten her.

Before Nathan could respond, Evelyn smiled serenely. "It's fine. Do what you must—just don't kill him."

She added softly, "He's taken a life. Death would be too easy for him."

Nathan studied her, a faint brow raised.

The men exchanged surprised looks.

Mrs. Goldmann is far more ruthless than she appears.

One of them nodded. "Since Mrs. Goldmann has spoken, we won't hold back."

The captive snarled through gritted teeth, "F*cking cowards! Just kill me already!"

Oliver, standing nearby, lifted his foot and kicked the man square in the head.

The impact sent him crashing into the wall. He blacked out momentarily, unable to rise.

It was the first time Evelyn had seen Oliver—usually so composed—act with such ferocity.

Oliver removed his coat, slipped on brass knuckles, and stared down at the man. "Killing you now would be mercy. And you don't deserve that."

The man was battered to the brink of death, yet he never begged for mercy—as if welcoming it. From start to finish, he betrayed no one.

When the man finally stopped moving, Oliver approached Nathan. "He's unconscious."

Nathan swirled the wine in his glass, his expression dark. "Wake him."

A bucket of ice water was dumped over the man's head.

He gasped awake, his will to live shattered. His voice was a ragged whisper. "Just... end it..."

Evelyn's lashes flickered. Just as they moved to resume, she suddenly said, "Wait."

The men paused, glancing back at her. Even Oliver looked puzzled.

Nathan watched calmly as Evelyn stood and walked toward the captive.

Oliver intercepted her before she got too close. "Ms. Vanderbilt, it's best not to approach him. He might—"

"He can't hurt me with all of you here." She patted his shoulder reassuringly.

Oliver reluctantly stepped aside as Evelyn crouched before the man. "Do you have a family?"

The man's pupils dilated slightly before he clenched his jaw shut.

Silence often spoke volumes.

Evelyn nodded. "So you do." Her voice softened with something like pity. "You have people waiting for you, yet you're willing to die for some faceless employer. There are only two reasons for that: either your family's safety is being threatened... or you're protecting them from retaliation."

The man wheezed, "No..."
###Chapter 375

Evelyn let out a soft chuckle. "Your pupils dilated the moment I asked you that question. That tells me everything."

She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. "And the hesitation before you answered? That was the real giveaway."

"I already told you—no!"

The man's composure shattered. His body tensed, muscles coiling as if he were about to lunge at her.

But before he could move, two men in black suits pinned him to the ground.

Evelyn blinked, startled for only a second before regaining her poise. She rose gracefully, her gaze cool as she looked down at him.

"Whether it's fear or loyalty driving you, ask yourself this—do you really have the power to protect them?" Her voice was soft, almost pitying. "You saw what happened to the Whitmores. You orchestrated it. So tell me, do you think you're untouchable?"

The man lay motionless, his hollow stare fixed on some distant point. Whether he had surrendered or simply run out of fight, it was impossible to tell.

Nathan stepped forward, sliding an arm around Evelyn's shoulders. He glanced at Oliver. "Keep him under surveillance. Let him stew on it for a while."

Oliver nodded.

Once outside, Nathan abruptly swept Evelyn into his arms, carrying her to the car. He deposited her onto the seat, then caged her in, one arm braced against the headrest.

His fingers tipped her chin up, forcing her to meet his gaze. A slow, dangerous smirk curled his lips.

"Zoe," he murmured, "since when did you learn to read people like that?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why wouldn't I know?"

Nathan's gaze burned into her, intense and unrelenting. She turned her face slightly, exhaling.

"Liam has a thing for psychology books. I skim them sometimes when I'm bored. So—mmph!"

His lips crashed against hers, swallowing her words. By the time he pulled back, she was breathless.

Nathan traced her swollen lower lip with his thumb, his chuckle low and satisfied. "My wife is brilliant. What a treasure I've found."

Evelyn shoved him lightly and buckled her seatbelt. "I was bluffing. He gave himself away."

Nathan smirked. "That old fool thought you weren't fit to be a Goldmann. Biggest mistake of his life."

Her tone turned sharp. "In his eyes, Rosalind would've been the perfect choice."

"Jealous again?" Amusement danced in his eyes.

Evelyn ignored him. "What if he never talks?"

"We already know who's pulling the strings. His confession doesn't matter." Nathan leaned in, brushing his lips against her forehead. His breath stirred the strands of hair framing her face. "Panic spreads. And when it does, she'll slip up."

The next day, at Blackgold Group

Rosalind approached the administrative office, her hand raised to knock—when a familiar voice stopped her cold.

"Ms. Summers."

Evelyn strode toward her, heels clicking against the marble floor.

Rosalind's expression darkened, though she forced a polite smile. "Ms. Vanderbilt. What brings you here?"

Why is this woman always in my way?

Evelyn tilted her head. "You’ve heard about last night’s incident, haven’t you?"

Rosalind’s smile stiffened. "I’m not sure what you mean."

Evelyn’s lips curved, though her eyes remained icy. "Mr. Whitmore was attacked in the hospital last night."

A flicker of tension crossed Rosalind’s face before she schooled her features.

Damn it. Does she know?

"I have no idea what you’re talking about." She forced a laugh, feigning innocence. "Ms. Vanderbilt, why do you always target me? If this is about Nathan, you’ve already won. Why bother with me?"

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Funny. The man we caught last night claims he knows you."
###Chapter 376

A sudden realization dawned on Rosalind, her expression shifting subtly. "Evelyn, don't you dare try to frame me without proof!"

"I'm not framing anyone." Evelyn's face blossomed into a radiant smile. "What makes you think I'd do that? Even if that man acted alone, he claimed to know you. I was merely asking."

Evelyn made to enter the office but paused dramatically. "Come to think of it, do you recall that man had rough, scarred skin?"

"That's impossible—"

Rosalind's throat constricted mid-sentence. Her shoulders trembled visibly as the color drained from her face.

As Evelyn stepped inside, Rosalind grabbed her arm urgently. "You'd better explain yourself clearly—"

The sight of Nathan sitting in the office chair made Rosalind's stomach drop with terrifying clarity.

"Nathan, I—"

"Seems he really was working for you after all."

His casual remark turned Rosalind's complexion ghostly white. The trap had been set, and she'd walked right into it. That old fool's survival had sealed her fate. She couldn't let them win. Her fingers tightened around her phone, secretly dialing a number.

"Nathan, I swear I'm not involved!" Rosalind rushed forward desperately. "I don't know why Ms. Vanderbilt would accuse me like this. Nathan, please believe me, I would never—"

"Never do this?"

Nathan's icy interruption froze her words. The office atmosphere turned oppressive, thick with tension. Rosalind's breathing grew erratic.

Her fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms. Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered, "Why are you doing this to me?"

Nathan lounged in his chair, his amber eyes darkening dangerously. "You know exactly what you've done."

A single crystalline tear traced down Rosalind's cheek.

"Vivian confessed everything," Nathan stated calmly. "She mentioned 'Lady Wolfsbane,' not Rosalind Summers." His tone made clear he'd never trusted her.

Rosalind shuddered violently. "Yes, I helped Vivian escape. But what does that prove? I let her out, but she's the one who sought revenge against Evelyn! How is that my fault? I admit I learned about Evelyn's connection to the de Armas from Vivian and told Grandfather, but it was for his own good!"

Nathan's gaze remained frigid. "So you manipulated Grandfather's trust. Used him to approach Richard and assist Vivian's attack—just to pin everything on him?"

"Nathan, no! I wasn't using him! Vivian hated Evelyn! How can you blame me for her actions? You're believing the wrong person!"

A humorless chuckle escaped Nathan. "I've reduced Vivian to a limbless cripple. She confessed everything to stay alive. Do you honestly think I'd spare her if she lied?"

Rosalind's entire body shook.

Nathan's expression hardened like tempered steel. "You've been trying to manipulate me since The Jade Store auction. I stopped trusting you the moment you brought me that photo of Zoe and Felix."
###Chapter 377

The air in the office was thick with tension.

"Rosalind, you know my boundaries, yet you chose to cross them." Nathan's voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. "And now you expect my trust?"

Rosalind Summers stood frozen, her lips parting but no words escaping.

Nathan didn’t give her the chance to explain. "I could have overlooked your attempts to manipulate things between Zoe and me. But when you involved my grandfather—when you whispered lies behind our backs—there’s nothing left to discuss."

Rosalind’s face paled, her fingers curling into tight fists. "Then why didn’t you expose me in front of Theodore?"

A cold smirk played on Nathan’s lips. "Because he trusted you. I wanted to see how far you’d go."

Her knees nearly buckled beneath her.

Evelyn turned, her gaze sharp. "Were you involved in Winifred’s case too?"

Rosalind’s eyes flashed with defiance. "What does Winifred’s case have to do with me?"

Evelyn’s voice remained steady. "You knew about the rivalry between Winifred and me in the training camp. If something had happened to me, she would’ve been the prime suspect."

She took a step closer. "But Winifred never admitted to the snake incident. And then, suddenly, she took her own life."

Rosalind’s jaw clenched. "I don’t know anything about that."

"Someone familiar with the camp layout could’ve easily slipped in unnoticed," Evelyn mused. "Someone who knew the routines, the blind spots."

Her eyes locked onto Rosalind’s. "Who else would want me dead, if not the person who sees me as an obstacle?"

A bead of sweat trickled down Rosalind’s temple, hidden beneath her hairline. Her grip on her shirt was so tight the fabric wrinkled.

Then, the office door swung open.

Theodore Goldmann stood there, his sharp gaze sweeping over the scene. His frown deepened as he took in Rosalind’s red-rimmed eyes. "What’s going on here?"

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard by his sudden appearance.

Nathan’s expression darkened, suspicion flickering in his eyes.

Rosalind seized the opportunity. "Grandfather, it’s my fault. I made a mistake." Her voice trembled with false remorse. "I don’t deserve to be Nathan’s special assistant anymore."

Theodore’s expression hardened as he turned to Nathan and Evelyn. "What has she done to warrant this?"

Before Evelyn could speak, Rosalind cut in. "I—I treated Ms. Vanderbilt poorly because of her connection to the de Armas family. I was wrong."

She knew Theodore well. Admitting fault first was her only chance to regain his favor.

Evelyn opened her mouth, but Nathan spoke first. "Is that all you did?"

Rosalind’s eyes welled with tears, the picture of wounded innocence. "Nathan, I know you hate me, but everything I did was for the Goldmanns." Her voice cracked. "I admit I tried to drive Ms. Vanderbilt away from you—but I never harmed her!"

The lie hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 378

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Ever since Rosalind had leaked information to Nathan, they had suspected her involvement in those incidents.

When Evelyn had tried to trick her with the photo of the man, Rosalind panicked and confessed that the person she sent wasn’t the one they were discussing—she couldn’t even confirm if he had been caught.

It was clear she was the reason Theodore had shown up.

Theodore frowned. "This is just a minor issue. There’s no need to blow it out of proportion." His trust in Rosalind remained unshaken.

Nathan’s gaze hardened. He scoffed. "Is murder a minor issue?" His tone left no room for argument.

Theodore’s expression darkened as he turned to Rosalind.

Rosalind desperately denied the accusation, her voice trembling. "Grandpa, I didn’t do it! I’ve been by your side all this time. You know me!" She meant to imply she would never harm anyone.

Theodore hesitated. Rosalind had been his loyal companion for years, never stepping out of line. He dismissed Nathan’s suspicions as mere prejudice and made a concession. "If you dislike Rosalind’s presence, just bring Oliver back."

Rosalind lowered her head, her eyes burning with hatred. Staying by Nathan’s side no longer mattered—they had set a trap for her, suspecting her all along.

She was fortunate Theodore still believed in her, but she couldn’t stay idle. Now that the truth was out, she had to act fast.

Nathan remained expressionless, as if he had already predicted the outcome. His silence was heavy, his jaw clenched.

Theodore ordered Rosalind to leave first before turning to Nathan sternly. "Rosalind grew up with us. No matter your disdain for her, you will treat her with respect—for Uncle Summers’ sake."

Nathan’s voice was icy. "The Summers family raised you, but I owe them nothing. I don’t have to be kind to them." Respect was the last thing on his mind.

"You—" Theodore choked on his words, shooting Evelyn a glare before storming out.

Evelyn sighed. Had she just been labeled the instigator?

Nathan pulled her into his arms. "Upset?" His voice was soft, referring to how things had unfolded.

Evelyn had expected Theodore to defend Rosalind, but his blind trust still stung. "A little."

Nathan tilted her chin up, brushing his thumb over her lips. "We’re not completely empty-handed."

Evelyn paused. They hadn’t lost entirely—they had confirmed Rosalind’s involvement and uncovered the connection between Mr. Whitmore and the other man.

Nathan studied her. "Want to visit Mr. Whitmore at the hospital with me?"

Mr. Whitmore had been discreetly transferred to a private facility. Standing outside his ward, Evelyn glanced inside. "Has he woken up yet?"

Oliver shook his head. "Not yet. The doctors say it’s up to him now."

Evelyn stayed silent as Nathan asked, "Any leads on that man’s family?"

Oliver hesitated. "Yes, but it’s strange. Both his parents are deceased. He went through a divorce and had no close friends. He wasn’t protecting anyone, as you suspected."

Evelyn frowned. "Did I misjudge the situation?"
###Chapter 379

"You were right." Nathan spoke calmly, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the steering wheel. "Our initial investigation missed crucial details. The person he was protecting is likely involved as well."

Oliver's eyes widened slightly as a memory surfaced. "Now that you mention it, there were regular deposits into his account—every few months, like clockwork."

Nathan's brow arched. "Dig deeper."

When they left the hospital, Evelyn asked Nathan to drop her off at Viana Jewelry.

The sleek black car rolled to a stop at the entrance. Just as she reached for the door handle, Nathan's fingers wrapped around her wrist, his gaze intense. "You're really moving here?"

Their eyes locked for a long moment before she blinked, a wry smile playing on her lips. "I can't keep splitting myself in half. It's exhausting."

Relief flickered across his face when he confirmed it was purely work-related. "Fine. I'll pick you up tonight."

"Deal." Evelyn stepped out.

Inside her office, she found Sophia sprawled on the couch, devouring a takeout box. The rich aroma of garlic butter shrimp filled the air.

Spotting Evelyn, Sophia feigned outrage. "You moved offices without telling me? Do you know how much I spent on a cab to track you down at ckgold?"

Evelyn eyed the shopping bags piled beside her. "And these are?"

Sophia groaned dramatically. "I got into a fight with Dad. He cut off my cards and kicked me out. I’m down to my last twenty bucks. It’s sweltering outside, so I came here for the AC."

"Ms. Hill," Evelyn crossed her arms, "didn’t I give you the keys to my old place?"

Sophia winced. "The utilities got cut off. I may have forgotten to pay the bills… for three months."

Evelyn sank into the adjacent chair. "What was the fight about this time?"

Sophia shoved the last bite of food into her mouth. "Madam Laurent and Dad are conspiring to marry me off to Lucas. Even Aunt Lydia approved it. I was the last to know." She flopped back. "If I hadn’t fought back, we’d already be registered. I’m not freeloading—I’m escaping forced matrimony."

She stared at the ceiling as if contemplating the meaning of life. "What did I do to deserve this? Marrying Lucas would shave years off my lifespan."

Evelyn smirked. "He’s objectively handsome."

Lucas, her cousin and Caleb’s piano instructor, was the golden grandson of the de Armas dynasty—a catch for any socialite. Marriage alliances were commonplace among elites, and with the Hills, Laurents, and Bouchers so deeply intertwined, Sophia had been a target from the start.

Sophia bolted upright. "Handsome? That man lives to torment me! Marrying him would be a life sentence of misery. I’d die of sheer frustration."

Evelyn laughed. "Enemies-to-lovers is a classic trope."

Sophia grabbed her phone with mock solemnity. "I think it’s time to reevaluate our friendship."
###Chapter 380

Evelyn waved her hand dismissively. "Alright, I've covered all your expenses for the year. You really need to find a job. Even if you refuse to live like a socialite, you can't just be a freeloader forever."

Though the words stung, Sophia managed a bright smile. "I know it's embarrassing that you always have to bail me out, but I also know you do it because you care. Don't worry, I'll start job hunting this week!"

Meanwhile, at the Goldmann estate...

"Grandfather, you have to believe me—I had nothing to do with it."

Rosalind stood behind Theodore with her head bowed, playing the role of the wounded victim perfectly.

Theodore studied her carefully. "I want to believe you, Rosalind. But I need you to answer one question truthfully."

She pressed her lips together and nodded.

His voice turned grave. "Were you involved in the near-fatal incident with the children?"

Theodore could overlook many things, but the safety of his great-grandchildren was non-negotiable.

Rosalind shook her head vehemently, fists clenched. "It wasn't me. It was Vivian—Evelyn's stepsister. They've always despised each other. If I'd known Vivian was behind it, I never would have helped her off the streets."

Her remorse seemed genuine, but the absolute trust Theodore once had in her wavered. He exhaled sharply. "Remember this—I can protect you, but if I discover you had any part in harming those children, there will be no forgiveness."

Rosalind left the study, her tense shoulders finally relaxing. But her eyes remained icy.

She needed to redirect Theodore's suspicions—fast.

Midnight.

Rain lashed against the windows as a sleek black car cut through the storm. Nathan sat in the backseat, his expression darker than the night outside.

Oliver glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "Mr. Goldmann, I traced the account holder. It's the brother of the man we interrogated earlier."

"Where is he now?" Nathan's voice was eerily calm.

"At the military camp." Oliver hesitated. "He's... someone we know."

Nathan's gaze turned glacial. He said nothing.

Then, headlights flashed in the side mirrors.

"We're being followed," Nathan observed.

Oliver tightened his grip on the wheel. "I see them." He accelerated.

Blue Bay Villa.

Evelyn stepped out of the shower, towel-drying her hair. The rain had intensified, pounding against the windows.

Nathan had left hours ago for urgent business—why wasn't he back yet?

Her fingers trembled as she dialed his number. No answer.

She tried Oliver next. The moment he picked up, she demanded, "Where's Nathan?"

Oliver's reply made her blood run cold. She hung up, changed swiftly, and grabbed an umbrella before rushing out.

At the hospital, Evelyn sprinted down the corridor, spotting Oliver near the surgical wing. She seized his arm. "What happened? Where is he? Is he hurt?"

Oliver opened his mouth, but a familiar deep voice cut in from behind them.

"I'm right here."

Evelyn whirled around. Nathan stood there unharmed, his broad shoulders casting a shadow as he strode forward and pulled her into his arms.
###Chapter 381

The scent of rain clung to Nathan's clothes, mingling with his signature cologne and the crisp aroma of tobacco. The combination flooded Evelyn's senses as she stood frozen in the hospital corridor.

"I didn't mean to worry you." Her voice trembled slightly as she gently pushed him back. "Why are you all here? Is someone injured?"

Oliver rubbed his nose bridge with a wry smile. "Someone did get hurt, just not any of us."

Evelyn's brow furrowed in confusion. She turned her questioning gaze toward Nathan, who merely arched an eyebrow in response.

"Nathan!"

The sharp voice made Evelyn spin around. Theodore Goldmann and Rosalind Summers were striding down the hallway, their footsteps echoing against the sterile tiles.

Rosalind's eyes flickered with surprise when she saw the unharmed group, but she quickly masked it. "Are you alright, Nathan? The elder Mr. Goldmann rushed here when he heard about the accident."

Nathan ignored her, addressing Theodore directly. "I'm fine."

The tension visibly drained from Theodore's shoulders, though his voice remained gruff. "Explain what happened."

Oliver stepped forward. "We were ambushed by two vehicles on our way back. They tried to run us off the road, but ended up wrecking their own cars instead. We brought the drivers here for treatment."

Rosalind's fingers turned bone-white where they clutched her purse.

Theodore looked stunned. "Who would dare attack you? Have you identified them?"

"They're still unconscious," Oliver sighed. "We planned to question them when they wake up."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her mind racing. Who would be bold enough to target Nathan Goldmann?

A sudden warmth enveloped her hand. Nathan was tracing letters on her palm with his fingertip, a silent message that steadied her nerves.

The doctor approached. "Mr. Goldmann, your patients are awake."

Nathan nodded. Without a word, he turned toward the hospital room, the others following in his wake. Oliver glanced back at Rosalind. "Aren't you coming?"

Rosalind's entire frame trembled. She forced a weak smile, her steps leaden as she trailed behind.

This wasn't supposed to happen. Her men were supposed to succeed, not end up hospitalized themselves. What incompetent fools had Shane sent? At least she'd been smart enough not to involve herself directly.

The bandaged figure in the bed resembled a mummy, only his eyes and mouth visible through the wrappings. Oliver leaned in. "Who sent you?"

The patient's gaze darted to Rosalind.

Her already pale face drained of all color. Theodore followed the man's line of sight, and Rosalind blurted, "I would never hurt Nathan! This has nothing to do with me!"

She whirled on the injured man. "I don't even know you! Why are you trying to frame me?"

Damn Shane! What kind of amateur operation was this? They were supposed to blame the de Arma family, not look at her like some guilty conspirator. She'd prepared contingencies if they implicated Shane, but this? This was a disaster.

Had Shane betrayed her? The thought sent ice through her veins.
###Chapter 382

The man on the bed gasped weakly, his voice barely audible. "It's you. You're the one who sent us after him!"

Rosalind's face twisted in horror. "No! That's a lie! I would never—!"

Her exaggerated reaction made Theodore's brows furrow. His expression darkened as suspicion flickered in his gaze.

Seeing his doubt, Rosalind clutched his arm desperately. "Grandpa, don't listen to him! He's lying! Nathan is the man I love—why would I ever hurt him?"

Nathan's voice cut through the room like ice. "If it wasn't you, then who?"

Rosalind pressed a trembling hand to her chest, her eyes reddening. "Nathan, you know how much I love you. I would never—never—!" She spun toward the bed, her voice rising hysterically. "Who are you? Why are you framing me?!"

Oliver swiftly pulled her back before she could lunge forward. Rosalind looked every bit the wronged innocent—frantic, tearful, desperate.

Evelyn watched in silence, her fingers curling into her palm. If Nathan hadn't traced his plan onto her skin earlier, she might have believed the de Arma family was truly behind this.

Nathan's lips curved into a cold smile. "Really? You're certain it was the de Armas?"

"You have to believe me, Nathan! It must be them—!"

"Then why would he accuse you?" Nathan's gaze sharpened. "Do you even know anyone from the de Arma family?"

Rosalind froze.

"No," she whispered, shaking her head. "I don't. I don't know why they'd—"

"Enough." Theodore's voice cracked like thunder. His face was stern, his patience worn thin. "If the de Armas wanted Nathan dead, he wouldn't be standing here now. I may be old, but I'm not a fool. Rosalind—tell me the truth. Did you send them?"

Rosalind dropped to her knees before him, tears streaming. "Grandpa, I swear it wasn't me!"

Theodore closed his eyes. He had raised Rosalind—watched her grow. The thought of her betrayal was unbearable.

When he opened them again, her tear-streaked face stared back. His expression softened slightly. "Get up."

Then, turning to Oliver, he commanded, "Find out who's truly responsible."

Oliver nodded smoothly. "Understood, Elder Master Goldmann."

Nathan stepped forward, his tone unreadable. "And if we do? Will you let me handle it?"

Theodore hesitated. Nathan never sought his approval—why now? The storm outside mirrored the tension in the room. Exhausted, Theodore waved a hand. "Do as you see fit."

Rosalind wiped her tears and clung to Theodore's arm. "I'll go back with you, Grandfather."

He nodded.

The moment they left, Oliver tapped the "injured" man's shoulder. Evelyn's eyes widened as he sat up, unwrapping the bandages with ease.

It was Nathan's bodyguard.

"Oliver, Mr. Goldmann—I nearly suffocated under all that gauze," he groaned, stretching. "But how was my performance? Convincing, right?"

Oliver smirked. "Excellent. Mr. Goldmann will reward you handsomely."

The man grinned. "Perfect! I'll take my leave, then."

Evelyn stared, stunned. "Wait—so this was all staged?"
###Chapter 383

When Nathan had mentioned there was a plan, Evelyn assumed he intended to expose Rosalind in front of Theodore.

Instead, he'd staged an elaborate performance with one of his men?

Oliver smirked, adjusting his cufflinks. "Ms. Vanderbilt, we didn't fabricate this. Someone did ambush Mr. Goldmann and me on our way back. The roads were slick from the rain. If not for my reflexes, we'd be the ones hospitalized."

He leaned in slightly. "The attackers weren’t badly hurt, so we handed them over to the authorities. After that, Mr. Goldmann suggested we… improvise."

Evelyn arched a brow, turning to Nathan. "And you're certain they were Rosalind’s men?"

Why would Rosalind, who’s supposedly in love with him, orchestrate this?

Nathan’s lips curved as he met her gaze. "The police interrogations confirmed it. Someone wanted them to frame the de Armas."

Evelyn recalled Rosalind’s insistence that the de Armas were responsible. Now it made sense—she’d been shifting blame to avoid Theodore’s suspicion.

Oliver nodded. "Exactly. We needed to expose her allies. After tonight, Elder Master Goldmann won’t trust her blindly anymore. And Rosalind? She’ll think her own people betrayed her."

Theodore’s faith in Rosalind had given her confidence. With her military training, she always had an exit strategy.

But desperation had clouded her judgment. She’d been too eager to prove her innocence. If Nathan had actually been hurt, Theodore would’ve blamed the de Armas without question.

Now, Rosalind would suspect her men had turned on her. And when she made her next move—they’d be ready.

After dismissing Oliver, Nathan took Evelyn back to Blue Bay Villa. The storm had eased, but his clothes were soaked.

Evelyn frowned, pressing a hand to his damp sleeve. "You’re drenched. Go shower before you catch a cold."

As she turned to leave, Nathan caught her wrist and pulled her against him. His arms circled her waist, his chin resting atop her head. His voice was soft, almost teasing. "Were you worried when you heard I was in the hospital?"

She scoffed. "Of course. You didn’t answer your phone, and Oliver said you’d been admitted." She pulled back just enough to glare at him. "Turns out, I panicked for nothing."

Nathan chuckled, thumb brushing her cheek. "Left my phone in the car. But I promise—no more scares like this."

Evelyn stayed silent.

His grip tightened slightly. "Are you angry?"

In one smooth motion, he lifted her onto the bed, caging her between his arms. His voice dropped, laced with sincerity. "Zoe, I’m sorry. It won’t happen again."

She just stared at him, lips pressed into a thin line.

"Hit me if it’ll make you feel better."

Before she could react, he grabbed her hand and smacked it against his own cheek—hard enough that her palm stung. She yanked back, eyes wide. "Are you insane?"

Nathan grinned, unrepentant. "So, forgiven?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, torn between irritation and amusement. "I will get mad if you don’t shower right now."

With a mock salute, he stood. "As you wish."

Minutes later, he emerged with a towel slung low on his hips, water glistening on his toned torso. He raked a hand through his damp hair, the motion effortlessly alluring.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Noticing her stare, Nathan smirked. He caught her wrist, tugging her flush against him. One hand splayed possessively at the small of her back.

"Like what you see?"
###Chapter 384

When Nathan had mentioned there was a plan, Evelyn assumed he intended to expose Rosalind in front of Theodore.

Instead, he'd staged an elaborate performance with one of his men?

Oliver flashed a mischievous grin. "Ms. Vanderbilt, this wasn't staged. We were genuinely ambushed on our way back."

Rain slicked the roads dangerously.

"If not for my expert driving, we'd be hospitalized right now. The attackers got off lightly - we handed them to the police."

He leaned closer. "After that, Mr. Goldmann suggested we... improvise a little theater."

Evelyn's gaze snapped to Nathan. "Are you certain they were Rosalind's people?"

Why would someone supposedly in love with Nathan orchestrate this?

Nathan's lips curved knowingly. "The suspects confessed everything at the station. Someone paid them to frame the de Armas family."

The realization struck Evelyn like lightning.

Rosalind had been so adamant about de Arma involvement earlier.

A perfect misdirection to avoid Theodore's suspicion.

Oliver nodded. "Precisely. We're flushing out Rosalind's network. After tonight, Elder Goldmann's trust in her will fracture."

His eyes gleamed. "Meanwhile, she'll suspect her own people betrayed her."

Theodore's blind faith had emboldened Rosalind.

Military training made her dangerously resourceful.

But desperation had clouded her judgment tonight.

Had Nathan actually been hurt, Theodore would've blamed the de Armas without question.

Now Rosalind would question her own allies' loyalty.

The trap was set - they merely needed to wait for her next move.

After briefing Oliver, Nathan escorted Evelyn back to Blue Bay Villa.

Midnight shadows stretched across their doorstep.

Evelyn frowned at Nathan's soaked attire. "You're drenched. Shower immediately before you catch pneumonia."

As she turned with his jacket, Nathan reeled her back against his chest.

His chin nestled in her hair. "Were you frightened when you heard I was hospitalized?"

"Terrified." Evelyn's voice flattened. "You ignored my calls. Then Oliver said you were in the ER."

She pivoted in his arms. "Turns out I worried for nothing."

Nathan caught her irritation and smiled apologetically. "Left my phone in the car."

His thumb traced her jawline. "I swear this won't happen again."

Evelyn remained silent.

"Are you angry?" Nathan swept her onto their bed, caging her beneath him.

"Zoe," he murmured, lips grazing her temple. "Forgive me?"

When she stayed quiet, Nathan guided her hand to his cheek.

"Hit me if it helps."

Her palm stung from the forceful contact. Evelyn recoiled. "Are you insane?"

Nathan nuzzled her neck. "Does this mean I'm forgiven?"

Evelyn fought a smile. "I'll really lose my temper if you don't shower soon."

Chuckling, Nathan rose. "As my lady commands."

Minutes later, he emerged with a towel slung low on his hips.

Water droplets glistened on his toned abdomen as he towel-dried his dark hair.

Evelyn's breath hitched at the sight.

Noticing her stare, Nathan smirked and pulled her against his damp body.

"Like what you see?" His hands settled possessively on her waist.
###Chapter 385

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper. "Even if Nathan's great-grandfather nearly died by your father's hand, you've already taken your revenge on his mother, haven't you? They owe you nothing now. Why can't you let the past stay buried?"

Two wrongs didn’t make a right. Why did this cycle of hatred have to poison the next generation?

Harrison's expression darkened. "They owe me nothing?"

His jaw tightened as he spoke, his voice eerily calm. "I will never forgive them. And you—you don’t even know the full extent of what they did to us."

Evelyn said nothing, her fingers digging into the fabric of her dress.

Then, without warning, Harrison turned and rolled up his pant leg. What she saw wasn’t flesh and bone—it was cold, unfeeling metal.

A prosthetic.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

"See this?" Harrison’s voice was laced with venom. "Philip Goldmann did this. He hacked off my leg when I was eight—just a child—to force my father out of politics." His hands clenched into fists. "The pain, the nightmares… they never left me. And the man who gave me this hell was Nathan’s great-grandfather."

Evelyn’s face paled.

Eight years old.

Harrison took a shuddering breath, struggling to regain his composure. "Philip swore to my father that if he stepped down, I’d be safe. But he lied. What else could you expect from a gutter rat who clawed his way up from the slums?"

His lips curled in disgust. "My father went after him for what he did to me. He should’ve thanked fate that he didn’t die that day. But when I turned sixteen and took over the de Arma family, my father suddenly dropped dead."

The hatred in his eyes was bone-deep, unshakable.

"And when I dug into his death, I learned the truth—about Philip, about his bastard child with the eldest princess." Harrison sneered.

Evelyn had heard fragments of this story from Nathan during their time in the training camp.

That "bastard" was Nathan’s grandfather—royal blood tainted by illegitimacy, a stain the Stoslo monarchy refused to acknowledge.

His entire life had been a battlefield, hunted for simply existing.

If Harrison’s words were true—if the Goldmanns had betrayed their word, if they had murdered his father—then their sins ran deeper than she’d ever imagined.

So why did the Goldmanns despise the de Armas so fiercely?

Was it really just about Nathan’s mother?

Something didn’t add up.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Are you absolutely certain Philip killed your father?"

Harrison scoffed. "Do I look like I’m joking? No one knows the Goldmanns’ true nature better than I do."

Her frown deepened.

Noticing her skepticism, Harrison leaned in. "Let me make this clear. If you value your life—or your children’s—stay away from the Goldmanns. My family isn’t their only enemy. Philip’s hands are drenched in blood, and the aristocracy hasn’t forgotten. You’re Isabella’s daughter, so I won’t touch you. But I can’t speak for the others."

His warning hung in the air like a blade.
###Chapter 386

Hernandez's words carried an edge, but they lacked the power to intimidate Evelyn.

She smiled coolly. "Rest assured, Sir Harrison. Even if the world turns against Nathan, I won't be among his enemies."

Evelyn had no intention of staying for lunch. With a polite nod, she excused herself and stepped out of the restaurant—only to collide with Rosalind and Theodore.

Rosalind's icy smirk made it clear she hadn't forgotten last night's events. "What a surprise, Ms. Vanderbilt. Dining with someone special?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Just finished, actually. I'll be on my way."

Theodore is here. If Lucas and Harrison come out now, with Rosalind stirring trouble, I won’t stand a chance.

She offered Theodore a respectful nod and turned to leave, but Rosalind seized her wrist. "Why the rush? Grandpa and I are here for brunch. As his granddaughter-in-law, shouldn’t you stay and keep him company?"

Her voice dripped with false sweetness. "Besides, I owe you an apology for my past behavior. Humor me—stay for lunch?"

Evelyn's expression tightened.

She’s clearly stalling. Does she know who I met? Refusing now would embarrass Theodore.

Before she could respond, Theodore cut in, his tone dismissive. "If she’s already eaten, let her go. No need for a crowd."

His words stung—she was still an outsider.

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth, Lucas and Harrison emerged from the private room.

Rosalind’s triumphant gaze flickered with satisfaction.

Theodore’s face darkened at the sight of Harrison, his demeanor turning glacial.

Harrison strode forward, cane tapping sharply. "Imagine running into you so soon in Zlokova, Theodore Goldmann."

Theodore’s glare was equally cutting. "Consider yourself lucky I’m wasting my time acknowledging you."

The air crackled with tension, thick enough to suffocate. One wrong word could ignite an explosion.

Evelyn caught Rosalind’s sly smirk and pieced it together.

She orchestrated this. She knows about the feud between Theodore and the de Armas. But how did she know I’d be here?

Fortunately, Lucas noticed Evelyn’s unease and stepped closer to Harrison. "Grandfather, we should go."

"Let’s." Harrison scoffed, brushing past Theodore without a second glance.

As they disappeared, Rosalind turned to Evelyn, her smile venomous. "So, you were meeting Mr. de Arma?"

Evelyn forced a calm smile. "Sir Harrison wanted to discuss something. Is that a crime?"

Rosalind’s tone turned mocking. "Discuss what? How to betray Nathan?"

Evelyn’s eyes turned to ice.

Theodore, already seething from the encounter, glared at Evelyn. "You’ve ignored my warnings."

"Grandfather, I haven’t forgotten my promise. Meeting Sir Harrison doesn’t mean I’ve sided with the de Armas."

Her voice was steady, but the storm in Theodore’s eyes didn’t waver.
###Chapter 387

"Enough." Theodore raised his hand sharply, cutting off Evelyn's explanation mid-sentence. His stormy gaze darkened further. "Just remember your words."

With that, Theodore turned on his heel and strode back into the restaurant.

Rosalind caught the frustration flashing in Evelyn's eyes and sauntered over with a victorious smirk.

"Evelyn, Grandfather still favors me more. Stop wasting your energy."

Evelyn met her gaze and laughed lightly. "Oh Rosalind, you're always stirring trouble to win Grandfather's affection. Since you're so desperate to be a Goldmann, why don't you legally change your name to Rosalind Goldmann? Then you and Nathan can officially be siblings."

Rosalind's face twisted in rage. "Watch your mouth, Evelyn Vanderbilt!"

She deliberately shoved past Evelyn, bumping shoulders hard before rushing after Theodore.

Evelyn exited SS Tower to find Chloe already waiting in the car. She slammed the door shut with more force than necessary.

Chloe took one look at her stormy expression. "Bad meeting?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just swallowed a fly during lunch. Feeling nauseous now."

"What? Flies at SS Tower?" Chloe gasped, completely believing her. "We should file a complaint!"

Evelyn chuckled wryly. "Let's just head back to Viana."

The Viana Jewelry lobby stood eerily quiet, not yet open for business.

The elevator doors had barely closed when Nathan's call came through.

"Done with lunch?" His deep voice soothed her frayed nerves instantly.

"We only discussed business. Didn't eat." She leaned against the elevator wall.

A brief pause. Then his teasing tone returned. "Lost your appetite without me there?"

Entering her office, Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa. "Ran into Rosalind and Grandfather at SS Restaurant. Grandfather found out about my meeting with Harrison. His misunderstanding has deepened."

"Leave it to me. I'll explain everything." His reassuring tone wrapped around her like a warm embrace.

"Miss me?" The sudden question caught her off guard.

"What?"

"Say you miss me, and I'll appear before you instantly." She could hear his smile through the phone. "I never break my promises."

Evelyn moved to the window, scoffing. "You're in Coralia. Unless you've mastered teleportation—"

"Maybe I have."

An odd silence stretched on the line. Then... footsteps? Her pulse quickened. "You—"

Nathan's reflection appeared in the glass. He stood at her office doorway, phone still at his ear. "Told you I'd come."

Evelyn whirled around as he approached. "You're really here?"

He cupped her face, thumbs brushing her cheeks. "Couldn't have my girl upset." His lips found hers in a searing kiss that left her breathless. "Better now?"

"Much." She wound her arms around his neck.

Nathan lifted her effortlessly onto the desk, his heated gaze dropping to her lips. "Good. Because I'm not done cheering you up."

Evelyn's cheeks burned. She placed a hand on his chest when his fingers began tracing dangerous patterns. "Nathan Goldmann, it's broad daylight!"

He trapped her between his arms, leaning in until his breath warmed her ear. "Then who would you prefer to have 'daylight activities' with, hmm?"
###Chapter 388

Evelyn could feel the dangerous heat radiating from Nathan's body. If this continued, the smoldering desire in his eyes would erupt into an uncontrollable blaze.

Though the corporate offices stood empty at this hour, she couldn't risk Gregory making an unexpected appearance. She hastily changed the subject. "Have you identified who that man is protecting?"

Nathan lifted his gaze, his stormy eyes darkening. "Someone from the training facility."

"From the training camp? Could it be—"

"You know them." Nathan dipped his head to press a kiss against her pale throat.

Evelyn's fingers tightened on his shoulders as she fought to maintain her composure. "Is it someone of Chloe and the others' rank? Mmmph—"

"Hmm?" Nathan paused deliberately, studying her flushed cheeks that rivaled the evening sky.

She bit her lip and averted her gaze. "Can you answer me properly?!"

His lips curved. "Then stop making those noises. It's dangerous."

Evelyn nearly combusted from frustration.

Nathan finally relented. "It's Instructor Lancaster."

"Him?" Her eyes darkened. "Was he involved in Winifred's death?"

'I know Instructor Lancaster, but this seems impossible. He supervised the entire shooting assessment that day.'

'When I saved Lillian from the pit viper, he and Harrison were the first to reach us. If he knew about the snake beforehand...'

'But if Lillian hadn't startled it, others might have triggered the attack instead. Wouldn't he worry about collateral damage?'

'Yet he seemed genuinely surprised by the viper's presence.'

"Why would Instructor Lancaster do this?" Evelyn frowned. "If that man was willing to protect him so fiercely, he wouldn't let him take such risks."

Nathan's gaze intensified. "Some people act under duress. There are always reasons."

The pieces clicked into place.

'Just as I suspected. The mastermind has leverage—someone precious to that man. Since his brother is Instructor Lancaster, the same applies.'

'Rosalind must be exploiting their relationship. I never imagined her scheme ran this deep.'

'She's orchestrated everything since I entered the training camp, controlling every variable.'

'Wynona's death was merely convenient—a scapegoat for the viper incident. Their strained relationship made her the perfect candidate. Whether I died or not, Winifred had to take the fall.'

'Vivian, Dad, the children, even Winifred's parents—every move executed flawlessly. Such venom hidden beneath beauty, yet Theodore remains oblivious.'

Softly, she asked, "Did Instructor Lancaster kill Winifred?"

"No." Nathan's voice was quiet. "He saw her that day but lied because he brought her there."

Understanding dawned—Instructor Lancaster wasn't the killer but an accomplice. "Is this evidence enough to expose her?"

Nathan smirked, tilting her chin up to claim her lips. "Don't worry. Oliver and I have everything arranged."

At the Summer Pavilion...

The imprisoned man hadn't eaten in days. Starvation blurred his vision as he licked cracked lips, teetering on death's edge.
###Chapter 389

The overhead lights flickered to life, casting harsh illumination across the interrogation room.

Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Oliver as he entered carrying a sleek laptop. The air grew thick with tension.

"Go to hell... I won't talk." The captive's voice cracked from dehydration, yet defiance still burned in his bloodshot eyes. Even starvation couldn't break his resolve.

Oliver set the laptop down with deliberate calm. "I'm not here for information." His tone carried an unsettling certainty.

The prisoner slumped against his restraints, too exhausted for further protest. His cracked lips parted slightly at the sight of the water bottle Oliver produced.

Placing a chair directly opposite, Oliver crossed his legs casually. "Your silence means nothing. Someone always talks eventually." He rolled the water bottle between his palms, watching condensation form.

The man's throat convulsed as he tracked every movement of the water. His tongue felt like sandpaper against the roof of his mouth.

With a quiet click, Oliver opened the laptop and rotated the screen. "I wonder if your associate shares your... fortitude."

The prisoner's entire body went rigid. His pupils contracted to pinpricks at the live surveillance footage.

"Your younger brother, isn't he?" Oliver's smile didn't reach his eyes as he slid the water within reach. "Mr. Goldmann has taken a personal interest in his interrogation."

A strangled sound escaped the prisoner's lips. "Take me... just let him go. He's just following orders like I was. If I talk, we're both dead men."

Oliver tapped a key, saving the recording. "Mr. Goldmann would never harm an innocent. But your employer? That's another matter."

The truth hung between them - Oliver already knew everything.

The prisoner's shoulders sagged as defeat washed over him. His breathing turned ragged.

Closing the laptop with finality, Oliver stood. "Mr. Goldmann respects your loyalty. Pity it's misplaced." He paused. "Your partner... Shane, isn't it?"

Shock registered on the prisoner's haggard face. They knew more than he'd imagined possible.

Dry lips parted. "Shane... he introduced me to Ms. Summers. Been her loyal dog for years."

"And the woman from Underground Freeway? Who handled that?"

"Shane. Always Shane." The words tumbled out now. "And Ms. Summers directly."

Oliver pressed further. "The Whitmore family. Why them?"

A swallow. "Mr. Whitmore saw Ms. Summers' face. She couldn't risk exposure. We... we promised them safe passage home. The accident was staged."

With all questions answered, Oliver secured the damning recording with a keystroke. As he turned to leave, a desperate hand shot out.

"Please... my brother."

Oliver glanced back. "That's up to the authorities now. If you want him alive, tell him to disappear. Permanently."

The prisoner nodded mutely. For a hired gun, prison might be mercy.

Outside Summer Pavilion, Oliver slid into the waiting car and dialed Nathan. "It's done. Full confession."

Nathan's voice came through crisp and clear as he fastened his cufflinks. "Excellent. Activate surveillance at the training camp. We spring the trap the moment our prey appears."

His gaze drifted to Evelyn, sleeping deeply amidst tangled sheets. Gently, he brushed a stray curl from her flushed cheek, savoring the lingering warmth of their passion. The peaceful rise and fall of her breathing belied the storm about to break.
###Chapter 390

The training camp was alive with activity, the sounds of basketballs bouncing and sneakers squeaking against the polished floor.

"Mr. Boucher, your little goddess has been gone for ages. Still pining for her?"

Felix Boucher wiped the sweat from his brow, his muscles aching from the intense game. He shot his friends a glare as they laughed, tossing his water bottle at them half-heartedly. "Get lost. I don’t need your teasing today."

One of them vaulted over the bench and dropped beside him, snatching the bottle from the ground. He twisted the cap off and took a long swig. "You’ve been distracted ever since she left. Barely even show up for practice anymore."

Felix exhaled sharply, rubbing the back of his neck. "My soul didn’t leave with her, idiot. I’m just trying to wrap things up here so I can get out of this place."

The man raised a brow. "And go back to what? Your parents breathing down your neck? At least here you’ve got freedom."

"For now," Felix muttered. "But how long can I keep running? I’m not cut out for top management. Might as well leave early and enjoy life while I can."

He pushed himself up, ignoring the protests from his aching limbs. "I’m hitting the showers. I smell like a locker room."

As he walked toward the dormitory, the dim hallway lights flickered overhead. At the far end, he spotted two figures—one with his back turned, the other standing too close, a hand gripping the instructor’s shoulder like a vice.

The stranger’s gaze flicked toward Felix, cold and calculating. He tugged his cap lower, hiding his face, then turned and strode away without a word.

Instructor Lancaster swayed slightly, his posture stiff.

Felix frowned, jogging forward just as the man collapsed. He barely caught him in time, his hands instantly slick with something warm and sticky.

Blood.

A dagger was buried deep in the instructor’s abdomen.

The car sped down the winding road, the engine roaring as the needle hovered at 100 mph.

The phone rang, and Shane tapped his earpiece. "Ms. Summers?"

Her voice was ice. "Are you driving back right now? At 100 miles per hour?"

His grip on the wheel tightened. "Yes… How did you—?"

Then he heard it.

The faint, rhythmic ticking beneath his seat.

His blood ran cold.

Rosalind’s voice turned lethal. "Shane, I’m sorry. But I can’t trust that you’ve never betrayed me. So don’t blame me for this."

"Ms. Summers—!"

The ticking grew louder.

Ahead, jeeps blocked the intersection.

He laughed, wild and unhinged. "You heartless witch!"

His foot slammed on the accelerator. "Fine. Let’s all burn together!"

The men in the jeeps scrambled, shouting into their radios. "Move! He’s taking us down with him!"

They dove into the trees just as the explosion ripped through the air.

The ground shook. Flames licked the sky.

And in the distance, Nathan Goldmann’s phone buzzed with an incoming call.

Harrison Lawson’s name flashed on the screen.
###Chapter 391

Nathan answered the phone. "Yes?"

"Mr. Goldmann, Shane attacked Instructor Lancaster at the training camp, but thanks to Mr. Boucher, Instructor Lancaster is alright, but—"

Nathan flicked the ashes of his cigarette into a half-empty soda can. A shadow passed over his gaze as he demanded, "But what?"

"When we tried to intercept Shane at the junction, his car exploded. He's dead."

For a moment, Nathan was silent.

He dropped the cigarette butt into the can, the sizzle of dying embers filling the brief silence. Then, his voice turned icy. "An explosion? Someone planted a bomb?"

Harrison confirmed, "Yes. It looks like they wanted him gone."

Nathan chuckled darkly, saying nothing.

If Rosalind had gone as far as eliminating her own man, she must have been convinced Shane had betrayed her.

And he had no doubt she would have killed him anyway, even if he had succeeded in taking out Instructor Lancaster.

"Did something happen?" Evelyn's voice pulled him back.

Nathan ended the call and turned to her, his expression softening as he took in her sleepy eyes. "You're awake?"

"For a while now." She had heard everything. "Another failure?"

"Instructor Lancaster was injured."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Rosalind is even more ruthless than we thought."

Not only did she have no qualms about taking lives, but she also didn’t hesitate to silence her own men the moment she suspected betrayal.

Nathan pulled her into his lap, his arm wrapping around her waist. "Shane’s dead, but that doesn’t mean she’s safe. We have more than enough evidence now."

Evelyn nodded.

The man at the Summer Pavilion, Instructor Lancaster, and Mr. Whitmore—they were the keys to bringing Rosalind down.

Now that she had killed one of her own, would the others still protect her secrets?

Evelyn doubted it.

That evening, Nathan took Evelyn back to the Summer Pavilion. The man’s injuries had scabbed over, and though he still looked rough, he had been resting well.

Sitting across from them, he asked, "How’s my brother?"

Nathan answered flatly, "Injured. Shane tried to kill him."

The man’s face darkened.

Then Nathan added, "Shane’s dead too."

"What?" Shock flickered in his eyes.

Nathan pulled out a cigarette and offered him one. "Rosalind killed him."

The man’s fingers trembled as he took it. His voice was hollow when he spoke. "You... already know everything, don’t you?"

It was clear they had figured out Rosalind was behind it all.

Evelyn leaned forward, her tone measured. "It wasn’t hard to piece together. Shane nearly killed your brother, and Rosalind made sure he didn’t live to talk."

She held his gaze. "If we hadn’t caught you, you’d be dead too."

The man stayed silent.

She was right. If they hadn’t captured him, he’d be in a grave by now. Finally, he took a long drag and exhaled sharply. "Fine. I’ll tell you everything."

He crushed the cigarette into the ashtray. "Besides the Whitmores and Winifred, Rosalind also ordered Shane to kill someone else. A staff member from Viana Jewelry."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Evelyn frowned. "Who?"

The man shook his head. "I don’t know. Shane never told me names. He just followed orders. That day, I was with him."
###Chapter 392

Evelyn sent a quick text to Oliver. Moments later, his reply buzzed through with the information she needed.

She tossed her phone onto the table, eyes sharp. "Is this the woman?"

The man glanced at the screen and nodded.

Evelyn picked up the phone, studying the image of the female employee.

Meryl Yates from the administrative department? What could she have possibly done to make Rosalind want her dead?

She turned to Nathan. "How did you figure out it was her?"

Nathan exhaled, his tone clipped. "She hasn’t shown up to work in days. It wasn’t hard to track her down."

Meryl had vanished without explanation. No calls answered, no messages returned. Her desk remained untouched, her belongings gathering dust. The department manager had reported it to Oliver, and from there, the pieces fell into place.

The man took a drag from his cigarette before speaking again. "Shane killed her. I was the one who disposed of the body. Drove it out to the woods and buried it."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. After a long silence, she met his gaze. "Aren’t you afraid of karma?"

He scoffed. "Money keeps us alive. That’s the only rule we follow. Retribution? That’s a luxury for people who don’t have to fight just to survive."

Another drag. Another exhale of smoke.

"I won’t lie—I’ve done terrible things. I’m no saint. Maybe I’ll die in some alley one day. But as long as my brother stays safe, prison or execution doesn’t scare me."

Evelyn’s fists clenched. This man wasn’t heartless. Life had forced him into this. She could see it in the way he spoke about his brother—blood mattered more than anything.

Nathan leaned forward. "Shane was from the training camp, wasn’t he? The same batch that tried for headquarters placement."

The man hesitated, then nodded. "Yeah. Shane was strong. Everyone who worked under him respected him. He was loyal to Ms. Summers—brought people he trusted into her circle. Me included."

He flicked ash from his cigarette. "At first, I didn’t know who Shane really was. Just that he had power. Later, I found out he worked for the Goldmanns. But why he followed Rosalind?" A dry laugh. "Pretty sure he was in love with her."

The cigarette burned low between his fingers. "We all saw it. The way he looked at her—different from how he treated anyone else."

Too bad Rosalind only saw him as disposable.

The city lights flickered to life outside the car window as they drove. Evelyn stared at the passing streets, lost in thought—until Nathan’s warm hand closed over hers.

"Where’d you go just now?"

He kept one hand on the wheel, eyes still on the road.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Just thinking how your grandfather never suspected Rosalind, even after all these years."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "She’s the Summers’ only granddaughter. That name buys forgiveness."

A beat of silence. Then Evelyn turned to him, a teasing glint in her eyes.

"You two grew up together, right? Childhood friends usually end up close. So why don’t you like her?"

If Rosalind had played her cards right—if Nathan had ever returned her feelings—Evelyn knew she wouldn’t have stood a chance.
###Chapter 393

Nathan's grip on Evelyn's hand tightened, making her wince. "Ow, that hurts. What's wrong? Can't I even ask?"

He smirked, his voice low. "No reason. I just don't like her."

Evelyn pulled her hand back, crossing her arms. "What about other women? Have you never been in love before?"

Nathan's gaze flickered away before returning to hers. "Never."

Then, his eyes darkened as he asked, "What about you? Any men before me?"

Evelyn pretended to think, a teasing smile playing on her lips. "Hmm, one. I had a crush on a senior in college."

Nathan's expression instantly soured.

She laughed, nudging him. "Relax. He was popular—handsome, brilliant. Half the campus adored him. He didn’t even know I existed."

Nathan’s jaw clenched. "So, you wish he had?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes, grinning. "Please. I have you—the most devastatingly handsome, successful man alive. Why would I even glance at anyone else?"

The car stopped at a red light.

Before she could react, Nathan cupped the back of her head and pulled her into a searing kiss.

Evelyn gasped, her cheeks burning as she pushed him away. "Nathan! We're in public!"

He smirked, undeterred.

By the time they reached Blue Bay Villa, Nathan had her pinned against the foyer wall the second the door closed. His lips trailed down her neck as her fingers tangled in his hair.

He tugged her hair loose, letting it cascade down her back. Her blouse slipped off one shoulder—

His phone rang.

Evelyn panted, pressing a hand to his chest. "You should… answer that."

Nathan exhaled sharply, clearly irritated. But he pulled back, yanking his phone out. "What?"

Oliver’s voice crackled through. "Mr. Goldmann, he's dead."

At the police station, Oliver stood outside the morgue, speaking with officers. When he spotted Nathan, he hurried over. "He was shot outside Summer Pavilion. Crowds panicked—someone called it in."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. "Then Instructor Lancaster—"

Rosalind was eliminating every loose end.

Nathan shot Oliver a look. The assistant immediately dialed Harrison, ordering him to guard the instructor at all costs.

While Nathan spoke with the police, Evelyn sank onto a bench, her mind racing.

Soon, the officers dispersed. Nathan crouched before her, hands on her knees. "Talk to me."

She met his gaze. "Nathan… we're being watched."

There was no other way Rosalind could’ve known the man was at Summer Pavilion. She’d waited until they left to strike—because Nathan’s men would’ve stopped her inside.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Evelyn’s thoughts spiraled. "Did she plant someone on me? How else did she show up at SS Restaurant with your grandfather? Or know I was meeting Harrison?"

If Rosalind hadn’t been tracking her, why block her from leaving that day?
###Chapter 394

Hadn't Rosalind been deliberately stalling to ensure Theodore would cross paths with her and Harrison?

Vivian appeared deep in thought, processing Evelyn's words. Resting her chin on her palm, Evelyn continued, "If he truly is her man, she could've ordered them to eliminate me. So why hasn't she? Is she just keeping tabs on me?"

Nathan stood abruptly, his gaze sharpening. "It seems she's exploiting those closest to you."

"Those closest to me? But no one else knew I went to SS Restaurant except you and—"

A realization struck her, and she gasped.

Nathan smirked darkly. "Perhaps it's time to teach her that not everyone in this world is as naive as she thinks."

The next day...

Nathan summoned Chloe to his office. Scratching her head nervously, she stepped inside, glancing at Oliver before asking, "Did you need me, Mr. Goldmann?"

Nathan didn’t look up from the documents he was flipping through. "The day I sent you to pick Zoe up from SS Restaurant—did you mention it to anyone else?"

"I told Rosalind," Chloe admitted without hesitation. "She was with me when you called, so I mentioned it to her."

Oliver pinched the bridge of his nose, hissing through clenched teeth. "Are you serious, Chloe? Did you tell Rosalind everything? Please tell me you didn’t also reveal where we took the man we captured."

He couldn’t believe his sister’s naivety. She’d been manipulated, and she hadn’t even realized it.

Chloe frowned in confusion. "What’s the big deal? Rosalind seemed genuinely concerned. Why wouldn’t I tell her?"

Oliver exhaled sharply, shaking his head. Clearly, she was the one who had leaked the information.

Nathan slammed the documents onto the desk, his voice icy. "You might just be the most gullible person I’ve ever met. Do you not realize Rosalind is behind all of this?"

Chloe’s eyes widened in disbelief. "That can’t be true! Rosalind is kind—gentle! How could she—?"

Oliver cut her off with a sigh. "Chloe, all the evidence points to her. The man we captured? He was killed last night—right after you told Rosalind."

Her face paled.

Had she been the one to cause this?

"Mr. Goldmann, Oliver… I—I’m so sorry. I swear I won’t trust anyone so blindly again. I just—" Her voice cracked with guilt.

Nathan’s piercing gaze locked onto her. "What exactly did you tell her?"

Chloe swallowed hard. "I told her we caught him at the hospital. She asked where he was being held, and I… I didn’t think it mattered, so I said the Summer Pavilion."

She wanted to slap herself.

Oliver exhaled in relief. At least he hadn’t told her everything—otherwise, Rosalind would’ve learned about Mr. Whitmore’s location and the staged confrontation that night.

With Shane eliminated, Rosalind would undoubtedly report back to Theodore.

Before Oliver could speak, Nathan said coldly, "Now you understand the gravity of your mistake?"

Chloe nodded shakily.

A smirk curled Nathan’s lips. "Good. Then you’ll have a chance to make it right. Consider this your redemption."

Her eyes lit up with determination. "I won’t let you down, Mr. Goldmann!"

At the Goldmann mansion...
###Chapter 395

Rosalind approached the table, her fingers wrapped around a steaming cup of coffee. She set it down carefully, her gaze flickering toward Theodore.

His cold demeanor hadn’t thawed since that night—the night Nathan had nearly been caught in an "accident."

Biting her lower lip, she summoned the most pitiful expression she could muster. "Grandfather, I’ve discovered who tried to harm Nathan. It was Shane."

Theodore stiffened. He lowered the newspaper, his sharp eyes locking onto hers, dark with suspicion. "Shane? The man I assigned to you?"

He knew Shane well. The man had been responsible for vetting potential members of the Night Banquet, working alongside Harrison for years. Theodore had personally reassigned him to assist Rosalind.

She slid into the seat beside him, her voice trembling. "Yes, it was him. Grandfather, I swear I had no idea he would do something so vile."

"You had no idea?" Theodore tossed the newspaper onto the table. "He answered to you. If you didn’t order it, how would he dare?"

Rosalind squeezed out a few tears, her lashes fluttering. "You know how much I love Nathan. Even if I admitted to targeting Evelyn, I would never hurt him."

Theodore remained silent, his fingers drumming against the armrest as he weighed her words.

"Grandfather, Shane never truly followed my orders. He never sought my approval for anything. And..." She hesitated, her voice dropping to a whisper.

"And what?" Theodore demanded.

She swallowed hard. "He... he tried to force himself on me. When I refused—when I told him my heart belonged only to Nathan—he grew furious. I believe that’s why he targeted him. This is all my fault."

Theodore exhaled sharply. If true, then Shane’s actions could indeed have been driven by jealousy.

Seizing the moment, Rosalind rolled up her sleeve, revealing a jagged scar. "When I confronted him, he tried to drag me away. I fought back with a knife, but he overpowered me and cut me before I escaped."

Theodore’s face darkened with rage. "That bastard!"

A flicker of triumph flashed in Rosalind’s eyes.

Shane was dead. There was no one left to contradict her story. Even if they investigated, they’d find nothing.

All she had to do was pin everything on him, and Theodore’s suspicions would vanish.

Then—

"You lied to me!"

Rosalind’s blood ran cold as Chloe Lawson stormed into the room, her face twisted in fury.

Damn it! Why is she here now?

Theodore frowned at Chloe’s outburst. "Have you forgotten your manners, girl?"

Chloe flinched but didn’t back down. "You can’t blame me, Elder Master Goldmann. Rosalind lied!"

Rosalind shot to her feet, forcing a smile as she grabbed Chloe’s wrist. "Let’s discuss this outside. Grandfather needs rest."

Chloe wrenched her arm free. "Don’t touch me, you scheming witch. Answer me—did you use me?"

Her voice rose. "You asked me where the man Mr. Goldmann arrested was being held. I told you—and then he was murdered last night. You did it, didn’t you?"
###Chapter 396

Rosalind’s face paled.

Chloe didn’t care about her reaction anymore.

Theodore’s expression darkened as he turned to Rosalind. "What is she talking about? Do you know something?"

Rosalind forced a smile, her voice trembling slightly. "Chloe, who told you these lies? I have no idea what you’re referring to!"

"Still pretending?" Chloe’s voice was icy. "The man confessed before he died. Winifred and the Whitmores—you killed them!"

Theodore’s grip on his cane tightened, his knuckles turning white.

Rosalind’s eyes flashed with panic. "That’s absurd! Why would I harm Winifred? You’re accusing me without proof!"

"If that’s a baseless accusation," Chloe countered coldly, "then what about the car accident that nearly killed Nathan? Was that also a coincidence?"

Rosalind stiffened.

"Shane was your man," Chloe pressed. "He acted on your orders, didn’t he?"

Rosalind clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. "Shane acted alone! I had no part in it!"

Chloe scoffed. "Convenient, isn’t it? Now that Shane’s dead, you can blame everything on him."

Theodore’s voice was sharp. "Shane is dead?"

Rosalind spun toward him, her eyes wide. "Grandfather, I swear I didn’t know! He was alive just days ago!"

Chloe’s lips curled into a bitter smile. "He went to kill Instructor Lancaster, but his car exploded during his escape. How very convenient."

Rosalind’s breath hitched. "That has nothing to do with me!"

"Then where’s your proof?" Chloe demanded. "Or are we just supposed to take your word for it?"

Before Rosalind could respond, a deep voice cut through the tension.

"The proof is right here."

Nathan’s father, Nicholas Goldmann, strode into the room, his golden cane tapping against the marble floor. Harrison followed closely behind, carrying a sleek laptop.

Theodore stood abruptly. "Nicholas?"

Rosalind’s face drained of color.

Nicholas didn’t spare her a glance. "Father, if sentiment blinds you to the truth, then as your son, I must intervene."

He took a seat, his gaze settling on Rosalind like a blade. "The Goldmanns raised you. We gave you everything. And yet, you dared to target my son and grandchildren."

Rosalind stepped forward, desperation lacing her voice. "Sir, I would never—"

Nicholas raised a hand, silencing her. "Save your excuses."

He nodded at Harrison, who opened the laptop. A video began to play—the dying confession of Shane, implicating Rosalind in every crime.

Theodore’s expression turned stormy.

Rosalind shook her head violently. "No! Shane framed me! He wanted to drag me down with him!"

Nicholas’s voice was glacial. "Enough lies."

Rosalind’s knees nearly buckled.

The game was over.
###Chapter 397

Nathan picked up the porcelain teacup, taking a deliberate sip before letting out a dark chuckle. "You truly don't know?"

He set the cup down with a sharp clink. "Simple. Because both Shane and this man are corpses now—conveniently unable to testify against you, isn't that right?"

Rosalind's fingers twitched violently.

Nathan turned to Harrison with a curt nod. "Bring him in."

"That man? Who—"

Rosalind's breath hitched, her face draining of color like parchment.

After a tense silence, Harrison returned with Instructor Lancaster, his frame still weakened from injury.

The moment Rosalind saw him, her composure shattered.

'He survived! Shane failed!'

Nathan's gaze pinned Lancaster. "Speak."

The instructor hesitated briefly, but the news of his brother's death burned through his loyalty. "Mr. Goldmann... Elder Master Goldmann... Ms. Summers orchestrated everything. After Winifred's death, she blackmailed me using my brother's life." His voice turned venomous. "That's how I learned she ordered Shane to release the viper targeting Ms. Vanderbilt."

"Lies!" Rosalind's shrill protest cut through the room. Lancaster ignored her. "You know the truth. Did my brother die for any reason other than your need to silence him? Shane confessed everything during his assassination attempt—you eliminate anyone who knows your crimes."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "I'd be dead too if Mr. Boucher hadn't intervened."

Theodore's expression hardened into glacial disappointment as he stared at his granddaughter.

Rosalind shook her head wildly. "This is Shane's doing! I'm innocent!"

Lancaster produced a recorder with trembling hands. "My brother sent this before his death. A failsafe—in case you turned on me."

The playback began—a damning exchange between Shane and Rosalind:

[Shane: Ms. Summers, please, keep my brother out of this.]

[Rosalind: If you value his pulse, you'll make him cooperate. Or shall I arrange his funeral now?]

[Rosalind: After all these years, you still underestimate me. Useless pawns get discarded. Push me again, and I'll have his throat slit before dawn.]

[Shane: ...What do you require?]

[Rosalind: Since that Vanderbilt whore survived the viper, we'll frame her for Winifred's murder instead.]

Silence swallowed the room when the recording ended.

Rosalind swayed, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

'That traitor recorded us!'

Seeing Theodore's stormy expression, she lunged forward. "Grandfather, let me expl—"

The slap echoed like a gunshot.

Rosalind staggered, her cheek flaming. Theodore's voice trembled with fury. "You've disgraced our name."

"Grandfather, please!" She collapsed to her knees, clutching his trousers. "I was blinded by love! Nathan belongs with me—I only wanted to scare Evelyn away!"

Tears streaked her makeup as she groveled. "I'll atone! Just don't cast me out!"

Theodore wrenched his leg free, turning to Nathan with weary resolve. "Handle this... as you see fit."
###Chapter 398

"Grandfather, you must understand how deeply I care for Nathan. Every action I take is for his sake!"

Rosalind's desperate grip on Theodore's trousers was violently shaken off. "For Nathan? You endangered his life and well-being, yet dare claim this was for his benefit?"

Her pupils shrank to pinpoints. "No, I swear I had no part in that! I admit to orchestrating Winifred's demise, but what happened to Nathan was entirely Shane's doing. I knew nothing of it!"

Theodore refused to even glance at her tear-streaked face. "I wanted to believe in you. I promised protection. But you've crossed a line no human should cross. Nathan remains my grandson."

His glacial stare pinned her kneeling form. "You've committed murder. What won't you do? How can I possibly trust your innocence now?"

'Even if she wasn't involved that night, this atrocity proves she's capable of anything. How could I leave such a dangerous presence near Nathan?'

Turning his back, Theodore delivered his verdict. "Turn yourself in."

"Turn myself in?" Rosalind collapsed like a marionette with cut strings.

'Prison would destroy everything! My life would be over!'

In a flash of desperation, she snatched the scissors from the table. Harrison reacted faster, tackling her before the blade could find its mark, kicking the weapon away with military precision.

"Control yourself, Ms. Summers." Though disgusted by her actions, he couldn't let her self-destruct.

Sobs wracked her body. "Let me die! I can't go to prison! I won't disgrace the Summers name! My parents would be ashamed from their graves!"

"Grandfather!" She crawled toward Theodore like a wounded animal. "You promised my parents you'd care for me! Send me anywhere but prison! I'll disappear from Nathan's life forever - I swear!"

Theodore's eyelids squeezed shut. This was the girl he'd raised from childhood. How had she become this monster?

Yet prison would indeed ruin her. The Goldmanns still owed the Summers a blood debt.

Without turning, he pronounced her sentence. "Go. Never let me see you again. The Summers' debt is cleared."

Chloe gasped.

'Is Lord Goldmann truly letting her walk free?'

Seeing her reprieve, Rosalind bit her lip bloody. "Thank you, Grandfather." She rose unsteadily. "Take care."

The mansion doors clicked shut behind her. Instantly, the broken woman vanished. Only cold calculation remained in her eyes.

At the private hospital...

Mr. Whitmore stared blankly through the window. Evelyn sat silently beside him until Nathan stepped out to take a call.

"Mr. Whitmore."

He didn't turn from the glass. "This is our punishment, isn't it?"
###Chapter 399

Mr. Whitmore's words hung in the air like a heavy fog.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she pressed her lips together. "Are you feeling any better?"

"What's the point of getting better?" Mr. Whitmore let out a bitter laugh. "My wife and daughter are both gone now. Why should I keep living?"

The truth was too cruel to bear.

No parent should ever have to face such devastation.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Deep down, you know exactly how this tragedy came to be."

Mr. Whitmore stiffened. His shoulders slumped as shame washed over him. "Yes... I admit our greed led us here."

He swallowed hard before continuing. "When we first heard about Winifred's death, we were shattered. Discovering she'd taken her own life at that training camp... we couldn't think straight. The camp offered compensation and put us up at Bassburgh Grand Hotel while waiting for the autopsy results."

"Then one day," his fingers clenched as if carrying an invisible weight, "a woman came to us. She claimed you were responsible for our daughter's death - that you drove her to it."

"She gave us your work address. My wife and I... we went after you. The money blinded us. Our daughter was already gone, we thought... why not take it? But we never imagined—" He buried his face in his hands, shoulders shaking. "That woman wanted us dead too. I suspected something, but... we still couldn't escape."

Regret poured from every word.

But what good did regret do now?

Evelyn gave him space, slipping quietly from the ward. Nathan had just ended his call when she approached.

"How did things go with Father Goldmann?" she asked, resting a hand on his back.

Nathan's expression darkened. "Grandfather let Rosalind go. Out of respect for the Summers family's past kindness."

Evelyn squeezed his cold fingers. "Now that your grandfather knows her true nature, she won't escape consequences if she acts again."

Nathan turned, pulling her into his embrace. His lips brushed her forehead. "Zoe, you don't need to comfort me."

She averted her eyes. "I'm not."

After a beat, she asked, "Why did you have Father handle this? Were you worried your grandfather wouldn't believe us?"

Nathan's arm tightened around her waist. "That foolish girl Chloe told Rosalind all our plans. If we'd confronted her directly, she would've weaseled out of it with some excuse."

Evelyn toyed with his tie absently. "Yet she still walked away unscathed. What a shame we couldn't send her to prison."

A dangerous smile curved his lips. "Prison would be too kind. Grandfather may have spared her, but Father won't."

The next day...

Viana Jewelry officially rebranded as Soul Jewelry, drawing massive crowds on opening day.

The showroom divided into two distinct sections:

Section A featured exclusive custom designs available by appointment only. Each breathtaking piece carried a staggering price tag, their unique designs justifying every penny.

Section B operated as a traditional boutique, selling ready-made collections that flew off the shelves.

As Bassburgh's sole Gothic-inspired jewelry brand - and with Zara as its celebrated designer - the store overflowed with customers.

Evelyn barely left her seat despite only handling custom orders. After seeing off one client, she turned to find Madam Nora approaching in her wheelchair, assisted by an attendant.
###Chapter 400

"Madam Nora, what a pleasant surprise." Evelyn's face lit up as she stepped forward to greet the elderly woman.

The chairwoman of Taylor Jewelry returned a warm smile. "When I heard your company's grand opening was today, I simply had to come show my support personally."

Evelyn gracefully knelt beside the wheelchair so Madam Nora wouldn't strain her neck. "With your endorsement, my competitors across Bassburgh will be green with envy. I might need extra security!"

Madam Nora chuckled, her eyes twinkling. "Oh you flatterer, always knowing just what to say to an old woman."

As she wheeled her VIP guest to the private lounge, Evelyn prepared tea with practiced hands. "How have you been keeping, Madam? Your health treating you well?"

"Better than ever, dear." Madam Nora blew gently on her steaming cup. "Though I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me these past months."

Evelyn grinned mischievously. "Impossible. I'd forget my own name before forgetting you."

After taking a delicate sip, Madam Nora's expression turned serious. "You promised me you'd establish your brand internationally within a year. At this rate, you'll achieve it in half that time."

Evelyn's fingers paused mid-air. "We've only just begun this journey."

"Nonsense!" The older woman waved her hand. "Give credit where it's due. That's precisely why I'm here - to offer you an extraordinary opportunity."

An intrigued silence filled the room.

"The Stoslo Sheena Jewelry Exhibition opens next month," Madam Nora continued. "This is your moment."

Evelyn's breath caught. She remembered attending previously under the Luxe brand when her oriental designs first gained international acclaim.

Back then, the world knew "Zara" only as Luxe's designer. Now, Viana Jewelry would bear her own name.

"Well?" Madam Nora arched an eyebrow. "Shall I put your name forward?"

Evelyn set down her teacup with deliberate calm. "Absolutely."

Later that afternoon, Chloe Lawson approached with visible apprehension. "Evelyn, about what happened with Rosalind... I owe you an apology. I was too trusting."

Evelyn waved it off with a playful smirk. "Nathan warned you about being too gullible. But don't worry - a few more betrayals and you'll develop healthy skepticism."

Chloe flushed. "That's hardly comforting."

Internally, she shuddered at the thought of Nathan's reaction if anything worse had happened to Evelyn.

Changing the subject, Chloe added, "Speaking of Rosalind - she's officially a wanted fugitive now."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "But the elder Mr. Goldmann pardoned her?"

"Technically." Chloe nodded. "The elder let her go, but Mr. Goldmann Sr. issued a million-dor bounty. Unless she gets plastic surgery or leaves the continent, she's as good as caught."

A wry smile touched Chloe's lips. "The irony? Rosalind's probably celebrating her freedom right now, unaware that while the elder pardoned her, the senior Goldmann's warrant stands. Two separate decisions - no conflict at all."
###Chapter 401

Evelyn couldn't help but smirk.

'Vivian was right. Grandfather only spared Rosalind for the Summers' sake, but Father would never tolerate this. This move will trap Rosalind with no escape routes left.'

Her options were bleak - live as a fugitive forever or surrender to prison.

In a dimly lit alleyway hotel...

Rosalind stared at the citywide manhunt announcement on her phone screen, her face twisting into something monstrous.

"The Goldmanns!" She crushed the phone in her trembling hands. "You're really pushing me to this? That bitch Evelyn and Nathan set me up from the beginning!"

A chilling laugh escaped her lips. "If you want to play dirty, don't blame me for what comes next."

With shaking fingers, she dialed an international number she'd sworn never to use.

After several rings, a mocking male voice answered. "Miss Summers? To what do I owe this... pleasure?"

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. "I need your help, Dominic."

"Help?" His laughter was ice-cold. "Why should I?"

The humiliation burned, but he was her only option now. She swallowed her pride. "You once said you'd assist me if I helped you against the Goldmanns."

"Ah." His tone dripped with amusement. "So the position of Mrs. Goldmann wasn't satisfying enough? How... predictable."

"I'll do anything," she hissed. "Name your price."

"Rosalind," he tutted, "I don't appreciate desperate women. Our... arrangement doesn't entitle you to my resources."

Her face drained of color at the insult.

"If you're serious," he continued, smoke evident in his voice, "lure Evelyn to Stoslo. However you manage it, I don't care. Remember - you're the beggar here. I'll consider helping only when Evelyn agrees to come."

The line went dead. Rosalind collapsed onto the bed, her breathing ragged before hardening into resolve.

'Evelyn... this is your fault. You should've stayed away from Nathan.'

That evening...

Nathan arrived at Soul Jewelry to pick up Evelyn. Leaning against the car window, his golden eyes caught the dying sunlight, transforming them into liquid amber pools.

Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, but the sight stole her breath.

'No wonder Vivian, Lydia, and Rosalind are obsessed. With his looks, power, and background...'

Noticing her stare, Nathan flashed a wolfish grin. "Like what you see?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Enough to understand why women throw themselves at you."

Oliver, their driver, nearly choked.

'Did I just hear that? Ms. Vanderbilt is getting bolder - teasing Mr. Goldmann outright!'

Nathan twirled a lock of her hair around his finger. "Darling, if you're that eager, wait until we're home. I'll let you pounce to your heart's content."
###Chapter 402

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "I meant those women!"

Nathan chuckled darkly. "Are you implying you don't feel that way about me?"

She flushed crimson, rendered speechless by his teasing. Snatching back the lock of hair he'd been twirling between his fingers, she huffed.

"Maybe I'm getting bored of pouncing on you. Perhaps it's time to find another man."

The temperature in the room plummeted as Nathan's expression turned glacial. "Who exactly do you plan to pounce on?"

Deliberately, Evelyn let her gaze drift toward Oliver.

Caught in the rearview mirror, Oliver nearly choked. "M-Ms. Vanderbilt! I-I'm... I'm gay!"

The moment the words left his mouth, he wanted to bite his tongue off.

Evelyn burst into laughter.

Nathan arched an eyebrow, shaking his head at her antics. "Little minx."

That night, Evelyn found herself thoroughly ravished once more.

Watching her exhausted form curled in sleep, Nathan felt equal parts frustration and helplessness. He leaned down, pressing tender kisses to her parted lips, the slope of her nose, and finally her forehead.

'My precious wife. I'll never let harm come to you again.'

Rising, he headed to the bathroom for a cold shower.

Emerging in a silk robe, his phone screen illuminated suddenly on the nightstand.

The message that greeted him turned his eyes to ice.

Nathan strode to his study, where the warm glow of a hidden lamp bathed his desk. Seated in the plush chair, he dialed Rosalind without hesitation.

"Brave of you to contact me," he said, voice dripping with venom.

"Nathan, you're utterly heartless," came the bitter reply.

He had no patience for her dramatics. "Explain your message."

Her laugh was hollow. "Don't you want to know who really killed Aunt Goldmann?"

Silence.

"I'll only say this once," Rosalind continued, voice steadying. "The de Armas were just puppets. The real mastermind behind your mother's kidnapping is in Stoslo."

Morning light found Evelyn alone in bed.

Breakfast waited downstairs alongside Nathan's characteristic neat script: "At the office early. Eat properly."

Peeling an egg, Evelyn froze at the unexpected knock.

'Who visits at this hour?'

The sight of Theodore Goldmann on her doorstep stole her breath. "Grandfather?"

Dismissing his bodyguards, the elder Goldmann swept inside with regal indifference. "We need to talk."

Evelyn trailed him to the sitting area. "Have you eaten?"

"I have." Theodore cut straight to the point. "I came to formally apologize for Rosalind's actions. My trust in her was... misplaced."

Evelyn's lips pressed together.

'An apology from Theodore Goldmann himself. How unexpected.'

"It's in the past. No apology necessary."

Theodore studied her. "Rosalind's absence doesn't mean I accept you."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes.

'Of course not.'

Steeling herself, she clasped her hands. "Grandfather, may I ask you something?"

The old man's gaze sharpened. "What is it?"
###Chapter 403

The dim glow of the chandelier cast long shadows across the study as Evelyn sat across from Theodore Goldmann. The air was thick with tension, the weight of unspoken history pressing down on them.

"I had dinner with Sir Harrison that evening," Evelyn began, her voice steady despite the storm of emotions inside her. "He told me it was your father who severed his leg and murdered his father. I need to know—is it true?"

If Theodore confirmed it, then where did that leave the decades-old feud between the de Armas and the Goldmanns? Who was right? Who was wrong?

To her surprise, Theodore’s expression darkened, his lips curling in disdain. "That old fool actually told you that?"

Evelyn didn’t deny it.

Theodore scoffed, his face hardening. "Harrison has a talent for twisting the truth, doesn’t he? My father did use him as leverage against the de Armas back then, but he never laid a finger on him. As for how he lost his leg—that had nothing to do with the Goldmanns."

Evelyn blinked. "So… it’s false?"

Theodore’s jaw tightened. "Absolute nonsense. My father despised the royals’ hypocrisy, but he would never harm a child. Harrison’s lies are on another level entirely."

Evelyn fell silent, her mind racing.

Her maternal grandfather had insisted it was Philip Goldmann’s doing, yet Theodore denied it. The feud between their families was far more complicated than she’d realized—filled with gaps and contradictions that needed unraveling.

"What else did that snake say?" Theodore demanded, his voice sharp. "Did he ask you to hurt Nathan?"

Evelyn shook her head, a faint smile touching her lips. "No."

She hesitated before adding, "He wouldn’t use me against Nathan."

Theodore stiffened, his expression flickering with something akin to guilt. He remembered how easily he’d once turned against Evelyn, swayed by Rosalind’s poisonous words. The memory stung.

At Goldmann Holdings, Oliver Lawson stared at Nathan in disbelief.

"You want me to book a flight to Stoslo?"

Nathan closed the file in his hands, his gaze unreadable. "Is there a problem?"

Oliver hesitated. "Sir, you know your father has always forbidden you from going there."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "I need answers about my mother’s death. I have to know if those people were involved."

Oliver paled. "But… that was fifteen years ago. Why now?"

A cold smirk curled Nathan’s lips. "Rosalind might be connected to them. Whether it’s a trap or not, I’ll find out when I get there."

Late that night, at Blue Bay Villa…

Steam curled through the bathroom, the mirror fogged from the heat. The reflection in the glass was hazy, but the intensity between them was unmistakable.

Nathan carried Evelyn back to the bed, her body still humming from their earlier passion. The moment her skin touched the cool sheets, she yanked the blanket up, wrapping herself tightly like a cocoon.

What’s gotten into him tonight? she wondered, heart pounding. Is he trying to devour me whole?

Before she could overthink it, his arms encircled her, pulling her close.

A deep, velvety voice murmured above her. "Zoe, I’ll be away for a few days."

Evelyn twisted to look at him. "Away?"

Nathan sat up, reaching for the bedside lamp. The soft glow illuminated his sharp features, casting half his face in shadow. "Are you saying you’ll miss me?"

Evelyn, bathed in the warm light, met his gaze. Her cheeks were flushed, her hair a wild tangle against the pillow. There was something unspoken in her eyes—something dangerously close to affection.

His voice dropped lower. "If you keep looking at me like that, I won’t hesitate to—"

She surged forward, pinning him beneath her before he could finish. "How long will you be gone?"

Nathan chuckled, the sound rich and warm. "Just a few days."
###Chapter 404

Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper. "When are you leaving?"

Nathan gazed at her with adoration, his fingers tracing circles on her bare shoulder. "Tomorrow morning."

His lips curled into that infuriatingly handsome smirk. "Going to miss me that much already?"

She bit her lower lip, refusing to give him the satisfaction of an answer. The way her cheeks flushed only made Nathan's possessive instincts flare hotter.

In one fluid motion, he flipped their positions, caging her beneath him.

"Nathan Goldmann, you still haven't told me where you're going!" Evelyn squirmed, her protests muffled as he captured her wrists effortlessly.

Morning light filtered through the curtains, painting golden stripes across the rumpled sheets.

Evelyn reached out instinctively, expecting to find warm skin. Her hand met cold emptiness instead.

The other side of the bed had long gone cold.

Downstairs, breakfast waited on the dining table - perfectly arranged as always. No Nathan. Just a note weighed down by a milk glass.

"Wait for me." His elegant script mocked her.

Evelyn crushed the paper in her fist. "That bastard! No wonder he kept me up all night - so he could sneak out while I was dead asleep!"

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips.

Just because I didn't ask doesn't mean I won't find out where you're going, Mr. Goldmann.

Bassburgh Airport's business lounge hummed with quiet luxury.

Nathan sat immersed in a financial magazine, the black turtleneck clinging to his broad frame emphasizing the sharp lines of his jaw. The suit jacket draped over his chair cost more than most people's monthly rent.

Every female attendant walking past did a double take at the unfairly attractive man radiating power from his wingback chair.

Oliver entered briskly. "Sir, there's a twenty-minute delay for the Zena flight."

Nathan didn't look up from his reading. "Unavoidable."

"I've briefed Mr. Goldmann Sr. He'll handle company affairs during your absence."

At this, Nathan's gaze lifted sharply. "Did he ask any questions?"

"None, sir." Oliver barely suppressed an eye roll. Like I'd dare tell the old lion anything.

A beat of silence. Then Oliver ventured, "Did you... inform Ms. Vanderbilt?"

The magazine page rustled as Nathan turned it with deliberate calm. "No. Stoslo isn't safe right now."

Especially with Daniel Kent's faction making moves. I won't risk Evelyn getting caught in that viper's nest.

Soul Jewelry's headquarters buzzed with midday energy.

Gregory's eyebrows shot up. "You're leaving for Stoslo now? The Sheena Jewelry Show isn't for another week."

Evelyn stacked design files with military precision. "I'm homesick. Thought I'd go early."

She'd tracked Nathan's flight plan - a private jet to Zena, Stoslo's glittering capital. The exact city hosting the jewelry exhibition. What were the odds?

Gregory studied her too-innocent expression. "Since when are you this excited about trade shows?"

Evelyn's hands stilled momentarily. "It's been too long since I walked Zena's streets at night."

Her ticket was already booked for tonight's red-eye. Chloe was coming. Madam Nora would meet them there.

First, I'll get to Stoslo. Then I'll find out what my elusive billionaire is really up to.

9 PM at Blue Bay Villa, Chloe arrived breathless, dragging luggage. "Evelyn, what's this sudden trip about?"

Pocketing her phone after texting Richard and the kids, Evelyn shrugged. "Sheena Jewelry Show prep. Just going a bit early."

The lie tasted like sugar on her tongue - sweet and dissolving too quickly. But some games required playing the long con. And when it came to Nathan Goldmann, Evelyn Vanderbilt always played to win.
###Chapter 405

Chloe gasped in shock. "Wait, does Mr. Goldmann know you're coming?"

Evelyn wheeled her luggage toward the waiting cab. "That's exactly why I'm doing this - to surprise him."

At precisely 11:50 p.m., their flight to Zena departed on schedule. The ten-hour journey would land them at 10:00 a.m. local time. When Evelyn awoke mid-flight, dawn's golden light already painted the sky, revealing thick cotton-like clouds beneath the aircraft.

Right on time, the plane began its descent over Stoslo's sprawling metropolis. From this altitude, the towering skyscrapers resembled miniature toy blocks. The intricate network of streets below looked like delicate veins pulsing through the urban landscape.

The plane touched down at Zena International Airport thirty minutes later.

"My entire body aches after that marathon flight," Chloe groaned, dragging her carry-on behind Evelyn. This marked her first transcontinental journey.

Evelyn gave her companion's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "You'll adjust eventually."

Hailing a taxi outside the terminal, Evelyn leaned toward the driver's window. "Rosette Hotel, please," she said in flawless local dialect.

Having visited Zena multiple times before, Evelyn had wisely booked their accommodations online. A quick ID check at the front desk secured their reservation.

Chloe immediately tossed her bag aside and launched herself onto the plush king-sized bed, bouncing slightly upon impact. "Heaven! A real mattress after that torture chamber they called economy class."

Her eyes caught the bilingual signage above the bed. "Huh, they provide translations here?"

Evelyn organized their luggage while slipping into comfortable slippers. "The Rosette caters primarily to international clientele. The owner's actually from Cornelia originally."

As Zena's only six-star luxury hotel, Rosette commanded premium rates that attracted global business elites and wealthy travelers.

Satisfied with this explanation, Chloe stopped questioning. After resting until late afternoon, they reserved a private dining room at an exclusive Japanese restaurant nearby.

Evelyn had changed into a sophisticated beige pantsuit with a crisp white blouse, her signature long hair styled in loose twin braids. Her sleek black ankle boots accentuated her slender legs, completing the effortlessly chic ensemble.

Chloe cleared her throat discreetly. "Evelyn, just remember Mr. Goldmann isn't here to... supervise. Please don't do anything that might get my salary docked."

The unspoken thought hung between them - Nathan would skin her alive if Evelyn got involved with some foreign playboy.

Evelyn's lips curved mischievously. "What makes you think Nathan isn't already here?"

Chloe froze. "Excuse me?"

Taking her seat at the table, Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "For all we know, he could be entertaining some local beauty right this moment."

An icy shiver raced down Chloe's spine.

Had Evelyn flown halfway across the world to catch Nathan cheating?

"Zara?"

Hearing her professional name, Evelyn turned to see a pleasantly surprised middle-aged gentleman approaching.

"My goodness, is that really you?"

Evelyn rose gracefully to embrace him. "Mr. Knowles! What a delightful coincidence. Where are your lovely wife and Olivia today?"

Henry Knowles returned the hug warmly. "They're at the modern art exhibition. I'm meeting Julian Abascal for business and happened to spot you. How have you been? I heard about your departure from Luxe."
###Chapter 406

"Yes, I've launched my own jewelry line." Evelyn flashed a confident smile before gesturing to her companion. "This is my dear friend, Chloe."

Henry Knowles gave a polite nod, which Chloe immediately returned with equal warmth.

Evelyn continued the introductions. "Mr. Knowles is a major investor at Luxe. He was incredibly supportive during my time there."

She turned back to Henry. "Have you dined yet, Mr. Knowles?"

From N?velDrama.Org.

Henry smiled. "Just finished a business lunch with Mr. Abascal and an important client." His eyes twinkled with amusement. "Speaking of which, our guest happens to be a young, successful entrepreneur from Zlokova."

Evelyn's gaze instinctively shifted to the group approaching behind Henry.

The cluster of businessmen moved with purpose, led by a striking figure in a perfectly tailored suit whose commanding presence turned heads.

When their eyes met, a flicker of surprise crossed Nathan Goldmann's usually impassive features before his expression schooled back into its typical unreadable mask.

Oliver Lawson, trailing behind his boss, nearly stumbled when he spotted Evelyn. What were the odds of running into his sister and Ms. Vanderbilt here of all places?

"Mr. Abascal!"

Henry raised his hand in greeting, drawing the attention of the blond man beside Nathan. Julian Abascal's eyebrows shot up when he noticed Evelyn. "And who might this lovely lady be, Mr. Knowles?"

Henry made the introductions. "This is Zara, a former lead designer at Luxe with remarkable talent."

Evelyn's crimson lips curved as she extended her hand. "A pleasure, Mr. Abascal."

Julian grasped her hand with enthusiasm. "The pleasure is entirely mine, Ms. Zara."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly.

Evelyn deliberately kept her attention on Julian for a beat longer before finally turning to Nathan with arched brows. "Mr. Goldmann in Stoslo? What an unexpected coincidence. We've traveled quite the distance only to bump into each other here."

Nathan's piercing gaze held hers, offering no verbal response.

Julian looked between them curiously. "You two know each other?"

Evelyn merely smirked while maintaining eye contact with Nathan, her expression radiating smug satisfaction.

'Surprised, aren't you?' she thought triumphantly.

Oliver and Chloe had drifted together, the former whispering urgently, "Why on earth is Ms. Vanderbilt in Stoslo?"

Chloe gave him an equally puzzled look. "She's here for the Sheena Jewelry Exhibition. More importantly, why are you and Mr. Goldmann here?"

Oliver's eyes widened. "She's attending the Sheena show?" He nearly facepalmed. 'Then why has Mr. Goldmann been acting like a brooding storm cloud all week?'

Chloe nudged her brother conspiratorially. "Don't you think there's some serious tension between those two?"

Oliver gave her a deadpan look. "That's not tension - that's a full-blown warzone."

The air between Evelyn and Nathan crackled with unspoken words.

Nathan hadn't mentioned his Stoslo trip to Evelyn, and this unexpected encounter clearly caught him off guard. Their eyes locked in a silent battle before Nathan finally broke contact, his expression shifting to something resembling resigned amusement. "We're... acquainted."

'Acquainted?' Evelyn's smile froze.

Julian stroked his chin, sensing there was far more to this story than either party was letting on.

Evelyn offered Julian a polite nod, though her smile didn't quite reach her eyes this time. "Is Mr. Goldmann here on business?"

Nathan confirmed with a slight nod, a challenging glint appearing in his gaze. "And Ms. Vanderbilt's purpose for visiting?"

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly. "Oh, just visiting my husband."

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously.
###Chapter 407

Nathan's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "You're married, Zara?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a playful smile. "Indeed."

"Oh? Is your husband here in Zena? We should invite him for tea." Nathan's curiosity burned - who was the fortunate man who'd won this brilliant beauty's heart?

Evelyn feigned a dramatic sigh. "I'd love to, but who knows which woman my husband is entertaining right now? He's completely unreachable."

Oliver, Chloe, and the others froze in shock. The entire group, including Nathan, looked at her with pity.

"That's terrible," Nathan said sympathetically. "But someone as stunning as you could easily find better."

Evelyn batted her eyelashes. "Really? Do you have someone in mind?"

Nathan's smirk widened. "Perhaps I do."

A storm cloud seemed to gather over Nathan's head. With a tight smile at the others, he ground out between clenched teeth, "Excuse me, I need to discuss urgent business with Ms. Vanderbilt. We'll have to skip dinner."

Before anyone could react, he seized Evelyn's wrist and practically dragged her away.

The electronic lock beeped as Nathan swiped the keycard, pulling Evelyn into his suite. She wrenched her arm free. "Nathan Goldmann, what do you think you're— Mmph!"

He pinned her against the wall, his lips crashing down on hers. The hunger in his dark eyes made her knees weak, but she refused to surrender so easily - sinking her teeth into his lower lip.

Nathan hissed, his gaze turning dangerous. "Biting me now?"

Evelyn tilted her chin defiantly. "Mr. Goldmann, isn't it improper to drag a woman into your private quarters?"

Recognizing her game, Nathan chuckled darkly. "What's improper about bringing my own wife to my room?"

"Wife?" Evelyn pressed a finger against his chest, pushing him back with a hollow laugh. "I thought we were just... close acquaintances."

Nathan's gaze dropped to her flushed face. Damn if she wasn't even more breathtaking when angry.

He caught her chin between his fingers. "Are you jealous, darling?"

Evelyn turned her face away.

When he leaned in again, she stopped him with a finger to his lips. "Not interested tonight, Mr. Goldmann."

Shoving past him, she straightened her dress and reached for the door handle. Just as her fingers brushed the knob, Nathan's body pressed against her from behind, his voice a velvet whisper against her ear. "What if I make it worth your while?"

Evelyn gritted her teeth. "Get lost."

"You sure about that?" His cool fingers traced the delicate column of her throat before brushing the corner of her mouth.

Evelyn remained stubbornly silent, though she could feel his body responding against hers.

When his lips found the sensitive spot below her ear, an involuntary shiver ran through her. All resistance melted away as if by magic.

Nathan took his sweet time, teasing and coaxing like a predator toying with its prey - setting the perfect trap, waiting for her to surrender, then slowly wrapping her in silken bonds until she was completely at his mercy.

When Evelyn finally looped her arms around his neck, standing on tiptoe until she nearly lost balance, he swept her up effortlessly.

"Such a little liar," Nathan murmured against her lips, his breath warm. "Still want me to leave?"

Evelyn bit her lip in surrender.

In one fluid motion, he spun her around, caging her between his body and the wall. "Now tell me, Zoe," he purred, his mouth hovering dangerously close, "what brings you to Stoslo?"

Evelyn glared up at him. "Do I need permission to travel now?"

Seeing her stubborn act, he nipped at her collarbone in punishment. "Answer me properly, sweetheart."
###Chapter 408

"You go first." Beads of sweat glistened at the man's temples as his gaze remained fixed on the woman.

She was pushing him.

After a long silence, Nathan scooped her into his arms and carried her to the bathroom.

Even when she was furious, he still helped adjust the delicate strap of her dress, his fingers brushing against her skin with such tenderness that it made her pout.

He chuckled. "Are you seriously mad at me?"

Evelyn turned her face away.

Nathan studied her for a moment before his lips curled into a warm smile. "Is this how you're going to talk to me from now on?"

He sighed in exasperation. "Aren't you embarrassed?"

Evelyn yanked the bathrobe back from him and glared. "Nothing compared to your shamelessness."

Nathan rose, caging her between his arms as he braced his hands against the dresser. A dry laugh escaped him. "Alright, Zoe, I'm sorry."

Evelyn shot him a look. "I'm taking a shower. Get out."

Nathan straightened with a nod. "Fine. I'll wait outside."

Once Evelyn finished showering and changed back into her clothes, she stepped out of the bathroom.

Nathan sat in the living room, dressed in a crisp black shirt and vest, his gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose as his fingers flew across the keyboard of his laptop.

There was something undeniably magnetic about him when he was focused—especially with those glasses on. The air around him hummed with quiet intensity.

Seeing him engrossed in work, Evelyn decided not to disturb him. Just as she turned to leave, his voice stopped her.

"Stay here tonight."

She had already slipped on one shoe but paused at his words, a smirk tugging at her lips. "I don't want to."

Nathan pushed his chair back, removed his glasses, and strode over before lifting her effortlessly into his arms.

"Put me down, Nathan!" Evelyn smacked his shoulder.

Did he not realize she was still angry? Was her irritation not obvious enough?

Nathan deposited her onto the bed and tucked her in.

Evelyn stared at him, stunned. "Nathan."

He leaned down, voice softening. "Be good. Stay with me tonight."

He retrieved his laptop and set it on the desk by the window, intending to work while keeping her close.

Evelyn sank into the mattress, pulling the blanket tighter around her. The rapid clatter of keys slowed, the noise fading into something gentler.

She exhaled, giving up. Distracting him while he worked felt wrong.

Oddly, his presence soothed her. The tension in her shoulders eased, and before she knew it, sleep claimed her.

When Nathan finally closed his laptop and removed his glasses, his gaze drifted to the bed.

She was already deep in slumber.

He stood and approached, the soft sound of her breathing a melody in the dim light. Unable to resist, he pressed a featherlight kiss to her forehead.

The next morning, at the restaurant...

Evelyn settled by the window with her breakfast. Chloe spotted her and sauntered over, grinning.

"Evelyn, did you stay at the Goldmann estate last night?"

Evelyn's grip on her milk glass faltered. She glanced up at Chloe's teasing smirk and arched a brow. "Where else would I have slept?"

Chloe glanced around. "Why isn’t Mr. Goldmann having breakfast with you?"

Evelyn tore a piece of toast, avoiding eye contact. "No idea where he went."

She dunked another piece into her milk before asking, "Did your brother mention what they’re doing in Stoslo?"

Chloe chewed thoughtfully before shrugging. "Oliver said it was business. Didn’t elaborate."
###Chapter 409

Evelyn stopped asking.

She could guess why Oliver hadn't told Chloe—he probably didn’t want her to find out.

Seeing her silence, Chloe mistook Evelyn’s concern for something else and grew serious. "Don’t worry, Evelyn. Mr. Goldmann isn’t the type to fool around."

Evelyn arched a brow. "And how would you know that?"

Chloe pressed a hand to her chest dramatically. "I swear on my honor."

Evelyn smirked. "What honor?"

Chloe pouted and amended, "Fine, I’ll swear on my tiny savings account."

Evelyn burst into laughter.

Chloe’s tone turned earnest. "Mr. Goldmann has always known his boundaries. You’re the first woman he’s ever publicly dated. Honestly, I used to think a man like him would never settle down."

Curiosity flickered in Evelyn’s eyes. "What was he like before?"

She had never bothered to dig into Nathan’s past, but now, with nothing else to occupy her thoughts, the question slipped out.

Chloe leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "Here’s a secret—Nathan wasn’t always so serious. When he was younger, Adrian Boucher used to bully him so badly he’d cry."

Evelyn blinked. "Nathan… cried?"

The image of the unshakable, ice-cold Nathan Goldmann reduced to tears by Adrian Boucher was almost too absurd to believe.

A new question surfaced. "If Adrian and Nathan grew up together, why aren’t the Bouchers and Goldmanns close?"

Even though the Bouchers were in politics and the Goldmanns in business, with no direct conflicts, their childhood friendship should have kept the families connected. Yet, there had never been any public ties between them.

Chloe glanced around before whispering, "The former head of the Boucher family and Mr. Goldmann Sr. were love rivals over Nathan’s mother. After that, they barely spoke."

Evelyn’s lips parted. "Love rivals?"

Chloe nodded. "Nathan’s mother, Victoria Knowles, was once involved with Yves Boucher. Everyone in Bassburgh from our parents’ generation knew about it. It was a huge scandal."

Victoria Knowles had been a star under Royal Crown, the most dazzling beauty in Bassburgh at the time. Her fame and influence rivaled even today’s top socialites.

Royal Crown hadn’t always belonged to the Goldmanns. Before Nathan’s father, Philip, won Victoria’s heart, Yves Boucher had been her lover for three years—though they kept it hidden.

But the Bouchers, an old-money political dynasty, could never accept an actress into their family. In the end, Yves chose his family over love, leaving Victoria behind.

After the breakup, rumors spread that Victoria had been dumped for failing to marry into wealth, tarnishing her reputation.

When Philip Goldmann later pursued her, Victoria was wary. But unlike Yves, Philip didn’t care about status. He bought Royal Crown just to make her happy.

Theodore Goldmann had initially opposed the match, just as the Bouchers had. But the difference was, while Yves had given up love for duty, Philip was willing to give up everything for Victoria.

Perhaps that was why she married him.

Even after their marriage, Philip never asked Victoria to leave the spotlight. He supported her career, even financing her films.
###Chapter 410

The media constantly speculated about whether she'd be abandoned again, but Nathan always silenced them with actions—a decade-long marriage without a single breakup rumor.

In Bassburgh, everyone knew Nathan Goldmann never entertained female company during business dinners. He'd simply walk away if anyone tried.

Victoria Knowles, once plagued by dating scandals, now chose dull soap operas over romantic roles. Not from lack of trust, but because their mutual respect ran deep.

Evelyn blinked slowly. "Father must have loved Nathan's mother very much."

If not for the de Armas family... Nathan might not have lost his soulmate.

Chloe nodded with a sigh. "After Mrs. Goldmann's accident fifteen years ago, Mr. Goldmann became withdrawn. He stayed in that mansion because she loved it."

Evelyn paused. That explained why Nathan preferred the secluded estate over city life. Why he'd remained unmarried all these years after losing Victoria.

Her heart ached. People craved fairytale endings—no one wanted love stories cut short by tragedy.

'But do perfect endings truly exist? We must cherish people while we can.'

After breakfast, Evelyn and Chloe encountered Mr. Abascal returning to their suite.

Julian Abascal appeared early thirties—thick brows, chiseled nose, hooded eyes embodying masculine beauty. Dressed casually with gloves, clearly heading out.

"Ms. Zara." Julian approached with a smile. "What luck. Just finished breakfast?"

Evelyn returned the smile. "Indeed."

Her gaze flickered to his attire. "Going somewhere?"

He nodded. "Golf with friends. Care to join?"

Evelyn didn't refuse. "Certainly."

Chloe's eyes narrowed at his obvious flirtation.

Turning to Chloe, Evelyn asked, "We're golfing with Julian. Coming?"

"What?" Chloe pulled her aside. "You're going with him? Aren't you worried he might—"

Evelyn chuckled at her concern.

"You'll be there, won't you?"

"True. I've got your back." Combat might be her only skill, but she excelled at it.

Julian led them to an expansive private course resembling a royal garden.

"Abascal!"

Several men approached. A blue-haired one slung an arm around Julian while eyeing the women. "Where'd you find these stunners?"

Julian shrugged him off. "Ms. Zara of Luxe Jewelry. Surely you've heard of her."

"The designer?" Blue-hair grinned, extending a hand. "Ms. Zara, your reputation precedes you. Though no one mentioned your beauty."

"Flattered."

Evelyn accepted the handshake gracefully, her smile never reaching her eyes.
###Chapter 411

Evelyn answered each question with effortless grace.

Julian Abascal observed from the sidelines. The curly-haired man beside him slung an arm over his shoulder and smirked.

"Julian, you like her, don’t you?"

"Me?" Julian shot him a lazy grin. "Sure, but too bad—she’s married."

"Married? Well, that’s a dead end." The man shrugged.

Julian swung his golf club, but the ball veered off course.

The blue-haired guy nearby chuckled. "Ms. Zara seems to be a natural."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, and Julian followed it. Not far away, Evelyn adjusted her grip and sent the ball sailing straight into the hole.

"Impressive," Julian murmured, admiration flickering in his eyes. Women who could play golf were rare in his circles—most socialites preferred less strenuous pastimes.

Evelyn was so absorbed she didn’t notice Julian approaching. When he spotted the sweat glistening on her forehead, he pulled out his handkerchief.

Chloe Lawson suddenly appeared, gripping his wrist. "What do you think you’re doing?"

Evelyn startled, turning to stare at him in disbelief. Julian froze, caught off guard. Flustered, he withdrew his hand.

"My apologies if I made you uncomfortable. It’s just habit—I’d do the same for any of my female friends."

Chloe narrowed her eyes. She didn’t trust this guy one bit.

Evelyn smiled politely. "That’s very considerate of you, Mr. Abascal."

So he does this for all his female friends? Charming, but still inappropriate.

Julian grinned. "Shouldn’t we be kind to the women in our lives?"

Then Evelyn felt it—a searing gaze burning into her. She turned and saw Nathan Goldmann and his entourage approaching.

Oliver Lawson noticed Nathan’s darkening expression and winced. If he could sense the tension, everyone else definitely could.

Julian followed Nathan’s glare and smirked. The possessive fury in those eyes told him everything.

Nathan didn’t speak. Instead, he strode forward, seized Evelyn’s wrist, and yanked her against his chest. Before she could react, his lips crashed onto hers.

Evelyn’s eyes widened in shock. The crowd gasped.

She shoved him away, her cheeks flushed. Nathan barely restrained the hunger in his gaze as he tightened his grip on her waist.

"Enjoying yourself, sweetheart?" he murmured, voice low and dangerous.
###Chapter 412

The crowd gasped in shock.

Wasn't Ms. Zara married? Then why was Mr. Goldmann calling her sweetheart? Did that mean...

Evelyn clenched her teeth in his embrace.

Sweetheart? Seriously?

She lowered her voice so only Nathan could hear. "Are you enjoying this little game, Nathan?"

Nathan inhaled the scent of her hair, his dark eyes burning with possessiveness.

No other man would dare lay eyes on his woman.

But revealing her true identity now was too risky—too many eyes in Stoslo were watching him.

Evelyn scoffed. "My husband was cozy with another woman, so why can't I flirt with another woman's husband?"

Oliver and Chloe exchanged exasperated glances.

What is wrong with these two?

Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low. "You’ve gotten bold. Still have energy to tease other men? Did your husband not wear you out enough last night?"

Evelyn traced a slow circle on his chest with her fingertip, smirking. "Then maybe you should share some of yours, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan seized her wrist, his grip tight. "Just you wait."

He turned to the stunned onlookers, his tone smooth but firm. "Forgive us, but my sweetheart and I have urgent matters to attend to."

Without another word, he dragged her away, leaving the crowd in stunned silence. Ms. Zara—married—openly flirting with another man? How scandalous!

The moment they were inside the car, Nathan pinned her beneath him, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. His gaze was molten when he finally pulled back.

Evelyn gasped for air, her cheeks flushed, eyes glazed. "Nathan, you jerk."

He tightened his grip on her wrists, lifting them above her head. "You started this, Zoe."

It struck him then—she was growing bolder by the day.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Did I?"

Nathan tilted her chin up, claiming her lips again. His touch burned, and Evelyn realized she might have pushed him too far. She grabbed his hand, breathless. "Can we at least go back to the hotel first?"

Nathan exhaled sharply, regaining some control. He brushed his thumb along her lower lip.

"As you wish."

By the time they reached their suite, Nathan had her pressed against the nearest surface, half their clothes already discarded. His kisses were relentless, his hands possessive.

Evelyn finally understood—she should never provoke a jealous man. He was a live wire, ready to ignite at the slightest spark.

"Zoe," he growled between kisses, marking her skin. "Stay away from Julian."

Evelyn laughed breathlessly. "Are you jealous?"

His eyes darkened with a mix of fury and hunger. "Would you like me to be?"

She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him closer. "Then tell me—why did you really come to Stoslo?"

Nathan ignored the question, his voice rough. "Focus, Zoe."

Any further protests were lost as he claimed her completely.

Later, exhausted, Evelyn fell asleep in his arms.

Nathan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, lighting a cigarette. He took a long drag, his expression unreadable.

There were things he couldn’t tell her—not yet.

His phone buzzed. Oliver’s name flashed on the screen.

"Where are you?" Nathan answered.

Oliver spoke quickly, and Nathan’s frown deepened. "Keep Chloe with Zoe at all times. No mistakes. And I need you to handle something else for me."
###Chapter 413

Evelyn lay still, her back turned to Nathan as she slowly opened her eyes.

She had been feigning sleep ever since he dressed and slipped out of their hotel room.

Rising from the bed, she frowned. What could possibly make Nathan this secretive? He'd rushed them to Stoslo without explanation.

Her fingers tightened on the sheets. It had to be something monumental for him to act this way.

A sudden realization made her blood run cold.

"Could it be about his mother?"

Natasha Goldmann had been kidnapped and murdered in this very city. Was that why he'd come?

Meanwhile, across town in a luxury suite...

Dominic Kent stood before floor-to-ceiling windows, swirling a crystal glass of bourbon. His silk robe hung open, revealing sculpted abs that tapered into forbidden territory.

Rosalind emerged from the steam-filled bathroom, cinching her robe with trembling fingers. "Mr. Kent," she forced through clenched teeth, "will you honor our agreement now?"

She'd lured Nathan to Stoslo. This was her moment.

Dominic turned slowly. Ice-blue eyes raked over her as a cruel smirk played on his lips. "Naturally."

He set his glass down with a deliberate click. "Though you've withheld one crucial detail."

Rosalind paled beneath his predatory gaze. "I've told you everything!"

A photograph slid across the table. "Who is she?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. "Evelyn? What's she doing—" Her nails dug into her palms. "She's here too?"

Dominic's smile turned lethal. "So you do know her."

"That bitch ruined my life!" Rosalind spat. "She's Nathan's wife and Harrison de Arma's granddaughter."

Dominic's expression darkened. "The de Arma family complicates things."

Seizing her chance, Rosalind leaned forward. "Let me handle her. With Harrison in Zlokova, any... accident could be blamed on the Goldmanns. Two problems solved at once."

Dominic studied the venom twisting her pretty features. His hand shot out, encircling her throat. "I adore this look," he purred, thumb tracing her jugular. "They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. How delightfully true."

Rosalind forced a smile despite the terror clawing up her spine. "I live to serve, Mr. Kent."

There was no turning back now. With Dominic's help, she'd make Nathan watch his precious Evelyn suffer.

His grip tightened. "You scheming viper." His breath was hot against her ear. "You'd use me as your pawn?"

Rosalind's lips trembled. "N-no! I would never—"

Dominic's laugh sent shivers down her spine. "Liar." He shoved her away. "But your hatred makes you useful."

She collapsed against the sofa, gasping. The game had just begun.
###Chapter 414

Dominic shoved Rosalind onto the bed, ripping her bathrobe apart with brutal efficiency.

Yet his gaze held no trace of desire—only cold calculation.

"When Nathan’s mother was kidnapped, you managed to push everyone away. You even fooled Theodore. Did you really think the same trick would work on me?"

Rosalind wasn’t humiliated. She was terrified.

She couldn’t bring herself to meet his eyes.

Dominic Kent was merciless. He had no capacity for passion, no weakness for sentiment. He was more ruthless than the Goldmanns, more perceptive than anyone she’d ever known.

His gaze could strip a person bare, exposing every hidden thought.

And once he fixed his attention on someone, he coiled around them like a serpent—slow, inevitable, suffocating.

Her blood turned to ice. "M-Mr. Kent, I—I wasn’t trying to use you—"

Dominic picked up the glass of red wine from the table and poured it over her body.

The liquid bloomed across her skin like crimson petals, stark against her pale flesh.

"Isn’t that your specialty? Making others take the fall for you." His voice was deceptively soft. "The Goldmanns still believe the de Armas killed Nathan’s mother. But your hypocrisy is exactly what makes you useful."

Rosalind’s pulse stuttered.

He gripped her chin, forcing her to look at him. "As long as you lure Nathan into my trap, I don’t care what you do with that woman. Understood?"

She nodded frantically. "Y-yes. I understand."

Dominic released her. Rosalind scrambled to cover herself, clutching the torn robe.

He turned his back. "Don’t disappoint me."

Two days later

Evelyn met Madam Nora at the Rosette Hotel’s restaurant.

The older woman sat by the window, an impeccably dressed middle-aged man beside her.

Evelyn approached with an apologetic smile. "Forgive me for keeping you waiting, Madam."

Madam Nora waved a hand. "Not at all."

She gestured to the man beside her. "Mr. Lucas, I believe you’ve met Ms. Zara before?"

Lucas smiled. "Indeed. At the Sheena Jewelry Show three years ago. A remarkable young woman."

Evelyn took her seat. "Ah, yes. You were one of the judges."

Lucas Abascal was a renowned fashion designer, the owner of a luxury brand that dominated Stoslo’s elite circles. He had sponsored nearly every major label at the Sheena Jewelry Show.

His presence as a judge had left an impression.

"I’m honored you remember me, Ms. Zara," he said smoothly.

Evelyn laughed lightly. "The honor is mine."

Their conversation flowed easily over lunch. Then Lucas’s guest arrived.

"Apologies for my tardiness," the man said as he joined them.

Evelyn turned—and found herself studying a striking face.

He wasn’t as devastatingly handsome as Nathan, but there was something compelling about him.

Not the kind of beauty that struck immediately, but the sort that grew more arresting the longer one looked.

Unlike Adrian Boucher’s refined elegance, this man exuded a quiet, dangerous intensity. His eyes held shadows, the kind that spoke of ambition, hunger, power.

He wasn’t someone you wanted to cross.

And he definitely wasn’t someone you could trust.
###Chapter 415

Madam Nora froze. "Who is this?"

With a charming smile, Lucas replied, "This is Mr. Kent."

Realization flashed across Madam Nora's face. "Ah, Mr. Kent. I've been eager to meet you."

Dominic stepped forward, taking her hand with practiced grace and pressing a light kiss to her knuckles. "The honor is mine, Madam Nora."

She smiled approvingly.

After exchanging a firm handshake with Lucas, Dominic's sharp gaze landed on Evelyn.

One brow arched playfully as he asked, "And who might this lovely lady be?"

Madam Nora interjected warmly, "This is Ms. Zara. Evelyn Vanderbilt."

Evelyn offered a polite nod in greeting.

"Is that so?" Dominic's dark eyes gleamed with predatory interest. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, the famous Ms. Zara. What an unexpected pleasure."

'Unexpected? Why would he say that?' Evelyn wondered silently.

Dominic settled into the seat beside Lucas, directly across from Evelyn. As he engaged Lucas in lively conversation, the designer eventually revealed, "Mr. Kent has joined the Viana Jewelry Show as this year's co-sponsor."

Madam Nora's eyes widened. "I didn't know you had an interest in jewelry, Mr. Kent."

A slow, knowing smile curved Dominic's lips. "I'm fascinated by all things beautiful."

His gaze locked with Evelyn's as he spoke, making her stiffen before quickly looking away.

'Who is this man? Have we met before?'

Nearby, Oliver Lawson broke into a cold sweat at the sight of Dominic. His fingers flew across his phone screen as he urgently texted Nathan.

The Kents were dangerous, especially Dominic. And now, it seemed their sights were set on Evelyn.

An hour later, the dinner concluded. As Madam Nora prepared to leave, Evelyn stood. "Allow me to escort you back, madam."

Before Madam Nora could respond, Lucas smoothly intervened. "I'll take Madam Nora home—it's on my way."

Madam Nora nodded. "No need to trouble yourself, dear. You should rest at the hotel."

Evelyn smiled but said nothing.

Once Madam Nora departed, Evelyn turned to Dominic. "I'll be going now, Mr. Kent."

Dominic rose leisurely. "Let me walk you to your room, Ms. Vanderbilt."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Mr. Kent, I have to ask—do we know each other?"

He stepped closer, invading her personal space. "What do you think?"

Whether intentional or not, his proximity made her skin crawl. She suppressed a shudder. 'Disgusting man.'

Dominic inhaled deeply, his smirk widening. "Are you wearing perfume, Ms. Vanderbilt?"

Evelyn took a deliberate step back. "I don't wear perfume, Mr. Kent. My room is just upstairs—no need for an escort."

With that, she turned on her heel and left.

Dominic watched her retreating figure, tongue tracing his lower lip thoughtfully. A dark glint entered his eyes.

'How entertaining it would be to steal Nathan's woman right from under him.'

Later that night, Evelyn soaked in the bathtub, staring absently at the starry sky through the window.

Something about Dominic unsettled her. Whether he was a predator or simply arrogant, she wanted nothing to do with him.

The living room lights were off when she stepped out. Just as her hand reached for the switch, a strong arm yanked her into the shadows, a palm clamping over her mouth.
###Chapter 416

The dim living room was suddenly illuminated as a familiar voice broke the silence. "It's me, Zoe."

Evelyn spun around, her heart skipping a beat when she recognized Nathan standing in the doorway.

"Why are you here?" The tension in her shoulders eased slightly at the sight of him.

Nathan closed the distance between them in three long strides. "I needed to see you."

His arms encircled her waist, pulling her close. The fresh scent of her shampoo from her recent shower filled his senses, calming the storm that had been raging inside him all evening. "Did you meet Dominic Kent today?"

Evelyn froze in his embrace. "Dominic Kent?"

Nathan remained silent, his grip tightening imperceptibly.

She turned in his arms to face him, searching his stormy gray eyes. "Nathan, do you know Mr. Kent?"

His answer came in the form of a searing kiss that stole her breath. Pushing her backward onto the couch, he claimed her lips with possessive intensity - until sharp pain made him jerk back.

Evelyn had bitten him. Again.

Nathan touched his bleeding lip, eyes darkening dangerously. "Did you just bite me, little cat?"

"I was asking you a question, and all you can think about is-" Her protest was cut short as he pinned her beneath him, his mouth crashing down on hers once more. The metallic tang of blood mixed with the taste of him as her struggles weakened. Oxygen deprivation turned her cheeks scarlet, leaving her gasping when he finally released her.

"Hah... Nathan!" Her chest heaved as she glared up at him with glassy eyes.

The sight of her furious pout only amused him. "Stay away from Dominic," he ordered, brushing a thumb across her swollen lips.

Evelyn scoffed. "First Julian Abascal, now Dominic Kent? You really can't stand other men near me, can you?"

Nathan's expression turned grave. "He's not like Julian. Dominic is dangerous."

"Do you know him?" she pressed.

"Not personally. He's from the Kent family - old nobility with leftist ties." Nathan cradled the back of her head, pulling her close. "Zoe, there are things I can't explain yet. Just trust me - the further you stay from him, the better." His gaze drifted to the window, mind racing. 'Dominic has clearly targeted Zoe. His people are probably watching us right now.'

Evelyn pushed against his chest. "Is this why you can't reveal our relationship publicly?"

Nathan blinked, then chuckled darkly. "My wife is as sharp as ever."

She huffed. "Do you want my forgiveness?"

His eyebrow arched in question.

In one swift motion, Evelyn flipped their positions, straddling him. Her fingers toyed with his immaculate dress shirt, a mischievous glint in her eyes. "I'll forgive you... if you let me have my way with you tonight."

Each button popped open with deliberate slowness, revealing the sculpted muscles beneath. His abdomen tensed as her nails traced his skin.

"Zoe-" His voice was a warning growl.

She leaned down until their lips almost touched. "If you want my forgiveness, show me some sincerity."

The hunger in his eyes shifted to something more predatory as her hands wandered lower.

'When did my obedient kitten learn to play with fire?' Nathan thought, jaw clenching.

Suddenly, his hands clamped around her wrists. "Are you sure you want to play this game, darling?"

Evelyn blinked up at him with faux innocence, though her smirk was pure sin. "Oh? Is the great Nathan Goldmann uncomfortable not being in control?" Her lips brushed his ear as she whispered, "Did you ever imagine you'd be at a woman's mercy?"
###Chapter 417

"Zoe, stop—" Nathan's voice was low and dangerous, like a predator rousing from centuries of slumber. His entire aura shifted, becoming electrifyingly intense.

Yet Evelyn continued her reckless teasing, her fingers tracing patterns along his collarbone.

Though every fiber of his being burned with desire, he clenched his jaw, struggling to maintain control. "You've developed quite the mischievous streak."

"People change." Evelyn's arms wound around his neck, her crimson lips curving into a provocative smile. "Why don't you beg me?"

Nathan exhaled sharply, his restraint crumbling as he captured her lips in a searing kiss. "Fine," he growled against her mouth. "I'm begging."

The next morning—

Evelyn had just finished applying her signature winged eyeliner when a sharp knock interrupted her routine.

Chloe opened the suite door to reveal a hotel attendant holding an exquisite violet gift box. "Compliments of Mr. Goldmann for the lady of the suite."

Accepting the package, Chloe turned to find Evelyn emerging from the bedroom. "What's that?"

"From Nathan," Chloe said with a knowing smirk. "Shall we see what the dragon of Wall Street sent his queen?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she untied the silk ribbon—Nathan had mentioned a surprise before leaving at dawn.

The box revealed a breathtaking gown that shimmered like liquid gold. Nestled in the folds lay a handwritten card:

[You'll outshine every star tonight.]

At the Viana Jewelry Exhibition—

The red carpet buzzed with energy as security struggled to contain the throngs of photographers. Media outlets jostled for prime positions to capture the glittering procession of celebrities.

Lucas Abascal made his entrance arm-in-arm with a Scandinavian supermodel, flashbulbs erupting around them like fireworks.

The venue itself was a spectacle—crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light over guests adorned in haute couture, each more dazzling than the last.

Then Evelyn arrived.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. "Who is she?" "That embroidery—is that real gold thread?" "Look at those phoenix earrings!"

Her ensemble was a masterpiece of East-meets-West design—a fitted gold bustier flowing into a dramatic train embroidered with an ascending phoenix. Delicate golden bells tinkled at her waist with each step, while tiered tassel earrings framed her sharp cheekbones.

Madam Nora entered shortly after with Lucas. The designer's eyes widened appreciatively. "Ms. Zara, you're a walking work of art."

"You flatter me," Evelyn demurred, though her gaze kept scanning the crowd.

Dominic Kent materialized from the sea of guests, his Prussian blue suit cutting a sharp contrast. "I never imagined you cleaned up so well, Ms. Zara. No wonder—" He left the implication hanging like a challenge.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Careful, Mr. Kent. Your compliments sound suspiciously like threats."

As guests settled into their seats, a familiar heat pressed against Evelyn's back. Nathan's breath ghosted over her ear as his hand settled possessively on her waist.

"Break a leg tonight, Ms. Vanderbilt." His lips brushed her earlobe. "But remember—you're mine."
###Chapter 418

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists at her sides. When she turned around again, the tall figure in Prussian blue had already vanished into the crowd.

Wish me good luck? What the hell does that mean?

She took her seat behind Madam Nora, her mind racing. Then, out of nowhere, she caught a glimpse of a painfully familiar face in the crowd.

Their eyes met—just for a split second—before the woman turned sharply and disappeared.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

That was Rosalind.

But how? Rosalind is supposed to be in Stoslo?

A cold dread settled in her stomach. Without thinking, she stood and slipped backstage.

Dominic Kent smirked when he spotted her, his lips curling into something dark and unreadable.

Evelyn lifted the hem of her dress, moving swiftly through the empty corridor. But by the time she reached the other side, there was no sign of anyone.

Why is Rosalind here?

The question gnawed at her. Something wasn’t right.

"Miss, are you lost?"

A man in a black suit materialized behind her, his voice smooth but oddly tense.

Evelyn turned, forcing a polite smile. "No, I just thought I saw someone I knew. Must’ve been mistaken."

She started to walk away, but the man spoke again. "Aren’t you supposed to meet Mr. Goldmann?"

She froze. "Excuse me?"

The man bowed slightly. "Mr. Goldmann is here, but he can’t appear publicly. He sent me to escort you to his private lounge."

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the man’s hands—crossed in front of him. A small tattoo marked the back of his right hand.

None of Nathan’s bodyguards have tattoos like that.

Her instincts screamed at her. "Do you even work for Nathan?"

The man stiffened.

She didn’t wait for an answer. Spinning on her heel, she bolted toward the main hall.

A hand clamped around her wrist, yanking her back. She twisted, slashing her ring across his cheek. Blood welled from the cut, but before she could break free, another pair of hands seized her from behind.

A sharp prick at her neck.

Sedative.

Her vision blurred. The last thing she saw before darkness swallowed her was Rosalind stepping out of the shadows, her smile chilling.

The room smelled like antiseptic and decay.

Evelyn groaned as she forced her eyes open, the blinding white light above making her wince. She turned her head, blinking until the world came into focus.

Medical equipment surrounded her. A blue partition screen blocked most of the room from view. It looked like a hospital—but not quite. More like a lab.

A faded poster on the wall caught her eye—Stoslo Viral Outbreak, 30 Years Ago.

Her pulse spiked.

She tried to sit up, only to realize her wrists and ankles were strapped to the bed.

A cold laugh echoed through the room.

"Finally awake?"

Rosalind stepped into view, flanked by two figures in full protective suits.

Her smile was razor-sharp. "Bet you didn’t see this coming. In Zlokova, you were untouchable. But here?" She leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Here, you’re mine."

Evelyn strained against the restraints. "What the hell do you want, Rosalind?"

Rosalind’s fingers closed around her throat, nails digging in. "What do I want?" She tilted her head, mockingly sweet. "How about I dissect you alive and pickle you in formalin? A perfect little specimen."
###Chapter 419

Evelyn drew in a sharp breath.

Her face paled instantly as she stared at Rosalind. "Do you honestly think Grandfather and Nathan won't discover what you've done here?"

Rosalind released her grip and stepped back with a chilling smirk. "What difference does it make?"

She turned slowly, her cold eyes locking onto Evelyn's. "He'll never trace this back to me. And you... you won't live long enough to tell him."

Two figures in hazmat suits advanced, their gloved hands reaching for Evelyn. She struggled against her restraints as primal terror coursed through her veins.

"Is this really how it ends?"

Her mind screamed in protest. "I can't die now. Not when the children need me. Not when Nathan needs me!"

Every nerve in her body trembled violently, her blood turning to ice in her veins.

Just as the suited figures began cutting away her clothing, a gunshot shattered the tense silence outside. The sudden noise sent everyone scrambling.

Rosalind barely had time to react before the door exploded inward. When she saw the man standing in the doorway, her lips parted in shock.

Nathan fired without hesitation.

The bullet tore through Rosalind's shoulder, sending her crashing to the floor. Oliver stormed in with a tactical team, swiftly neutralizing the other two assailants.

Nathan rushed to the examination table, his fingers working frantically at the restraints binding Evelyn. When she came free, he cradled her against his chest, pressing a kiss to her sweat-dampened hair. "Zoe... I'm so sorry."

The moment Evelyn met his eyes, the dam broke. Tears streamed down her face as she clung to him desperately.

Nathan scooped her into his arms, turning to leave. Rosalind crawled forward, blood soaking through her blouse, and grabbed at his ankle. "Nathan, please! I was forced into this! You have to believe me!"

He kicked her away without a second glance. "Take them into custody," he ordered his men, carrying Evelyn toward the exit.

As they emerged from the derelict hospital, a dozen smoke canisters suddenly rained down, enveloping the area in thick white fog.

Nathan instinctively tightened his hold on Evelyn. "Ambush!" he shouted.

"Take cover!" Oliver's voice cut through the chaos. The team scrambled for position as visibility dropped to zero.

When the smoke began to clear, a squad of armed mercenaries materialized from the haze, weapons trained on them.

"Move!" Nathan barked, shielding Evelyn as they dove behind a concrete barrier.

Oliver and the others found whatever cover they could among the debris.

"Come out now, Goldmann," a voice called from the smoke. "Unless you want your precious wife caught in the crossfire."

A figure emerged from a black sedan, puffing on an e-cigarette. Nathan risked a glance and immediately recognized their adversary.

"The Kents are this desperate for my head?" Nathan called back.

Dominic Kent exhaled a plume of vapor with a humorless laugh. "Oh, you misunderstand. The Kents aren't your only enemies." His smile turned predatory. "Though I must say, Goldmann men do share a fatal weakness for their women. Your great-grandfather Philip... and now you. History does love to repeat itself."

Evelyn stiffened in Nathan's arms.

"So this was Dominic's plan all along? Using me as bait?"

Feeling her distress, Nathan cradled her head gently. "Trust me, Zoe," he murmured against her hair.

Evelyn pressed closer, her whisper fierce. "Whatever comes next, we face it together."
###Chapter 420

Evelyn's brow furrowed in confusion. How had Dominic known about her connection to Nathan? She had never revealed her true identity in Stoslo!

'Could it be Rosalind?' The realization struck her like lightning. 'No wonder she captured me.'

Nathan rested his chin atop Evelyn's head, his heart aching with guilt. He hadn't even dared to tell her the truth.

He'd anticipated someone might target Evelyn. That's why he'd embedded a micro-tracker in the beading of the dress he gave her - an insurance policy against traps. But he never expected their enemies to strike so swiftly, nor that Rosalind would be working with them.

"Dominic Kent." Nathan's eyes darkened as he addressed the men surrounding them. "Did you truly believe I'd come here unprepared?"

Dominic stiffened slightly, a dangerous glint flashing in his dark eyes.

Nathan glanced meaningfully at the abandoned buildings surrounding them. "Perhaps you should look around."

Dominic's gaze snapped upward - to the snipers positioned on every rooftop.

A silent curse formed on his lips.

His men still held their weapons, but none dared move.

The screech of tires announced the arrival of several black SUVs. A man in a trench coat stepped out, adjusting his steel-rimmed glasses with one finger. "Mr. Kent, it appears you've miscalculated this time."

"Edmund Lincoln?" Dominic's surprise was evident. "What business does the Metropolis have here?"

Edmund smiled thinly. "Our reasons are irrelevant. Suffice to say, if you value your position, the Kents would do well to stand down."

With a frustrated growl, Dominic signaled his men to lower their weapons.

Rosalind, clutching her wounded arm, stared in shock at Dominic's deference. She hadn't realized the Goldmanns had connections to the powerful Metropolis organization from Morwich.

Unlike the Night Banquet, the Metropolis operated with royal sanction, holding extraordinary governmental privileges and even royal authority in Morwich.

As Nathan led Evelyn forward, her eyes widened at the sight of Edmund. "Uncle Edmund?"

He gave a brief nod.

Rosalind paled.

'So Evelyn is the one connected to them! Damn it all!'

She couldn't bring herself to meet Dominic's gaze, already feeling the weight of his murderous glare.

She'd only told Dominic about Evelyn's ties to the de Armas family. The Kents and de Armas were both noble houses, but the latter held far less royal favor.

'We could have blamed any harm to Evelyn on the Goldmanns, deepening their feud with the de Armas. That's what the leftists wanted! But now...'

The plan had unraveled spectacularly.

Evelyn approached Edmund, glancing between the men. Suddenly, Dominic's earlier words made sense.

'He was behind this all along!'

Dominic shot Evelyn one last venomous look before signaling his retreat. His men followed silently.

Rosalind knew returning with Dominic meant a fate worse than death. She turned desperate eyes to Nathan, pleading silently for mercy.

Nathan didn't even glance her way.

At the hospital...

After her examination, Evelyn sat wrapped in Nathan's coat, listening to the doctor's report outside. "Aside from the sedative and psychological trauma, the young lady has no serious injuries."
###Chapter 421

Nathan strode into the room, pulling out the chair with a quiet scrape before settling across from Evelyn. "Still not feeling well?" His voice carried that familiar deep timbre.

Evelyn shook her head, her fingers tracing invisible patterns on the tablecloth. "Why did you bring Uncle Edmund here?"

A muscle twitched near Nathan's eye. "I called him. After what happened at the gala, I needed backup." His jaw tightened. "Couldn't risk anything happening to you."

The silence stretched between them like taffy before Evelyn voiced the question burning in her chest. "Nathan, tell me truthfully - were you investigating your mother's death in Stoslo?"

His fingers stilled against the polished mahogany. The lack of response spoke volumes.

She exhaled sharply, pressing her lips together until they turned white. "I'm sorry you got dragged into this because of me."

Nathan's hand closed over hers, warm against her chilled skin. "I knew it was a trap the moment they dangled my mother's case." His thumb brushed her knuckles. "That's why I brought Edmund. If anything happened to me, you'd still have protection."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

He'd walked into danger knowingly? For her?

Her lashes fluttered. "Why reopen your mother's case now? Is it because—"

Nathan's gaze held hers for three heartbeats before he spoke. "Because the de Armas weren't responsible."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "How did you—?"

Even Theodore Goldmann had believed the de Armas guilty. When she'd confronted Harrison about it, the old man hadn't denied it. His hatred for the Goldmanns ran bone-deep.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "Rosalind confessed their involvement. The de Armas were scapegoats."

The pieces clicked together. Dominic Kent's sudden interest. The left-wing faction's timing. Harrison's absence from Stoslo during the ambush.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around his. "There's something else. When Harrison sent Lucas to see me, he claimed your great-grandfather crippled him and murdered his father."

She hesitated. "But your grandfather told me a different story. Said Patrick Goldmann took Harrison hostage but released him unharmed."

Nathan's eyes darkened to stormcloud gray.

A knock interrupted them. Edmund stood in the doorway, his silver hair catching the light. "Am I interrupting?"

Nathan rose smoothly, adjusting his cuffs. "Mr. Lincoln, keep an eye on Zoe for me." His hand lingered on Evelyn's head like she was some unruly child before striding out.

Edmund waited until Nathan's footsteps faded. "You alright, kid?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Thanks to Nathan's timing." She chewed her lip. "Uncle Edmund, who were those men?"

Edmund moved to the window, his reflection ghostly against the glass. "Kent's people. Old Stoslo nobility, just like the de Armas. Only these ones still have the royal family's ear."

The way he said it made Evelyn's skin prickle. Like they'd just stepped onto a chessboard where every piece was razor-edged.
###Chapter 422

Evelyn rose from her seat and moved toward him with deliberate steps. "Will you tell me about them?"

"Ah!" Rosalind collapsed onto the blood-smeared floor, her body trembling from the brutal lashes. Deep, jagged wounds split her skin, each one throbbing with agony. With cracked lips, she lifted her head to glare at the man lounging in the chair, exhaling a slow stream of smoke.

"Mr. Kent—I swear, I didn’t know how Evelyn was connected to Metropolis!"

Dominic took another drag, his gaze sharp as a blade. "I spent months luring Nathan into my trap. I was this close to having him."

Rosalind's teeth chattered uncontrollably.

Dominic uncrossed his legs and stood, his tall frame looming over her battered form. He stared down, his voice dripping with disdain. "And then you ruined everything. Because you couldn’t even verify that woman’s identity?"

She reached out, fingers clutching at his pant leg. "Mr. Kent, please—give me another chance! I can fix this. I’ll do anything."

A dark chuckle escaped him. He crouched, gripping her hair and yanking her head back until her scalp burned. She bit back a whimper as he forced her to meet his cold eyes. "Anything?"

Dominic turned to the man holding the whip. "Bring it out."

The man nodded and disappeared through the door.

It? Rosalind’s stomach twisted with dread.

Dominic smirked at the terror in her eyes. "Relax. It’s not for you. You’re not worthy of something this precious."

The man returned, carrying a sleek silver box with a fingerprint lock. Dominic pressed his thumb against the scanner. The lid slid open, revealing a slender glass tube filled with an eerie blue liquid.

It shimmered—beautiful, delicate, deadly.

Dominic lifted it, watching the way the light danced through the substance. "Do you know what this is?"

She shook her head, her breath shallow.

"This," he murmured, "is perfection and poison in one. If it spills onto skin, the infection begins. No cure. No mercy."

Rosalind paled. She’d heard whispers of this—rumors from Stoslo’s dark past. But she never imagined the epidemic decades ago hadn’t been natural. It had been engineered.

Dominic’s grin widened at her horror. "Don’t worry. This is the last of its kind. And once it’s used, there’s no stopping it. Hospitals won’t even detect it. Just a slow, quiet death."

"Mr. Kent," she rasped, "what do you want me to do with it?"

He pulled out a syringe, gloved his hands, and carefully drew a small amount of the blue liquid. Then he sealed the tube and crouched before her again, holding the needle inches from her face.

"Make sure Nathan gets infected. Fail me, and I’ll carve off your head and toss it into the Zena River."

At the hospital...

After Edmund finished recounting the past, Evelyn sat frozen. Even the epidemic that had ravaged Stoslo after the princess’s downfall—it had all been orchestrated. A calculated move to turn the people against her, to strip her of her birthright.
###Chapter 423

The princess of Stoslo was adored by her people, celebrated as the most approachable royal the kingdom had ever known. Her business acumen was unmatched, and her influence stretched far beyond the palace walls. King Maxwell himself had declared her leadership skills rivaled even those of his sons.

Yet this beloved princess, who cherished her nation above all else, faced disgrace when she fell for Philip Goldmann—a man deemed unworthy of her station.

This scandal ignited the royal family's internal strife.

The court fractured into two factions. The left-wing, including the current Kents, rallied behind Prince Reginald, the princess's younger half-brother. The other faction remained loyal to the princess.

"The princess affair" became the left-wing's weapon to undermine her claim to the throne, using her relationship with Philip as political ammunition.

When a devastating epidemic struck, the people's faith in their princess wavered.

But without Philip's intervention, the left-wing would have executed their coup. Contrary to their propaganda, Philip wasn't the bloodthirsty villain they portrayed—his hands were stained only with the blood of those who deserved it.

Edmund Lincoln slowly turned, his piercing gaze settling on Evelyn Vanderbilt's face. "The left-wing targets the Goldmanns because royal blood flows in their veins. Eliminating them removes a threat to their power."

Evelyn's lips parted. "What about the de Armas?"

Edmund stepped closer. "They were originally left-wing allies, but when Philip took young Harrison hostage to force the Count's withdrawal, the family became neutral. After the Count's accidental death, Harrison refused involvement in their schemes."

Evelyn's mind raced as she coldly observed, "Could the left-wing have manipulated the rift between de Armas and Goldmanns?"

If Harrison's account was truthful—and if Theodore hadn't lied—three possibilities emerged from that fateful incident.

Someone might have exploited Philip's release of Harrison to frame the Goldmanns.

If the de Armas were truly innocent, then like Nathan suspected, they'd been framed in his mother's death fifteen years prior—just as Dominic Kent used Rosalind as bait. Even her death would have been blamed on the Goldmanns. The left-wing had weaponized the families' feud, turning the de Armas into pawns for their purge.

Edmund's lips curved. "Perhaps."

"Uncle Edmund," Evelyn said calmly, "you're still keeping secrets. Always saying 'later' or 'when you're stronger.' Is this connected too?"

Before learning her mother's true identity, Evelyn hadn't questioned these mysteries. But now she saw the tangled web connecting the Goldmanns to the royals—and even Edmund's shadowy past.

He'd protected her by withholding the truth, fearing she'd become another sacrificial piece in their deadly game.

Edmund neither confirmed nor denied. "Had Nathan Goldmann not entered your life, I might have told you sooner."
###Chapter 424

Edmund studied Evelyn's face carefully. "Harrison likely came to the same conclusion. Had he known about Ms. Isabella's daughter, he would have claimed you immediately. Harrison isn't foolish - he understands the left-wing faction might exploit your connection."

Evelyn's eyes widened momentarily before recalling Harrison's chilling words to her.

"You're Isabella's child, so I won't harm you personally during my vengeance against the Goldmanns. But I can't speak for others."

Those "others" clearly meant the radical leftists.

A sudden realization struck Evelyn after a prolonged silence. She met Edmund's gaze steadily. "There's something else I need to know."

Edmund raised an eyebrow as she asked calmly, "Was my mother's illness connected to that virus?"

The atmosphere in the study turned glacial.

After what felt like an eternity, Edmund lowered his eyes and murmured, "Yes."

His gaze drifted toward the window. "She contracted a rare dormant strain linked to the pandemic three decades prior. Your mother was among those infected."

"The outbreak thirty years ago?" Evelyn whispered, pieces clicking together from the reports she'd seen.

Edmund recognized the futility of concealment now that she'd become a target. As long as Evelyn remained in Stoslo, danger would follow.

"Your mother volunteered during the crisis. Hundreds were infected in Cornelia then, though it wasn't the initial outbreak. Besides the princess incident, the epidemic thirty years back was the second major occurrence."

Evelyn gasped. "The princess was—"

Edmund nodded grimly. "Do you honestly believe the royal family would announce their princess died from a virus?"

The answer was obvious.

With the princess infected, the palace had claimed she succumbed to natural illness.

Evelyn fell silent. Though born years after these events, she'd studied this history. The princess's epidemic had been far deadlier than the later outbreak, wiping out nearly half of Stoslo's population. Over 390,000 lives lost—truth would have sparked chaos.

The later outbreak infected a thousand, with only a dozen fatalities thanks to advanced treatments.

Public records claimed the epidemic's containment resulted from a vaccine breakthrough. During the princess's era, no such remedy existed.

"But if there was a vaccine, why couldn't my mother—"

"It controlled symptoms but couldn't cure," Edmund interrupted. "The dormant virus shows no early signs, like rabies. Both have year-long incubation periods. Early vaccine administration could suppress it, allowing potential recovery."

"So my mother..." Evelyn's voice faltered.

Edmund answered quietly, "Your mother discovered her infection a year post-outbreak. She sought Sebastian in Morwich—only he possessed a solution. Without that journey, she wouldn't have survived long enough to bear you. Sebastian maintained viral suppression and developed an antiserum."
###Chapter 425

"Unfortunately, it was too late." His voice was heavy with regret. "Your mother was in the final stages of the illness and didn't have much time left. That's why she chose to leave."

A pause. Then, softer—

"But before she went, Sebastian gave her the antibody. There were only two in existence. He kept one for himself and entrusted the other to your mother. I believe she injected it before deciding to conceive. Otherwise, your father would have been infected too, and you—"

Edmund hesitated, his gaze flickering over Evelyn's face before he fell silent.

Her heart clenched. "So that's why my blood is different?"

Isabella had made the choice to inject herself while pregnant, even though the serum couldn't save her. She had done it to protect Richard—and to ensure Evelyn wouldn't inherit the virus.

Had she known all along that she wouldn't survive? Had she planned her departure meticulously, leaving nothing to chance? But then—why marry Richard, a man she barely knew, instead of returning to Sebastian, her first love?

"Evelyn," Edmund said carefully, "remember what I told you about keeping your blood's properties a secret?"

She nodded, curiosity burning in her chest.

He leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "The virus can't infect you. And the sleeper virus outbreak wasn't natural. It was engineered."

Back at the hotel, Evelyn's mind still spun with questions.

Chloe, waiting for her in the lobby, took one look at her pale face and frowned. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," Evelyn forced a smile.

The Viana Jewelry Show had ended without her. She'd left before the final verdict, but right now, the results were the last thing on her mind.

Upstairs, she stepped under the shower's scalding spray, trying to wash away the weight of Edmund's words. The sleeper virus—man-made. A deliberate act of destruction.

Who would do something like that? Who could be so ruthless?

Wrapped in a robe, she towel-dried her hair when a knock sounded at the door.

She opened it—and barely had time to register Nathan's presence before she launched herself into his arms.

He caught her effortlessly, his low chuckle vibrating against her skin. "Missed me that much?"

"You have no idea," she mumbled into his shoulder.

His hands settled at her waist, warm and familiar. "Did you eat?"

"Not yet." She pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "Where were you?"

"Handling some business." He nudged the door shut with his foot, his gaze darkening as it trailed over her. The robe clung to damp skin, the scent of her shampoo sweet in the air.

One brow arched.

Then, without warning, he scooped her up.

Evelyn yelped as he carried her to the couch, depositing her onto his lap. Her arms looped around his neck instinctively.

"What took so long?" she asked, fingers playing with the hair at his nape.

Nathan's hands slid beneath the robe's belt, teasing but controlled. His voice was pure velvet. "Half a day apart, and you're already this clingy?"

She laughed, unrepentant. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

"Is that so?" His lips curved, slow and dangerous. "Then how do you plan to show it?"

Heat flooded her cheeks as his fingers traced higher. "You're already doing plenty."

"Am I?" He feigned innocence, even as his touch grew bolder.

Evelyn squirmed, breath hitching when his thumb brushed a sensitive spot. "N-Nathan—"

He finally stilled, but his smirk was anything but innocent. "Seems like you're the one taking advantage now."
###Chapter 426

Evelyn gasped sharply, her breath hitching. "You've actually gone and done it, Nathan!"

After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn began smoothing down her rumpled clothes. Nathan chuckled darkly, assisting her with deliberate slowness. "You're improving remarkably, Zoe. My lessons seem to be paying off."

"Flattered?" Evelyn pouted, her cheeks puffing adorably. This man grew bolder by the day - who knew he'd dare do such things right here?

Noticing her adorable irritation, Nathan's gaze softened with undisguised affection.

They said women only became clingy and spoiled when truly in love. Seeing these traits in Evelyn filled him with primal satisfaction.

Pulling her against his chest, he murmured, "I made a discovery today. Rosalind knew about my mother's abduction."

Evelyn stiffened. "She never told your grandfather?"

Nathan's eyes turned glacial. "She told no one - not Grandfather, not the Night Banquet members. She pinned everything on Harrison."

Silence stretched between them. Evelyn recalled Rosalind's desperate expression earlier - that silent plea for help, the lack of genuine loyalty to Dominic.

Was Dominic blackmailing her?

Not that Evelyn cared. Rosalind had crossed too many lines. Karma always collected its dues.

A sudden growl interrupted the moment. Nathan blinked before bursting into laughter.

Evelyn's face burned crimson. "This is your fault!" she hissed. "I told you I was starving!"

"Mm, my mistake," Nathan conceded, still grinning. "Let me make it up to you."

He drove them to an open-air restaurant near the amusement park, its fairy lights creating a magical ambiance. The place buzzed with international tourists, making the striking couple stand out even more.

Nearby, the amusement park glittered like a jewel box. A colossal Ferris wheel dominated the skyline, its slow rotation painting the night with streaks of colored light.

"Nathan!" Evelyn pointed excitedly. "Let's ride that after dinner! I've never been on one before." Her lower lip jutted out in that irresistible pout. "I can't leave Stoslo without experiencing this."

Amusement parks had been a luxury in her past life. Now, she intended to savor every moment.

Nathan's lips quirked. "As you wish."

After their meal, they joined the vibrant crowds. A clown distributed rainbow balloons to delighted children while carnival music filled the air.

Hand in hand, they approached the Ferris wheel. Nathan purchased tickets, and soon they were ascending in their private gondola.

Evelyn pressed against the glass as the world shrank below them, her eyes sparkling brighter than the city lights. Across from her, Nathan sat perfectly composed - though his gaze never left her radiant face.

To him, no view could compare.

Catching his stare, Evelyn grinned. "They say couples who ride Ferris wheels always break up." She delighted in Nathan's immediate scowl. Rising, she closed the distance between them, eyes gleaming. "But legend also says..." Her fingers traced his jaw. "...a kiss at the peak ensures forever."

As their capsule reached the apex, Evelyn sealed their fate with a kiss that tasted like promises.
###Chapter 427

Nathan lowered his head, his fingers tangling in Evelyn's silken hair as he deepened their kiss.

The Ferris wheel myth seemed trivial, but for her, he'd embrace any fairy tale.

When they finally parted, Evelyn's cheeks were flushed crimson, her breath coming in shallow gasps.

Nathan chuckled, thumb brushing her swollen lips. "After all this time, you still forget to breathe during kisses?"

Evelyn batted her lashes, too breathless to retort.

"Clearly you need more practice." His fingers tilted her chin as he claimed her mouth again.

An eternity later, Evelyn wrenched away, chest heaving. "Enough!" She pressed a hand against his chest when he leaned in again. "I've got it now."

Her lips tingled - any longer and they'd be embarrassingly swollen.

As they disembarked, a freckled boy in a newsboy cap approached with a basket of roses. "Mister, your lady's the prettiest I've seen today. Roses would make her shine brighter."

Nathan flashed a grin, pulling bills from his wallet. "I'll take them all. Keep the change."

The boy beamed, handing over the basket with a theatrical bow before skipping away.

Evelyn buried her nose in the fragrant blooms. "Mr. Goldmann, such extravagance for little old me?"

He leaned close, breath warm against her ear. "Do you like them?"

She smirked. "I adore roses... but cold hard cash more."

Her eyes sparkled at the mention of money. Without hesitation, Nathan pressed his wallet into her hands. "Bank's open, sweetheart."

Click.

A shadowy figure captured their intimate moment.

The photo transmitted instantly, receiving a chilling reply:

[He doesn't leave this park alive.]

[Understood.]

The assassin adjusted his earpiece, signaling to black-clad operatives blending into the crowd.

Evelyn dragged Nathan through the bustling park, her laughter infectious. He followed indulgently - until his instincts screamed danger.

He whirled around, scanning the crowd with razor focus.

Evelyn was gone.

"Damn it!" Nathan shoved through panicked visitors while dialing Oliver. A deafening explosion shattered the festive atmosphere.

Screams erupted as people stampeded. Masked gunmen advanced through the chaos.

Then Nathan spotted her - roses crushed underfoot, cradling a sobbing, injured girl.

"Zoe!"
###Chapter 428

Evelyn gasped as Nathan rushed to her side.

She pressed her palm against the little girl's bleeding wound, her face ghostly pale. "Nathan, she got separated from her parents. We can't just abandon her here."

"I know." His jaw tightened. "Take her and find shelter."

"But what about you?" Evelyn grabbed his arm desperately as he stood. "There are too many of them! They're hunting you down—you can't just walk out there!"

She'd overheard the chilling threats in the crowd—these men were here to kill Nathan.

Nathan cupped her face, pressing a firm kiss to her forehead. His thumb brushed away an unshed tear. "Trust me, sweetheart. Now go."

Before she could protest, he vanished into the chaos.

The child in Evelyn's arms wailed in pain. She forced herself to focus, rocking the girl gently. "Shh, sweetie. I'll get you to safety, I promise."

As the sobs subsided, Evelyn cast one last frantic look toward where Nathan had disappeared. Gritting her teeth, she scooped up the child and sprinted toward the fleeing crowds.

Police sirens wailed in the distance. Hundreds of terrified visitors huddled in the amusement park's central plaza, relief washing over them at the sight of authorities.

Evelyn pushed through the throng, searching frantically. "She's hurt! Please, can someone help? She's lost her family!"

A young couple immediately took the child. "We've got her," the woman assured.

Evelyn turned back toward the park's entrance, but the man called after her, "Miss! It's a warzone in there!"

Her lips curved in a determined smile. "My husband's still inside."

Without hesitation, she plunged back into the nightmare.

The once-vibrant park now resembled a battleground. Gunfire echoed between the abandoned rides. Evelyn ducked behind an overturned ice cream cart, her breath coming in sharp gasps.

A body collapsed inches from her hiding spot. Blood pooled on the pavement. Her stomach lurched.

Then she spotted the fallen man's weapon.

Moving faster than she thought possible, Evelyn rolled forward and snatched the pistol. The metallic click of another gun's safety being disengaged froze her blood.

"Bitch!" a masked figure snarled, leveling his weapon at her head.

Evelyn slowly raised her hands, the stolen gun clattering to the ground. "I didn't shoot him," she said carefully. "I just needed protection."

Turning with deliberate slowness, she met her captor's eyes through his balaclava. A slow, seductive smile curved her lips as she shrugged off her jacket, revealing the thin tank top beneath. "But if you'd prefer... I can make it worth your while."

She pulled the band from her hair, letting the golden waves cascade over her shoulders. The man's grip on his weapon faltered ever so slightly.
###Chapter 429

The masked man's piercing blue eyes raked over Evelyn's body. His pulse quickened, throat bobbing visibly as he swallowed hard. Seizing his momentary distraction, Evelyn twisted away from the gun barrel and sprang to her feet.

Bang!

The bullet whizzed past her shoulder.

In one fluid motion, Evelyn pivoted behind him, locking her arm around his neck in a chokehold. "Where's Nathan?" she demanded through gritted teeth.

The masked man gasped something unintelligible. With a sharp strike to his pressure point, Evelyn rendered him unconscious. She snatched his firearm and sprinted deeper into the compound.

Meanwhile, Nathan had already neutralized three attackers. Their writhing bodies littered the floor, clutching gunshot wounds. As he disarmed the fourth assailant with a brutal kick, his once-pristine suit hung in tatters. Sweat glistened on his brow, blood trickling from multiple lacerations across his arms and back. The disheveled appearance only accentuated his dangerous aura.

"Who sent you?" Nathan growled, grinding his heel into the man's hand.

When the man remained silent, Nathan delivered a vicious kick that sent him coughing blood. Pressing the gun barrel to the man's temple, Nathan hissed, "Last chance."

The man squeezed his eyes shut, embracing death.

Bang!

Nathan whirled toward the gunshot's origin. A masked attacker collapsed behind him, knife clattering to the ground. His eyes widened at the shooter.

Evelyn stood trembling, the pistol shaking violently in her grasp even after the body hit the floor.

'I just took a life... But it was him or Nathan. I had no choice.'

"Zoe!" Nathan rushed to her. The gun clattered as she collapsed into his arms, forcing a weak smile. "Nathan...I'm not a monster, am I?"

Nathan crushed her against his chest, voice raw. "What the hell were you thinking coming back here?"

Evelyn met his gaze. "I couldn't leave you to face this alone."

Nathan's breath hitched. He cradled her closer, pressing a desperate kiss to her hair. The thought of losing her paralyzed him.

Hidden in the shadows, Rosalind signaled retreat. "Police incoming. Secure the virus." A subordinate handed her a syringe. Her gaze lingered on Nathan, heart fracturing anew.

Twenty years of devotion. Childhood dreams of becoming his bride. All shattered because he'd chosen Evelyn.

Rosalind's eyes burned with venom as she loaded a special bullet - its tip glistening with a single drop of lethal virus. Dominic's warning echoed in her mind: one skin contact meant certain death. Even protective gloves couldn't stop this enhanced strain.

Her hands shook as she took aim. "You should have loved me, Nathan," she whispered.

Nathan's instincts flared. He spotted the laser sight a heartbeat too late. Whirling, he shielded Evelyn with his body as the shot rang out.
###Chapter 430

A gunshot cracked through the air, sharp and sudden.

The bullet struck Nathan's back with a sickening thud.

Evelyn froze, her breath catching in her throat.

His face, usually so composed, softened under the dim light. The fire in his eyes dimmed, fading like embers in the wind.

His fingers trembled as he reached for her cheek, brushing away a stray tear. A faint smile touched his lips. "Zoe... don't worry. I—"

He leaned in, his breath warm against her skin—

Then his body went slack, collapsing against her like a puppet with its strings severed.

Evelyn barely caught him, her hands shaking. Blood seeped through his shirt, staining her fingers.

Hot tears spilled down her cheeks. She clutched him tighter, her voice breaking. "No! Nathan, stay awake! Look at me—don't you dare leave me!"

By the time Oliver and Chloe arrived with the police, the scene was chaos.

Evelyn knelt on the ground, cradling Nathan's limp form, her sobs raw and desperate.

"Mr. Goldmann—!" Oliver's voice was thick with shock.

The ambulance screeched to a halt. Inside, Evelyn gripped Nathan's icy hand, pressing it between hers as if she could will warmth back into him.

The medical team worked frantically, but the blood wouldn't stop.

Her entire body trembled.

At the hospital, Nathan was rushed into surgery. The doors slammed shut, leaving Evelyn standing there, hollow.

Her legs gave out. She slid down the wall, arms wrapped around herself.

"Mrs. Goldmann—" Chloe reached for her, but Oliver held her back.

There were no words.

Edmund arrived soon after, his face grim. After speaking with Oliver, he approached Evelyn, crouching in front of her.

"Zoe," he said gently, "Nathan is strong. He'll pull through."

She shook her head, her voice barely a whisper. "It should've been me."

Edmund exhaled, steadying her shoulders. "He chose to protect you. Don't waste that by falling apart now."

He helped her up, guiding her to a bench. His jacket settled over her shoulders, heavy with the scent of cedar.

"Wouldn't want him waking up to see you like this, would we?"

She managed a weak smile.

Then the surgeon emerged.

Evelyn shot to her feet, heart pounding. "How is he?"

The doctor hesitated. "His condition is... complicated. But we're doing everything we can."

She grabbed his arm, nails digging in. "Promise me he'll live."

The doctor met her gaze. "We won't let him go."

Nathan survived—but barely.

The ICU kept him under strict observation, allowing only brief visits.

Every day, Evelyn stood outside that glass, watching the steady rise and fall of his chest. The ventilator hissed, a cruel reminder of his fragility.

She traced the lines of the ECG, counting each heartbeat like a prayer.

As long as it kept going, so would she.

When she stepped out this time, Edmund was speaking with the doctor. His expression was unreadable.

Her stomach twisted.

Something was wrong.
###Chapter 431

The moment Evelyn spotted him, Edmund exchanged a few words with the physician before approaching her. "Zoe, I knew I'd find you here at the hospital."

Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "Where else would I be?"

Her gaze flickered to Edmund as soon as she answered. "What were you discussing with the doctor?"

Edmund hesitated briefly before replying smoothly, "Just checking on Mr. Goldmann's condition."

"Is it serious?" Evelyn pressed, noting his lack of immediate denial. Her voice dropped, rough with suppressed emotion. "Is he in danger?"

"It's... complicated." Edmund's expression darkened with concern.

If it were just a gunshot wound, survival would have been victory enough. But Nathan's situation was far more intricate than that.

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone buzzed—her father calling all the way from Cornelia.

She hesitated, then answered.

"Dad?"

"Zoe, are you alright? The news mentioned riots breaking out in Stoslo." Richard's voice was thick with worry.

Evelyn frowned. "I'm fine. Don't worry about me."

"I just needed to hear your voice," Richard sighed. "How much longer will you be there? The children miss you terribly."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Three children.

What would they do if she had died that night? And Nathan still hadn't woken up.

She bit her lip. "It might take a while. Tell them their father and I are both safe."

After a few more reassurances, Richard hung up. Edmund rested a hand on her shoulder. "Go back to the hotel. Leave the hospital to me."

Evelyn trusted him. She nodded.

Once she left, Edmund sought out the doctor again. He knocked, waited for permission, then stepped inside.

Dr. Raymond stood. "Mr. Lincoln, please sit."

Edmund took a seat on the couch. "About what we discussed earlier—elaborate."

Dr. Raymond, familiar with Edmund’s reputation, handed him a blood test report without hesitation. "We analyzed Mr. Goldmann's blood composition. There’s something unusual."

Edmund scanned the results, his face paling slightly.

Dr. Raymond continued, "His condition resembles the virus-infected patients from thirty years ago. But aside from his platelets, everything else appears normal."

Edmund’s grip tightened on the paper. "Who else knows?"

Dr. Raymond shook his head. "We can’t confirm if it’s truly the virus or a mutated strain. Another week of observation is necessary."

Edmund remained silent.

The "sleeper virus" was a silent predator—transmitted only through intimate contact or inherited from an infected parent. It wasn’t airborne, requiring direct skin-to-skin exposure.

The outbreak three decades ago had originated in a luxury hotel’s water tank. Every guest who bathed or consumed the contaminated water became a carrier.

Hundreds checked in daily. The restaurant used the same water supply.

Within weeks, thousands were infected—unknowingly spreading it to their partners.

A nightmare reborn.
###Chapter 432

The virus traces weren't just found in the hotel's water supply. Multiple water sources across the city showed contamination, proving this outbreak wasn't natural - it was orchestrated. 'If Nathan's truly infected, it confirms my worst fears. Someone's still actively developing this bioweapon.'

Evelyn returned to the hotel, freezing when Theodore and Oliver emerged from the entrance. Theodore's face darkened upon seeing her. "Have you forgotten your promise? Look what's happened to Nathan because of you. Are you satisfied now?"

Her gaze dropped. "I'm sorry..."

No excuses came to mind. Nathan had taken that bullet protecting her - the truth was undeniable.

Theodore's expression turned stormy. "Being with you puts Nathan in constant danger. If you truly care for him, walk away."

Her head snapped up. "I can't."

"Then you'll be his executioner!" Theodore's eyes burned with fury.

When Evelyn opened her mouth but found no words, Theodore delivered the final blow. "Evelyn, my objections to your relationship exist for good reason. You're Nathan's only vulnerability. How do you think his enemies got to him? Through you!"

"That bullet was meant for your heart. Next time, he might not survive." The words struck like a physical blow. Her breath hitched painfully at the thought of Nathan dying for her.

'Will I really be the death of him?'

The mere possibility made each breath feel like swallowing glass. Oliver wanted to defend Evelyn, but Theodore's thunderous expression warned against interference. Any protest would only redirect Theodore's wrath onto Evelyn.

Better to wait until Nathan regained consciousness.

As Theodore and Oliver left for the hospital, Evelyn's spirits sank lower. The confrontation had left her hollow.

Chloe waited in the hotel room, rising immediately when Evelyn entered. "You're back... Did you see Mr. Goldmann Senior?" She knew Theodore had come to Stoslo because of the incident.

'With Nathan injured and Theodore never approving of their relationship, this confrontation was inevitable.'

Evelyn nodded numbly.

Seeing her despondent expression, Chloe squeezed her shoulder reassuringly. "Don't torture yourself. Nathan's stable now. He'll wake up soon."

"Chloe," Evelyn met her eyes desperately, "Tell me honestly - am I destroying Nathan?"

Chloe hesitated briefly before smiling. "Why would you think that? Life's unpredictable, Evelyn. And any Blackwood Camp graduate knows the risks. If Nathan took that bullet, it's because you're worth dying for."

The words only deepened Evelyn's anguish. "Exactly. He'd sacrifice everything for me. That's precisely why I've become the weapon his enemies will use against him."

'He pretended indifference in public to protect me, while I remained oblivious. I never considered the dangers he faced in Stoslo. Never imagined I'd be used as leverage against him.'
###Chapter 433

"I just wanted to stay with him. I never meant to leave him vulnerable, yet I ended up causing him harm."

Noticing Evelyn's despondency, Chloe grasped her shoulders firmly. "Running away from challenges is cowardice, Evelyn. The only way forward is facing them together. Do you truly believe you're responsible for Mr. Goldmann's injuries?"

Her grip tightened. "No, you're not. Our enemies have always existed. Even if you'd never entered Nathan's life, this danger would have found him eventually. It was inevitable."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "I never knew you were so good at comforting people."

Chloe grinned, scratching her head sheepishly.

Evelyn moved to the sofa and sat gracefully. "Speaking of which, is Rosalind working with them now?"

Chloe nodded, sitting opposite her. "Harrison's already investigating. Who would've thought Rosalind Summers had ties to those people? She hid it well. No wonder she managed to frame Winifred so easily."

Her expression darkened with lingering disbelief at Rosalind's betrayal.

Evelyn's gaze grew thoughtful.

'So Rosalind was involved in the amusement park incident too.'

'It's time I paid her a visit.'

At the hospital...

Nathan's eyelids fluttered open.

The nurse monitoring him gasped and rushed out. "Dr. Raymond! The patient is awake!"

Dr. Raymond, Theodore, and Oliver hurried in. Theodore marched straight to the bedside, scrutinizing his grandson. "Nathan? Can you hear me?"

Nathan nodded weakly. As the nurse removed his oxygen mask, his eyes darted around the room. "Where's Zoe?"

Theodore's face soured. "That woman again? You nearly died, boy!"

Oliver answered quickly, "Ms. Vanderbilt returned to the hotel. She's perfectly safe."

Nathan winced as he tried sitting up, the searing pain in his back stealing his breath. His last memory was the gunshot - everything after remained blank. "How long was I out?"

"Four days in a coma, Mr. Goldmann," Dr. Raymond replied. "Your wife visited daily."

Nathan attempted to throw off the blanket but Theodore restrained him. "Are you trying to finish what the bullet started? You're still in ICU!"

"It was just a gunshot wound. Why ICU?" Nathan frowned.

Theodore exchanged glances with Dr. Raymond.

The doctor offered a placating smile. "Your condition remains... complex. Further observation is necessary."

"Rest now that you're awake," Theodore ordered before turning to Oliver. "Stay with him."

Once they left, Nathan fixed Oliver with an intense stare. "The attackers?"

Oliver nodded. "The Kents, as expected. Also mercenaries hired by Prince Reginald."

Meanwhile at LG Entertainment Club...

Rosalind's blindfold was ripped away. Blinking against the sudden light, she recoiled upon recognizing the woman before her. "Evelyn Vanderbilt? You bitch!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Why so surprised, Ms. Summers? Surely you anticipated this?"

Rosalind paled when she noticed the foreign bodyguards flanking Evelyn.

'Edmund Lincoln's men.'

Evelyn approached slowly, heels clicking ominously. "Playing both sides must be exhausting."

Her lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Does Nathan know you helped orchestrate his mother's tragedy?"
###Chapter 434

Rosalind's hands trembled slightly as she averted her gaze, unable to meet Evelyn's piercing stare. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

Evelyn took a step closer, her voice low and deliberate. "Is that the truth, or are you just pretending? Should I ask your new employer, Dominic Kent, for the answers instead?"

Rosalind's eyes flashed with resentment. "Evelyn, what exactly are you implying?"

With a dismissive shrug, Evelyn scoffed. "Exactly what you heard. Theodore Goldmann trusted you once, yet you betrayed the family and sided with Dominic. Do you really think he values you any more than they did?"

Rosalind's fists clenched, her lips curling into a bitter smile. "Why bother asking? Are you trying to win me back? Pathetic. Even if I returned to the Goldmanns now, there’s no future for me there. I might as well stay with Dominic."

A cold smirk twisted Rosalind’s lips when Evelyn remained silent. "So what if you’ve uncovered the truth about the incident fifteen years ago? Do you honestly think the Goldmanns would believe the de Armas are innocent because of it?"

She leaned in, her voice dripping with venom. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, don’t be naive. What can you possibly do for the Goldmanns now? The person you should be worrying about is Nathan. The Goldmanns can’t even protect themselves anymore—how laughable!"

The smugness in Rosalind’s tone sent a sharp pang through Evelyn’s chest, especially at the mention of Nathan. He was shot because of me. And those people from that night are connected to Dominic. I won’t show mercy to anyone who hurt my husband—no matter who they are.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into tight fists. "Rosalind Summers, I was going to give you a chance to leave with dignity. But it seems you don’t know how to appreciate kindness."

Rosalind threw her head back in a mocking laugh. "You giving me a chance? Evelyn Vanderbilt, what makes you think you have that right? You are the reason I’m in this position!"

Evelyn said nothing, her expression unreadable.

Rosalind lunged forward, gripping Evelyn’s collar, her face contorted with fury. "Nathan never should have fallen for you. You brought this upon him. You are the reason he’s suffering!"

Two bodyguards immediately seized Rosalind, forcing her back and restraining her arms.

Hatred burned in Rosalind’s eyes as she spat, "You claim to love him? Don’t worry—you’ll join him in death soon enough!"

Evelyn’s voice was eerily calm. "Before that happens, take care of yourself."

With a flick of her wrist, the bodyguards released Rosalind.

Confusion flickered across Rosalind’s face before she sneered. "Scared, are we? Why aren’t you doing anything to me? You dragged me here—don’t you want revenge? Go on! Order them to kill me if you dare!"

Evelyn’s lips curved into a chilling smile. "I won’t lay a finger on you. Someone else will do it for me. I hope you won’t regret your choices."

Rosalind stiffened, sensing the threat beneath Evelyn’s words, but she had no time to dwell on it. With a haughty toss of her head, she stormed out of the private room.

Evelyn watched her leave, arms crossed. Then, turning to her men, she ordered, "Download the surveillance footage and send it to me."

As she stepped out of the club, her phone buzzed—a message from Edmund.

[Nathan is awake.]

Her heart leaped. She signaled her driver. "To the hospital. Now."

At Kent Manor

Rosalind stumbled as she was suddenly shoved to the floor.

Dominic threw a tablet in front of her, the screen displaying footage of her leaving the LG Entertainment Club—followed by Evelyn.

Rosalind’s blood ran cold.

That bitch set me up!

"Mr. Kent, please—let me explain—"

A sharp cry cut through the air as Dominic’s hand struck her.
###Chapter 435

Rosalind was thrown against the wall with a brutal kick. Dominic loosened his tie, his dark eyes burning with fury.

"Traitorous wench," he hissed. "Having second thoughts about betraying me?"

Rosalind scrambled to her knees, trembling. "No! I swear, I didn’t say anything! Evelyn set me up—she forced me there to intimidate me!"

Dominic leaned down, gripping her chin with bruising force. "You know too much, Rosalind Summers. Do you really think I’d believe your pathetic lies?"

Her entire body shook. Dominic was paranoid—he despised betrayal above all else. Even if she had stayed silent, she now carried dangerous secrets. The virus. The conspiracy.

"I didn’t tell her anything!" she sobbed. "Please, Mr. Kent, you have to believe me! I was framed!"

Tears streamed down her face. She had nowhere left to run.

The Night Banquet is lost to me. The Goldmanns will kill me on sight. My only chance is to beg for mercy.

Dominic released her with a scoff.

Just as relief flickered in her chest, his voice cut through the air like ice. "Pathetic. Falling into someone else’s trap so easily."

A sharp bark echoed outside.

Rosalind’s blood turned to ice.

Three massive wolfhounds lunged into the room, their teeth bared, saliva dripping. Their handlers stood by, expressionless.

She clutched Dominic’s pant leg, desperation clawing at her throat. "Please! I’ll remember my place! Just give me another chance!"

He kicked her away without hesitation.

The handlers released the leashes.

The dogs attacked.

Screams tore through the night. Blood splattered across the floor.

Rosalind’s vision blurred as teeth sank into her flesh. Pain seared through her—her arm, her leg, her face.

She was nothing but prey.

Only when her cries grew weak did Dominic finally signal for the dogs to retreat.

Rosalind lay in a pool of blood, half her face mangled beyond recognition. Her breath came in shallow gasps.

Dominic sighed, as if bored. "Tsk. Maybe now you’ll learn." He waved a dismissive hand. "Get her patched up. Make sure she doesn’t die."

Two guards dragged her limp body away.

Dominic picked up the shattered tablet from the floor. The frozen image of Evelyn’s horrified face stared back at him.

With a snarl, he hurled it against the wall.

The screen shattered into pieces.

At the hospital...

Evelyn burst into the ward. "Nathan!"

Nathan barely had time to react before she crashed into him, her arms wrapping around him in a desperate embrace. The force sent him tumbling back onto the bed, pain flaring through his injuries.

He sucked in a sharp breath.

Evelyn jerked back, eyes wide. "Oh God—did I hurt you?"

Nathan chuckled weakly, his voice rough. "Were you trying to finish me off, sweetheart?"

Her lip trembled. Tears welled in her eyes.

Nathan’s smirk faded. Gently, he wiped a tear from her cheek. "Zoe… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you."

"You idiot!" she choked out.

Tears spilled over. Nathan pulled her into his arms, murmuring soft reassurances.

"Shh… it’s okay. I’m here."

Evelyn buried her face in his chest, her body shaking. "I thought—I thought you’d never wake up."

His grip tightened. "I’m not going anywhere."
###Chapter 436

Nathan lowered his gaze, pressing his lips gently against Evelyn's forehead. He opened his mouth to speak when a violent coughing fit seized him.

Evelyn sprang up, her heart constricting with worry. "Nathan! What's wrong?"

Turning his face away, Nathan stifled the cough into his palm. His eyes widened slightly at the sticky crimson substance now staining his hand. Smoothing his expression, he clenched his fist before meeting her concerned gaze. "Just swallowed wrong, darling. Nothing serious."

Her lips pressed into a thin line of disbelief. "You're pale as a ghost. When was the last time you ate? Let me make you something."

Nathan's tired eyes softened. "Now that you mention it... I'd kill for your famous chicken soup." His voice carried that familiar teasing lilt, though weaker than usual.

Evelyn stood decisively. "Stay put. I'll be back in twenty minutes."

As she reached the doorway, she spotted Edmund lingering in the hall. "Uncle Edmund, could you keep an eye on him? Just until I get back?"

The older man nodded solemnly.

The moment Evelyn's footsteps faded, Edmund entered to find Nathan staring at his bloodied palm with eerie calm.

"Coughing up blood now, are we?" Edmund's voice was gruff with unspoken concern.

Nathan's fingers curled around the evidence. "Apparently so." His piercing gaze lifted. "You knew this would happen."

Edmund exhaled heavily. "Your condition's been deteriorating since the shooting."

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw. "Tell me straight - what's happening to me?"

The silence stretched between them before Edmund spoke the damning words. "It's the sleeper virus. The mutated strain."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

Nathan's knuckles whitened around the bloodstained napkin. "Does Zoe know?"

"Only Dr. Raymond and I are aware." Edmund's voice dropped. "The original strain had a year-long incubation period. This variant... it's progressing at an alarming rate."

Nathan turned toward the window where the dying sunlight painted the sky in hues of blood and gold. He knew the statistics - no known cure, 100% mortality rate. The original creator of the antibody had vanished decades ago. Worst of all, the virus could transmit to intimate partners. Even with precautions, there remained that terrifying 0.9% risk.

"You're not planning to tell her." It wasn't a question.

Nathan's smile was bitter. "You know Evelyn. If she thought there was even a fraction of a chance..." His voice broke. "That woman would walk through hellfire barefoot if she thought it would save me."

Edwin handed him a fresh handkerchief. "Clean yourself up before she returns."

As Nathan wiped the blood from his fingers, his mind raced. "The bullet?"

Edwin nodded grimly. "Ballistic delivery. Someone wanted to make absolutely sure the virus took hold."

"The sleeper virus was supposed to be contained after the last outbreak." Nathan's voice turned dangerously quiet. "If they're weaponizing it again..."

"Then we're looking at another global catastrophe." Edwin's aged face was grave. "The original strain gave victims a year of perfect health before the collapse. This variant skips the grace period entirely."

Nathan's gaze dropped to his trembling hands - the first visible symptom of his body's impending failure. Somewhere in the kitchen, he could hear Evelyn humming as she cooked, blissfully unaware that their borrowed time was running out.
###Chapter 437

The moment the incubation period ended, the infected would begin coughing up blood relentlessly. Their immune systems would collapse at an alarming rate—cancer patients would deteriorate rapidly, metabolism would spiral out of control, and blood cell counts would plummet. Within a year, death was inevitable.

Nathan let out a bitter chuckle. "So, how long do I have?"

Edmund frowned. "Given your current condition... three, maybe four years."

Evelyn arrived at the hospital with dinner she had prepared herself. When she stepped into the room, she found Nathan staring blankly out the window, Edmund already gone.

"Nathan, I brought you food." She moved to his bedside and set the container down.

He turned to her with a faint smile. "Good. I want you to feed me."

She didn’t argue. Opening the container, she sat beside him, carefully spooning food into his mouth. Between bites, she asked, "Has Uncle Edmund left already?"

"Yeah. He had something to take care of."

Evelyn continued feeding him, her lips curving slightly. "How does it taste?"

Nathan lowered his gaze, amusement flickering in his eyes. "Do I even dare say it’s bad when you made it?"

She pouted.

Once he finished, she set the container aside. "I’m staying with you tonight."

Nathan’s gaze lingered on her before he simply murmured, "Mm."

She requested an extra bed from the nurse, fluffed the pillow, and settled in. Nathan shifted onto his side, watching her. "Zoe."

"Hmm?" She turned to face him. "What is it?"

His dark eyes held something unreadable. "If... I ever keep something from you in the future, would you be angry?"

Evelyn hesitated, then shook her head. "No. If you hide something, I’ll assume it’s for my own good."

Nathan’s smile deepened, but he said nothing more.

Evelyn slept soundly through the night. Nathan, however, didn’t sleep at all. He spent the hours drinking in the sight of her peaceful face, memorizing every detail, before finally turning away, his expression swallowed by shadows.

The next morning—

Evelyn woke to an empty bed. She asked a nurse, who informed her Nathan had gone for tests.

She folded the extra bed neatly, then noticed the water pitcher was empty. She grabbed it and headed out.

On her way back, she spotted Oliver standing outside the room. Before she could greet him, Theodore’s sharp voice cut through the air.

"You want to be discharged now? Have you lost your mind?"

Discharged? Evelyn froze. Nathan wants to leave?

Inside, Nathan sat on the edge of the bed, looking far better than a man in a hospital gown should. "It’s just a gunshot wound. No reason to waste time lying here. I have work."

"You reckless brat!" Theodore’s voice rose. "Do you even value your life? I ought to shoot you myself and be done with it!"

Nathan smirked. "It’s not like I have much time left anyway."

"You—!" Theodore started, then noticed Evelyn standing in the doorway, kettle in hand. He scoffed. "You’d throw your life away for a woman? Is she worth it?"

Evelyn knew Theodore blamed her for Nathan’s injury. And why wouldn’t he? Nathan had gotten hurt because of her.

She pressed her lips together, setting the kettle down. "You’re leaving the hospital?"
###Chapter 438

Evelyn stood frozen as Nathan's cold gaze pierced through her. "Yes, there's no need for hospitalization," he stated flatly, then turned to Oliver.

"Book my return flight for the morning after tomorrow."

Oliver hesitated. "But your injuries—"

"I know my own condition." Nathan's tone left no room for argument.

Oliver shot a helpless glance at Theodore, who threw up his hands in exasperation. "Let him go if he insists. I've lost all authority over this stubborn grandson of mine." With that, he stormed out, his coat flapping behind him.

Evelyn bit her lip and approached Nathan. "Please listen to your grandfather. Waiting a few more days won't hurt."

The long flight could aggravate his wounds. What if they reopened mid-air?

Nathan's expression remained icy, his lips pressed into a thin line. The sudden chill in his demeanor made Evelyn shiver—this wasn't the man she knew. "Nathan?"

"I'm leaving." He stood abruptly, ignoring her concern, and reached for his clothes. As he shrugged off the hospital gown, the stark white bandages wrapped around his torso came into view. Bullet wounds, knife slashes—evidence of his brutal encounter with the masked assailant.

Without thinking, Evelyn stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him from behind, pressing her cheek against his back. His warmth was there, but beneath it, a disturbing coldness lingered.

Nathan stilled, his jaw tightening.

"You're not healed yet," she whispered, her voice soft as midnight breeze, carrying the weight of her worry.

His eyes darkened. Gently but firmly, he pried her arms away. "Don't."

Silence stretched between them as he pulled on his shirt. Evelyn moved to fasten the buttons for him. He didn't protest, but neither did he acknowledge her touch.

When she finished, she kept her gaze lowered. "Nathan... are you keeping something from me?"

Her eyes lifted, searching his face for answers.

Something was off. He felt distant, guarded in a way he'd never been before.

Nathan's gaze was unfathomable, like the depths of a frozen lake. "Some things are better left unasked."

He reached for his trousers, then paused, arching a brow at her. "Planning to watch?"

Evelyn flushed and spun around. "Fine, I won't look."

A quiet chuckle escaped him—the first hint of warmth since the conversation began.

After his discharge, they returned to his hotel suite. Evelyn packed her belongings and informed Chloe to prepare for their upcoming flight.

That afternoon, she met Madam Nora at an upscale restaurant. The elderly woman had requested the meeting upon hearing of Evelyn's abduction during the show.

"Thank you for your concern, I'm alright," Evelyn assured her with a smile.

"Good. Missing one show isn't the end. There will be other opportunities—I have faith in you."

Madam Nora's kindness touched Evelyn. Just then, the older woman's assistant approached. "Madam, we must leave for the airport in two hours."

"Of course," Madam Nora replied before turning back to Evelyn. "You're returning soon?"

Evelyn nodded. "The day after tomorrow."

"Contact me when you're back in town." As Madam Nora's wheelchair was pushed away, Evelyn remained seated, lost in thought as she stared out the window.

"Ms. Zara."

The familiar voice snapped her from her reverie. Julian stood there, glancing at the two place settings. "Dining alone?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just finished a meeting. You?"

"Business lunch." His gaze lingered on the unused cutlery. "Expecting someone? Your husband, perhaps?"
###Chapter 439

Evelyn's hand froze mid-air, the teacup trembling slightly in her grip. She lowered her gaze. "No, it was with my business partner."

It had been weeks since she last saw Nathan after he left the hospital. Not even Chloe knew where he had disappeared to.

She took a sip of tea, but the moment the liquid touched her tongue, a wave of nausea hit her. Clamping a hand over her mouth, she bolted for the bathroom.

"Ms. Zara?" Julian's concerned voice followed her, but she couldn't respond.

She barely made it to the sink before retching violently, her lunch coming back up in painful heaves. The tap water gushed as she tried to wash away the evidence, but another wave hit her, leaving her trembling.

When there was nothing left, she splashed cold water on her face and dried it with a towel, her reflection pale and exhausted.

Julian was waiting outside. "You don't look well," he observed, brow furrowed.

"It's nothing. Probably just something I ate," Evelyn dismissed weakly, waving a hand.

"Should I take you to a doctor?"

She forced a smile. "No need, really. I just need to rest."

Julian hesitated but nodded. "Alright."

Back in her room, she sipped warm water, but the moment it settled, her stomach rebelled again. Another trip to the bathroom left her hollow and shaking.

Staring at her ghostly reflection, she frowned. She hadn’t eaten anything unusual—so why this?

The doorbell chimed.

She dragged herself to the door and froze.

Nathan stood there, his expression unreadable.

He stepped inside, shutting the door behind him. "You're sick?"

A flicker of warmth sparked in her chest. Did Julian run into him?

She looped her arms around his neck, leaning into him. "Yes. Stay with me?"

Nathan exhaled but scooped her up effortlessly, carrying her to the bed. "What's wrong?" His voice was softer than usual, his breath warm against her cheek.

Her fingers curled into his shoulders. "My stomach." As if on cue, it twisted sharply.

His hand pressed gently against her abdomen. "Gastritis?"

She didn’t answer. It wasn’t pain—just relentless nausea. Mostly, she just wanted him close.

"I'll get you medicine." He moved to stand, but she clung to his arm. "No. Stay."

Nathan studied her, then sighed, brushing stray hairs from her face. "Fine. I’ll stay."

"Are you okay?" she asked suddenly.

He nodded. "Don’t worry about me."

She searched his face. He tucked a loose strand behind her ear. "What?"

Evelyn bit her lip, then looked away. "Nothing. Just... you're hiding something. I won’t ask, but—" Her voice cracked. "Don’t pull away from me."

She’d noticed. The distance. The unspoken tension.

If nothing was wrong, why did he keep withdrawing?

Nathan pulled her into his arms, his chin resting atop her head. "I just have things to handle, Zoe. That’s all."

Holding her like this, he never wanted to let go. She leaned into him completely—exactly what he'd always wanted.

But he couldn’t drag her into this. Not now.
###Chapter 440

Evelyn clung to him, burying her face in his chest. "Alright, I trust you." Nathan looked down, but his eyes swirled with dark intensity.

Dominic's phone vibrated with a message. He hurled it against the wall with a snarl.

His men stood frozen, heads bowed in silence. One dared to speak. "Edmund Lincoln is involved now. With Theodore Goldmann's return and knowledge of his grandson's injury...he won't show mercy."

Dominic exhaled a cloud of vapor from his vape, the mist distorting his reflection in the window. "Any man caught by Theodore is already dead."

The subordinate paled. "What's our move then?"

Another plume of vapor. "What did Reginald say?"

"He wants you to handle this. Also...the hospital may have discovered Nathan's infection."

Dominic's expression darkened as he turned slowly. "Eliminate the loose ends. The virus stays contained - for now."

"The Night Banquet will crumble after Nathan's death. But if word of the virus leaks...investigators will swarm. That benefits no one." Dominic couldn't let his masterpiece fail now. He needed to watch the Goldmanns witness their heir perish from an incurable plague!

The basement's flickering lights cast long shadows.

Dominic entered the sparse room - just a bed and medical cabinet. Bloodied bandages and antiseptics littered the surfaces. The figure on the bed lay swathed in bandages, only half a face visible beneath the wrappings.

At the sound of footsteps, Rosalind's eyes fluttered open. A muffled whimper escaped her throat.

Dominic perched on the bed's edge, tracing her uninjured cheekbone. His smile never reached his cold eyes. "Don't fret, darling. I still have uses for you."

A single tear traced Rosalind's temple - whether from pain or despair was unclear.

"Your hatred is misplaced. That Vanderbilt woman orchestrated your downfall." Dominic leaned closer, his breath chilling her skin. "I need you to kill her. Spark war between de Armas and Goldmann. The Night Banquet must fall within the year. Can you do that?"

Rosalind's fingers clawed at the sheets, her eyes burning with renewed fury.

Dominic's lips curved. "Good girl."

The thought of the Goldmanns facing dual catastrophes sent thrilling shivers down his spine.

Edmund met Evelyn in the hotel gardens before their departure. "Uncle Edmund...did Nathan say anything after I left the hospital?"

Edmund deftly changed subjects. "Just discussed his condition. When do you return?"

"Tomorrow."

"Good. Stoslo grows dangerous." Edmund's gaze grew distant. "I can't always protect you."

Evelyn studied his profile. "Are you helping the Goldmanns...because of me?"

Edmund ruffled her hair affectionately. "Your safety comes first. You never should've been dragged into this."

Kyle approached suddenly, whispering urgent words that drained the color from Edmund's face.
###Chapter 441

Evelyn studied their expressions and could piece together what had transpired, though she chose not to pry.

Edmund turned to her, resting a hand on her shoulder. "Kyle and I have matters to attend to. Zoe, you should head back first."

She nodded, watching as they departed.

Just then, Chloe rushed up to her, slightly out of breath. "Mrs. Goldmann, there you are! I was afraid you'd left."

"What's wrong?"

Chloe took a moment to steady herself before speaking hurriedly. "Mr. Goldmann isn't doing well. Elder Master Goldmann wants to see you immediately."

Evelyn followed her swiftly to the room. Inside, aside from Oliver and Theodore, the others were unfamiliar—likely members of the Night Banquet.

Nathan lay on the bed, his face alarmingly pale, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead. A specialist Theodore had summoned was checking his temperature. After a moment, the doctor turned to Oliver. "When did Mr. Goldmann's fever start?"

Oliver hesitated. "He seemed unwell when he returned this morning."

Evelyn froze. This morning? Had he been running a fever all night?

Theodore's sharp gaze landed on her. "Nathan was with you last night. How could you not notice his condition?"

Her lips trembled slightly, but no words came. She had asked him to stay, but she'd kept her distance, afraid of aggravating his wounds. And this morning, he hadn’t mentioned feeling ill.

The other men turned to study her, curiosity flickering in their eyes. This was their first encounter with her, but they already knew who she was.

Theodore scoffed bitterly. "Ever since Nathan got involved with you, his life has been nothing but turmoil. At this rate, you’ll be the death of him."

The air in the room thickened.

Their gazes shifted, now laced with scrutiny. To them, Nathan was the heir of the Night Banquet, and his wife couldn’t afford to be weak.

First, he was shot in Stoslo. Now, he was sick. He had spent the night with her, and Theodore had already blamed her for the earlier incident. Now, he was piling everything onto her shoulders.

Evelyn felt the weight pressing down on her chest, suffocating.

It was as if Theodore saw her as the root of all misfortune—especially because of her ties to the de Arma family.

The specialist administered medication before stepping out to confer with Theodore. Evelyn remained by the window, her eyes fixed on Nathan’s pallid face. A sharp pang of guilt twisted inside her.

This was all her fault.

Chloe approached quietly, offering comfort. "Mrs. Goldmann, don’t take Elder Master’s words to heart. He’s just worried. He didn’t mean it."

Evelyn forced a faint smile. "I know. But I should have taken better care of him."

Nathan didn’t wake until late afternoon.

His heart clenched when he saw Evelyn slumped beside his bed, asleep. He reached out, brushing his fingers lightly against her cheek.

She stirred, lifting her head to meet his gaze. "You're awake?"

He nodded, then winced as a cough tore through him.

"I’ll get you water." She stood quickly, returning with a glass.

He drank deeply, relief washing over him as the cool liquid soothed his throat. "Have you been here the whole time?"
###Chapter 442

"Yes," Evelyn lowered her gaze, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of the blanket. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were running a fever."

Nathan reached out, his warm palm covering her chilled fingers. A faint smile played at his lips as he murmured, "I didn't want you to worry. The apology should be mine, Zoe."

The unspoken truth weighed heavily between them. He was keeping a dangerous secret.

All rights ? N?velDrama.Org.

He knew. The virus pulsed through his veins, marking the beginning of the end. Persistent fever, bloody coughs, gradual deterioration - these were just the opening acts of a tragedy with a three-year finale.

Evelyn opened her mouth to speak when Theodore burst in. "Nathan! You're awake!"

"Grandfather." Nathan nodded weakly.

Theodore's sharp gaze flicked to Evelyn. "Leave us. I need to speak with my grandson alone."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. She rose silently, casting one last glance at Nathan before exiting. The door clicked shut behind her, and with it, the light seemed to drain from Nathan's eyes.

When they were alone, Theodore's voice turned razor-sharp. "What's really happening with you?" The specialists had reported anomalies - a simple fever shouldn't persist like this.

Nathan met his grandfather's gaze steadily. "I'm infected. With the sleeper virus."

Theodore's face paled.

"Keep this between us," Nathan continued quietly. "Father, the children, Zoe - none of them can know."

Theodore's hands trembled as he gripped the bedrail. "How?" The word came out strangled.

"The bullet." Nathan's voice was eerily calm. "It was contaminated."

"You reckless fool!" Theodore's voice cracked. "You're the backbone of the Goldmann empire! What happens when those three children lose their father? When our enemies smell blood in the water?"

His fist slammed against the bedside table. "There's no cure, Nathan! Your great-grandparents died screaming from this same curse, and now you—" He broke off, running a shaking hand through his silver hair. "I never should have allowed that marriage. Love makes warriors weak."

A heavy silence fell between them. Finally, Theodore sighed. "No wonder your father resists passing you the Night Banquet. You're just like him."

History was repeating itself. First Natasha, now Evelyn - both had become weapons turned against the Goldmanns. And both had succeeded.

After a long pause, Nathan spoke. "I'll file for divorce."

Theodore startled. "What did you say?"

Nathan's gaze was steady. "I'll transfer half my shares to Evelyn and the children. After the divorce, we'll co-parent. They're Goldmanns, but they're her children too. She has every right."

Understanding dawned in Theodore's eyes. He said nothing - the reason for Nathan's decision was painfully clear.

Outside, Evelyn paced the corridor. The hushed voices behind the door gave nothing away. When Theodore finally emerged, his face was unreadable.

"You may go in now."

He strode away without another word. Evelyn blinked in surprise at the absence of his usual biting remarks.

She found Nathan staring blankly out the window, his profile etched with exhaustion. This wasn't the indomitable CEO she knew. This was a shattered man, fragile as Venetian glass balanced on a precipice.

The realization struck her like a physical blow - for the first time since they'd met, Nathan Goldmann looked breakable.
###Chapter 443

The silence stretched between them like an endless chasm.

Nathan finally spoke, his voice hollow. "Let's get a divorce, Zoe."

Evelyn froze. The words hit her like a physical blow, her mind reeling. She stared at him, lips trembling. "What... did you just say?"

He turned his head, his gaze empty. "A divorce," he repeated, cold and detached.

The word echoed in her skull.

Divorce.

Her chest tightened, a sharp pain lancing through her. Never in a million years had she imagined Nathan would say this to her. She clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay composed. "Why? Give me a reason."

She searched his face desperately, but his expression was unreadable—pale, distant, his blue eyes as deep and unfeeling as the ocean. "No reason. I'm just... tired of you."

Her nails dug into her palms. It felt like her heart was being ripped out. "Tired of me?" she whispered.

Nathan didn’t respond.

Evelyn stepped closer, her lashes lowering to hide the hurt. A weak smile tugged at her lips. "You're joking, right? Did your grandfather say something to you?"

"Grandpa is my family," he said icily. "You don’t get to question what he tells me. I want this divorce. It has nothing to do with him. All you need to do is agree." His gaze was merciless. "Don’t worry—you’ll keep the kids. And I’ll transfer half of CKGold’s shares. That should be enough for you to live comfortably for the rest of your life."

"Nathan!" Evelyn grabbed his collar, her fingers shaking violently. Tears burned in her eyes, her voice breaking. "What kind of woman do you think I am? You were the one who wanted to marry me! And now you just—just throw me away? You're lying, aren’t you? There’s something you’re not telling me—"

"Do you know how annoying it is when women ask too many questions?" His lips curled into a sneer. He pried her hand off, his touch devoid of warmth. "Do I look like I’m lying when I say I’m tired of you?"

Brushing off his shirt, he continued, voice like steel. "I’ll have Oliver prepare the divorce papers once we’re back in the country. You’ll get everything you’re owed."

The sharp crack of her palm against his cheek shattered the silence.

A red mark bloomed across his face, stark against his pale skin. His jaw clenched, but the pain in his chest was far worse than the sting on his skin.

Evelyn’s eyes were red-rimmed, tears threatening to spill, but she refused to let them fall. "Nathan, you’re not thinking straight. You have a fever. I won’t agree to this. Don’t even think about it."

With that, she turned and stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

The moment she was gone, Nathan doubled over, coughing violently. Blood splattered onto the pristine white sheets. When he opened his palm, crimson streaked his skin, mingling with the crescent marks his nails had left.

He wasn’t the only one in pain.

If he had any other choice, he would never let her go. But he had no options left.

"Zoe... forgive me," he whispered, a single tear falling onto his hand.

Evelyn didn’t sleep that night.

She tossed and turned, her mind racing. Finally, she sat up, staring out at the glittering city lights. There was no way Nathan meant what he said. Something was wrong.

The next morning, she marched to his room—only to find a housekeeper inside, tidying up.

"Where’s the guest who was staying here?" Evelyn demanded.

The housekeeper glanced up. "He checked out early this morning."
###Chapter 444

Evelyn smiled gratefully at the housekeeper before retreating to her room, where Chloe was busy packing her belongings.

"Call Oliver and ask him where Nathan is," Evelyn instructed.

Chloe froze momentarily but obediently pulled out her phone and dialed. Evelyn couldn't hear what Oliver said, but the shock on Chloe's face was unmistakable.

"I thought his flight was this afternoon?"

After a brief exchange, Oliver ended the call. Chloe turned to Evelyn, bewildered.

"Mr. Goldmann and the others have already returned to the country."

Evelyn's expression darkened instantly.

"Zoe," Chloe ventured cautiously, "what happened between you and Mr. Goldmann? Did something go wrong yesterday?"

She recalled how furious Evelyn had been after storming out of Nathan's room the previous night—so angry she hadn’t even eaten dinner. She’d tried asking Oliver, but he’d refused to say a word.

"He wants a divorce."

"A—what? Divorce?" Chloe rushed to her side. "Mr. Goldmann wants to divorce you? Are you sure he wasn’t joking?"

Even Chloe found it hard to believe. And if she doubted it, Evelyn had even more reason to.

Yet Nathan had changed his flight without telling her—avoiding her entirely. Did he truly mean it?

Had he really grown tired of her?

Later, while scrolling through the news, Evelyn stumbled upon a shocking headline: a doctor and several nurses had been shot dead in the very hospital where Nathan had been treated.

Her blood ran cold.

Only now did she understand why Edmund had warned her that Stoslo wasn’t safe.

Was it the same group? But why target the medical staff?

By the time they landed in Zlokova, night had fallen. Instead of heading to Blue Bay Villa or the Goldmann estate, Evelyn went straight to Vanderbilt Manor.

Richard was preparing for bed when the doorbell rang. Descending the stairs, he opened the door to find Evelyn standing there, suitcase in hand.

"Zoe, you—"

She cut him off, throwing her arms around him. "Dad, I'm home."

Richard stiffened in surprise but quickly sensed her distress. Gently stroking her hair, he murmured, "Alright. Did something happen?"

Evelyn shook her head, forcing a smile. "I'm fine. I just missed you. Dad, can I stay here tonight?"

Richard glanced at Chloe, who stood respectfully by the door. He nodded in acknowledgment before turning back to Evelyn.

"Of course. This is your home—you don’t even need to ask."

Evelyn carried her suitcase upstairs while Chloe received a text.

(Mr. Goldmann wants to know your location.)

Chloe replied: (Mrs. Goldmann has returned to Vanderbilt Manor. Oliver, can you tell me why Mr. Goldmann wants a divorce?)

Moments later, Oliver responded: (Don’t ask. It’s not your concern. Mr. Goldmann wants you to stay with Ms. Vanderbilt. From now on, you report to her. If anything happens, notify us immediately.)

In her room, Evelyn unpacked her clothes. Richard appeared in the doorway, studying her.

"Are you sure nothing’s wrong, Zoe?"

She paused, meeting his gaze. "Nothing’s wrong."

"If nothing’s wrong, why did you come straight here after returning from abroad?" Richard sighed. "Did you and Mr. Goldmann have a fight? You young people—"

"Dad," Evelyn interrupted, "what would you say if I divorced Nathan?"

Richard stiffened. "Divorce?"

Evelyn’s smile was brittle. "He wants one. But I refused. He’s not getting rid of me that easily."

Richard fell silent. He knew better than to interfere.

One thing was clear—his daughter was deeply, irrevocably in love.
###Chapter 445

Richard Vanderbilt didn’t want his daughter to suffer. Before leaving, he turned to her with a firm but gentle expression.

"Zoe," he said, his voice steady, "you don’t always have to sacrifice yourself for others. Even if things don’t work out with Nathan, this will always be your home. The Vanderbilts’ doors will never close to you."

Evelyn blinked, surprised. A small, bittersweet smile curved her lips.

She understood what her father meant. He was trying to protect her from heartbreak. But she wasn’t ready to give up yet—not until she heard the truth from Nathan himself.

Once, he had pursued her relentlessly. Now, it was her turn to fight for him.

The next day, at Goldmann Enterprises…

After Chloe Lawson confirmed Nathan was in his office, Evelyn dressed carefully—soft curls framing her face, a fitted dress accentuating her figure. She carried a handmade lunchbox, determination in her every step.

Oliver Lawson nearly dropped his coffee when he spotted her approaching. "Ms. Vanderbilt—"

Evelyn had always been striking, but since marrying Nathan, she’d rarely bothered with makeup. Today, she looked radiant.

"Can I go in?" she asked, gesturing toward the office door.

Oliver hesitated. Nathan hadn’t explicitly banned her, but…

Before he could respond, Evelyn pushed the door open.

Nathan didn’t glance up from his documents, though he’d recognized her voice.

She set the lunchbox on his desk.

His tone was cool. "What do you need?"

"You haven’t eaten, have you? I made these myself." She lifted the lid, revealing neatly arranged pastries.

He barely glanced at them. "Leave it. I’m busy."

Evelyn obeyed, sliding the box aside. Then she leaned against his desk, watching him with warm eyes. "That’s fine. I’ll stay and keep you company."

Nathan’s fingers stilled on the papers. He didn’t respond.

Unbothered, Evelyn wandered his office—trailing fingers over the bookshelves, studying the art on the walls.

Eventually, Nathan exhaled sharply. "If you have nothing else to do, you should leave."

"Am I distracting you?" She turned, meeting his gaze.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. The makeup highlighted her features—the same way she’d looked when he first fell for her.

Even now, he struggled to look away.

Evelyn leaned forward, bracing her hands on the desk. A playful smirk tugged at her lips. "I thought you’d lost interest, Mr. Goldmann. But it seems I still affect you."

Nathan clenched his teeth, deliberately shifting his attention back to his work.

Evelyn bit her lip. Then, before he could react, she snatched the documents from his hands and perched herself on his lap, arms looping around his neck.

Her voice was a whisper. "Nathan… let’s not get divorced."

He didn’t answer.

Even with her this close, he refused to react—though the effort it took to suppress his emotions was nearly unbearable.

Evelyn’s gaze dropped to his lips. Just as she leaned in, he turned his face away, gripping her wrists to push her off.

Her breath hitched.

His expression was ice. "Seduction doesn’t work on a man who’s no longer interested."

No longer interested.

Evelyn stiffened. Then, slowly, she smiled. "Are you sure about that?"

Nathan’s eyes darkened. He tilted his head, challenge in his tone. "Test me. Let’s see if you still have any power over me."
###Chapter 446

Evelyn pressed her lips against Nathan's cold ones once more, clinging to his rigid frame as she tried to ignite his passion through subtle touches.

She believed she could break through his icy exterior, but reality proved her wrong.

Nathan remained unmoved. If not for the legendary self-control he was known for, she might have thought he'd truly lost all interest in her.

Slowly pulling away, Evelyn felt each breath grow heavier, the weight of rejection pressing against her chest.

'Should I accept that he's genuinely fallen out of love? Or is this just another cruel test to push me away?'

Her fingers curled into tight fists. "Nathan," she whispered, "what if I refuse to give up on us?"

A flicker of surprise crossed his features before vanishing as he turned away. "You should leave now."

Evelyn stepped forward, wrapping her arms around him.

Nathan's body tensed, his suspended hand clenching into a fist as he fought the overwhelming urge to crush her against him.

Her voice was feather-light against his chest. "I don't believe you've stopped loving me. And even if you have... I'll make you fall for me all over again."

The storm in Nathan's eyes stilled. Though his love for her burned as fiercely as ever, his expression remained merciless.

He pried her away. "Go home. I'll pick you up tonight. We still need to maintain appearances for the children's sake."

Evelyn's lips pressed together. The disappointment stung, but at least their shared love for Caleb, Liam, and Daisy remained their tether. A bitter laugh escaped her as she left his office.

'Our children are the only reason we're still pretending.'

'Is he truly serious about ending us?'

The moment Evelyn departed, Oliver entered with documents to find Nathan chain-smoking by the window, the ashtray overflowing with crushed cigarette butts.

Never had Oliver witnessed his boss consume nicotine so desperately.

"Mr. Goldmann, about the divorce papers..." Oliver understood Nathan's sacrificial motives. Yet even as an outsider, he could see the depth of Nathan's devotion. This painful charade was the only protection Nathan could offer.

The proposed settlement itself revealed everything - Evelyn would receive half of Goldmann Group's shares, securing her future beyond measure.

Nathan's voice emerged like gravel. "Leave them."

Oliver placed the documents on the desk.

Drawing deeply from his cigarette, Nathan turned, tapping ash into the tray. "Any updates from Stoslo?"

"Elder Goldmann has captured Dominic's men, but he'd already abandoned them. The murdered hospital staff confirms they're covering up the virus."

Nathan's brow furrowed. "And Prince Reginald?"

"Remains inactive," Oliver reported. "Likely fearing royal repercussions."

King Maxwell still held Stoslo's throne. Since the incident involving the crown princess, the royal family had opposed Reginald's power grabs. As an illegitimate son born to a chambermaid, the prince lacked any legitimate claim to succession.

For decades, Reginald operated through proxies, never dirtying his own hands. The Kents' support was equally transparent - they backed his ambitions to further their own agenda.
###Chapter 447

Nathan pushed the crystal ashtray aside, his fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the mahogany desk. "Does Harrison know about this?"

His question hung heavy in the air, referring to Evelyn's recent ordeal in Stoslo.

Oliver hesitated for barely a heartbeat before responding, "I believe Harrison must be aware by now."

When Evelyn was escorted to the Laurent estate, she'd already pieced together Harrison's motives for summoning her.

Lillian guided her to the study where Harrison stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows, hands clasped tightly behind his back. Without turning, his gravelly voice cut through the silence. "You and Nathan were ambushed in Stoslo."

A wry smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Your intelligence network operates at frightening speed."

A humorless chuckle escaped him. "Stoslo falls under my jurisdiction. My men reported the incident immediately." His shoulders tensed. "Our enemies grow bold."

Finally turning, Harrison's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "I warned you this would happen. While I won't use you against the Goldmanns now that you're bound to Nathan, our adversaries lack such scruples."

Evelyn stepped forward, her heels clicking against the parquet. "Have you considered, Sir Harrison, that you might be mistaken about the feud between our families?"

Harrison's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds. "Still defending them?"

She'd anticipated his reaction but pressed on regardless. "Then let me ask directly - were you involved in Natasha's kidnapping fifteen years ago?"

His derisive snort filled the study. "What does it matter what I say? The Goldmanns have already convicted me in their narrative."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "So it wasn't you."

"Even if I played no part," Harrison countered coldly, "this blood feud won't end with simple explanations."

Silence stretched between them.

Just as she'd suspected - Harrison knew the truth about that night but refused to clear his name to the Goldmanns. His hatred ran too deep for explanations to matter.

'Whether he's guilty or not changes nothing. But at least now I know the de Armas weren't involved.'

Evelyn's lashes lowered as a small, knowing smile curved her lips. "I'm relieved to hear it wasn't you."

Harrison studied her for a long moment before his expression hardened. "Leave the Goldmanns. Now that your connection to Nathan is known, you're walking target."

"I won't abandon him." Her voice held steel. "I wouldn't be standing here if not for Nathan's protection that night." Her chin lifted defiantly. 'No one will separate us - not even Nathan himself.'

"You stubborn—"

"Grandfather."

The word stopped Harrison mid-sentence. Even Lillian gasped - it was the first time Evelyn had willingly used the familial title.

Her tone softened but remained resolute. "I understand your hatred for the Goldmanns, but some incidents may not be—"

"Not their doing?" Harrison's fist slammed onto the desk, making the inkwell rattle. "Did I lose my leg to phantom enemies?"

Evelyn met his fury with calm logic. "If Theodore Goldmann truly wanted you maimed during your captivity, why wait until after releasing you? It makes no strategic sense."

'From what Edmund shared, the elder Goldmann wasn't one for senseless cruelty - especially against a child.'

Harrison's brows knitted together. "Who fed you these lies? Nathan?"

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "Edmund Lincoln. He happens to know more than most about that era."

Harrison went utterly still. "Edmund?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "How do you know that man?"
###Chapter 448

Evelyn hesitated for a fraction of a second before continuing, "My mother knew him. He also told me that my mother died because of the sleeper virus."

Lillian pressed a hand to her mouth, shock evident in her widened eyes.

Harrison froze momentarily, his expression shifting in an instant.

He instructed Lillian to take Evelyn out while he remained in the silent study. No one could decipher his thoughts—only the growing darkness in his gaze as time passed.

As they descended the stairs, Lillian suddenly asked, "Evelyn, is what you said true? Your mother really—?"

"Yes. Uncle Edmund wouldn’t lie to me."

Evelyn trusted Edmund completely when it came to the truth about her mother’s death. Yet, the way Harrison’s expression had darkened lingered in her mind. "Aunt, do you know why Grandpa reacted like that when he heard about the virus?"

The affectionate address softened Lillian’s features, but her response was hesitant. "I don’t know. Your grandfather truly had no idea your mother was infected. Neither did I. No wonder she left with Sebastian..."

"Now I understand why Mom said only Sebastian could save her back then. But in the end, even he couldn’t."

Lillian’s eyes dimmed with sorrow. "There’s no cure for that virus. Even with the suppressants Sebastian developed, Miranda’s condition had already progressed too far by the time symptoms appeared—"

She stopped abruptly.

"Aunt? What’s wrong?" Evelyn frowned as Lillian’s face paled.

Lillian met her gaze. "The virus has a one-year incubation period. That means your mother was infected the same year the epidemic started. But that doesn’t make sense."

"Why not?"

"The epidemic thirty years ago only broke out after initial contact. The source was traced to a hotel’s water supply, but your mother never went there."

Lillian’s voice lowered. "During incubation, carriers showed no symptoms. The virus wasn’t airborne—it spread through direct contact, like bacteria on surfaces. But Miranda never left the de Arma estate before meeting Sebastian. She had no exposure to outsiders. So how was she infected?"

The question haunted Evelyn the entire ride back.

Mom’s infection was orchestrated. Just as Uncle Edmund said—this wasn’t a natural outbreak, but a weapon.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Nathan.

The suffocating silence in the car pressed down on her. Nathan barely spoke, leaving Evelyn scrambling for words to bridge the distance.

Oliver glanced at them through the rearview mirror, uneasy.

Mr. Goldmann contracted the virus because of those targeting his family. If he doesn’t divorce Evelyn now, he can’t protect her in his condition.

Only by severing ties with the Goldmanns can Evelyn be safe. Once the de Armas acknowledge her, no one would dare touch her in Stoslo.

Harrison’s influence is absolute. Those who targeted Evelyn before only did so because he wasn’t present. If anything happened to her now, they’d face the full wrath of the de Armas.
###Chapter 449

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around each other as she turned to face Nathan, who seemed lost in thought.

"How do we explain to the kids that we’re getting a divorce?"

Nathan stiffened slightly, his gaze darkening. "We’ll figure it out when the time comes."

Even if they end up hating me.

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before speaking slowly. "Is there really no other way?"

"Do we have to go through with this?"

Silence.

Her hands clenched into fists. "At least tell me why you want this."

Nathan’s brow furrowed, irritation flashing in his eyes. "I’ve said all I need to say."

Of course. He won’t give me a straight answer.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

If he won’t tell me why, then I won’t agree to it.

Nathan caught the flicker of hurt in her expression, and something deep inside him twisted. His jaw tightened.

She’s hurting.

But so am I.

The children were overjoyed when their parents returned. After so long apart, they clung to Evelyn more than ever.

Daisy nestled in her arms, big eyes pleading. "Mommy, can we go to Grandpa’s house to see Rusty? We miss him so much!"

Caleb munched on chips. "And Grandpa’s banana bread. I really want some."

Liam closed his book with a sigh. "All you ever think about is food."

Caleb grinned. "Eating is happiness, Liam."

Evelyn chuckled. "Alright, we’ll go tomorrow."

Liam tilted his head. "Mommy, aren’t you busy?"

Her breath hitched—just as Nathan’s gaze locked onto hers. She quickly looked away. "Not at all. Uncle Gregory is handling things at the company."

Daisy turned to Nathan. "What about Daddy?"

His lips thinned. "I’m free too."

Evelyn barely glanced at him.

If he wants to spend time with them… maybe I can change his mind before it’s too late.

Since Rosalind had been banished from the Goldmann mansion, the children had grown more comfortable there.

Tonight was the first time Evelyn had stayed in months.

Lying on the bed, she scrolled through her phone, searching for ways to make Nathan reconsider.

Netizen1: If he wants a divorce, he’s already fallen out of love. No amount of begging will help.

Netizen2: Why bother? Move on and find someone better.

Netizen3: Either he finds you unattractive now, or there’s someone else. Watch out.

Evelyn groaned, tossing her phone aside.

I’d rather believe it’s me. Maybe he just… doesn’t want me anymore.

The memory of his cold indifference at the office made her chest ache.

The door creaked open.

Nathan stepped inside, freezing when he saw her.

The silk nightgown clung to her curves, the strap slipping off one shoulder. Her curls spilled across the pillow as she absently tucked a strand behind her ear, legs swaying slightly.

His blood burned.

Evelyn startled when she noticed him. "How long have you been standing there?"

Please tell me he didn’t see what I was reading.

Nathan turned away abruptly. "I’m taking a shower."

Without another word, he disappeared into the bathroom.
###Chapter 450

Evelyn's lips formed a pout, but a cunning glint flashed through her eyes as an idea struck her.

Nathan stepped under the icy shower spray, desperately trying to quell the fire burning within him. A pang of regret twisted in his chest at his own hesitation.

'Will I truly be able to let her go if I keep her close like this?'

The thought tormented him. 'I don't want to, but I must.'

Though Nathan spoke of divorce, he found himself indulging Evelyn's whims when it came to their children. Perhaps this was his selfishness - grasping at these fleeting moments of happiness while he still could.

Emerging from the bathroom, the sight before him reignited the flames he'd struggled to extinguish. His self-control teetered on the edge.

Evelyn lounged across the bed, propped on one elbow in a pose that was nothing short of intoxicating. Any man would have lost his composure at such a vision, let alone Nathan.

He turned his face away sharply, jaw clenched. "Evelyn Vanderbilt, do you realize what you're doing?"

"You claimed I no longer attract you," she purred, twirling a lock of hair around her finger while giving him a sultry smile. "Then why can't you look at me?"

Nathan's expression darkened, his voice dropping to a dangerous timbre. "Stop this pointless game."

"I disagree." Evelyn sat up straight. "Nathan Goldmann, look at me."

When he finally met her gaze, the stubborn determination in her beautiful face struck him. But what truly burned him was the raw vulnerability shining through her eyes.

Text ? owned by N?velDrama.Org.

Evelyn's heart twisted as she questioned herself, 'Here I stand before him, offering everything, yet he remains unmoved. Have I truly lost my appeal? Or has he simply grown tired of me?'

Her fingers trembled slightly as they clutched her nightdress. Defeated, she lowered her gaze, biting her lip as she dressed once more.

"I'll sleep with the children," she murmured, the words laced with unspoken bitterness.

As she moved to rise, a powerful force suddenly pinned her to the bed. Nathan's lips crashed against hers with desperate intensity.

"Nathan—" she gasped between breaths.

His eyes burned crimson, his movements growing increasingly rough. "Isn't this what you wanted?"

Evelyn stared up at him. Everywhere his lips touched ignited like wildfire, scorching her skin and searing her soul.

Just as she surrendered to the moment, anticipating his next move, he pulled away abruptly.

The cruel truth dawned on her - he was torturing them both.

"I'll sleep in the study," Nathan declared coldly, striding from the room without a backward glance.

Evelyn lay frozen, watching the door slam shut, her heart plummeting into darkness.

In the study, Nathan chain-smoked. Normally not a heavy smoker, he'd found himself increasingly dependent on the habit lately. Gazing out at the misty night, his expression mirrored the cold darkness outside.

Morning light found Nathan descending the stairs.

Noticing the absence of Evelyn and the children, he inquired of Mr. Chester, "Where are they?"

"The young mistress took the children out early this morning," the butler replied with a warm smile.

Nathan's gaze fell upon the meticulously arranged breakfast spread - unmistakably Evelyn's handiwork.

'She still made breakfast...'

The thought brought an involuntary smile to his lips, though he quickly schooled his features.

At the Vanderbilt manor...

The three children's laughter filled the air as they chased Rusty around the garden, their joy infectious.

Richard observed the scene with mixed emotions. It had been years since the Vanderbilt estate had known such liveliness, especially with the children's presence. Turning to Evelyn, he ventured cautiously, "Have you and Mr. Goldmann resolved your differences? Does he... truly intend to divorce?"
###Chapter 451

Evelyn stood frozen for a moment. She lowered her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper. "I suppose so."

"What about the children?" Richard's question came slowly, weighted with concern. "They'll be devastated if you two separate, won't they?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together until they formed a thin line. "Nathan promised we'd co-parent after the divorce. That means I can still be part of their lives..."

Richard's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Nathan Goldmann actually said that?"

Honestly, he'd never expected the ruthless CEO to make such concessions.

Evelyn gave a small nod. Given Nathan's power and influence, he could have easily stripped her of all parental rights. He could have made sure she never saw the children again or received a single penny.

Yet he hadn't. This convinced her there were deeper reasons behind his sudden demand for divorce - reasons he stubbornly refused to share.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Gregory. Stepping aside, she answered. "Yes, Uncle Gregory? Alright, I'll be there shortly."

"Gregory needs you?" Richard inquired as she ended the call.

Evelyn turned to face him. "Yes. Dad, could you watch the kids? I need to head to the office for a bit."

Richard smiled warmly. "Of course. Drive carefully."

Arriving at Soul Jewelry's headquarters, Evelyn immediately spotted Gregory in deep discussion with the photography crew in the main hall.

From their earlier phone conversation, she'd learned Soul had contracted rising starlet Iris Linwood as their new spokesperson. Today was the scheduled shoot, but the temperamental actress had kept everyone waiting all morning without showing up.

Multiple calls to Iris's assistant had yielded only threats - they'd cancel the entire deal if pressured further, as Iris was allegedly tied up filming a reality show.

Soul could reschedule, but the photography crew's time was money.

"Zoe," Gregory approached her, frustration evident in his tone, "The crew can't wait any longer. Ms. Linwood signed the contract, but her behavior is completely unprofessional and jeopardizing our entire production schedule."

Evelyn studied his face. "Have you managed to speak with Ms. Linwood directly?"

Gregory shook his head grimly.

Nearby, a staff member muttered under their breath, "That Iris is being a complete diva. If she didn't want the job, she shouldn't have signed the damn contract."

Every element was prepared - costumes, jewelry sets, lighting rigs. The crew stood ready, their expensive equipment idling. Even basic rehearsals would take hours they no longer had.

Evelyn rested her chin thoughtfully on her hand. After a moment's consideration, she announced, "We'll find a replacement."

"A replacement?" The staff exchanged shocked glances. Finding someone suitable on such short notice seemed impossible.

Moreover, as a new player in the jewelry industry, Soul lacked connections. Their million-dollar contract with Iris represented a major investment. Who would step in at the last minute?

Evelyn's gaze remained steady. "They breached contract first by failing to show. I see no issue with replacing them. We can't afford to wait indefinitely."

"But who could possibly help us now?" Gregory frowned. Securing another celebrity within hours was unrealistic.

Then inspiration struck. Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "We don't necessarily need an actress. We just need someone with significant social influence, correct?"

Gregory blinked. "Zoe, you don't mean..."

"I have the perfect candidate in mind," Evelyn said, already scrolling through her contacts. A crew member nearby asked skeptically, "Who besides a celebrity has that kind of reach?"

Evelyn raised the phone to her ear, answering calmly, "How about Lucas Laurent, the heir to the Laurent fashion empire?"
###Chapter 452

The renowned violin prodigy Lucas Laurent had connections that spanned continents. Not only was he a virtuoso performer, but he'd graduated top of his class from the Royal Conservatory of Music.

Gregory Fannon's eyebrows shot up. He'd expected Evelyn to approach Adrian Boucher, not Lucas.

While having Lucas as Soul Jewelry's spokesperson would be a coup - Gregory had no doubt the musician would excel - there was one problem. Lucas had never endorsed any commercial brand in his entire career.

Evelyn stepped aside to make her call. Gregory couldn't hear the conversation, but moments later she turned and flashed him a triumphant thumbs-up.

"Start the preparations immediately!" Gregory barked to his team.

Exactly ten minutes later, Lucas strode into Soul Jewelry's headquarters. Gasps rippled through the staff - most were seeing the musical genius in person for the first time.

At 6'3" with legs that seemed to go on forever, Lucas cut an imposing figure. His sharp aristocratic features held an aloofness that only enhanced his prince-like aura. That single monolid eye made him appear both untouchable and mesmerizing. Once people looked at him, they found it impossible to look away.

Evelyn checked her watch and smiled. "Perfect timing."

"What's so urgent?" Lucas's deep voice held genuine curiosity. Evelyn never reached out without reason.

"I need a favor."

"Which is?"

Her smile turned impish. "Saving my company's launch."

With Adrian's fees being astronomical, Lucas had become her plan B.

Understanding dawned on Lucas's face. "You want me to be Soul Jewelry's face?" His brow furrowed. "I don't do endorsements."

"There's a first time for everything." Evelyn's grin widened. "I'll pay market rate. And family doesn't let family drown, right?"

Without waiting for his answer, Evelyn spun towards her team. "Prep Mr. Laurent for wardrobe and makeup. We shoot in twenty."

The decision had been made for him.

The entire advertising concept changed. After consulting her creative team, Evelyn personally designed Lucas's styling.

Meanwhile, across town, Iris Linwood emerged from a pool in a scandalous bikini. Her innocent face contrasted sharply with her voluptuous curves.

She embodied the current beauty standard - porcelain skin, slender frame, youthful appearance. That juxtaposition of purity and sensuality had made her famous.

An assistant draped a towel over Iris's shoulders as she lounged on a deck chair. Sipping juice, she asked lazily, "Has Soul called yet?"

The assistant checked her phone. "Not yet. Probably too embarrassed to keep begging."

"Rude of them to rush me in the first place." Iris waved a manicured hand. "Tell them I'll grace them with my presence this afternoon."

After all, they'd forgive anything. Her uncle's influence as a top director ensured that.

When the assistant made the call, her expression darkened. "You're replacing us?!"

Iris nearly choked on her drink.

"Do you know who you're dealing with?" the assistant shrieked. "We have a signed contract!"

Gregory kept his voice measured. "Ms. Linwood failed to meet contractual obligations. Given her... busy schedule, we've chosen not to inconvenience her further with our small project. Surely there's no issue with that?"
###Chapter 453

"What kind of attitude is that?"

"Attitude?" Gregory scoffed. "You're lecturing me about attitude now? We simply gave you a taste of your own medicine. And for the record, it doesn’t have to be Mrs. Langley either."

With that, he ended the call.

The assistant approached Iris with hesitation. "Iris, Soul Jewelry has decided to replace you as their spokesperson."

Iris's expression darkened instantly. Never in her career had she been treated with such disrespect.

"An obscure jewelry brand dares to humiliate me?"

A smirk curled her lips as she pulled out her phone and drafted a post on Instagram.

@IrisBaby: Never thought it would come to this. (JPG)

The image showed a small dog perched on a balcony, gazing down at the crowd below. The implication was unmistakable. Within minutes, her fans swarmed the comments, outraged on her behalf.

@IrisForever: What happened, queen? Weren’t you supposed to be shooting for Soul Jewelry today?

@IrisBaby: Sigh. Maybe I’m just not good enough for them.

@IrisArmy: Wait, did they really drop you?

Iris responded with a tearful emoji, fueling her fans' fury. Just days ago, she had proudly announced her partnership with Soul Jewelry. Now, they had betrayed her.

Her loyal followers stormed Soul Jewelry’s official page, flooding it with angry comments.

By afternoon, the hashtag #SoulDropsIris was trending.

Meanwhile, Lucas Laurent finished his photoshoot. Evelyn Vanderbilt reviewed the shots, impressed despite his minimal screen time.

The theme was dark elegance—onyx and sapphire tones blending into a regal yet modern aesthetic. A single close-up of Lucas wearing Soul’s signature ring was breathtaking, as if crafted by a master artist.

No surprise. His hands, meticulously maintained for his violin career, were worth millions. The female staff couldn’t tear their eyes away.

Once Lucas changed back into his usual attire, Evelyn approached him. "Thank you for stepping in, Mr. Laurent. I’ll transfer your fee later."

"Keep it," he said, adjusting his cufflinks. "Consider it a favor—for family. But don’t ask me to do this again."

Evelyn grinned. "Noted."

He arched a brow. "Why didn’t you ask Nathan Goldmann? I’m sure he’d jump at the chance."

She hesitated, then shrugged. "He’s a businessman. Not exactly the face of a jewelry brand."

Lucas frowned. "And I am?"

Evelyn eyed him up and down before laughing. "You’re tall."

He rolled his eyes.

Back at the office, Gregory handed her a tablet. "Iris knows we replaced her."

Evelyn scrolled through the trending backlash. "Did she have other commitments today?"

Gregory shook his head. "She claimed she was free, which is why we scheduled the shoot. But her assistant suddenly mentioned a variety show recording. No idea if it’s true."

Evelyn smirked. "Let her vent. We’ll see who laughs last when the campaign drops."
###Chapter 454

Evelyn set the tablet aside. She intended to leverage Lucas Laurent's role as their spokesperson to prove Iris Linwood—and the public—wrong.

By the time she arrived home, Richard was already preparing dinner for the kids, with Liam, the ever-responsible little adult, assisting him in the kitchen.

Daisy and Caleb were sprawled on the couch, engrossed in their game. The moment they spotted her, Daisy dropped the controller and chirped, "Mommy, you're back! Work's done?"

"Yes, sweetheart, all done," Evelyn replied, slipping off her heels.

Rusty lay curled beside them, exhausted from playing with the kids. The pup barely lifted its head to acknowledge her before drifting back to sleep.

As Richard set the table, he called out, "Dinner's ready. Wash up and come eat."

"Okay!" Caleb and Daisy abandoned their game and scrambled to the sink.

Rusty stretched lazily before hopping down, trotting straight to Liam as the boy poured kibble into its bowl.

Liam ruffled the dog's fur. "When will Rusty get bigger?"

Richard chuckled. "He's still a puppy. Give him time."

"Then eat more and grow fast, chubby boy," Liam cooed at Rusty.

Daisy dashed to the table, and Richard lifted her into her chair. She peered up at him. "Grandpa, can we take Rusty home for a few days?"

Since the kids adored the dog, Richard patted her head. "Of course."

"Yay!" Daisy clapped. "We can play with Rusty every day!"

Evelyn sighed. "You won't have time. Caleb has school, and you two have sessions at Royal Crown Entertainment. Rusty will be bored."

Daisy pouted. "Fine."

After a pause, she brightened. "Then we'll visit Grandpa every day!"

Evelyn pinched her nose. "You just want to play with Rusty, don't you?"

Daisy wrinkled her nose defiantly. "So what?"

Richard laughed, handing her a plate of spaghetti. "You're always welcome. Now eat up—you too, Caleb and Liam."

"Thanks, Grandpa," the boys chorused.

The doorbell rang, and Richard stood. "I'll get it."

When he opened the door, his expression froze. "Mr. Goldmann, you—"

"Good evening, sir." Nathan dipped his head respectfully, making Richard shift uncomfortably.

"Daddy!" Caleb's eyes lit up. "Why are you here?"

Daisy rolled her eyes. "Obviously for Mommy. Duh."

Richard fetched another set of cutlery without comment. He understood their situation but knew better than to pry in front of the kids—who remained oblivious to their impending divorce.

"Heh, did you get lonely eating alone?" Caleb teased.

Evelyn stiffened. She shot him a look. "No talking with your mouth full."

Nathan pressed his lips together, silent.

Liam studied them. "Daddy, are you and Mommy fighting?"

The question made Daisy and Caleb swivel their heads toward their parents.

Were they?

Sensing the tension, Richard interjected, "Don't be silly. If they were fighting, would your dad be here?"
###Chapter 455

The children agreed with Richard's reasoning. After all, if their parents were truly fighting, Nathan wouldn't have come to have dinner with them.

After finishing their meal, the kids decided to stay overnight. Richard took them to their rooms to read bedtime stories, intentionally giving Evelyn and Nathan some private time.

Evelyn was clearing the dining table when Nathan entered the kitchen. His jaw tightened visibly as he watched her washing dishes. After several tense moments, he rolled up his sleeves.

"Let me help," he offered abruptly.

Evelyn froze in surprise as Nathan took the plate from her hands without waiting for a response.

"Is this for the children's sake?" she asked quietly, keeping her gaze lowered.

Nathan's eyelashes flickered slightly. "Yes."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "How long do you think we can maintain this charade?"

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable.

Biting her lip, Evelyn turned away. "If you want to stay here tonight, you can have the bedroom. I'll explain to the kids."

The only sound in the spacious kitchen became the running water as Nathan clenched the plate tightly in his hands.

Later, when Evelyn emerged from the bathroom, she found Nathan sitting grim-faced on the edge of the bed. As she moved to leave, his hand shot out to grasp her wrist.

"What are you—" she began in surprise.

"Until the divorce is finalized, we're still husband and wife," Nathan stated flatly before releasing her. He stood and brushed past her. "I'm taking a shower now."

Evelyn's face darkened at his words.

'Still husband and wife until the divorce?'

His determination to end their marriage seemed absolute. She no longer felt confident about changing his mind.

That night, Evelyn lay with her back turned to Nathan. Though sharing the same bed, an invisible chasm separated them, neither daring to cross it.

Sleep eluded Evelyn. When she heard movement behind her, her eyes flew open.

Suddenly, strong arms pulled her backward into a firm embrace. "Nathan?" she gasped in surprise.

But Nathan simply held her tightly, his gaze lingering on her face for a long moment before murmuring, "Go to sleep."

Evelyn said nothing. Her long lashes lowered, concealing the disappointment in her eyes.

Did he still love her? She couldn't tell anymore.

By morning, Nathan had already left. When Evelyn came downstairs after getting ready, the three children were eating breakfast prepared by Richard, with no sign of Nathan.

"Good morning, Mommy!" Daisy chirped, milk forming a faint mustache above her lip.

Evelyn smiled and wiped her daughter's mouth with a napkin. "Morning, sweetheart."

Sitting at the table, Evelyn asked casually, "Where's Nathan?"

"Daddy went to the office," Caleb answered between bites. "He told us not to wake you."

Evelyn nodded silently.

After breakfast, Richard walked Evelyn to the door. "Zoe," he said hesitantly, "I know it's not my place to interfere in your marriage with Mr. Goldmann. But whatever decision you make, I'll support you."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thank you, Dad."

Arriving at Soul Jewelry, Evelyn found a crowd of protesters holding signs outside the building - all fans of Iris Linwood demanding justice for their idol.

Security guards barely contained the agitated crowd that might otherwise have stormed the premises.

As Evelyn stepped out of her car, someone shouted, "Ms. Zara!"
###Chapter 456

The flash of cameras blinded Evelyn as reporters swarmed around her. "Ms. Zara," one journalist shoved a microphone toward her, "is Viana Jewelry replacing Iris Linwood as your spokesperson because she lacks star power?"

Another chimed in, "Can you explain the sudden contract termination? Was there a breach of trust?"

The crowd of Iris’s fans erupted behind them. "Viana Jewelry is just another elitist brand looking down on people!" someone shouted. "Get out of Bassburgh!"

"Trash like Viana doesn’t deserve our Iris!"

Evelyn’s gaze darkened as she met the camera lens. A cold smirk curled her lips. "Did you not hear them? A brand like ours truly isn’t worthy of an artist like Iris."

The reporters froze. They had expected excuses, apologies—anything but this sharp dismissal.

Is she not afraid of the backlash?

Iris’s fans exploded in fury. One enraged supporter lunged forward, hand raised to shove Evelyn—

A strong arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her back as Nathan stepped between them, effortlessly pushing the fan away.

Evelyn turned, startled by the familiar scent of his cologne. His jaw was set, his glare icy as he scanned the crowd. "Leave," he commanded, voice low and dangerous. "Unless you want your idol blacklisted from the industry."

The fans hesitated, but one defiant voice shot back, "You can’t just ban her! Who do you think you are?"

Nathan’s expression turned lethal. "Try me."

The crowd fell silent.

Evelyn tugged Nathan aside and stepped forward. "Before you rally for injustice," she said coolly, "ask yourselves why Iris signed our contract and then ghosted us on the very first day. Is Viana unworthy? Or is Iris too prestigious to honor her commitments?"

She tilted her head, eyes glinting. "I understand wanting to play diva. But not at my company’s expense." She paused, letting her words sink in. "Let me make this clear—Viana Jewelry will never work with unreliable artists like Iris again."

With that, she turned on her heel and strode back into the building, leaving chaos in her wake.

Inside the elevator, she glanced at Nathan, who lingered beside her. "Shouldn’t you be at Goldmann Corp.?"

His lips thinned. He’d come just to see her, but he wouldn’t admit it. "Passing by."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Passing by? Then why are you still here?"

Nathan exhaled, unclenching his fists. "Call me if you need backup." He walked away without another word.

She watched him go, a faint smile tugging at her lips.

Still worried about me, huh?

Back in her office, she found Chloe deep in conversation with Gregory. The younger girl brightened when she saw Evelyn. "You’re back! Did those fans give you trouble?"

Evelyn chuckled. "Why are you here? I thought I sent you back to training camp."

Chloe fidgeted, avoiding the truth—that Nathan had ordered her to stay close. "I missed you! The camp’s boring, and I want to help. Consider me an unpaid Viana employee now!"

Evelyn studied her, suspicion flickering in her gaze.
###Chapter 457

The sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Vanderbilt's office, casting a golden glow over the sleek modern furniture.

"Chloe, a soldier who values money as much as her own life, would actually say she doesn’t want a salary?"

Gregory Fannon approached, holding a tablet. "Zoe, Mr. Lucas Laurent’s endorsement video has been released."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a knowing smile, her sharp gaze glinting with satisfaction. "Perfect. Now we wait for Iris to humiliate herself."

#Soul’s Spokesperson: Lucas Laurent#

#Iris Linwood No-Show: Exposed as a Fraud#

The moment Soul Jewelry’s official accounts dropped Lucas’ endorsement video across all social media platforms, the internet erupted. Netizens were stunned—if Soul could secure someone as prestigious as the "Prince of Violin," then rejecting Iris Linwood spoke volumes.

Comments flooded in:

Grace Green: "I knew it! Iris was never on their level."

Scarlett Fox: "Soul just ended her career with one post."

Simon Blake: "Imagine thinking you’re too good for Soul and then getting replaced by Lucas freaking Laurent."

But Iris’ die-hard fans weren’t ready to surrender. They dug up an old clip of Evelyn mentioning Iris’ lack of worth, trying to spin it as bullying.

Their efforts backfired—spectacularly.

Soul Jewelry retaliated by releasing the signed contract, the original shooting schedule, and a detailed statement exposing Iris’ unprofessionalism. She had ghosted them without notice, leaving the entire team waiting for hours.

Her assistant had lied, claiming a conflicting variety show schedule—but Iris had already confirmed the shoot date.

Then came the knockout punch.

A leaked video surfaced, showing Iris lounging at a luxury hotel pool on the very day she was supposed to be filming.

The internet exploded.

Veronica Styles: "She really thought she could get away with this?"

Bianca Chase: "Bye, fraud. Enjoy the blacklist."

Iris’ phone buzzed relentlessly with notifications. She snatched it up, her face paling as she scrolled through the trending tags.

Her hands trembled.

Then she hurled the phone across the room.

"How the hell did this happen?!"

Her assistant flinched, picking up the cracked device. The screen displayed Soul’s damning post.

Before she could speak, Iris grabbed her shoulders, shaking her violently. "Fix this! Now!"

"Iris, you need to calm down—"

"Calm down?! I’m calling my uncle!"

She dialed frantically, convinced he could erase the scandal.

"He’ll make this disappear. He always does."

The call connected. "Uncle, I need—"

"I didn’t push you into this industry so you could embarrass me!" His voice was ice. "Do you even know who owns Soul Jewelry? Mrs. Goldmann. And you thought you could mess with them?"

Iris froze.

Mrs. Goldmann?

The name sent a chill down her spine.

"But—but it’s just a new jewelry brand!"

"New?" He scoffed. "You’re on your own."

The line went dead.

Iris collapsed onto the couch, her mind racing.

Then her manager called.

She answered numbly. "Mr. Yankov…?"

"Do you have any idea what you’ve done?" His voice was a whip. "Years of work, destroyed in one day. You got cocky, and now the entire jewelry industry has blacklisted you."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

"Taylor, Viana, Luxe—they’ve all issued statements banning you from endorsements. Your career is over."

The phone slipped from her fingers.

It was too late.

No one would protect her now.

At ckgold...

Nathan Goldmann scrolled through the viral posts flooding every social media platform, his lips curling into a subtle smirk.

The glow of multiple screens reflected in his piercing blue eyes as he leaned back in his leather chair.

A quiet chuckle escaped him. "So she's figured it out after all."

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the polished mahogany desk, the rhythmic sound echoing through the spacious office.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the city lights twinkled like scattered diamonds against the night sky.

Nathan's gaze lingered on one particular trending hashtag - #VianaJewelryScandal - where thousands of comments were pouring in by the minute.

He zoomed in on a blurry surveillance photo showing Evelyn Vanderbilt's determined expression as she confronted the counterfeiters.

"Impressive as always, Zee," he murmured to himself, a hint of admiration coloring his tone.

The notification ping of an incoming email interrupted his thoughts. The subject line read: "Emergency Board Meeting Request - RE: Recent Events."

Nathan's smirk widened as he imagined the chaos unfolding at Viana Jewelry's headquarters.

He reached for his phone and dialed a familiar number. "Oliver? Cancel all my afternoon appointments. It seems I have some damage control to attend to."

As he ended the call, his eyes flicked back to Evelyn's photo on screen.

This game between them was far from over.
###Chapter 458

Nathan set the tablet down with a quiet thud. His fingers lingered over the polished wood of his desk before he pulled open the drawer, his gaze falling on the crisp white divorce papers tucked inside.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts. He shut the drawer just as Oliver stepped into the office. "Sir, Mr. Harrison de Arma is here to see you."

Nathan stilled, his expression unreadable. After a beat, he nodded. "Let him in."

Oliver disappeared briefly before Harrison strode in, his presence commanding as he settled onto the couch without waiting for an invitation.

Nathan rose and crossed the room, taking the seat opposite him. Oliver poured tea in silence before slipping out and closing the door behind him.

"Mr. de Arma," Nathan began, his voice cool. "What brings you here?"

Harrison lifted his head, his sharp eyes assessing. "There is something you should know."

Nathan waited, his fingers tightening imperceptibly against his thighs.

Harrison exhaled, his tone laced with something unreadable. "I know what happened between you and Evelyn in Stoslo. And now, I understand what she told me that day."

Nathan's jaw tensed. "What did Zoe say to you?"

Harrison met his gaze, unwavering. "You should be grateful my granddaughter is so stubbornly devoted to you. I warned her to leave you. I told her that if she stayed, she’d be in danger because of who you are. Even if I don’t use her against the Goldmanns, others won’t hesitate."

Nathan’s lips pressed into a thin line.

Harrison continued, his voice low. "Do you know what she said to me? She said she would never betray you, even if the whole world turned against you. She would never walk away."

A flicker of something raw crossed Nathan’s eyes. His hands, resting on his knees, clenched into fists.

Zoe… said that?

Harrison studied him. "She came to me asking about your mother’s kidnapping fifteen years ago. I know the Goldmanns have always blamed me. I never bothered to correct that assumption."

His expression darkened. "My hatred for your family stems from what happened to my father and my leg—both tied to your great-grandfather. But what Evelyn said that day… it made me reconsider."

He paused, then admitted, "Perhaps she was right. Perhaps this feud was built on misunderstandings."

Nathan’s gaze dropped, his voice flat. "When someone lured me to Stoslo using my mother’s death, I already suspected there was more to it."

Harrison folded his hands, resting them on his knee. "I knew those people were behind your mother’s death. But my hatred for the Goldmanns was so deep, I didn’t care if I was blamed. One more crime on my conscience meant nothing."

His eyes hardened. "But I also knew those people wanted the de Armas on their side. When I came to Zlokova searching for Evelyn and learned of her connection to you, I kept her lineage hidden. For her safety."

His voice wavered slightly. "I didn’t want her to suffer the same fate as my daughter, Miranda."

Nathan stiffened. "What do you mean?"

Harrison’s face twisted with regret, his usual sharpness crumbling. "Do you know how it shattered me when Evelyn told me her mother died from the sleeper virus? That infection… it was because of me."

Nathan’s breath caught.

Zoe’s mother died from the virus too?

Harrison’s voice was barely audible. "Miranda was only seventeen thirty years ago. She volunteered in the outbreak zone. I was terrified for her—afraid the virus still lingered there."

His hands trembled. "And because of that fear, I lost her."
###Chapter 459

The office was heavy with silence as Harrison de Arma's knuckles turned white from clenching his fists.

"At that time, the Kents were still my allies." His voice was rough with suppressed rage. "They handed me a vial, claiming it contained an experimental serum that could immunize against the virus."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "I trusted them. I was desperate to protect my daughter. So I paid an exorbitant sum and injected her with it."

His jaw tightened. "But she still got infected. Now I understand why she suddenly left the de Arma estate a year later and fled to Morwich with Sebastian." His eyes burned with betrayal. "They used me. That vial wasn't a cure—it was the virus itself. My own daughter became their test subject."

Nathan Goldmann poured himself tea, the delicate clink of porcelain unnaturally loud in the tense room. "So the virus was always part of their experiments?"

Harrison's shoulders slumped. "Edmund Lincoln told me in Stoslo that infection was just the first phase."

The revelation had shattered him. For decades, he'd believed the Kents were searching for a cure. Instead, they'd been perfecting a weapon.

"My father withdrew our family from royal politics after the incident with the eldest princess," Harrison continued hoarsely. "Everyone thought it was because Philip Goldmann took me hostage. But that was only part of it."

He rubbed his missing leg absently. "I lost more than a limb that day. When I learned Philip was involved in my father's death, hatred consumed me. The Kents exploited that. They made me their pawn."

A haunted look crossed his face. "My father knew about their experiments but believed they were developing treatments. After the outbreak thirty years ago, he locked himself away for a week. When he emerged, he warned me not to follow his path." Harrison's voice broke. "I didn't understand until now."

Nathan's gaze darkened. His own grandfather had been infected. "What exactly were they trying to achieve?"

Harrison exhaled sharply. "You know what the wealthy and powerful fear most, don't you?"

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line.

"Aging. Disease. Death." Harrison's laugh was hollow. "No medicine grants immortality, but they were willing to burn the world for even a few extra years. The royals wanted an antibody—something to rewrite human genetics. So they engineered a virus, tested it on people, then tried to develop counteragents."

His fist hit the desk. "The outbreak thirty years ago wasn't an accident. It was their failed experiment going rogue. The epidemic destroyed the princess's reputation, playing right into their hands."

The truth hung between them—a web of lies spanning generations. Nathan's tea had gone cold, mirroring the ice in his veins. Some wars weren't fought with weapons, but with viruses and betrayal.

And the battle was far from over.
###Chapter 460

Nathan clenched his fists tightly before parting his lips slightly.

"They're still experimenting."

Harrison was stunned. "How did you know?"

"Because I've been infected." His cold gaze lingered on the teacup. "There's no incubation period this time. It's a new strain."

"Does Evelyn know?"

"No."

Harrison fell silent for a long moment, shock evident in his expression.

Nathan's voice remained steady. "Zoe's mother was infected. She must have taken something to suppress it, which is why Zoe shows no symptoms. And her blood... is unique."

Harrison exhaled sharply, lifting the teacup but not drinking.

Nathan continued, indifferent. "I'll divorce Evelyn."

Harrison studied him for a long time. From what he had just witnessed, it was clear Nathan cared deeply for his granddaughter. He set the cup down. "I understand."

"Keep this a secret for me." Nathan's tone was firm.

Harrison hesitated. "Don't you want to live?"

A flicker of emotion darkened Nathan's eyes, but he didn't answer directly. "You and Edmund will protect her. I've already given her half of ckgold's shares. The Goldmanns won't fall even if I die. This... is my only way out."

After Harrison left, Nathan suddenly coughed violently, blood staining his fingers crimson.

Oliver burst in at the sound, panic flashing across his face. "Sir, I'm taking you to the hospital—"

"No hospitals." Nathan's face paled. "Handle the divorce paperwork. But take me home first."

Evelyn had been sitting in her office all afternoon, her eyelids twitching incessantly. A deep unease coiled in her chest.

Then Oliver's message arrived.

Her heart plummeted when she read it—Nathan wanted her to handle the divorce.

She applied fresh makeup, determined to confront him at his office.

But when she arrived, she was told Nathan hadn’t been in for days. Oliver was managing everything.

She strode into the administrative office, finding only Oliver there.

"Ms. Vanderbilt." He stood, sliding a document across the desk. "Mr. Goldmann asked you to sign this first."

Evelyn stared at the papers, her calm unnerving even to herself. "He’s really going through with this?"

Oliver avoided her gaze, his expression tense. "I’m sorry. He has his reasons. Just... sign it."

Her fists tightened, then loosened. "I want to see Nathan."

"Mr. Goldmann isn’t seeing anyone."

"Oliver." Her voice sharpened. "Tell me what’s happening to him."

Oliver hesitated. He could see Evelyn’s desperation, but his oath bound him. "I’m sorry."

Understanding flickered in her eyes. She pushed the papers away. "Then I won’t sign."

Before Oliver could react, she turned and left.

In her car, her grip on the steering wheel turned white-knuckled.

"Divorce?" Her voice was a whisper, then a snarl. "After everything, Nathan Goldmann, you push me away without a word?"

She grabbed her phone and dialed. "Sophia. Free tonight? Let’s get a drink."
###Chapter 461

The evening sky was painted in hues of violet when Evelyn pulled up outside Sophia's apartment.

Sophia bounded down the steps wearing a denim pinafore dress, her twin braids swinging with each energetic step. She slid into the passenger seat with practiced ease, buckling up with a click. "Since when do you suddenly crave cocktails on a Tuesday night?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the steering wheel as she merged into traffic. A shadow crossed her face. "I need to talk."

Sophia studied her best friend's profile. "This is about Nathan, isn't it?" She frowned. "Weren't you two perfectly fine before the Stoslo trip?"

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered like trapped butterflies. The words "we're getting divorced" burned her tongue but remained unspoken.

Perhaps she wanted to preserve the illusion a little longer - even if the marriage existed only in other people's perceptions now.

The neon sign of 'Velvet Martini' buzzed to life as they entered. Sophia stirred her cosmopolitan absently. "Zoe, you're scaring me. What's really going on?"

Evelyn took a fortifying sip of her gin fizz before deflecting. "How's wedding planning with Lucas going?"

Sophia groaned dramatically. "Ugh, don't remind me." She twirled a braid around her finger. "Between my father, Aunt Lydia, and the entire Laurent family breathing down my neck... It's like they think this arranged marriage will magically fix everything."

She leaned in conspiratorially. "And between us? Lucas is insufferable. We argue about everything from music preferences to proper tea brewing temperatures." A dramatic shudder. "Plus, did you know his ex was Victoria's Secret model Valentina Rossi? I saw photos - the woman has legs for days and a backside that could launch ships."

Evelyn's drink paused halfway to her lips as a familiar figure materialized behind Sophia's chair. She opened her mouth to warn her friend, but Sophia's rant had reached terminal velocity.

"...and if you think I'm exaggerating about his temper, just last week he threw a cello bow across the room because-"

Evelyn reached out and pinched Sophia's arm sharply.

"Ow! What was that for? I'm just saying the man has the emotional regulation of a-"

Sophia's words died as she followed Evelyn's gaze. Lucas stood at the bar, collecting two tumblers of amber liquid. She shrank into her seat. "Tell me he didn't hear any of that."

"Not a word," Evelyn lied smoothly.

Lucas turned, his sharp features illuminated by the bar's mood lighting. "Fancy seeing you two here alone."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Cousin! Here with friends?"

Lucas's eyebrow arched. "'Cousin'? That's new."

"Family should stick together," Evelyn said brightly, slinging an arm around Sophia's stiff shoulders. "Isn't that right, future cousin-in-law?"

Sophia elbowed her sharply. "In your dreams, Vanderbilt."

Lucas's gaze flickered between them. "Join us in the VIP lounge."

Evelyn practically dragged a resisting Sophia through the crowded bar. The private room revealed Adrian Boucher holding court among a group of sharply dressed men.

"Adrian!" Sophia broke free to claim the empty seat beside the actor. "Since when does the king of 18-hour workdays do social calls?"

Adrian's famous smile flashed. "Even workaholics get nights off." His gaze lifted to Evelyn hovering in the doorway. "Ms. Vanderbilt. Unexpected pleasure."

Evelyn nodded and retreated to a secluded corner booth. The other men - clearly industry elites from their designer watches and confident postures - greeted Sophia with easy familiarity. Their attention soon returned to Adrian, who was recounting some Hollywood anecdote.

From her shadowed perch, Evelyn watched the scene unfold - the way Lucas's fingers drummed impatiently on his glass, how Adrian's laugh never quite reached his eyes, and Sophia's animated gestures as she argued some point about method acting.

The ice in her drink cracked loudly in the brief silence between conversations. Evelyn realized with sudden clarity that she was the only one here who didn't belong.
###Chapter 462

"Lucas, it's quite unusual for you to invite your fiancée to join our drinking session." Trevor Hannigan swirled his wine glass, his teasing gaze fixed on Lucas Laurent as he chuckled.

Lucas remained silent.

Sophia Hill hurled a handful of snacks at Trevor. "Stop your nonsense! What ridiculous things are you spouting?"

Dodging the flying snacks, Trevor laughed. "We all move in the same social circles. Who doesn't know about the engagement between the Hills and the Laurents?"

The engagement between these two prominent families had become common knowledge in their social sphere. It was an arranged marriage that had been meticulously planned for months. Even if Sophia wanted to deny it, she couldn't escape this reality forever.

Damian Santiago, seated beside Lucas, joined in the teasing with a smirk. "Adrian, aren't you going to start considering marriage plans? You're not getting any younger."

Adrian Boucher set down his glass. "There's no rush."

"No rush? You're practically the same age as Nathan. Speaking of which, it's been years since Nathan last joined our gatherings."

Trevor glanced at Damian. "He's a family man now. Not like you, still playing the field as a bachelor."

"Hey, when have you ever seen me chasing women? Don't slander me like that. There are ladies present." All eyes turned toward Evelyn Vanderbilt at Damian's remark.

Evelyn had been quietly swirling her wine glass in the corner since their arrival, drinking alone.

Suddenly, someone slid into the seat beside her.

Both Lucas and Adrian tensed slightly.

Jordan Lichtenberg, unaware of Evelyn's identity and slightly intoxicated, draped an arm around her shoulders with his signature playboy charm. "You gentlemen have been neglecting this beautiful lady, leaving her to drink alone. Don't worry darling, I'll keep you company."

As Sophia opened her mouth to intervene, Adrian's voice turned icy. "Jordan, do you know who she is?"

Trevor and Damian, noticing Adrian's changed expression, studied Evelyn more closely, finding her vaguely familiar.

Too tipsy to care, Jordan shrugged. "Who is she? How should I know? Isn't she here to get drunk like the rest of us?" Just as Adrian was about to speak, Evelyn clinked her glass against Jordan's. "Exactly, we're all here to enjoy ourselves tonight. Let's make it memorable."

Both Lucas and Adrian seemed taken aback by her composed response, sensing something amiss.

Sophia leaned forward with a dark expression. "If you get drunk with Mrs. Goldmann tonight, your head might very well end up floating in the Yurp River tomorrow."

'Mrs. Goldmann!'

The name instantly sobered Jordan. "What did you just say?"

"So this is Mrs. Goldmann..." Trevor looked astonished. They'd heard of her but never met in person. The announcement of her marriage to Nathan Goldmann had caused a sensation, published in newspapers everywhere. Now he recognized that familiar face.

Jordan immediately withdrew his arm from Evelyn's shoulders and scooted away. No matter how reckless he was, he wouldn't dare flirt with Nathan Goldmann's wife!

Lucas stood and took Jordan's vacated seat while Evelyn simply held her untouched wine glass. Her expression revealed neither joy nor sorrow—just a quiet melancholy.

Setting down her glass, she rose gracefully. "Please continue your drinks. I need some air."

"Zoe!" Sophia stood abruptly.

But Evelyn had already exited the private room.

Sophia moved to follow, but Adrian stopped her. "I'll go. It's not safe for a woman alone out there, and your presence wouldn't make much difference anyway."

Watching Adrian don his mask and cap before pursuing Evelyn, Sophia could only stand helplessly, uncertain what to do next.
###Chapter 463

Sophia didn't want to be left alone in the bar. As she reached for her clutch, her gaze fell upon Evelyn's phone abandoned on the leather couch.

"Honestly, how could she—"

The screen illuminated when she picked it up, revealing an unread text notification. Her breath hitched as the message content registered.

Lucas noticed her frozen stance. "Is that Zoe's phone?"

Without answering, Sophia snatched her bag and bolted toward the exit.

"Lucas, what's going on?" Damian asked, exchanging confused glances with their companions.

Lucas exhaled sharply and stood. "Keep drinking. I'll handle this."

He caught up with Sophia just outside the bar, gripping her elbow gently. "Call Adrian. Ask his location—I'll drive you there."

Sophia remained shell-shocked.

When she didn't respond, Lucas leaned closer—only for her to suddenly meet his gaze with haunted eyes. "Nathan wants to divorce Zoe."

The neon fountain cast rippling colors across Evelyn's solitary figure on the park bench. Adrian approached through the mist, his shadow stretching long across the damp pavement.

"Do you realize how late it is?" His voice carried equal parts concern and exasperation. "Wandering alone at night—do you want to give Nathan a heart attack?"

"Would he even care?" Evelyn's bitter laugh dissolved into the night. When she lifted her face, the artificial glow highlighted her hollow smile. "I suppose you've heard? The divorce papers are already drafted."

Adrian's mask concealed his momentary shock. "He's serious?"

"Full custody of the children. Fifty percent of CKGold shares." Her fingers twisted the hem of her jacket. "How very generous of him, don't you think?"

The unspoken words hung between them—generous to everyone except her heart.

Adrian studied her profile before speaking carefully. "Do you understand what half of CKGold represents?"

Her silence prompted him to continue. "Even combined with other major shareholders, that stake makes you the company's largest individual owner." He exhaled sharply. "He's handing you the entire empire. Just not as his wife."

Evelyn's breath caught. Nathan surrendering CKGold? The man who'd built it from scratch? It made no sense.

Adrian settled beside her, the bench creaking under his weight. Despite the baseball cap and nondescript hoodie, his aristocratic bearing remained unmistakable. Where Nathan radiated the dangerous allure of aged whiskey, Adrian possessed the layered complexity of rare tea—each encounter revealing deeper facets.

"We grew up together," he murmured, staring at the fountain's dancing waters. "I used to envy him terribly."

"Envy?" The unexpected confession snapped Evelyn from her thoughts.

Adrian's gloved fingers brushed hers briefly. "The way he loved you. Like a man who'd found his compass after years adrift." His voice dropped. "Men like Nathan don't give away their life's work unless they're protecting something more precious."

The fountain's spray turned to diamonds in the moonlight as Evelyn's vision blurred. Protection? Or permanent farewell?

The golden sunlight streamed through the towering windows of the Vanderbilt estate, casting long shadows across the marble floors.

Evelyn stood by the grand piano, her fingers tracing the polished keys absently.

"Adrian Boucher was born with everything," Vivian remarked from the velvet chaise, swirling her wine glass. "A name that commands respect, generations of influence—what more could one ask for?"

Evelyn didn't respond immediately.

She knew better than to engage in Vivian's games.

But the truth lingered in the air, unspoken yet undeniable.

Adrian Boucher wasn't just privileged—he was untouchable.

His family's legacy stretched back centuries, their power woven into the very fabric of high society.

Yet, beneath the glittering surface, Evelyn sensed something darker.

A shadow that even Adrian couldn't escape.

Vivian smirked, taking a slow sip. "People would kill for his life."

Evelyn finally met her stepsister's gaze.

"Or die trying," she murmured.

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning.

Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the windows like a warning.
###Chapter 464

Adrian Boucher smiled wistfully. "Yes, I envied him for having parents who adored him. I envied the freedom he possessed."

The loneliness flickering in his eyes made Evelyn Vanderbilt realize his envy of Nathan was genuine.

Adrian continued, his voice detached. "Someone once told me that a life without dreams is tragic. That existing merely to follow rules, jumping from one day to the next without purpose, is no way to live."

His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "That person was Nathan’s mother—Aunt Victoria Knowles."

Evelyn’s lips parted, but no words came out.

Adrian spoke slowly, as if recalling distant memories. "My family elders were always strict. As a child, I was drilled in etiquette, tradition, and endless books to expand my knowledge. Private school only added more burdens. There was no time to play, let alone hope for friendships."

Evelyn understood. Noble birth granted privilege, but the chains of expectation were suffocating.

"How did you and Nathan meet?" she asked suddenly, curiosity sparking about Nathan’s past.

Adrian’s expression softened. "Once, my family punished me by making me kneel before our ancestors’ portraits for a mistake I’d made. I was so angry, I ran away from the manor. That’s when I stumbled upon Nathan and his mother on the street."

He had been just a child then, and Nathan only a year older. Victoria had found him crying in a corner and, after hearing his story, brought him home to the Goldmann mansion.

From that day, he and Nathan became inseparable. The Goldmann estate was the only place Adrian ever felt free—where warmth and laughter replaced cold discipline.

Victoria treated him like a second son, baking his favorite treats whenever he visited.

Nathan, however, hadn’t been so welcoming at first. Jealous of his mother’s affection for Adrian, he’d been combative, always picking fights. And when he lost, he’d cry.

Adrian chuckled. "But he had his moments. When my knees were swollen from kneeling, he’d bring me medicine. When I admitted I’d never played basketball, he dragged me to the court. He even took me to see the ocean for the first time—though his father scolded us fiercely afterward. Nathan stood up for me, though."

His smile widened. "Once, he stormed into my house and yelled at my grandfather for beating me. Then, to avenge me, he released all my grandfather’s prized canaries. Those birds were worth a fortune. My grandfather was livid."

Evelyn laughed. "He was that mischievous?"

Adrian nodded. "Until Victoria’s accident. After that, he changed completely. The laughter vanished. He became withdrawn, his emotions unreadable. We didn’t see each other for years after high school—not until a banquet when he returned from college to take over Luxe."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Did you enter acting because of his mother?"

"Yes." Adrian met her eyes. "She told me that while we can’t choose our birth, we can choose our life. I refused to be shackled to the Boucher legacy like my father—unable to make my own choices, even in love. Did you know he couldn’t even pick his own wife?"
###Chapter 465

Evelyn fell silent.

Sophia had told her about the tangled history between the Bouchers and the Knowles. If Yves Boucher hadn’t abandoned Victoria Knowles all those years ago due to family obligations, perhaps Nathan wouldn’t have become the man she knew and loved. And Adrian Boucher wouldn’t be the one sitting beside her now.

Fate works in mysterious ways. If I hadn’t changed my path back then, I might never have met Nathan.

That absurd night six years ago set everything in motion, planting a seed that would only grow with time. And now, fate has spun its wheel again, bringing us back together. But was it really fate? Or was it my own choices? If I hadn’t returned to Cornelia to reclaim Viana Jewelry, if I’d stayed in Stoslo basking in my success, I might never have met the father of my children.

Adrian glanced at his watch. "It’s getting late. I should take you home."

After their conversation, Evelyn no longer felt the suffocating boredom from earlier. She stood and nodded. "Thank you."

Adrian smiled. "No need for formalities. Since destiny keeps throwing us together, I consider you a friend."

They stepped out of the park—only to find Nathan standing by his car, his expression dark as storm clouds.

It had been days since Evelyn last saw him. Now, she noticed how much weight he’d lost, his sharp features even more pronounced. Despite everything, her heart leapt at the sight of him. She took a step forward—

Then his cold voice cut through the air. "If you want her, Adrian, you can have her as soon as the divorce is finalized."

The words froze her in place.

Adrian’s eyes narrowed. "And you’d just let her go?"

Nathan scoffed. "She’s just a woman. It’s not that hard."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. The fragile hope in her chest shattered like glass, leaving behind a raw, bleeding wound.

Adrian studied her before turning back to Nathan. "Then why give her half of CKGOLD’s shares in the settlement? You’re not the type to hand over power so easily."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but his voice remained icy. "I don’t need them. I just want her gone. It doesn’t matter who ends up with CKGOLD. Funny how you’ll benefit either way."

Adrian frowned.

Before he could respond, a figure lunged forward—

Lucas Laurent swung a fist straight into Nathan’s face.

Evelyn gasped.

Nathan staggered but caught himself, wiping the blood from his split lip with his thumb. His smirk was chilling.

Sophia yanked Lucas back. "Have you lost your mind?!"

Lucas glared at Nathan, his voice dripping with venom. "Nathan Goldmann, don’t think your name makes you untouchable. If you won’t act like a human, I’ll treat you like the animal you are."

Nathan’s laugh was dark. "You?"

Sophia kept a firm grip on Lucas, her eyes darting between Nathan and Evelyn in disbelief. She’d seen Evelyn’s text—about the divorce—but hearing Nathan say those words out loud was another level of cruelty.

How could he be so heartless?

Sophia’s fear of Nathan evaporated under a wave of fury. "What the hell is wrong with you? You begged her to marry you! And now you’re throwing her away like trash?"

Nathan’s lips curled into a sneer. The blood on his mouth stood stark against his pale skin, making him look like a predator in the dim light. "So what? I’m tired of playing husband. Got a problem with that?"
###Chapter 466

"Nathan, you—" Lucas Laurent lunged forward, fists clenched, but Sophia Hill held him back with surprising strength.

He couldn't just shove her aside.

Lucas rarely lost his temper - violence wasn't in his nature unless provoked beyond reason. But Nathan had crossed every line imaginable.

"That's enough."

Evelyn Vanderbilt stood motionless as marble, her expression unreadable. Her fingers curled into fists, turning bone-white with tension.

Her red-rimmed eyes locked onto Nathan's profile, but he refused to meet her gaze. Couldn't bear to.

"Nathan," her voice trembled, "what will you do if I refuse to sign those divorce papers?" She'd swallowed her pride, offering one last olive branch. Retreating, but not surrendering. She wouldn't leave, even if he dragged her out by her hair.

How could she believe the man who'd taken bullets for her in Stoslo had stopped loving her? That he'd grown tired of their marriage?

"Evelyn, are you deaf? Divorcing this bastard is your best option." Lucas ground his teeth so hard his jaw ached.

Since discovering their familial connection, he'd treated Evelyn like a sister. When she'd chosen Nathan, he'd respected her decision - never badmouthed the Goldmanns, never interfered. But this? This was unforgivable.

If Nathan couldn't appreciate her worth, the Laurents and Harrisons certainly would.

Sophia nodded vehemently. "Zoe, if he wants out, let him go. The world's full of better men!"

They'd both seen Nathan's true colors today.

Tired of her? Planning to pass her off to another man post-divorce? What kind of monster said such things?

In hindsight, she should've set Zoe up with her cousin ages ago.

This broken version of Evelyn was unrecognizable. Love might be blind, but this was self-destruction. And they couldn't let it continue.

But they didn't understand what Evelyn and Nathan had survived together. A bitter smile twisted her lips. "I wish I could be as ruthless as him...but I need to know—"

Her entire body trembled as she faced him. "Nathan, do our promises still mean anything?"

He'd sworn death alone could part them.

Vowed she'd be his only bride.

Promised a wedding that would make Bassburgh's elite weep with envy.

In return, she'd pledged eternal loyalty. Were those just pretty lies now?

Nathan's lips pressed into a bloodless line. She searched his eyes desperately for any flicker of hesitation—found none.

His jaw clenched as those obsidian eyes traced her delicate yet resilient features. "We'll settle this in court then. You know my win record. Evelyn...don't make this harder than it has to be."

Each word shattered her heart anew. No attempt to reconcile. Just cold legal threats to end what they'd built.

"Nathan...is this truly what you want?"

Was their love so disposable?

Silence. Nathan wrenched his car door open, pausing with one foot inside. "Time's up for second chances." The door slammed like a judge's gavel.
###Chapter 467

Time was slipping through her fingers like sand.

The heavy door slammed shut with finality as the black sedan vanished into the inky darkness. Evelyn remained frozen in place, her vision blurred by unshed tears that now splattered against her leather shoes like shattered rose petals.

Sophia rushed forward, gripping her friend's shoulders. "Evelyn, why cling to someone who's already—"

"You wouldn't understand." Evelyn's voice cut sharper than winter frost. The harsh streetlights stretched her shadow into a distorted silhouette of grief. After an eternity of silence, she whispered, "Take me back to Vanderbilt Manor, please."

She never raised her eyes.

Adrian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "I'll get the car." The drive passed in suffocating silence. When they arrived, Evelyn clutched her phone like a lifeline, murmured her thanks, and disappeared through the wrought iron gates without a backward glance.

Adrian watched until the manor doors swallowed her whole. His brow furrowed as he tapped out a rapid message on his phone.

Meanwhile, at the Goldmann estate...

Nathan staggered through the grand foyer, crimson droplets staining his lips. His knuckles turned white against the banister as violent coughs wracked his body.

I'm sorry, Zoe.

The words burned in his throat as his vision swam with unshed tears.

Alfred gasped when he flicked on the lights. "Master Goldmann!"

Oliver arrived with the family physician in record time. They hovered outside the bedroom door as the doctor examined his patient.

"He went out?" Oliver's frown deepened at Nathan's deteriorating condition. The virus remained their deadly secret - its revelation would cause citywide panic.

The physician confirmed the fever would rage for days. No conventional medications could touch it. "He must endure the storm," the doctor said gravely.

Alfred wrung his hands. "He returned worse than when he left. Is it... contagious?"

Oliver hesitated. That was one word for it.

His phone vibrated with Theodore's call. Stepping away, he answered tersely. "Not good, sir."

A weighted pause. "Keep him alive until my plane lands."

Sleep eluded Evelyn that night.

Morning found her at the breakfast table, her porcelain skin stretched too tight over sharp cheekbones. Dark smudges beneath her eyes betrayed her sleepless vigil.

Richard set a steaming bowl before her. "Zoe, perhaps a holiday? This self-destruction serves no one."

She managed two spoonfuls before pushing it away. Food had lost all meaning these days.

"I'll have the children brought home," she said suddenly, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "They shouldn't see me like this."

Richard nodded his approval.

A quick text to Gregory ensured her office would manage without her.

The café where Sophia worked provided temporary refuge. Her friend slid a cappuccino across the table. "If you're running away, take me with you. Every tragic heroine needs comic relief."
###Chapter 468

"Don't you have work today?" Evelyn asked, eyeing her best friend skeptically.

Sophia waved her hand dismissively. "I can take unpaid leave. A few days without pay won't kill me."

Evelyn picked up her coffee cup, but the moment the bitter liquid touched her tongue, a wave of nausea hit her. She barely had time to set the cup down before rushing to the bathroom.

"Zoe?" Sophia jumped up from her seat.

Evelyn barely made it to the stall before emptying the contents of her stomach into the toilet.

"Zoe, are you okay?" Sophia's concerned voice came from outside the stall.

When Sophia saw her vomiting, realization dawned on her face. "Zoe, are you...?"

Evelyn froze mid-retch. The nausea, loss of appetite, missed period—it all clicked into place. No. This couldn't be happening.

Flushing the toilet, Evelyn emerged pale-faced, one hand instinctively cradling her stomach.

Sophia looked genuinely worried. "Should we go to the hospital? Just to be sure?"

Evelyn didn't object. If she really was pregnant... Nathan wanted a divorce. What would that mean for their child?

At the hospital, Sophia stayed by Evelyn's side through every test. The results confirmed their suspicions—Evelyn was pregnant.

The doctor slid the report across his desk while typing into his computer. "You're five weeks along. Avoid stress—it could lead to complications. And I'd recommend separate sleeping arrangements for now."

Evelyn's hand trembled against her stomach as she took the report. She thanked the doctor numbly before walking out.

Sophia followed, her expression sympathetic. "Nathan files for divorce, and now this. The universe has a sick sense of humor."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Tell me about it."

Pregnant right as their marriage was ending. Would Nathan change his mind if he knew?

In the hospital lobby, breaking news flashed across the wall-mounted screen: "Shocking development! Nathan Goldmann and Evelyn Vanderbilt announce divorce proceedings."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. The color drained from her face as the words sank in.

He'd gone public with their divorce. Nathan was forcing her hand.

Sophia gasped, but before she could speak, Evelyn was already rushing toward the exit.

"Zoe!" Sophia called after her, but Evelyn had already hailed a cab.

Sophia quickly dialed Adrian Boucher—if anyone could help, it was him.

Through the taxi window, Evelyn watched the city blur through her tears. She muffled her sobs with one hand, her other protectively covering her still-flat stomach.

Sophia's calls went unanswered. Evelyn needed to see Nathan—to confront him about this cruelty.

Dark clouds gathered as the cab pulled up to the Goldmann estate. Evelyn barely waited for it to stop before throwing open the door.

But at the gates, security blocked her path. "Ma'am, I'm sorry—you can't enter."

"I need to see Nathan. Move!" Evelyn tried to push past them.

The guards held firm. "I knew you'd come," a familiar voice said.

Theodore Goldmann approached, his expression unreadable. "Nathan won't see you. It's over—accept it."
###Chapter 469

"He wouldn't just demand a divorce without cause!" Evelyn's voice trembled, her eyes rimmed red. "Mr. Theodore Goldmann, I'm begging you—let me see him!"

Theodore's jaw tightened, though his expression remained impassive. "He's made his decision. Why persist? Haven't you caused enough trouble already? We're not contesting custody, and Nathan even transferred some of his shares to you. What more do you want?"

Evelyn's fingers turned ice-cold. Was that what they thought she cared about? Never.

Her voice shook. "I just need answers."

Theodore clenched his fist behind his back. Memories of his grandson's suffering hardened his gaze. "Answers? I never approved this marriage in the first place. I forced him to file for divorce. You were never worthy of him."

If Nathan couldn't sever ties, he'd play the villain himself.

His teeth ground together. "Evelyn, if you truly care for Nathan, sign the papers. We've been more than generous. If this goes to court, you'll lose everything."

"Furthermore," he continued coldly, "Nathan gave me his word—no further contact after this. Hate me if you must, but I won't watch my grandson suffer again. The children will be cared for, but you and Nathan are finished. Why cling when he's already let go?"

Let go? A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips. Her chest ached as if split open, hollow and raw. "Mr. Goldmann, please—just let me see him once."

"He refuses to see you. Leave."

With a dismissive wave, he turned toward the mansion, deliberately blocking her view inside.

Evelyn stood frozen as the doors slammed shut. The two guards exchanged glances. "Ms. Vanderbilt," one said carefully, "you should go."

Even her title had been stripped away. She didn't move.

The guards retreated, assuming she'd leave eventually.

Upstairs, Oliver watched from the window, his heart heavy. How could Nathan face her in this state?

Rain began pelting the pavement as Evelyn remained. The downpour drowned all other sounds, icy droplets mixing with her tears.

She clenched her fists, numb to the cold, refusing to budge.

Theodore sat stiffly beside Nathan's sickbed, eyes closed, hands folded. Oliver approached. "Sir, Ms. Vanderbilt still... hasn't left."

Theodore's eyes snapped open. "And? Should we parade him out like this?"

Oliver bowed his head.

"Let her wait," Theodore said coldly. "She'll leave when she's exhausted."

Oliver frowned. He'd message Chloe—someone needed to retrieve Evelyn before she collapsed.

Outside, Evelyn's vision blurred. Her body had long since lost feeling. Still, Nathan never appeared.

'Why, Nathan? Why this cruelty?'

Her knees buckled as darkness crept in.

Just before she hit the ground, strong arms caught her. She glimpsed a familiar silhouette before consciousness slipped away.
###Chapter 470

The sharp scent of antiseptic stung Evelyn's nostrils as she blinked awake. Sterile white tiles stretched above her, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights.

"Zoe, you're finally awake!" Sophia rushed to her bedside, relief washing over her features.

Richard and Chloe stood nearby. After collapsing, Richard had received word from Chloe about Evelyn's hospitalization and immediately rushed over. "The doctor said you need complete bed rest," Richard said gently, smoothing her blanket. "The stress nearly caused you to lose the baby."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her fingers trembled as they brushed her still-flat abdomen, guilt twisting in her chest. In a hoarse whisper, she asked, "Who...who brought me here?"

Flashes of a dark silhouette surfaced in her foggy memory. Sophia exchanged a glance with Chloe before answering carefully. "It was Nathan. His assistant called him away for an urgent matter."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line, her lashes fluttering rapidly.

Chloe moved to adjust her pillows when she saw Evelyn struggling to sit up. Only after Nathan's call had she learned the shocking truth - Evelyn was carrying his child.

After a prolonged silence, Evelyn spoke with eerie calm. "Please...I need to be alone."

Chloe hesitated, but Sophia squeezed her shoulder. "Of course. We'll check on you later." Richard nodded in agreement, casting one last worried glance before following them out.

Left alone, Evelyn leaned against the cold headboard, staring blankly at the rain-streaked window. Her eyes held the emptiness of a battlefield after the war.

Meanwhile, at the Goldmann estate...

"Pregnant? Ms. Vanderbilt is pregnant?" Oliver nearly dropped his phone upon hearing Chloe's news. His gaze darted toward the closed bedroom door where Nathan lay unconscious. This complicated everything.

Theodore stormed in, his cane tapping impatiently. "What now?"

Oliver debated withholding the information but ultimately confessed, "It's Chloe. She just called—"

"That girl with Evelyn?" Theodore interrupted with a scoff. "Unless someone's dying, it can wait." Compared to his grandson's condition, a fainting spell meant nothing.

As Theodore marched toward Nathan's room, Oliver blurted, "Sir, about the divorce papers—"

"What about them?" Theodore whirled around, eyes blazing. "The announcement's already made. Do you want this farce to continue indefinitely?" His voice turned glacial. "If Nathan won't end it, I will."

Oliver swallowed his protest. He understood Nathan's cruel strategy - pushing Evelyn to leave voluntarily rather than through legal force.

Theodore's phone rang abruptly - undoubtedly Nichs calling about the scandalous headlines.

Three days later...

Evelyn stood by the hospital window, watching pedestrians navigate the freshly washed sidewalks. The post-storm air carried the earthy fragrance of damp soil and new grass.

Chloe entered with a food tray, gasping when she saw Evelyn upright. "You shouldn't be out of bed!"

"Just stretching my legs," Evelyn murmured without turning.

Then, the question Chloe had been dreading: "When can I leave?"

After three days of confinement, Evelyn's patience wore thin. Worse, she'd forbidden Richard and Chloe from telling the children about her hospitalization, terrified they'd see her weakness.
###Chapter 471

The past three days had been eerily silent.

Nathan hadn't texted.

He hadn't called.

He hadn't even shown his face.

Evelyn sat by the hospital window, staring blankly at the city skyline. The sunlight streaming in did little to warm the cold knot in her chest.

Chloe placed a lunch tray on the bedside table. "The doctor says you're still weak," she said gently. "With the risk of miscarriage, you need proper rest before discharge."

Evelyn didn’t respond.

Sighing, Chloe guided her back to bed. "Mrs. Goldmann, you have to eat something. Richard went through the trouble of preparing this himself."

Evelyn’s stomach churned at the thought of food. Lately, everything made her nauseous.

But she forced a bite down.

For the baby.

She glanced at Chloe. "Thank you. For everything."

Chloe grinned. "No need for thanks. It’s my job."

Evelyn managed a small smile. "Then stop calling me Mrs. Goldmann. Evelyn is fine."

Chloe tilted her head. "How about Zoe?"

"Zoe?" Evelyn blinked, then chuckled. "Sure. If you like it."

——

That afternoon, Evelyn wandered to the hospital garden.

The benches were mostly occupied by elderly patients, their slow movements a stark contrast to her restless energy.

The sun warmed her skin, but her thoughts remained icy.

Then a shadow fell over her.

She looked up.

Adrian Boucher stood there, his golden hair catching the light.

"You look better," he remarked, smiling.

Evelyn forced a grin. "Hospital food does wonders."

They made an odd pair—him, a regal figure in his tailored coat; her, pale but still striking in her hospital gown.

An elderly woman shuffled past, pausing to squint at them. "Your wife, young man? She sick?"

Evelyn flushed.

Adrian laughed smoothly. "Just friends, ma’am."

The woman tsked. "Shame. Handsome boy like you? Better snatch him up before someone else does."

Evelyn opened her mouth, but the woman had already turned to Adrian, eyes narrowing. "You look familiar. Like that actor on TV…"

Evelyn’s pulse jumped.

Adrian didn’t wear a mask.

But he only pulled out a pair of black-framed glasses, sliding them on with practiced ease. "Ah, you mean Adrian Boucher? People say we look alike."

Evelyn bit back a laugh.

The woman nodded sagely. "My granddaughter loves him. She’d faint if she saw you."

Adrian’s lips curved. "Would she?"

He stepped closer, towering over the tiny woman. Taking her wrinkled hand, he pressed a kiss to her knuckles. "Tell her Adrian says hello."

The woman giggled like a schoolgirl.

Evelyn shook her head, hiding her smile.

Only Adrian could flirt with grandmas and get away with it.

"Since your granddaughter adores Adrian so much," Evelyn suggested, plucking the magazine from Daisy's hands, "why don't we recreate this photo?" She struck an identical pose, tilting her chin at the same angle.

Daisy gasped, clapping her hands together. "Yes! Please!"

###Chapter 472

The elderly woman's face brightened instantly. She fumbled for her phone with trembling hands. "Is it really you? Oh my goodness, thank you, young man!"

Adrian Boucher flashed his signature charming smile and posed for a selfie with her. After the photo, the woman waved goodbye, still beaming with joy.

Adjusting his black-rimmed glasses, Adrian let out a relieved sigh. "That was way too close for comfort."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "Honestly, what were you thinking? Wandering into a public hospital without even a disguise? You're literally the hottest actor in the country right now, Mr. Boucher."

Thankfully, the elderly woman wasn't as tuned into celebrity gossip as younger generations. Otherwise, the entire hospital would've erupted into chaos.

Adrian merely smirked but didn't respond.

He didn't linger much longer. After escorting Evelyn back to her ward, he said, "I should head out now. Take care of yourself, okay?"

Evelyn nodded. "I will."

As he turned to leave, he paused. "Oh, and if you need anything—anything at all—just call Sophia."

The unspoken message was clear: Sophia would relay everything to him.

Evelyn murmured her agreement.

Though she appreciated Adrian's kindness, she didn't want to impose. The last thing she needed was to drag him into another media scandal.

The moment Adrian left, Oliver Lawson appeared in the doorway. Evelyn's expression darkened.

She already knew what document he was holding. "Divorce papers, I assume?"

Oliver hesitated, then nodded. He placed the papers on the bedside table. "Ms. Vanderbilt, signing this is for the best. For both you and Mr. Goldmann."

He knew how deeply Evelyn loved Nathan, and how fiercely Nathan had once loved her. But Nathan had made his choice—he didn’t want her to suffer.

Even if he only had a few years left, he still prioritized her happiness above all else.

Evelyn was silent for a long moment before whispering, "Fine. I'll sign."

Oliver blinked in surprise. He hadn’t expected her to agree so easily. But then again, maybe she understood it was inevitable.

Evelyn took the papers and signed without even glancing at the terms. "I don’t want the shares. He can give them to whoever he pleases. Since he’s the one insisting on this, tell him not to regret it later."

Her voice was steady, but her fingers trembled slightly.

"He’s the one who walked away. He broke his promises. He showed me exactly how ruthless he can be. I’m done holding on. He’s free now—free to be the Nathan Goldmann he was before me. We’re nothing to each other anymore."

Oliver opened his mouth, then closed it. There was nothing left to say.

He collected the signed papers and left without another word.

Evelyn sat motionless on the edge of the bed long after he was gone. The pain in her chest was unbearable, as if someone had plunged a knife into her heart and twisted it.

Nathan had pulled himself out of the wreckage of their love. But she was still drowning in it, sinking deeper with every breath.

Days later, after confirming both Evelyn and the baby were healthy, Richard Vanderbilt completed her discharge paperwork.

Chloe Lawson waited outside in the car. Richard loaded Evelyn’s belongings into the trunk before turning to her. "Zoe, let’s go home."

Evelyn nodded. Just as she was about to step into the car, an eerie sensation prickled the back of her neck.

She turned sharply—and locked eyes with a masked woman standing a short distance away, staring intently at her.
###Chapter 473

Evelyn froze.

Even with half of the woman's face obscured by a mask, the icy glint in her eyes and the sinister aura radiating from her told Evelyn exactly who she was.

Rosalind.

Wasn't she in Stoslo? When did she come back?

"Zoe?" Richard called out when he noticed she hadn’t gotten into the car, her gaze fixed on something in the distance.

Evelyn turned to him, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think I just saw—"

But when she looked back, the woman was gone.

Richard followed her line of sight, but there was no one there. "Who did you see?"

Evelyn hesitated before murmuring, "Nothing."

Did I imagine it?

Rosalind was supposed to be in Stoslo. Nathan knew everything she had done—would she really dare to return?

Evelyn doubted it.

Still, unease settled in her chest as she climbed into the car. Chloe started the engine, and they pulled away from the curb.

But the moment the car began moving, a sharp, foreboding dread coiled in Evelyn’s stomach. Something wasn’t right.

Her fingers brushed over her abdomen before drifting to the ring on her finger—the one she still couldn’t bring herself to remove.

Slowly, she slid it off.

Sunlight streamed through the window, glinting off the diamond’s facets.

Then—

Boom!

The world spun violently.

Pain exploded through her body, sharp and all-consuming. A metallic taste filled her mouth.

Her ears rang.

Something warm trickled down her legs.

She tried to move, but her limbs refused to obey.

"Dad…" she choked out weakly.

Her vision blurred as she forced her eyes open.

Richard lay motionless beside her, blood seeping from a wound on his temple.

Her heart stuttered.

Footsteps crunched against broken glass.

The car door was wrenched open.

Hands grabbed her, dragging her out.

"No!" She fought weakly, reaching for her father.

But it was too late.

From the corner of her eye, she saw Chloe’s limp hand dangling from the driver’s seat.

Her lifeless eyes stared back, unseeing.

"Save them!" Evelyn screamed, her voice raw.

She tried to lunge forward, but the person behind her yanked her back.

Then—

Boom!

The car erupted into flames.

Heat seared her skin.

The fire swallowed everything—her father, Chloe, the wreckage.

Evelyn collapsed to the ground, her body wracked with sobs.

Darkness swallowed her whole.

At the Goldmann Mansion

"Zoe!" Nathan jolted awake, coughing violently.

"Young master, you're awake!" Alfred rushed in, relief flooding his features. He immediately called for the doctor.

By the time the physician arrived, Theodore and Oliver had already entered the room.

Theodore hurried to Nathan’s bedside. "How are you feeling?"

Nathan coughed again, his voice hoarse. "How long was I out?"

Oliver answered grimly, "A week, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

A week.

The doctor checked his temperature and nodded. "His fever has broken."

Theodore exhaled in relief. Then, hesitantly, he said, "Evelyn… has already signed the divorce papers."

Nathan’s fingers curled into fists.

She signed it.

Good.

But the satisfaction was hollow.

Before he could speak, a bodyguard burst into the room, his face ashen.

"Elder Master Goldmann! Oliver! Something terrible has happened!"
###Chapter 474

The bodyguard's hands trembled as he saw Nathan regain consciousness. "M-Mr. Goldmann," he stuttered.

Theodore's brow furrowed deeply. "Report. Now."

The guard's eyes darted between Oliver and Nathan. He swallowed hard before speaking. "Ms. Chloe... Ms. Vanderbilt and her father... Their car exploded after leaving the hospital."

Oliver grabbed the man's collar violently. "Repeat that!"

"We got the alert an hour ago," the guard continued, voice shaking. "The entire vehicle was engulfed in flames when we arrived. They were all inside."

Oliver's face went pale with shock.

"Nathan!" Theodore turned just in time to see Nathan tearing IV lines from his arm and bolting toward the door.

At the crash site, police tape cordoned off the intersection as firefighters battled the last of the flames. The blackened skeleton of the car stood as a grim monument.

Nathan shoved through the gathering crowd. "Let me through!" he roared when officers tried to stop him.

One cop recognized him instantly. "Mr. Goldmann? Stand back, sir!"

But Nathan was already falling to his knees before the wreckage. His voice broke. "Zoe... please... I take it all back. No divorce. Just come home."

Tears streamed down the face of the man known for his icy composure. The crowd murmured in shock.

"Wasn't he divorced?"
"Is that his wife's car?"
"God, they were inside?"

Oliver arrived with security. "Sir, you must stand up."

"Don't touch me!" Nathan lashed out wildly. "I can't... I can't breathe without her."

When the coroner unloaded two charred bodies, Nathan fought like a madman against those restraining him. Through the body bags' plastic, he recognized Chloe's distinctive bracelet.

A detective approached with an evidence bag. "We found this in the wreckage, sir."

The engagement ring - blackened and cracked - lay in Nathan's trembling palm. "Zoe..." His whisper carried unbearable pain.

Meanwhile, in the hospital...

"Dad! Chloe!" Evelyn jolted awake, tearing at her IV line. The heart monitor screamed as she ripped the sensors off.

She touched her bandaged face, memories flooding back. "The explosion... I was there..."

Blood dripped from her hand as she stumbled from bed, collapsing on the cold tile.

A shadow appeared in the doorway. "Do you really think you're going anywhere in this state?"
###Chapter 475

Evelyn gasped, her breath catching in her throat. She lifted her gaze to meet the man standing before her. His features were sharp, his face clean-shaven, and his piercing blue eyes held an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.

He carried himself with the same regal air as Edmund, though he appeared to be around the same age.

Dressed in a tailored dark gray pinstripe suit, he wore a peacock blue silk tie secured with an elegant serpent-shaped tie clip.

The man crouched down, extending a hand to help her up. His fingers were warm against hers as he steadied her. He studied her face for a long moment before a slow, knowing smile curved his lips.

"You really are her daughter," he murmured. "The resemblance is uncanny."

Evelyn frowned. "Who are you?"

His smile faded slightly. "Did Edmund never mention me?" He guided her back to the bed, his movements deliberate. When she didn’t answer, he exhaled. "I suppose he wouldn’t have."

He pulled a chair closer and sat, crossing one leg over the other. Resting his hands on his knee, he regarded her with an unreadable expression. "These days, I go by Henry. Edmund is one of my most trusted men in Metropolis. I assigned him to protect your mother."

His gaze flickered to the Ouroboros ring still glinting on her finger. He pointed at it. "Edmund gave you that, didn’t he? And I assume he’s the one who trained you in self-defense?"

Evelyn’s fingers instinctively curled around the ring.

Uncle Edmund works for this man? If he ordered him to protect Mom… then that means—

Her breath hitched. "You’re Sebastian?"

The name slipped out before she could stop it.

The realization struck her like lightning. The man before her was Sebastian—the legendary researcher who had vanished from the medical world over a decade ago.

He hadn’t disappeared. He had simply reinvented himself—as the leader of Metropolis.

He didn’t confirm or deny it, but Evelyn knew.

Now that she recognized him, she understood why her mother had never truly moved on, even after marrying Richard. Sebastian had been her first love, the one who had left an indelible mark on her heart.

He must have been devastatingly handsome in his youth. Even now, time had been kind to him. The years had only deepened his presence, transforming him into a man of quiet authority and undeniable charm.

He was around the same age as her father, yet he carried himself with a vitality Richard had long lost.

The thought of her father made her stomach twist. "My father… and Chloe—"

"I’m sorry."

Sebastian’s voice was low, laced with regret. "We tried to save them, but we were too late. Someone wanted all of you dead. If we hadn’t arrived when we did, you wouldn’t be here now."

His eyes darkened as he continued. "We managed to save you, but… your baby… we did everything we could."

Evelyn sat frozen, the words carving into her like a blade.

Her father and Chloe had been swallowed by the flames. And now, she had failed to protect her own child.

A sob tore from her throat. Her shoulders shook violently as grief crashed over her in relentless waves.

She was alone.

Sebastian reached into his pocket, producing a silk handkerchief. He gently wiped her tears away. "Come with me to Morwich," he said softly. "From this moment on, I will care for you as if you were my own."

One week later…

Nathan sat slumped in his chair, his expression grim. Every time his phone buzzed, his heart lurched with hope—only to plummet when he saw the caller wasn’t the one he was waiting for.

When Oliver’s name flashed across the screen, he answered with a terse, "What?"

Oliver’s voice was heavy. "Mr. Goldmann, we’ve searched every hospital in Bassburgh. There’s still no sign of Ms. Vanderbilt."

Nathan said nothing. He ended the call and let the phone slip from his fingers.
###Chapter 476

Nathan's fingers trembled as he lifted the signed divorce papers from Evelyn's hand. The corner crumpled beneath his grip, the paper nearly tearing from the force of his anguish.

Zoe is really gone. And I'll never see her again...

News outlets had been relentless, replaying footage of Nathan breaking down in front of the wrecked car from the accident a week prior. Speculation ran wild—his wife had perished in the crash, they claimed, sparking a frenzy of public sympathy and morbid curiosity.

Back at the Goldmann estate, the truth had been kept from the children—until now.

Liam stormed into the room first, his small frame trembling with fury. "Where's Mom?" he demanded, voice cracking.

Nathan didn't answer, his gaze fixed on the floor where the divorce papers had fallen. Caleb and Daisy followed, their confusion turning to dread as they took in the scene.

Theodore and Mr. Chester lingered in the doorway, helpless.

Liam snatched up the papers and hurled them at Nathan. "Bring her back!"

Caleb and Daisy froze, their brother's outburst terrifying them. But the suffocating silence in the room told them everything they needed to know.

Theodore stepped forward, his voice heavy. "Liam, this isn't your father's fault."

Liam whirled on him, eyes blazing. "I hate you!"

The words struck Theodore like a physical blow. Before he could react, Liam bolted for the door.

"Stop him!" Theodore barked.

Bodyguards intercepted Liam, restraining him despite his desperate thrashing.

Theodore turned, his gaze piercing. "If you were strong enough to protect your mother, she wouldn't be in this situation."

Liam went still.

His small fists clenched, knuckles white.

He's right. I'm weak. I couldn't protect her. That's why they hurt her.

Liam lifted his chin, his expression hardening beyond his years. "One day, I'll be strong enough. And I'll make every single person who hurt Mom, Caleb, and Daisy pay. They'll beg for death."

Theodore studied him, then nodded. "Then stay by my side. Power comes with suffering. If you want revenge, you'll endure it."

Mr. Chester frowned. "Elder Master Goldmann, he's just a boy."

Theodore scoffed. "And one day, Nathan, Nicholas, and I will be gone. Who will protect them then?"

Caleb and Daisy exchanged horrified glances.

What does Great-grandpa mean? Does Dad... not have much time left?

Two months later...

Morwich, Hanns Palace, City of Saint Page

Evelyn sat quietly on a garden bench, surrounded by a sea of blooming irises. The delicate fragrance filled the air, carried by a gentle breeze.

A group of maids lingered nearby, whispering among themselves.

"That's the girl Mr. Henry brought here, isn't she?"

"Girl? Did he adopt her?"

The first maid smirked. "Mr. Henry doesn't just take in strays. Don't you think it's strange that she appeared out of nowhere?"

Another sighed. "She hasn't spoken to anyone since she arrived."

"Maybe she doesn't understand us?"

Evelyn remained still, her expression unreadable.

The wind rustled through the flowers, carrying secrets only she knew.
###Chapter 477

The servants believed Evelyn's silence meant ignorance. They gossiped freely, unaware their careless words carried through the marble halls.

A sharp voice sliced through their chatter. "Mr. Lawson won't tolerate such disrespect."

The maids froze mid-sentence. Turning, they found Margaret standing rigid in her perfectly pressed uniform, her glasses glinting with disapproval.

Evelyn remained motionless by the window, her delicate fingers tracing patterns on the cold glass. The afternoon sun painted golden streaks across her hollow cheeks.

"Miss Vanderbilt." Margaret adjusted her cuffs. "Mr. Lawson requests your presence."

Evelyn rose slowly, her movements deliberate. The emptiness in her sapphire eyes mirrored the vast gardens beyond the window.

The study door groaned open to reveal Sebastian Lawson immersed in leather-bound medical texts. Sunlight streamed through stained glass, casting jewel-toned shadows across his angular features.

A glass terrarium hummed in the corner, housing an emerald basilisk that flicked its tongue at Evelyn's approach.

"Still adjusting?" Sebastian closed his book with a thud.

Evelyn's response came measured. "Day by day."

Sebastian produced a crumbling journal from his desk. The cracked leather binding whispered of decades past. "Your mother's writings. When you're ready."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her trembling fingers grazed the cover but didn't open it.

"No rush." Sebastian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Grief has no timetable."

"Uncle Sebastian." Evelyn's voice cracked like thin ice. "Was she afraid? When she knew..."

The question hung between them, heavy as the antique chandelier overhead.

Sebastian moved to the espresso machine, the grinding beans drowning out his hesitation. "Your mother never admitted fear. Not even to me."

He handed her a demitasse, the bitter aroma mingling with old parchment. "She left because she loved me too much to watch me suffer."

Evelyn cradled the tiny cup, its heat seeping into her cold palms.

"Love makes martyrs of us all," Sebastian murmured. "We sacrifice while believing it's for their good."

Nathan's face flashed behind Evelyn's eyelids - his smile, his anger, the way his hands felt tracing her spine.

Sebastian observed her carefully. "The past is quicksand, Evelyn. Your mother taught me that."

The porcelain cracked under Evelyn's grip. "I can't move forward while their killers breathe free air."

Nightmares haunted her - Richard's last embrace, Chloe's bloodied uniform, the tiny grave no one dared name. Three ghosts followed her into waking hours, their whispers louder than the living.
###Chapter 478

Sebastian scoffed. "So, what exactly can you accomplish with your current skills?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together tightly.

He studied her for a long moment before speaking slowly. "Why do you think Edmund kept those things from you? It's because he knows you're no match for those people alone. What happened in Stoslo was just their opening move."

"You know about that?" Evelyn's eyes flickered with surprise. Sebastian leaned forward, resting his hands on the table. "There's nothing in this world I don't know—including your history with the Goldmanns."

A shadow crossed Evelyn's face. She suspected Edmund must have told him.

Uncle Edmund always said he withheld information for my own good, unsure if I could handle it.

The events in Stoslo months ago had made one thing painfully clear—those people had no regard for human life.

What she had stumbled into was far more sinister than it appeared.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn set down her mug. "You've developed antibodies, haven't you? Tell me about the virus. Why does Uncle Edmund insist it's man-made?"

Sebastian didn’t bother hiding it. "You're the virus's most successful experiment. You should have never fallen ill as a child—no cancer, no disease. The results in your body are exactly what they wanted."

Her fingers trembled slightly. She stared at him, disbelief etched across her face.

He explained that when the sleeper virus first emerged, it granted the infected immunity—even fighting cancer during its one-year incubation. This discovery led to secret experiments, even after the princess incident.

The nobles lacked the courage to test it on themselves, so they turned to the slums. To them, the lives of the poor were expendable.

Later, corrupt merchants smuggled and sold what they claimed were antibody vines—but these were actually early virus prototypes.

Evelyn's voice shook. "So both outbreaks... they were just experiments?"

Sebastian didn’t deny it. "All failures. The princess's brutality backfired, making her the first victim. I met your mother during the pandemic thirty years ago—before she got infected."

"How?"

Aunt Lillian told me Mother was never exposed. How could she have contracted it?

Sebastian gazed out the window. "Your grandfather injected her with a vine. I suspect he was deceived." A chill ran down Evelyn's spine despite the warm room.

Now it all makes sense.

Why the de Armas and Goldmanns despised each other. Why the de Armas took the blame. Those puppeteers behind the scenes orchestrated everything. No wonder Grandpa looked so horrified when he learned Mother died from the virus.

Sebastian turned back, offering a faint smile. "You know everything now. What you do next is your choice."

As he rose to leave, Evelyn spoke up. "Uncle Sebastian... can you give me a new identity?"

He paused but didn’t turn. "From now on, you'll be Alice."
###Chapter 479

Three years later...

In the heart of Bassburgh, beneath a sky heavy with shadows, the neon glow of a bar flickered like a dying ember.

Lucas stepped inside, his sharp gaze sweeping across the dimly lit crowd before landing on the lone figure slumped at the counter.

Even in the hazy lighting, he recognized her instantly—Sophia Hill.

He strode forward, plucking the wine glass from her fingers before she could take another sip. Sophia blinked up at him, her vision swimming. "Why you?" she slurred, her voice thick with alcohol. "Plenty of drinks here... why steal mine?"

Her hand flailed toward the glass, but Lucas caught her wrist, his grip firm. "Evelyn's gone," he said, voice low. "And yet, here you are—three years drowning in liquor. Is this how you cope?"

At the mention of Evelyn, Sophia's face twisted. She jerked her arm free. "Why are you even here?"

Lucas set the glass down with a sharp clink. "Have you heard from her?"

Evelyn Vanderbilt had vanished after the incident three years ago. The Laurents and the de Armas had torn the world apart searching, but she had disappeared without a trace.

And Sophia—her best friend—was the only lead left.

Sophia let out a bitter laugh. "Did Nathan send you to interrogate me?" She jabbed a finger at his chest. "Do you even remember how he treated Zoe back then? Or were you all just blind?"

She shoved away from the bar, swaying dangerously. "I haven’t heard from her. If you’re so desperate, go find her yourself!"

Lucas grabbed her arm before she could stumble away. Sophia lost her balance, crashing into him. Instinctively, she shoved back. "What the hell? Trying to cop a feel?"

Lucas scoffed. "You think I’d waste my time?"

She hiccuped. "Then what do you want?"

His expression darkened. "Has Nathan sent others to ask you the same thing?"

Nathan Goldmann had become a ghost these past three years—rumors swirled of illness, of withdrawal, of a man barely clinging to life. The once-unshakable CEO of CKGOLD had retreated into shadows, just as Evelyn had.

Sophia sneered. "So what if he has?"

Then, without warning, she doubled over—and vomited all over his shoes.

Lucas went rigid, his face paling in disgust.

At the Goldmann Mansion...

The study was bathed in the dim glow of twilight, the French windows framing a man seated in a wheelchair. His suit was immaculate, his posture rigid, but his eyes—dark and hollow—betrayed the years of torment.

Oliver entered quietly, standing at his side. "Sir, Lucas has approached Ms. Hill."

Nathan didn’t look up. "I know."

Oliver hesitated. "You’ve known her whereabouts for months. Why send them after her?"

Evelyn Vanderbilt—the woman who had disappeared without a trace.

For three years, Nathan’s health had deteriorated. Even standing for too long left him coughing blood. The Goldmann empire had been managed from the shadows, his grandfather and Oliver holding the reins while Nathan remained a ghost in his own life.

And yet, despite everything, he had never stopped searching.

Oliver exhaled. "You let them believe you were dying. That you had only a year left. You handed everything over to Harrison and me... all to draw her out."

Nathan’s fingers tightened on the armrest.

Because Evelyn wasn’t just missing.

She was hiding.

And Nathan would burn the world down to find her.
###Chapter 480

"This is merely a smokescreen to convince everyone that Mr. Goldmann's schedule is completely packed these days."

"As for the Laurent family and the de Armas, they've been exhausting all resources to find Ms. Vanderbilt. Mr. Goldmann remains the sole person aware of her location yet refuses to investigate. I suspect it's not unwillingness but fear that holds him back."

Nathan's gaze turned icy, his silence speaking volumes.

Early dawn...

Sophia awoke with a skull-splitting headache. The throbbing pain made her temples pulse violently, and the harsh morning light forced her to shield her eyes with trembling fingers.

As consciousness returned, memories flooded back. She bolted upright, fingers combing through tangled locks while desperately trying to piece together last night's events.

"Finally awake?" A deep voice sliced through her confusion. Sophia whirled toward the sound, heart hammering against her ribs.

Lucas Laurent lounged on her velvet chaise, his tailored suit wrinkled from hours of waiting. His wristwatch caught the sunlight as he checked it with visible irritation. "You could sleep through an earthquake."

"Lucas Laurent!" Sophia shrieked, clutching the duvet to her chest. Her frantic gaze darted between her changed pajamas and his impassive face. "Did you—"

"Please." His lip curled. "As if I'd waste my time ogling a scarecrow like you."

"You absolute swine!" A pillow went flying toward his head.

With feline reflexes, Lucas caught it midair. Rising with effortless grace, he tossed it back onto the bed. "You vomited on my Burberry trench last night. Consider yourself lucky I didn't leave you in that alley."

Sophia's fingers dug into the sheets. "You camped in my apartment just to ask about your cousin?"

His silence confirmed her suspicion.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Why does everyone assume I'm some all-knowing oracle about Zoe's whereabouts?" Her expression hardened. "I know jackshit."

Lucas studied her for three excruciating heartbeats before straightening his cuffs. "Burn that coat. I don't want it back."

The moment the door clicked shut, Sophia exhaled shakily. She fumbled for her phone, thumbs flying across the screen.

Morwich, City of Saint Page...

"Miss Alice, I swear on my daughter's life—I never meant to betray you!" The kneeling photographer's knees left damp prints on the marble floor.

Evelyn Vanderbilt sipped jasmine tea beneath the pavilion's arched roof, sunlight glinting off the surveillance photos in her left hand. Each frame captured her in various locations around the city—evidence of meticulous stalking.

Her manicured nail tapped against a close-up of the trembling man's six-year-old daughter. "Tell me, Mr. Ramirez... how would you feel if someone took clandestine shots of your little girl?"

The photographer's throat worked soundlessly.

She set down the porcelain cup with deliberate calm. "Your client. How much did they pay you?"

"One-and-a-half million," he whispered.

Evelyn's laughter rang like shattered crystal. "How flattering. My face commands such a price." She leaned forward, shadows sharpening her delicate features. "Describe them."

"Foreigners," he stammered. "The leader—Caucasian like you, but with a strange accent—"

Her phone vibrated with an incoming message. Evelyn's fingers stilled above the screen as she read Sophia's coded text. Without looking up, she waved dismissively. "Consider your debt paid. Get out."

The photographer scrambled backward like a crab escaping boiling water. Evelyn's thumb hovered over the delete button—then decisively erased the incriminating photos. A new game had begun.
###Chapter 481

Evelyn turned to face the middle-aged man.

He had been dismissed, yet he couldn't complain. Walking away with his life intact was a blessing.

Evelyn picked up her phone, responding to Sophia’s message. Over the past three years, she had secretly kept in touch with Sophia, though she never revealed her location—only that she was abroad.

Through their exchanges, Evelyn had learned that the Laurent family and her grandfather had been searching for her relentlessly.

The children were thriving under the Goldmanns' care. Liam was being groomed as the next successor, shadowing Theodore just as Nathan once had.

But Evelyn never asked about Nathan. Why was Liam being prepared for this role so young? And why had the Goldmanns suddenly taken them in?

She sifted through a stack of photos. For three years in Morwich, she had remained unseen—no media had captured her face. The world only knew Mr. Henry had a daughter named Alice.

Now, someone was using Hanns Place employees to photograph her. Had her location been compromised?

Could it be him?

Evelyn approached the study. The two guards at the door nodded respectfully. "Ma'am."

She acknowledged them with a slight tilt of her head and pushed open the door. Inside, Sebastian was deep in conversation with another man.

The man turned, and Evelyn’s breath caught. "Uncle Edmund?"

Edmund rose with a warm smile. "It’s been too long."

Sebastian stood as well. "I was just about to tell you Edmund had returned."

Evelyn stepped forward, her lips curving slightly. "Father, am I interrupting?"

Sebastian brushed a hand over her hair, his gaze tender. "Never. Now that Edmund is here, you two should catch up. I have work to attend to."

Buttoning his suit jacket, he left the room.

Edmund studied her. "Have you been well these past three years, Zoe?"

"Yes," she replied softly. "Father has been kind—perhaps because of his love for Mother."

A thought struck her. "And you? I heard you weren’t in Zlokova. Where have you been?"

Edmund settled onto the couch. "I had unfinished business in Stoslo. Ran into some trouble."

Her pulse quickened. "What kind of trouble?"

She remembered returning to Stoslo with him—Edmund hadn’t been back then. Had something happened?

Edmund sipped his coffee, his expression unreadable. "Nothing serious. I crossed the wrong people. They wanted revenge. Luck was on my side."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. If he had truly been in danger, he wouldn’t be here now. Yet guilt pricked at her—Edmund had helped her before. Had that put him at risk?

"Zoe," Edmund said gently. "Sebastian told me what happened three years ago. I wish I’d been there."

She paused, then offered a faint smile. "It’s in the past."

"Do you know who was behind the accident?"

Her hands clenched. She would never forget the explosion that took her father and Chloe.

The only lead? The person she’d seen just before—Rosalind.
###Chapter 482

Evelyn hesitated before answering, "I can't confirm it. Before the incident, I thought I saw Rosalind, but I'm not certain if it was really her."

The name Rosalind Summers hadn't surfaced in three years. Evelyn had even sent people to investigate, but there had been no trace of her in Stoslo either.

Edmund set down his teacup and slid a photograph across the table. "I received this a year ago. Someone likely wanted me to look into it."

Evelyn studied the image—a woman in a mask and cap, standing in the crowd after the incident. The height, the build—it matched Rosalind perfectly.

Her eyes widened. "Uncle Edmund, who sent you this?"

Edmund's lips thinned. "Him."

Evelyn didn’t press further, but her expression darkened. She didn’t want to confirm whether he was the one investigating this.

Edmund studied her. "Do you hate him, Zoe?"

Hate?

Evelyn wasn’t sure. He had never given her a reason to hate him. But resentment? Yes. For breaking promises. For his cruelty. For never searching for her all these years.

Even if someone was digging into her past, she refused to believe it was him.

It could be the Goldmanns. Or her grandfather.

If it were Nathan, he would have come for her by now. If he suspected anything, he would have shown up in Morwich. But he never did.

Maybe he had moved on.

Then why investigate the incident?

For Chloe?

Yes, Chloe had died. Oliver had lost his sister. Even if Nathan didn’t care, Oliver would have demanded answers.

Seeing the turmoil in her eyes, Edmund sighed. "If you were waiting for him to come find you… it’s probably impossible now."

Probably impossible?

Evelyn stiffened, then laughed bitterly at herself. Was she still holding onto that hope?

Edmund’s voice was calm. "Because he can’t come."

Her breath hitched. "Why?"

Even after three years, she still cared. Nathan was a thorn in her heart—too painful to remove, too deep to ignore.

Edmund exhaled. "He’s sick. Rumors say it’s terminal."

"That’s impossible!" Evelyn shot to her feet. "He was fine three years ago!"

"Were you there to see it?" Edmund’s gaze was steady. "Maybe that’s why he asked for the divorce."

Evelyn froze.

She had always suspected Nathan was hiding something when he ended things so abruptly. Theodore had demanded the divorce for years, yet Nathan only agreed after returning from Stoslo.

Was he really sick?

Her voice trembled. "How did it happen?"

Edmund didn’t flinch. "He contracted it in Stoslo."

"No!" Evelyn collapsed back into her chair, face pale. "He was already shot there—how could he be sick too?"
###Chapter 483

Edmund raised a brow, his lips curling into a knowing smile. "If you ask him yourself, you might get the truth. But given your current standing, do you even care about the people from your past? For all you know, he could be a withered old man with only a few breaths left in him."

His words struck Evelyn like a sudden gust of wind, freezing her in place.

"And he was the one who demanded the divorce," Edmund continued, tilting his head. "Do you really want to reopen that door?"

Sophia was still working at the same café. The morning rush had faded, leaving only the occasional customer. She didn’t bother looking up when the bell chimed. "What can I get you?"

"Latte."

Her fingers stilled. That voice—she knew it instantly. Sophia lifted her gaze, a small smile forming when she saw Lucas standing there. "You? Here?"

His brows knitted together. "Can’t I order coffee?"

Sophia punched in the order without missing a beat. "Of course you can."

She turned to prepare the drink, her movements practiced and smooth. When she slid the cup across the counter, Lucas didn’t take it immediately.

"To go," he said flatly.

Sophia retrieved the cup and placed it in a holder. Lucas leaned against the counter, studying her. "Still no contact?"

She exhaled sharply, irritation flickering in her eyes. "No."

He lingered, watching as she handed him the coffee. Just as he reached for it, a notification lit up her phone screen beside the register.

Sophia snatched it up, glaring at him. "Are you spying on me now?"

Lucas smirked. "Why so defensive? Seeing someone?"

She scoffed, typing a quick reply. "Yes, actually. A sweet, charming guy who actually wants to be around me."

Lucas’s gaze darkened. "Then you should call off our engagement first."

Sophia didn’t even glance up. "Sure. Go tell Lillian and my father. If they agree, I’ll happily sign the papers."

He let out a dry laugh. "Why don’t you tell them?"

Their engagement had been nothing more than a political arrangement—a merger of two powerful families. Lucas hadn’t protested because, frankly, Sophia was the only one who might know where Evelyn had disappeared to.

His mother and her father had orchestrated the match. He hadn’t resisted—not because he wanted it, but because he dreaded the endless parade of socialite women who only saw his name and fortune.

Sophia was different. She didn’t cling to him. She didn’t scheme. If anything, she avoided him. And that made her the least unbearable option.

Maybe he was just lazy. Maybe he didn’t want to deal with the hassle of rejecting another dozen gold-diggers. Either way, he’d never bothered to end things.

But he knew the day would come when they’d have to make it official. And the thought of being shackled to a stranger—even one as indifferent as Sophia—left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Sophia met his gaze. "Why don’t you handle it, then?"

Lucas shrugged. "Do I look like I have that kind of power?"

She rolled her eyes. "Then stop bothering me. Go away." She turned her back to him, typing furiously.

Why is Zoe suddenly asking about Nathan?

That was the real question. Sophia hadn’t spared Nathan a thought in three years—not after what he’d done to Evelyn.

But now, the past was knocking. And she wasn’t sure if she should answer.
###Chapter 484

Sophia was about to reply when her phone was suddenly snatched away. She gasped. "Lucas, give that back!"

She lunged for it, but Lucas dodged effortlessly. Spotting her frustration, he smirked and raised the phone higher.

At 6'2", he towered over her. "Try jumping for it, short stuff," he teased, his voice dripping with amusement.

Sophia's temper flared. Without warning, she kicked his knee—hard.

Lucas staggered, caught off guard, and dropped to one knee with a sharp curse. His eyes burned with irritation as he glared up at her. "Sophia!"

She snatched her phone back and took several quick steps away, grinning triumphantly. "Maybe next time you won't underestimate me."

Lucas stood, dusting off his pants with a dark chuckle. "Fine. But remember this when you need my help." With that, he turned and stormed off.

As soon as he was gone, Sophia hurriedly typed a reply to Evelyn’s message—only to freeze when another notification popped up. Her breath hitched.

That afternoon, a rental car pulled up outside the imposing gates of the Goldmann estate. Sophia stepped out, staring up at the sprawling mansion that resembled a royal palace.

Yet despite its grandeur, the place felt eerily silent.

She exhaled sharply, frustration bubbling inside her. The Goldmann estate had always been heavily guarded, but now? It was practically a fortress.

Sure enough, a security guard intercepted her the moment she approached. "Who are you here to see, miss?"

Sophia forced a bright smile. "I need to speak with Mr. Goldmann."

The guard’s expression turned skeptical.

She quickly amended, "Or Oliver Lawson, if that’s easier."

If she couldn’t see Nathan, maybe his assistant would do.

The guards exchanged glances. One pressed a finger to his earpiece and murmured something before turning back to her. "Your name?"

"Sophia Hill."

The man stepped aside, speaking low into his comm. "Mr. Lawson, a Ms. Sophia Hill is here to see you."

Oliver paused, glancing at Nathan, who sat at his desk, impeccably dressed, his focus never wavering from the documents in front of him.

No reaction.

Oliver hesitated, then spoke into the comm. "I’ll handle it."

He descended the grand staircase moments later, finding Sophia waiting just inside the gates. "What brings you here, Ms. Hill?"

Sophia fidgeted, suddenly awkward. "I, uh… just wanted to check on Mr. Goldmann. How is he?"

Oliver’s eyes narrowed. "Did Evelyn send you?"

Sophia stiffened, her face betraying her guilt. "No! I just… wanted to know."

Oliver saw right through her. He exhaled sharply. "Tell Evelyn to stop asking about Mr. Goldmann."

Sophia’s jaw clenched. "You’re right. They’re divorced. It’s not like she cares if he lives or dies. I shouldn’t have come."

She spun on her heel and marched away, fists clenched.

Evelyn didn’t need to know anything.
###Chapter 485

Sophia was about to leave when Oliver suddenly spoke. "Mr. Goldmann has his reasons."

She paused mid-step and turned back, but Oliver had already disappeared into the house. Inside the study, Nathan stood by the window, lost in thought. The air around him turned icy, a chill so palpable Oliver felt it the moment he reached the door.

"Mr. Goldmann, Ms. Hill has left," Oliver announced.

Nathan gave a slight nod, his focus unbroken.

Oliver hesitated, frowning when Nathan didn’t inquire further. "Aren’t you going to ask why she came?"

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable, but his fingers tightened into a fist on his thigh, his gaze cold. "It doesn’t matter anymore."

Oliver studied him but said nothing. The lie was obvious. Anyone could see how much Evelyn meant to him—how she was the one person he cherished above all else.

If it truly didn’t matter, he wouldn’t have spent the last three years digging into her past, scouring the world for any trace of her. He wouldn’t have sent operatives to Morwich.

The truth was, Nathan hadn’t gone looking for her himself because he feared what he might do if they met face-to-face.

Just then, Oliver’s phone rang. His expression shifted as he listened. "You’re certain?"

The confirmation came through, and Nathan finally turned his attention to him. "What is it?"

Oliver lowered the phone. "It’s the de Armas. Something’s happened."

Nathan closed the file in front of him, his brow furrowing. "Details."

Oliver relayed the report. "Our intel confirms Harrison was ambushed. He’s missing. Roger’s faction is already moving to seize control of the de Armas estate. It appears he’s backing the Kents."

Ever since Harrison had uncovered the conspiracy and manipulation behind Evelyn’s disappearance, he had been locked in a brutal power struggle with the Kents. The feud between the two noble houses had turned Stoslo into a battleground.

Harrison had been systematically dismantling the Kents’ influence. But as key allies of Prince Reginald, their downfall would weaken his standing within the royal court.

Now, with the election looming, Reginald was desperate. If the de Armas fell, the Goldmanns would lose a critical ally—and Stoslo’s political landscape would shift irreversibly.

Nathan’s lips pressed into a thin line. "The Stoslo election is this year, isn’t it?"

Oliver nodded. "Yes. Are you thinking—?"

Nathan’s eyes darkened. He could see Reginald’s play clearly now. "His preferred candidate needs the de Armas’ vote. If Harrison is… unavailable, and someone else takes his place?"

Oliver’s breath caught. If that happened, Reginald would effectively control the government. Stoslo would be at his mercy.

Nathan turned back to the window, his gaze distant but resolute. "Book me a flight to Stoslo."

Oliver stiffened. "But your condition—"

Nathan tapped the desk once, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Do it."

With a reluctant nod, Oliver left. The moment the door closed, Nathan exhaled, his reflection in the glass looking more like a ghost than a man.

Meanwhile, in Morwich…

Night had fallen over Saint Page. The Hanns Place stood like a black pearl amidst the city’s glittering expanse, its windows glowing from within.

In the brightly lit study, Sebastian requested Evelyn’s presence.

She entered, her voice steady. "You wanted to see me, Father?"
###Chapter 486

Sebastian set the document aside, his piercing gaze meeting Evelyn's. "Your grandfather is facing serious difficulties. Do you wish to return and assess the situation at the de Arma estate?"

Evelyn froze. "What's happened?"

Harrison de Arma remained her sole blood relative in this world. How could he possibly be in danger?

Sebastian gave a solemn nod. "The Royal left-wing faction has targeted your grandfather. With the de Arma family currently in disarray, they've seized this opportunity to claim their territories. I suspect this move aims to prevent his interference in the upcoming election."

Stoslo conducted presidential elections every six years, with neither royalty nor government permitted involvement. Perhaps Reginald's government alliance sought to bolster his influence—or perhaps his ambitions extended beyond the throne to all of Stoslo.

When Evelyn remained silent, Sebastian spoke again, measured. "The choice is yours. I won't compel you."

"I'll go," Evelyn declared, resolve hardening her features. "Though I want nothing from the de Armas, I won't let others steal what's rightfully theirs."

A faint smile touched Sebastian's lips. "Very well. Sadie will accompany you."

With a gesture, he summoned his aide. Evelyn's eyes widened at the androgynous figure who appeared.

"Sir," the person acknowledged.

Evelyn turned to Sebastian incredulously. "Is that a girl or boy?"

Sadie's youthful face and masculine attire created striking contrast. Though Evelyn knew nothing of Sadie's past, the weight of untold stories lingered in those world-weary eyes.

Sebastian chuckled. "Sadie's been my most trusted companion since age fifteen. Her skills are unmatched. With her representing me, I can rest assured. My people will meet you upon arrival."

Three days later...

Evelyn and Sadie touched down in Stoslo. When Evelyn's feet met Zena's soil again, an inexplicable tremor ran through her, unsettling emotions churning in her gut.

Their escorts arrived promptly. A man approached deferentially. "Ms. Alice? Mr. Henry sent us to receive you."

Evelyn nodded, entering the vehicle with Sadie.

As the car pulled away, unnoticed, a man in the adjacent vehicle lowered his window, withdrawing his surveillance.

Nathan adjusted his Bluetooth earpiece, amber eyes scanning the data streaming across his tablet.

Oliver turned from the passenger seat after ending his call. "Mr. Goldmann, our sources confirm Mr. Henry's operatives have entered Stoslo. Could Metropolis be involved in this affair?"

Oliver's confusion mirrored Nathan's own. The shadowy Metropolis organization wielded unprecedented influence across Morwich's underworld and law enforcement. Mr. Henry's ties to Morwich's royal family and government granted him near-regal authority.

Though they'd traced Evelyn to Saint Page, locating her in that vast city proved impossible—especially if Edmund had hidden her somewhere as formidable as Metropolis. Rumors swirled about Mr. Henry adopting his late lover's daughter, though media knew nothing of her appearance. His obsessive protection ensured no leaks from Hanns Place.

Initial suspicions about her paternity were disproven when Mr. Henry publicly released DNA results—Evelyn remained Richard's biological daughter, eliminating blood ties to Mr. Henry. His sudden interest in Stoslo raised alarming questions.

Nathan's brow furrowed deeply as he stared through the window. The light in his amber eyes dimmed to smoldering embers.
###Chapter 487

The sleek black sedan rolled to a silent halt before the towering gates of Easton Estate.

Endless fields of irises stretched across the landscape, their purple blooms swaying gently in the breeze - planted years ago by Sebastian himself.

Evelyn stepped onto the cobblestone driveway, her heels clicking against the stone. "Mr. Donovan acquired Easton Estate during his last business trip to Stoslo," her escort informed her. "Every staff member here answers directly to him. You need only ask."

She gave a curt nod as a uniformed maid ushered her into the grand manor. The interior design mirrored Hanns Place's opulence - gilded moldings, crystal chandeliers, and imported marble floors that spoke of extravagant wealth.

Settling into a velvet armchair, Evelyn fixed her gaze on the intelligence officer. "Tell me what you know about the de Arma family's current situation."

"The de Armas?" The man hesitated briefly. "They've been locked in a power struggle with the Kents for years. Recently, Harrison disappeared mysteriously. Reginald's faction seized the opportunity to claim several de Arma territories. Their organization is in complete disarray."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the armrest as fragments of Sebastian's revelations resurfaced. The sleeper virus that had infected her mother... the secret experiments conducted by noble families... the manufactured feud between the Goldmanns and de Armas.

None of it had been real. Not her great-grandfather severing Harrison's leg. Not Harrison kidnapping Nathan's mother. Just pawns in someone else's deadly game.

Now Harrison had uncovered the truth - hence his relentless attacks on the Kent family, the left-wing faction's strongest pillar. And her own staged death three years ago? Another move in their endless chess match.

A porcelain teacup appeared before her. "Ms. Alice," the officer ventured cautiously, "are you planning to intervene on the de Armas' behalf?"

Evelyn lifted the cup, watching steam curl from its surface. "My mother was a de Arma. I intend to reclaim what's rightfully theirs... and find my grandfather."

The man inclined his head. "Whenever you're ready, we have operatives standing by."

"Tonight," Evelyn said decisively, setting down her untouched tea. "We move tonight."

Moonlight glinted off the harbor waters as five armed guards patrolled Zephyr Dock. A sudden flare of light in the distance drew three men away to investigate.

Silenced shots rang out. The remaining guards collapsed before they could raise their weapons, dragged swiftly into shadow.

At the flare's origin, the investigating guards found only burning trash. As they exchanged confused glances, their third companion vanished without a sound.

Two figures emerged from the darkness. Precise strikes snapped their necks before they could scream.

Weapons collected, the shadowy team advanced toward the cargo ship where raucous laughter and card games echoed across the deck.

One player suddenly stilled. "Did you hear that?"

Another waved dismissively. "Go check it out."

The designated guard grabbed his rifle and disappeared into the night. Minutes ticked by with no return.

Nervous murmurs spread as the remaining men scrambled to their feet. The deck appeared deserted until a voice called down from above: "Looking for someone?"

Black-clad figures rained down from the ship's rigging before the guards could react. Within moments, Reginald's men stationed at the former de Arma territory lay unconscious or subdued.

The ambush had begun.
###Chapter 488

At Reginald’s mansion—

A sharp crash echoed from the study as a porcelain cup shattered against the marble floor. The silver-haired man stood rigid, his towering frame casting a long shadow. His piercing turquoise eyes burned with the intensity of a predator.

"Useless fools!" His voice was a low growl. "Have you uncovered who dared to strike against us?"

The middle-aged man before him bowed his head. "Your Highness, we have yet to identify the perpetrators. However, the method—leaving no survivors—matches the work of that woman from the Metropolis."

The name hung heavy in the air. Sadie.

Henry’s right hand, Sadie, was infamous for her merciless efficiency. Even men like Philip Goldmann, known for their brutality, paled in comparison. Where Philip might toy with his prey, Sadie ensured none walked away alive.

Her involvement was a declaration—Henry himself had stepped into the fray.

Reginald’s knuckles whitened, veins bulging beneath his skin. "Damn them! Since when does the Metropolis meddle in the affairs of the de Arma family? Investigate immediately! I want confirmation—is this Henry’s doing?"

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit room—

Oliver Lawson entered, followed by another man. The only illumination came from a single lamp beside the computer. Nathan Goldmann lounged in a high-backed chair, clad in a silk robe, a half-empty glass of wine dangling from his fingers.

"Mr. Goldmann," Oliver began, "Reginald’s forces occupying the de Arma territory have been wiped out."

Nathan’s fingers stilled over the keyboard. Shadows obscured half his face, masking his expression. He leaned back, tapping the desk with deliberate slowness. "By whom?"

Oliver glanced at the man beside him, who answered, "Evidence points to the Metropolis. Clean kills—no wasted movements, no defensive wounds. Every target was eliminated in a single strike."

A pause. Then, "It was an ambush. No signs of struggle. They never had a chance to fight back."

Oliver frowned. The Metropolis operated with brutal transparency—why resort to stealth now? And why target Reginald? Unless…

His gaze flicked to Nathan, but the man’s face remained unreadable. After a weighted silence, Nathan finally spoke. "Who did Henry send?"

The man didn’t hesitate. "It had to be Sadie. No one else in the Metropolis is that precise—or that ruthless."

Oliver’s jaw tightened. Sadie was a force of nature. Even if Harrison, Oliver, and every member of Night Banquet attacked her at once, victory wasn’t guaranteed.

Henry was an enigma, surrounded by monsters like Edmund and Sadie. Crossing him was suicide.

A thought struck Oliver. "Sadie never leaves Henry’s side. Why send her to Stoslo? What’s his connection to the de Armas?"

The man hesitated, then added, "There’s more. Reports mention a woman—Alice—traveling with Henry’s team to Stoslo."

"Alice?"

Oliver’s breath hitched. His eyes snapped to Nathan.

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "Has she been seen since arriving?"

The man shook his head. "No sightings. She’s vanished."

Nathan’s fingers curled around his glass. The silence stretched, thick with tension. Finally, he gestured dismissively. "Leave us."

As the door clicked shut, Oliver exhaled. The game had just gotten far more dangerous.
###Chapter 489

Nathan Goldmann's gaze remained fixed on the computer screen. The sparse information displayed about "Alice" frustrated him—no photograph, barely any details.

His phone buzzed. A message from Wesley Donovan, an old friend still in Stoslo.

Several days ago...

The refusal of Mr. Henry's daughter, Alice Henry, to meet Prince Reginald's representatives had sparked outrage.

On one side stood the daughter of a man whose influence rivaled the royal family's in Morwich. On the other, a prince of Stoslo. Few dared snub royalty so blatantly.

Though, to be fair, Alice hadn't rejected the royal family's formal invitation—only the prince's presumptuous demands.

The grand white parlor glittered under crystal chandeliers. Maids stood at attention, serving tea with practiced grace. Queen Annabelle, in her fifties, carried herself with the poise of the Miller bloodline. Her amber eyes held a familiarity that unsettled Evelyn.

This wasn't Evelyn's first royal audience. Nine years ago, as the designer Zara, she'd met the queen's daughter to discuss a Victorian-style tiara for her wedding.

But facing Queen Annabelle directly was different. The woman radiate elegance—and something sharper beneath.

"You remind me of someone, Ms. Alice."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her teacup. "Oh?"

"Lord Harrison's granddaughter."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "How observant. She was my mother."

Queen Annabelle's cup clinked against its saucer. "You're Harrison's blood?"

Evelyn nodded.

"Now I understand why you're helping him." The queen set her tea aside.

Evelyn's jaw clenched. After a beat, she asked, "What do you know?"

Annabelle's laugh was light, almost mocking. "Everything my uncle does. The de Armas were once our most loyal supporters. After Harrison's father died? They withdrew completely."

A shadow crossed the queen's face. Evelyn stayed silent. These royal confidences weren't meant for outsiders—yet Annabelle kept talking.

The palace's gilded facade hid rot. Power struggles consumed them all, royalty or not.

Annabelle wasn't idle. She simply lacked Reginald's resources.

Evelyn emerged into the palace gardens where Sadie waited.

"Miss, Mr. Henry insists you attend tonight's banquet. It's critical—the Ashton Group's new president, Wesley Donovan, will be there. His father sits in Stoslo's congress. With elections coming, Reginald will court him aggressively. If you want to aid the de Armas, you must secure Donovan first."

"Partnership?" Evelyn arched a brow.

Sadie nodded. "Donovan's integrity makes him pivotal. Reginald plans to stack the government with loyalists. Mr. Henry believes—"

"I've offended the prince already," Evelyn mused. Her repeated refusals had been deliberate provocations.

Reginald's restraint puzzled her. Sebastian's protection? Possibly.

But Evelyn wasn't waiting passively. She needed Reginald arrogant, overconfident—vulnerable.

Her grandfather remained missing. Yet having entered this game, retreat wasn't an option.

Forward was the only path left.
###Chapter 490

The Donovan Group hosted an extravagant gala in the grand ballroom of the St. Regis Hotel to celebrate their remarkable resurgence.

Why such fanfare for the Donovan Group's revival? Everyone knew the company had been a Stoslo institution for six decades. But after the previous chairman declared bankruptcy during the economic downturn, no one dared touch the failing empire.

That changed when Wesley Donovan stepped in. After acquiring majority shares and assuming the chairman role, he single-handedly resurrected the corporate giant. When pressed by journalists about his motivation, Wesley simply mentioned working there during university summers. The Donovan Group held sentimental value, he claimed, making its potential demise unacceptable.

Whether truth or clever PR, the results spoke for themselves. Under Wesley's leadership, Donovan Group's market value skyrocketed 70% within a year, securing its position as the nation's second-largest corporation. All eyes were now on this phoenix rising from ashes.

Wesley extended invitations to his extensive network across industries. When Evelyn Vanderbilt received Mr. Henry's gilt-edged invitation on her phone, she knew she'd be attending as his representative.

The cavernous ballroom buzzed with elite guests mingling before the formal proceedings. Between discussions of market trends and corporate gossip, one topic dominated conversations - the enigmatic daughter of the infamous Mr. Henry.

Though Mr. Henry operated in Morwich's underworld, his influence rivaled royalty. His recent foray into legitimate business had amassed staggering wealth. And now, whispers circulated about his newly adopted heir.

"Imagine marrying into that fortune," one socialite murmured behind her champagne flute.

"Don't waste your fantasies," her companion scoffed. "With his status, she'll undoubtedly wed nobility. Though it's curious she declined Prince Reginald's invitation while in Stoslo..."

Their gossip halted abruptly when the massive oak doors swung open. All heads turned toward the late arrival.

A striking figure dominated the entrance. The woman's burgundy pantsuit clung to her curves, the plunging neckline of her chiffon blouse showcasing a blood-red ruby pendant. Cropped trousers revealed slender ankles, while stiletto heels added commanding height.

Her raven hair swept into a sleek ponytail, the upper half of her face obscured by an ornate gold mask that caught the chandelier's glow.

Four attendants trailed behind - three Morwich natives easily recognized, and the fourth, a sharp-featured woman with cropped hair. The crowd immediately identified her as Sadie, Mr. Henry's infamous right hand.

Which meant...

This masked vision must be Alice.

Even through the disguise, her aristocratic bearing was unmistakable.

Evelyn moved with panther-like grace across the marble floor, her heels clicking a steady rhythm. Light refracted off her mask, scattering diamond-like sparks through the room.

Wesley paused mid-conversation, his wine glass frozen halfway to his lips as he registered her approach.

Without hesitation, Evelyn extended a gloved hand. "Mr. Donovan, what a pleasure. I'm Alice."

Wesley's lips curved into a practiced smile. Passing his drink to an aide, he grasped her hand firmly. "Ms. Alice, your reputation precedes you. Has Mr. Henry sent you as his emissary?"

"Indeed." Evelyn's voice carried the perfect blend of warmth and detachment. "My father requested I attend in his stead and deliver his personal congratulations." From Sadie, she accepted an ornate box. "A small token of his esteem."

The crowd leaned in collectively, breath held, as Wesley lifted the lid. Inside lay something that made even the unflappable CEO's eyes widen fractionally. The game, Evelyn knew, had just begun.
###Chapter 491

The moment Evelyn stopped speaking, a sharply dressed man emerged from behind her carrying an ornate silver case. He stepped forward with practiced elegance and opened the lid to reveal a delicate Nine Dragon jade cup resting on velvet lining.

Everyone in attendance knew Wesley Donovan's legendary obsession with Victorian-era artifacts - a passion so intense he'd once bankrupted a competitor at auction to obtain a single teacup.

Wesley's eyes lit up with genuine delight. "Please convey my deepest gratitude to Mr. Henry. This gift is truly magnificent." He gestured for an attendant to receive the precious artifact.

Evelyn accepted a champagne flute from a passing waiter and raised it toward their host. Crystal clinked against crystal as glasses met.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. "So she really is Alice Henry?"

"Why the mask though? Some disfigurement perhaps?"

"Mr. Henry guards his daughter's privacy fiercely. Not even the paparazzi have gotten a clear photo. Always that damned mask."

Evelyn ignored the whispers, steering the conversation toward business. "Mr. Donovan, regarding our proposed partnership-"

Wesley chuckled, cutting her off. "Ms. Henry, I'm afraid you're too late. The Ashton Group has already committed to another investor."

Her grip tightened imperceptibly on the champagne flute, though her expression remained perfectly composed. "How unfortunate. Might I inquire who secured this opportunity before me?"

"An old friend from Zlokova," Wesley said without hesitation. "Mr. Goldmann and I reached an agreement earlier this evening."

The name struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Her breath caught as Wesley gestured across the room. "Ah, here he comes now."

Evelyn turned slowly, her champagne flute trembling slightly. The sight that greeted her sent ice through her veins.

Nathan sat in a wheelchair, his once-familiar features now sharper, more angular with time. The black tailored suit accentuated his broad shoulders, giving him an air of dangerous elegance. A team of black-suited bodyguards maintained a protective perimeter while Oliver pushed the wheelchair.

The mask might fool strangers, but not those who'd known her intimately.

Oliver's eyes widened in recognition. Evelyn Vanderbilt stood before them in disguise.

Wesley made introductions. "Mr. Goldmann, allow me to present Ms. Alice Henry, daughter of the renowned Mr. Henry."

All eyes locked onto Evelyn, especially Oliver's, which burned with unanswered questions.

Nathan's gaze flickered momentarily before his usual icy composure returned. Evelyn steadied herself, offering a polite smile. "Mr. Goldmann. I've heard much about your business acumen."

Her tone carried the polite detachment of strangers, belying their shared history.

The corner of Nathan's mouth twitched. "Have you now? I'm flattered."

That voice - deep and resonant - sent unwelcome memories flooding back. Nights spent wrapped in those velvet tones, whispered endearments, promises broken.

Evelyn shoved the recollections aside, turning to set down her glass. A waiter bumped her elbow abruptly, sending champagne cascading down her silk sleeve.
###Chapter 492

Sadie gasped. "Madam!"

The waiter bowed repeatedly, his face pale with panic. "I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!"

Evelyn swiftly pulled out a handkerchief, dabbing at the spilled wine on her sleeve. A calm smile curved her lips. "It's nothing serious. You may go."

Nathan observed her with an unreadable expression. "I anticipated such an incident and had a gown prepared. It should suit you perfectly, Ms. Vanderbilt. The banquet is far from over, after all."

His words held an unspoken command—she wasn’t leaving yet.

Wesley chuckled, stepping closer. "Indeed, Ms. Vanderbilt is my honored guest. I can’t have her attending in stained attire. It would reflect poorly on my hospitality."

Evelyn met his gaze, then inclined her head. "Then I’ll take you up on your offer, Mr. Donovan."

She motioned for Sadie to accompany her to the guest room. She trusted no one else to stand guard.

Sadie remained outside, arms crossed, as Nathan’s assistant delivered the gown. She passed it through the door without a word.

Inside, Evelyn unclasped the ruby pendant and shrugged off her burgundy suit.

Her mind drifted to Nathan’s appearance—frail, confined to a wheelchair. Edmund’s warning echoed in her ears: He’s gravely ill. A shadow flickered in her eyes.

She unfolded the gown from its purple box.

Her breath hitched.

Dark green silk, delicate tulle overlaying the back—almost identical to the dress she’d worn to the Bouchers’ gala three years ago.

How did he—

Her fingers tightened around the fabric.

As she slipped it on, the lights abruptly died.

Not just the room. The entire corridor plunged into darkness.

"Sadie!" she called.

"Checking the circuit!" Sadie’s voice faded as she hurried away.

Evelyn’s eyes adjusted quickly. She stepped out—this was no accident.

A figure materialized from the shadows, yanking her against a solid chest.

She froze.

The scent of Gi cologne—warm, intoxicating, achingly familiar—wrapped around her.

Then his lips crashed onto hers.

The kiss was feverish, desperate, leaving no room for resistance.

For a heartbeat, she melted into it.

Then reality snapped back.

She shoved him away, arm swinging—

Crack!

The slap echoed in the darkness.

Light flooded the hallway.

A red mark bloomed across Nathan’s pale cheek.

Evelyn’s hand trembled. She hadn’t struck with full force. She couldn’t.

"Madam!" Sadie sprinted back, gaze sharpening at the sight of Nathan. She positioned herself between them, a human shield. "Sir, step back."

Her tone left no room for argument.

To Evelyn, she murmured, "Someone tampered with the main switch. Are you hurt?"

Sadie had gambled by leaving—Evelyn wasn’t one to cower in a dark room.

But seeing Nathan here? The trap became clear.

Lure the bodyguard away. Get to Evelyn.

Nathan’s lips quirked. "Mr. Vanderbilt chose well. Your protector is... thorough."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Resorting to cheap tricks, Mr. Goldmann? I expected better."
###Chapter 493

Nathan chuckled, his deep gaze piercing through her. "You wouldn't have stepped out if you didn't want to see me."

The moment Evelyn had chosen to leave the safety of the room, it was a silent admission—she wanted this encounter as much as he did.

The security at Mr. Donovan’s banquet is among the strictest in the city. And as Richard Vanderbilt’s daughter, who would dare lay a finger on me so recklessly?

But then again, he’s always been audacious. He did it without hesitation.

Her pulse quickened. She had known the power outage was deliberate. She had suspected it was him.

Evelyn scoffed. "Still as shameless as ever, Mr. Goldmann."

Nathan didn’t deny it. His silence was confirmation enough.

She didn’t want to linger in his presence any longer. Turning to Sadie, she said, "Let’s go downstairs."

Sadie nodded, casting a wary glance at Nathan before following closely behind Evelyn.

Then, his voice, low and commanding, stopped her in her tracks.

"If you’re considering a partnership with Wesley, you might as well choose me instead."

Evelyn froze.

Nathan closed the distance between them, standing beside her now. "I think you’ll agree—for the sake of the de Armas family."

Without waiting for a response, he strode ahead, leaving her standing there.

Her fingers unclenched slowly. The ghost of his touch still lingered on her lips—his scent, his breath, the heat of him.

Could she forget the man who had walked away from her over a thousand days ago?

No.

She had never forgotten.

Nathan Goldmann was like an addiction—one taste, and she was ensnared. She couldn’t stop thinking about him, couldn’t suppress the urge to reach for him. And now, after that kiss, she was lost in a haze of memories.

Ridiculous.

When she returned to the banquet hall, Nathan was already seated in his wheelchair, composed and unreadable, conversing with Wesley and a group of foreign investors.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

He doesn’t look sick at all. So why the wheelchair? Is this an act, or is there something I don’t know?

"Ms. Vanderbilt, you’re back." Wesley’s gaze settled on her, appreciative. "That gown suits you perfectly. A gift from Mr. Goldmann?"

Even behind the mask, her elegance was undeniable. The way the fabric draped over her figure, the way the light caught the emerald silk—she was mesmerizing.

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Yes. Mr. Goldmann has been… generous."

Nathan lifted his wine glass slightly. "Glad you like it, Ms. Vanderbilt."

As the ball commenced, Wesley extended his hand. "May I have this dance?"

She didn’t refuse. Placing her hand in his, she let him lead her onto the floor.

They moved in perfect sync, their steps fluid beneath the shimmering chandeliers. To the onlookers, Evelyn was a vision—graceful, untouchable, a goddess woven into the rhythm of the waltz.

Three years ago, she had been the same dazzling presence at the Bouchers’ gala.

Oliver watched Nathan carefully. Though his expression remained impassive, his gaze darkened as it followed Evelyn across the dance floor.

When the music ended, applause erupted around them.

Evelyn inclined her head. "I’ll remember this dance, Mr. Donovan. But I must take my leave now."

Wesley didn’t press her. "Until next time, then."

She left swiftly with Sadie, not once looking back.

But she could feel his eyes burning into her.

In the car, Sadie finally spoke. "You know him, don’t you?"

Evelyn hesitated, then let out a humorless laugh. "You could say that."

We were married. We had children together.

How did we end up like this?

The East Ind Vi’s courtyard was aglow with lights, but the grandeur felt hollow—a beautiful shell without a soul.
###Chapter 494

The amber glow of the desk lamp cast long shadows across Nathan Goldmann's study as he massaged his temples. The door creaked open, revealing Oliver Lawson carrying a steaming mug.

"Your chamomile tea, sir."

Three years of insomnia had left Nathan dependent on sleeping aids. The porcelain cup warmed his palms as he stared at the swirling steam.

"Should I investigate Ms. Vanderbilt's connection to Mr. Henry?" Oliver ventured. "Including... the paternity test results?"

Nathan's gaze darkened. "Unnecessary. I've pieced together her ties to the de Armas family."

The puzzle had become clear - why Edmund Lincoln had served Miranda de Arma all those years, why he'd protected Evelyn so fiercely.

Nathan tapped a white pill onto his palm but hesitated. Oliver observed his employer closely. "Ms. Vanderbilt provoked Reginald immediately upon arriving in Stoslo. Her appearance at Mr. Donovan's gala tonight was clearly strategic."

An enigmatic smile played on Nathan's lips. "Neither of them anticipated I'd already secured Wesley Donovan's allegiance."

Not just Reginald, but Mr. Henry would be blindsided too. The realization warmed Nathan more than the tea. He swallowed the pill dry, anticipation for their inevitable reunion acting as stronger sedative than any pharmaceutical.

Across the city, Evelyn Vanderbilt tossed in her silk sheets. Sleep proved elusive as Nathan's image haunted her behind closed eyelids. She flung off the covers and padded to the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Moonlight sculpted her silhouette in silver as she pressed her forehead against the cool glass. Her phone chimed with a message from Sebastian - it would be evening in Morwich now.

[Heard someone beat you to Wesley Donovan?]

Evelyn smirked. Sadie had obviously briefed him. [Disappointed?] she typed back.

[You've done remarkably well given the circumstances.] His response carried unexpected warmth. [Reginald failed too. The game continues.]

Another message followed: [My team's closing in on your grandfather's location. Get some rest - I prefer my daughters without panda eyes.]

Evelyn's laughter died as quickly as it came. She gazed at the fog-smudged moon, wondering what life might've been had fate dealt different cards.

Meanwhile, Nathan's phone buzzed with an unknown caller ID. He answered on the first ring, voice rough with anticipation. "Hello?"

Evelyn's grip tightened around her device. That voice - unchanged after all these years. She'd dialed his old number on impulse, never expecting...

"Dammit," she muttered. Of all the things to remember perfectly.

"Knew you'd call," Nathan murmured after her prolonged silence, amusement coloring his tone.

Evelyn's teeth grazed her lower lip. "How'd you know it was me, Mr. Goldmann?" She'd changed numbers twice since they'd last spoken.

"Intuition," came the simple reply. Three years of keeping the same contact information, three years of waiting for this moment.

Evelyn exhaled through her nose. "About your partnership proposal - what's your angle?"

"Let's discuss it in person," Nathan countered smoothly.

Following his coordinates, Evelyn arrived at East Ind Vi with Sadie and two armored escorts. The moon hung low over the industrial district, painting the warehouses in monochrome. Somewhere in the shadows, Nathan Goldmann waited.
###Chapter 495

Evelyn instructed the two bodyguards to wait outside the grand entrance before stepping into the VIP lounge with Sadie.

Nathan was already seated in the lounge, his piercing gaze locking onto her the moment she entered. "You're here."

His attention shifted briefly to Sadie, his tone firm. "Mr. Goldmann requested that you come alone."

Evelyn paused mid-step, exchanging a glance with Sadie. "Wait for me here. I'll be fine."

Sadie hesitated, her jaw tightening, but she didn't argue. Still, her sharp eyes tracked Evelyn’s every movement as she ascended the stairs.

Quincy—no, Oliver—cast her an amused smirk. "I’ve heard you’re quite the fighter, Ms. Sadie. Maybe you could teach me a thing or two when you have time?"

Sadie barely spared him a glance, her voice flat. "Only if you’ve got a death wish."

Oliver choked on his own laughter.

When Evelyn pushed open the study door, Nathan stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows, dressed in nothing but a crisp white shirt. His broad shoulders were as imposing as ever, yet something about his stance seemed… lonely.

He didn’t turn around, but his voice cut through the silence like a blade. "How have you been these past three years?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, her tone deliberately cool. "Mr. Goldmann, I assumed this meeting was to discuss our business partnership. Yet your first question is personal?"

Nathan finally turned, his dark eyes burning into hers. "Answer me. How have you been?"

A humorless smile curved her lips. "Wonderful. Free. Happy."

His response was immediate. "I haven’t been."

Evelyn’s fingers twitched at her sides, her pulse betraying her.

Nathan closed the distance between them in three strides. When she instinctively stepped back, he caged her against the wall, one arm braced beside her head, the other wrapping around her waist.

The scent of him—sandalwood and something uniquely him—flooded her senses, dizzying.

"Zoe," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "I missed you."

Her lashes fluttered.

He missed her?

After everything? After he was the one who pushed her away?

A cold laugh escaped her. "You don’t get to say that, Nathan Goldmann."

His silence was heavy, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "You filed for divorce. You left. And now you’re telling me you regret it?"

Nathan’s lips curved, but there was no humor in it. "I never signed the papers."

Her breath hitched.

What?

His thumb brushed her cheek. "We’re still married, Zoe."

The words slammed into her like a physical blow.

She shoved against his chest, but he didn’t budge. "After three years of separation, our marriage is effectively over."

Nathan’s grip on her wrist tightened. "Not unless I say it is."

"You’re unbelievable!"

"Yes," he agreed, his voice rough. "I am."

Evelyn stared at him, stunned.

Nathan exhaled slowly. "Do you know why I never came to Morwich to find you?"

She said nothing.

"Because I was afraid," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

Evelyn’s pulse roared in her ears.

Afraid?

Nathan Goldmann was afraid?

His fingers traced her wrist, sending shivers down her spine. "Afraid that if I saw you, I wouldn’t be able to let you go again."
###Chapter 496

Nathan smiled, but there was an undercurrent of sorrow in his expression. His voice was barely above a whisper as he confessed, "I was terrified that I'd lose control if I saw you again—just like I did yesterday."

He stepped forward, blocking her path. "Zoe, if you hadn't shown up today, I would have lost it completely and hunted you down. But you came."

For three years, Nathan had relied on sheer willpower to suppress his emotions. He had fooled the world—but never himself.

Evelyn's grip on the file loosened slightly, her long lashes veiling the storm in her eyes. After a tense silence, she withdrew her hand. "We should focus on discussing our partnership."

Nathan lowered his gaze, a faint smile playing on his lips as he walked to the desk and picked up a folder. "Here’s the list of candidates. Wesley gave it to me."

Evelyn froze. "Why would he hand it to you?"

For a fleeting moment, she reverted to her old self—sharp, guarded. Even if this was strictly business, Nathan found solace in that familiar fire.

He moved closer, extending the file toward her. "Because his concerns align with ours."

Evelyn took it, scanning the names. Wesley Donovan was among them.

"Mr. Donovan is running for president?" Shock rippled through her. Hadn't he just taken over Ashton Group?

Nathan nodded. "Mr. Henry must have mentioned his background. His family has always been in politics. His grandfather was elected president two terms ago but was assassinated within three years."

Evelyn studied him. When it came to work, Nathan slipped effortlessly into his usual composed demeanor—serious, restrained. "Wesley knew his grandfather’s death wasn’t just an accident. That’s why he’s spent years pretending to be nothing more than a reckless businessman."

Nathan glanced up, catching her intense gaze. Deliberately—or perhaps not—he closed the distance between them. "Do you have a question?"

His face filled her vision, snapping her back to reality. She averted her eyes, feigning calm. "So that’s why Mr. Donovan is working with you?"

Nathan’s lips curved. "Yes."

Evelyn’s ears burned, just like they used to. Despite the years, some things never changed. She had grown sharper, more polished—but the core of her remained.

She could feel his eyes on her. Swallowing hard, she forced her voice steady. "Then why involve me? You and Wesley are already collaborating. Neither Reginald nor I could secure a deal with him."

Nathan’s gaze softened. "Because I can’t show my face. I still need you."

"Couldn’t Mr. Donovan handle it?"

"Wesley’s position is too precarious. But you—you’re Alice." His tone dropped, intimate.

Evelyn stiffened, refusing to meet his eyes. She took a step back, but his arms encircled her, spinning her into a hold she knew too well.

"Nathan, let me go!" She struggled.

"Stop fighting, Zoe." He buried his face in her shoulder, his voice thick with desperation as he held her tighter.

Something in his tone made her freeze.

She gritted her teeth. "Is this why you called me here? To use business as an excuse to manhandle me? Don’t forget—none of your men stand a chance against Sadie. I swear I’ll—"

"You won’t." Nathan nuzzled against her, his breath warm against her ear. "You’d never let her hurt me."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, bitterness twisting her expression. "Still so arrogant, Nathan."
###Chapter 497

Was Nathan willing to gamble on this? He'd already won the bet regardless.

Evelyn would never have allowed Sadie to hurt him. If Nathan's obsessive need to cling to her was problematic, what did that make her? She wanted to let go but couldn't - wasn't that equally troubling?

The man behind her chuckled darkly. "It's not confidence. It's trust in you."

Nathan raised his palm upward, intertwining their fingers in a firm grasp. His voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm sorry, Zoe."

His tone carried the weight of genuine remorse, laced with caution. Had he not pushed her away so brutally three years ago, perhaps the accident never would have happened.

"What's the point of apologies now?"

Evelyn's eyes dulled as a bitter laugh escaped her lips. She withdrew her hand sharply, rising to put distance between them. "Father's gone. Chloe too. And we lost..." Her voice cracked. "If only I hadn't stood in that rain—"

"What child?!" Nathan's throat constricted, shock and devastation warring in his amber gaze.

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it. Of course he wouldn't know. She'd never gotten the chance to tell him.

Nathan surged to his feet, gripping her shoulders. "Zoe, you were pregnant?!"

The realization hit him like a physical blow.

"Why didn't you tell me?" His face drained of color.

Evelyn's lips twisted without humor. "Have you forgotten? When you announced our divorce, I came begging to see you. You refused."

Nathan's hands clenched. The words died in his throat, leaving only pressed lips and a storm gathering behind his carefully controlled expression.

The divorce announcement hadn't been his idea - but he'd known about it.

Evelyn's smile held no warmth. "I waited in the rain for over an hour. You never came."

"Zoe, I—"

"Nathan." Her calm interruption cut deeper than any shout. "I wanted to hate you. But I couldn't. I knew you weren't involved. But if you'd just been honest with me..." Her voice trailed off.

Nathan's heart lurched violently. The pain was excruciating. He hadn't known about her visit. Hadn't known about the pregnancy. Hadn't known about the hour she'd spent waiting in the storm.

Every cruel word had been calculated to make her accept the divorce. But learning about the accident? That haunted him. Letting her walk away was his greatest regret.

Sometimes the smallest decisions created seismic consequences. And this one had cost them their child.

Evelyn composed herself with visible effort. "Have Oliver contact me when you've decided about the partnership." She checked her watch. "Sadie will be worried. I should go."

She left the study without looking back. Nathan remained rooted, an immovable statue long after the door closed.

Minutes later, Oliver entered cautiously. "Mr. Goldmann?"

"Did you know she was pregnant?" Nathan's voice was raw, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the window.

Oliver hesitated, guilt flashing across his features. "Yes."

Nathan whirled, teeth bared in fury. "Why wasn't I told?!"

Oliver stiffened. Not his choice - Theodore had forbidden it. Because...

The old man had claimed the knowledge would destroy Nathan completely.
###Chapter 498

Nathan's piercing gaze lingered on Oliver for what felt like an eternity before his lips twisted into a bitter smirk. The irony wasn't lost on him.

"All these years by my side," he said, voice dripping with sarcasm, "yet you conspired with my grandfather behind my back."

The truth was crystal clear now. Theodore Goldmann had orchestrated the divorce announcement. The old man had even manipulated Oliver into forcing Evelyn to sign those damned papers. Nathan knew Oliver would never have kept this from him without his grandfather's direct orders.

But how could his most trusted ally stand with Theodore on something this monumental?

"Mr. Goldmann," Oliver began carefully, "the Elder Master only acted in your best interest."

"My best interest?" Nathan barked a humorless laugh, his voice cracking. "Because of me, she lost our child. His 'good intentions' have left me with a debt I can never repay."

The unborn child he'd never known about. The truth that had been hidden from him for years. How was he supposed to face this? To make amends?

A violent cough wracked his body, crimson droplets staining his palm.

Oliver's face drained of color. "Mr. Goldmann!"

Meanwhile, Sadie glanced through the rearview mirror, noting the profound sorrow shadowing Evelyn's usually vibrant eyes. "Are you alright, Ms. Vanderbilt?"

"I'm fine." Evelyn's response was automatic, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery, face an unreadable mask. Sadie knew better than to press further.

Evelyn's fingers twisted together in her lap. The memories from three years ago played like a relentless film reel behind her eyelids.

She didn't hate Nathan. Not truly. But that single moment had cost her everything - her father, Chloe, their child. That was a price too steep to forgive.

As she'd told him, there was no reason for hatred. Nathan had merely been forcing her hand in the divorce.

Her love for him remained, tangled with resentment for his cruelty. She couldn't let go, yet couldn't bring herself to forgive.

When the car pulled into Easton Estate, Evelyn stepped out to find the head housekeeper rushing toward her. "Ms. Vanderbilt, the prince's envoy is waiting in the grand hall."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. So Prince Roger hadn't abandoned his territorial ambitions. Accepting the Venetian mask Sadie handed her, she smoothed her expression. "Then we shouldn't keep them waiting."

The grand hall's opulence couldn't mask the tension as Evelyn entered. A sharply dressed Stoslo diplomat rose from the velvet settee, flanked by two stone-faced bodyguards.

"Ms. Vanderbilt, I presume?" The man's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Sean Patterson, representing His Highness Prince Roger."

Evelyn inclined her head, taking the opposing seat. "Mr. Patterson. To what do I owe this... unexpected visit?"

As the diplomat sat, his guards produced a silver briefcase, snapping it open to reveal stacks of crisp bills. Evelyn's brow arched. "What's this?"

"His Highness wishes to purchase the territory currently under your stewardship," Sean explained smoothly. "Name your price if this seems... insufficient."

Evelyn's fingers twitched against the armrest.

The audacity. Attempting to seize the de Arma lands while her grandfather was absent. When Metropolis already controlled the region, this "purchase" was nothing but a thinly veiled power grab.

Leaning back, Evelyn adopted an apologetic smile. "The offer is... generous, Mr. Patterson. But I find myself rather... financially secure at present."

"Ms. Vanderbilt," Sean's tone turned diplomatic, "Stoslo and Morwich have enjoyed generations of alliance. His Highness wishes to preserve that. Metropolis' interference jeopardizes our mutual interests."
###Chapter 499

The air in the study was thick with tension as Sean Patterson leaned forward, his polished shoes gleaming under the chandelier's light. "If you accept this generous offer, His Highness Prince Reginald will ensure you're well compensated—with additional privileges beyond your imagination."

His words carried the weight of diplomatic implications, yet beneath the veneer of courtesy lay a clear message: Morwich had no business meddling in Stoslo's internal affairs.

Evelyn Vanderbilt's lips curved into a wry smile. "Morwich may have overstepped, but this isn't about privileges." Her gloved fingers traced the edge of her porcelain teacup. "Anything concerning the de Armas family concerns me personally."

Sean's expression darkened at her defiance. "If you persist in this interference, His Highness won't take it lightly. Consider this my final warning." He rose abruptly, fastening his suit jacket with sharp precision.

As he turned to leave, Evelyn's voice cut through the silence like tempered steel. "The de Armas and I share history."

Sean froze mid-step but didn't turn.

Evelyn stood, her emerald gown pooling around her. "And that territory stays under my protection."

After the tense departure, Evelyn summoned the head butler. "Who exactly is this Sean Patterson the prince sent as his envoy?"

The butler adjusted his spectacles. "A Stoslo magnate handpicked by Prince Reginald, Miss Vanderbilt. He controls nearly all major casinos and entertainment venues in the capital. Essentially the prince's eyes and ears among the nobility—most business dealings between the crown and powerful families go through him."

So the territory negotiation had been framed as another transactional deal. The prince's associates likely saw it as another stepping stone to royal favor. Evelyn knew Reginald wouldn't retreat quietly after this rejection.

Meanwhile, in the gilded halls of Stoslo's royal palace, Sean delivered his report. Prince Reginald's ice-blue eyes narrowed dangerously, his fingers drumming the armrest of his throne.

A shadowed figure stood silhouetted against stained glass windows, his voice a velvet rumble. "She claims ties to the de Armas?"

Sean nodded. "Explicitly so, my lord."

"Did you see beneath the mask?"

"Only what the tabloids show—the woman hides her face completely."

The mysterious man fell silent as Reginald's gaze sharpened. "Any progress locating Harrison?"

"Not yet, Your Highness."

The prince's jeweled ring clicked against crystal. "When found, eliminate him. That traitor knows too much." Anyone threatening their plans became disposable—Harrison had been branded an outcast the moment he escaped their control.

Reginald turned to the shadowed figure. "As for Alice... I trust you'll handle it."

Back in her study, Evelyn pored over intelligence files by lamplight. Prince Reginald's inner circle comprised three key players: Sean Patterson in commerce, Robert Stone controlling Stoslo's treasury, and Gregory Grayson—the spider at the center of the royal investigation bureau's web.

Nathan Goldmann's warning proved accurate—the prince's tendrils had indeed infiltrated Stoslo's government. Why else manipulate elections?

Her phone screen illuminated abruptly. That familiar number flashed again. Evelyn's breath hitched, her finger hovering over the decline button until the third call came.

She answered on the fourth ring. "Mr. Goldmann," she said, her voice carefully neutral. "To what do I owe this late-night interruption?"
###Chapter 500

"You're still awake." His voice carried a rough edge, yet simmered with undeniable warmth.

Evelyn froze, her jaw tightening. "Who told you that? I was sound asleep."

Nathan remained silent for a beat before murmuring, "Your lights are still on."

Evelyn rose and moved to the window. A sleek black car idled outside her gates, and there stood Nathan - tall, imposing, wrapped in a caramel trenchcoat that fluttered slightly in the night breeze. The streetlight cast long shadows around him, accentuating his solitary figure.

Rubbing her temples against the sudden throbbing, Evelyn sighed. "Nathan, what do you want?"

"Nothing." His gaze lifted to her window. "Just passing through."

A dry laugh escaped her lips. "You drove halfway across the city to 'pass through'? That's the weakest excuse I've heard, Mr. Goldmann."

"Reginald sent someone to see you." Nathan produced a cigarette from his coat pocket.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "How did you know that?"

The cigarette twirled between his fingers, unlit. "He'll never stop chasing the de Armas territory."

"True enough. But I won't surrender it either." Evelyn turned away from the window. "Nathan, it's late. We'll talk tomorrow."

"Is that an invitation?" His chuckle rumbled through the night air.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Don't forget you proposed this partnership. Seasons Restaurant. Noon."

His quiet laughter followed. "As you wish."

The line went dead. Evelyn lingered by the window a moment longer before snapping the blinds shut.

Nathan didn't leave until her lights flickered off. A bittersweet smile touched his lips. If business was the only thread connecting them now, he'd cling to it desperately.

Morning arrived with crisp sunlight.

Evelyn waited at Seasons Restaurant, Sadie standing guard beside her. The clock ticked past their appointed time.

"Ma'am," Sadie murmured, checking her watch. "Twenty minutes late."

Evelyn's teacup hovered mid-air. "Give it time."

Had Nathan changed his mind?

Another ten minutes crawled by. The waiter approached hesitantly. "Ms. Vanderbilt, shall we take your order now?"

Evelyn's silence spoke volumes.

Who did Nathan think he was? Was this some power play? Some twisted game?

"Ms. Vanderbilt?" The waiter pressed gently.

"Later." The words came out clipped. The waiter retreated.

Her fingers hovered over Nathan's contact. Then hesitated.

Did his absence mean the partnership was over? Had it all been lies?

"Good afternoon, sir. Do you have a reservation?"

Evelyn turned at the host's greeting. Her breath caught.

Dominic Kent stood in the doorway.

He advanced with predatory grace, his piercing gaze seeming to see straight through her mask.

"Waiting for someone?" He stopped before her table.

Evelyn remained silent, calculating.

Dominic's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Allow me to introduce myself. Dominic Kent."

Evelyn mirrored his cold smile. "What can I do for you, Mr. Kent?"

Without invitation, Dominic took the seat opposite her. "Ms. Vanderbilt... you look familiar. Have we met?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Dominic had glimpsed her three years prior, but their interaction had been brief. Surely the mask would conceal her identity.
