###Chapter 1

Harrison's world shattered when she found proof of Nathaniel's infidelity.

Her husband was sleeping with a university student.

It was Nathaniel's birthday. Harrison had spent all morning preparing his favorite dishes. That's when his phone buzzed on the kitchen counter.

Ding!

He'd forgotten it at home.

Harrison unlocked the screen to see a message from the student.

[I scraped my knee carrying your cake. It really hurts.]

Attached was a suggestive photo - not of the sender's face, but of her thighs. The girl wore thigh-high white stockings with black Mary Janes and a plaid skirt hiked up to reveal toned legs. A fresh bruise bloomed on her porcelain skin. The youthful image paired with the coy message screamed calculated seduction.

Powerful men like Nathaniel always fell for this type.

Harrison's grip tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Ding!

Another message arrived.

"Mr. Falcon, see you at Silver Pines tonight! Let me make your birthday unforgettable."

So his mistress planned to celebrate with him.

Harrison grabbed her purse and drove straight to Silver Pines Hotel. She needed to see this girl's face.

As she approached the entrance, she froze. Her parents Theodore and Victoria stood near the valet. Heart pounding, she approached them.

"Father? Mother? What are you doing here?"

The couple exchanged nervous glances before Theodore cleared his throat.

"Harrison... Isabella returned today. We're welcoming her back."

Isabella?

Through the hotel's glass facade, Harrison spotted her sister - wearing the exact same plaid skirt from Nathaniel's phone. The mistress was her own flesh and blood.

Isabella had always been stunning, dubbed Willowbrook's "Crimson Rose," famous for her dancer's legs. Countless men had fallen for her charms. Now her perfect sister was using those very assets to steal her husband.

Harrison let out a bitter laugh. "I suppose I'm the last to know?"

Theodore gave an uncomfortable smile. "Harrison, Mr. Falcon never wanted you."

"Exactly," Victoria added. "Every woman in Willowbrook wants Nathaniel Falcon. Better our Isabella than some stranger."

Harrison's nails dug into her palms. "I'm your daughter too!"

She turned sharply, heels clicking against pavement.

Victoria called after her. "Harrison! Tell me - has Nathaniel ever touched you?" Harrison stopped dead.

Theodore's voice turned cold. "Don't act the victim. Three years ago when Nathaniel and Isabella were Willowbrook's golden couple, everyone expected their engagement. Then the accident left him comatose. You were just the placeholder."

Victoria's gaze swept over Harrison's simple dress. "Look at you - a frumpy housewife while Isabella became principal dancer at the National Ballet. She's the swan, you're the duckling. What could you possibly offer him? Just give him back."

Each word stabbed deeper. Blinking back tears, Harrison fled.

Night had fallen when she returned to Rosewood Manor. She'd dismissed the staff, leaving the mansion dark and hollow.

She sat alone at the dining table.

The food had gone cold. The cake she'd decorated read "Happy Birthday My Love" in perfect script.

The irony burned - her entire existence was a joke.

Nathaniel and Isabella had been Willowbrook's darlings, with Isabella as his treasured "Crimson Rose." Then the accident left Nathaniel vegetative and Isabella vanished abroad.

That's when the Whitmores dragged Harrison from the countryside to take Isabella's place. She'd agreed eagerly - she'd loved Nathaniel since childhood.

For three years, she'd devoted herself to his care, abandoning her own life to nurse him. Her efforts paid off - Nathaniel woke.

Harrison lit the birthday candles.

Their glow reflected in the mirror - a plain woman in a shapeless dress, no sparkle left.

Meanwhile, Isabella remained radiant - a prima ballerina in her prime.

Harrison was the duckling. Isabella the swan.

Now awake, Nathaniel returned to his true love.

A hollow laugh escaped her. This wasn't love - it was delusion. Nathaniel had never wanted her, yet she'd given everything. The first to love always loses.

Today, Nathaniel destroyed her completely.

Tears fell as she blew out the candles, plunging the mansion into darkness.

Suddenly, headlights cut through the night. Nathaniel's Rolls-Royce purred up the drive.

Harrison's breath caught. She hadn't expected him home tonight.

The door opened, Nathaniel bringing the night's chill with him.

Nathaniel Falcon - heir to Falcon Enterprises. A business prodigy who'd earned dual masters from Westfield by sixteen. He'd taken the company public in Willow Heights, becoming Willowbrook's wealthiest man before thirty.

"Why are you sitting in the dark?" His baritone voice filled the space as lights flickered on.

Harrison blinked against the sudden brightness. When her vision cleared, she took him in - the impeccably tailored suit, the aristocratic bearing that haunted society women's dreams.

"It's your birthday."

Nathaniel's handsome face remained impassive as he glanced at the table. "I've told you not to bother with this."

"Or is it just me you don't want celebrating with you?" Harrison challenged.

His cold gaze flickered over her. "Believe what you like."

He turned toward the stairs.

Always so distant. Nothing could melt that icy exterior.

Harrison stood abruptly. "I have a gift for you."

Nathaniel didn't pause. "I don't want it."

A sad smile touched her lips. "Nathaniel... I want a divorce."

He froze mid-step, slowly turning. His dark eyes locked onto hers with startling intensity.
###Chapter 2

Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze without flinching. Her voice carried quiet determination as she repeated, "I want a divorce, Nathaniel. Did you enjoy your birthday present?"

Nathaniel didn't react. "You're ending our marriage because I missed my birthday dinner?"

"Isabella's back, isn't she?"

At the mention of Isabella, Nathaniel's lips twisted into a sardonic smile. He closed the distance between them in one stride. "Jealous?"

The youngest billionaire in Willowbrook radiated power with every movement. Harrison instinctively retreated until her back hit the cold wall.

Nathaniel caged her in, one hand planted beside her head. His muscular frame blocked all escape.

His piercing eyes bored into hers. "The entire city knows Isabella was my choice. You schemed your way into this marriage when she left. Why the sudden conscience?"

Harrison's face paled.

Yes, Nathaniel had loved Isabella. Without that accident putting him in a coma, she'd never have become Mrs. Falcon.

She'd never forget the icy disappointment in his eyes when he woke and found her by his bedside.

Separate bedrooms. No intimacy.

He loved Isabella.

She'd always known this, but...

Harrison studied Nathaniel's face, superimposing the man before her with the boy from her memories.

'Nathaniel, do you really not remember me?'

She'd been waiting for someone who no longer existed.

Enough.

Three years of one-sided devotion.

Suppressing the ache in her chest, Harrison whispered, "Let's end this farce of a marriage."

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. "Farce?"

He seized her chin, thumb brushing her lower lip. "Is that what this is about? You're frustrated?" His voice dropped to a husky murmur. "Need me that badly?"

Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks.

That wasn't what she meant!

Yet Nathaniel kept tracing her mouth with shocking intimacy. The usually composed billionaire had a wicked side.

He was seeing Harrison properly for the first time. Normally hidden behind oversized glasses and drab outfits, now he noticed her delicate features, the striking eyes behind those lenses.

Her lips were impossibly soft. Tempting.

A dangerous thought surfaced.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. "Who knew my proper wife was so desperate?"

Slap!

Harrison's palm connected with his cheek. Nathaniel's head snapped sideways.

Her hand trembled. Love shouldn't require sacrificing dignity. He'd crossed a line.

"I know you never stopped loving Isabella," she spat. "Fine. You can have your precious Mrs. Falcon title back!"

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. No one had ever struck him.

His voice dripped venom. "You married me when it suited you. Now you'll divorce on a whim? What am I to you?"

Harrison laughed bitterly. "A trophy."

"What?"

"A prize I stole from Isabella." She forced the words out, ignoring the pain. "I'm bored now. Time to discard you."

Nathaniel's face darkened. "Fine! Don't come crawling back!"

He stormed upstairs, the study door slamming shut.

Harrison slid down the wall, hugging her knees. 'Nathaniel, I'm done loving you.'

Next morning, Beatrice entered the study.

Nathaniel was reviewing documents, the notorious workaholic.

"Sir?" Beatrice approached cautiously.

He didn't look up. The air around him was frigid.

She set down a coffee. "Mrs. Falcon made this."

Nathaniel's pen stilled. The coffee he liked. Was this her apology?

Truthfully, Harrison was an impeccable wife—excellent cook, meticulous homemaker.

He took a sip. Perfect, as always.

But no. She'd slapped him. A coffee wouldn't suffice.

"Did she apologize?" Nathaniel demanded.

Beatrice hesitated. "Sir... Mrs. Falcon left."

Nathaniel froze.

She handed him a document. "She asked me to give you this."

The words "Divorce Agreement" glared up at him.

His expression darkened. He'd thought this was reconciliation.

Beatrice added, "She requested you finish the coffee before signing."

Nathaniel glared at the cup. "Throw it out!"

'But you were enjoying it moments ago,' Beatrice thought, swiftly removing it.

Nathaniel scanned the agreement. She wanted nothing—no alimony, no assets.

He scoffed. How would a small-town girl survive without his money?

Then he saw her handwritten reason for divorce:

"My husband suffers from erectile dysfunction and cannot perform marital duties."

Nathaniel's face turned thunderous.

'That damn woman!'

He grabbed his phone and dialed Harrison.

She answered immediately. "Yes?"
###Chapter 3

Nathaniel's lips twisted into a cold smirk. "Harrison, get your ass back here now!"

Harrison let out a light laugh. "You think I'll come running just because you snapped your fingers? We're divorced, Nathaniel. Your little games don't work on me anymore."

His jaw tightened. "I'm giving you one chance to change the divorce papers."

Her voice turned teasing. "Did I lie? It's been six months since you woke up, hasn't it? Six months and you haven't so much as touched me. Three years in a coma left you physically intact, but clearly something's not working right downstairs. Maybe find yourself a good herbalist? Consider it my parting gift—hope you recover your manhood soon!"

Nathaniel's temple pulsed visibly. This woman had lost her damn mind.

"Harrison, you'll regret this. Deeply."

"Sorry, but you'll never get the chance to prove that."

"Harrison—!"

The line went dead with two sharp beeps. He barely had time to process his rage before the dial tone mocked him.

'Damn her...!'

Harrison was already at her best friend Gabrielle's penthouse when she hung up. Gabrielle burst out laughing, giving her an enthusiastic high-five.

"That was glorious! Nathaniel's probably choking on his own rage right now."

Harrison realized she'd been too meek before, letting him walk all over her for years.

'Self-respect comes first. Always.'

"Three years ago when Isabella heard Nathaniel was in a coma, she bolted like a scared rabbit. Now that he's awake, she comes crawling back? Pathetic. You're better off without that trash," Gabrielle scoffed. Harrison unwrapped a caramel, letting the sweetness drown out the bitterness. "That's how you know who really loves you, Gabrielle."

Those who are loved fear nothing. The unloved live in constant doubt.

Gabrielle noticed the pile of candy wrappers and yanked Harrison to her feet.

"Enough moping! Lose one tree, gain a whole damn forest. Tonight, I'm booking eight male models to celebrate your freedom!"

Harrison laughed, covering her face.

Gabrielle suddenly snatched Harrison's thick-rimmed glasses and tossed them in the trash.

Harrison reached for them. "Hey—!"

"Stop. You've been buried in research too long. Take notes from Isabella—time to glam up."

Harrison remembered how her parents always called her the ugly duckling compared to Isabella's swan. Nathaniel must've thought the same. To him, she'd always be that awkward girl.

Gabrielle dragged her toward the door. "Shopping spree! Hair, nails, wardrobe—the works. Let Nathaniel and everyone else see the goddess you really are!"

As they left, Gabrielle paused. "Wait, you're really taking nothing from Nathaniel in the divorce?"

"I have my own money."

"So Isabella gets to spend his fortune? How generous of you!" Gabrielle teased.

Harrison rolled her eyes.

"What about the black card he gave you?" Gabrielle pressed.

Nathaniel had handed her an unlimited black card years ago. She'd never used it.

Now, Harrison pulled it from her purse with a wicked grin. "Today, Nathaniel's paying for everything."

That night at The Velvet Lounge.

Willowbrook's most exclusive nightclub, where heirs and elites burned through fortunes. The bass pulsed relentlessly, bodies grinding under strobe lights.

In the VIP section, Nathaniel dominated a leather booth. Dressed in all black, sleeves rolled to reveal muscular forearms and a platinum watch worth millions. His aristocratic features drew hungry stares from every woman in the room.

Beside him sat Sebastian Gondale—heir to the Gondale empire—and other young elites.

Sebastian smirked. "Seriously? Harrison filed for divorce?"

The group laughed. "Everyone knows she's obsessed with you. She married you while you were comatose. No way she's serious."

"Let's bet how long before she comes crawling back."

Sebastian checked his watch. "I give it till midnight. She's probably texting him right now."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He pulled out his phone, opening their WhatsApp.

The last message was from last night—a photo of herbal soup with: [Sweetheart, even though your bones healed, keep drinking this. Don't stay out too late!]

Scrolling up revealed hundreds of similar messages. Daily. Relentless.

He'd never replied. Not once.

Today? Radio silence.

An odd irritation prickled his skin.

Ding!

A notification.

"Told you!" Sebastian crowed.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

More alerts in rapid succession.

The group erupted. "Knew she couldn't last! But damn, she folded fast."

"Read them out. Let's hear Harrison beg," Sebastian urged.

Nathaniel's brow arched. Had she really caved so easily? Then why the dramatic exit this morning?

He tapped the notifications—and froze.

Sebastian leaned over, reading aloud: "VIP Alert: Card ending 0975 charged $800 at Glamour Nails."

The group frowned.

Nathaniel scrolled down.

$2,000 at Elite Hair Studio.
$86,000 at Chanel.
$240,000 at Louis Vuitton.

No pleas. No apologies. Just receipts.

The room fell silent, the collective ego bruise almost audible. Nathaniel slammed his phone on the table. The money meant nothing. It was the audacity—divorced and immediately splurging? This wasn't the Harrison he knew.

The meek woman who'd clung to him for years had grown claws.

"Damn, Harrison's gone full makeover. Trying to copy Isabella?" Sebastian mused.

"Isabella's Willowbrook's golden girl. Harrison's just a bookworm playing dress-up."

"A swan's a swan. A duck stays a duck."

They all laughed.

Then—a sudden hush fell over the club. Every head turned toward the entrance.

Someone gasped. "Holy hell... is that an angel?"
###Chapter 4 

The shopping spree at the mall had been exhilarating. Gabrielle wasted no time whisking Harrison straight to The Velvet Lounge. Tonight called for celebration—Harrison deserved nothing less.

Harrison hadn’t anticipated running into Nathaniel and his entourage here. Their snide remarks carried easily across the room.

She recognized Sebastian and the others in the VIP booth. They were Nathaniel’s inner circle, with Sebastian being his closest confidant. Back when Nathaniel had his whirlwind romance with Isabella, they’d all adored her. Sebastian had even declared her Nathaniel’s future wife.

Three years of marriage hadn’t earned Harrison their acceptance.

The labels they slapped on her never changed—gold-digger, plain Jane, backwater nobody.

When a man didn’t love you, his friends wouldn’t respect you either.

Gabrielle’s temper flared. She rolled up her sleeves, ready to storm their booth. "I’ll rip their tongues out!"

Harrison caught her wrist. "Gabrielle, don’t. We’re divorced now. They’re not worth it."

Gabrielle huffed but relented at Harrison’s calm dismissal. Then, as whispers and awed murmurs spread through the crowd—angel, goddess, breathtaking—Gabrielle’s mood lifted. "Come on, Harrison. Time to celebrate."

She dragged Harrison to another VIP booth and snapped her fingers imperiously. "Bring every male host in this place to me. Now."

Meanwhile, at Nathaniel’s booth, Sebastian and the others continued their derisive commentary—until a glacial stare silenced them.

Nathaniel’s sharp, warning gaze cut through their laughter like a blade.

The men stiffened, mouths snapping shut.

Sebastian shot Nathaniel a glance. Though Nathaniel had never paid Harrison much attention, she had devoted three years to him. Maybe that still counted for something.

Then, a commotion erupted nearby.

"Damn, look at her!"

"Who is that?"

Following the crowd’s stares, Sebastian turned—and nearly choked on his drink. "Holy hell. She’s unreal."

The other men gaped, transfixed. "Since when did Willowbrook have someone like her? How have we never seen her before?"

Sebastian elbowed Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, look. Angel."

Nathaniel, perpetually surrounded by women, couldn’t care less. He’d seen every type—petite, voluptuous, demure, bold. But Harrison’s booth was directly across from his.

When he glanced over, he saw her.

No thick glasses. No frumpy clothes. Just delicate features, porcelain skin, and an ethereal glow. Her glossy black hair cascaded over her shoulders like silk.

An angel, indeed.

Nathaniel stared. Two full seconds.

Sebastian grinned. "So? What do you think?"

Another man scoffed. "Please. Mr. Falcon prefers delicate flowers like Isabella, not ice queens."

"Did you see her legs, though? They’re just as perfect as Isabella’s."

Harrison’s Chanel-inspired dress showcased legs that could haunt a man’s dreams—slender, toned, flawless.

Nathaniel studied her, frowning. Something about her felt familiar.

Then, a line of male hosts approached Harrison’s booth—tall, sculpted, smirking.

Gabrielle beamed. "Pick eight, Harrison."

Harrison, embracing her newfound freedom, pointed lazily. "You. You. And you. All of you—stay."

Sebastian choked. "Eight? She just ordered eight male hosts?"

The others laughed. "Why pay? She could have us for free."

Nathaniel’s phone buzzed.

[VIP Alert: Card ending 0975 charged $500,000 at The Velvet Lounge—eight male hosts.]

Nathaniel’s grip tightened on his phone. His gaze snapped back to the "angel."

If that wasn’t Harrison, who the hell was it?

The hosts crowded around Harrison, pouring drinks, leaning in. "Let’s play a game."

Gabrielle clapped. "Yes! Loser drinks."

Harrison lost the first round. A host handed her a glass. "For you, gorgeous."

She took a sip, but the others protested. "Why him? Drink mine too."

Harrison laughed, overwhelmed by their attention—until a steely grip clamped around her wrist and yanked her up.

Nathaniel’s furious face loomed over her.

She gasped. "Nathaniel—let go!"

Without a word, he dragged her away.

Gabrielle shot up. "Nathaniel! What the hell are you doing?"

Sebastian and the others gaped.

"Harrison?"

"That’s Harrison?"

"The plain Harrison?"

"She’s a goddess."

As Nathaniel hauled her off, Sebastian muttered, "Damn. Harrison stopped chasing Nathaniel—and turned into that."

Nathaniel’s grip was iron. Harrison stumbled, struggling to keep up. "Nathaniel, release me!"

He shoved her against a wall, caging her in. His voice was lethal.

"Harrison. Do I look dead to you?"
###Chapter 5

Harrison frowned. "What did I do?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Who told you to dress like this?"

'Like this?' she wondered. "What are you talking about, Nathaniel?"

His gaze dropped to her scandalously short skirt. "Your thighs are practically bare. Do you actually want men staring at your legs like this?"

The outfit had been Gabrielle's idea. Her exact words still rang in Harrison's ears: "My darling Harrison never shows skin, while Isabella parades around half-naked. Tonight, let Willowbrook see who truly has the best legs."

Harrison arched one perfect eyebrow. "Seems Mr. Falcon appreciates my legs after all."

Nathaniel froze.

Leaning back against the wall with effortless grace, Harrison slowly lifted her right leg. The crystal stiletto traced a teasing path up his ankle.

He wore tailored black trousers that accentuated his powerful physique, radiating icy restraint.

Her bare skin ghosted higher, deliberately provocative. A silent challenge.

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "Explain yourself."

Harrison's lips curved. "Tell me, Mr. Falcon - do you prefer my legs...or Isabella's?"

He studied her luminous face - angelic yet devilish in its temptation. Last night's glimpse behind those glasses hadn't prepared him for this breathtaking vision.

Something about her features tugged at his memory.

Harrison's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Has Isabella ever wrapped her legs around your waist, Nathaniel?"

His breath caught. Leaning closer, his expression softened in a way she'd never seen. "Harrison, are you truly this brazen? Your mind only thinks of men. You even hired eight male escorts to satisfy your...needs."

He'd dodged her question about Isabella. The ultimate protective gesture.

Their passion must have been explosive in their youth. Isabella's legs had definitely claimed his waist - why else would he still carry that torch?

Isabella was fortunate to inspire such devotion from a man like Nathaniel. He'd never call her 'shameless.'

Harrison's smile never reached her distant eyes. "Well, Mr. Falcon, since you're...inadequate, I must seek satisfaction elsewhere. Let's finalize our divorce. If the first man fails, perhaps the next will succeed."

Did she just imply he was insufficient? That another man might please her better?

This woman was playing with fire.

Nathaniel seized her chin. "Testing me? You want proof of my...capabilities?"

Harrison stiffened.

His lips hovered centimeters from hers, his words icy. "Keep dreaming. I won't touch you. My heart belongs to Isabella."

That declaration shouldn't have stung. She'd always known. Yet the pain spread through her chest like poison.

"Darling."

Harrison looked up - Isabella had arrived.

Willowbrook's Red Rose lived up to her name - porcelain skin, rosebud lips, a ballerina's graceful frame.

Nathaniel released Harrison instantly. His entire demeanor softened as he approached Isabella. "You're here."

Isabella's gaze flickered to Harrison. "Who's this?"

She didn't recognize her stepsister.

But Harrison would never forget Isabella.

Stepsisters by marriage only. Harrison's father Theodore wasn't her biological parent - that honor belonged to Benjamin, long deceased.

Once, Harrison had a loving family - Benjamin, her mother Victoria, all devoted to each other.

Her father would lift her high, whispering, "My Harrison, promise me you'll always be happy."

Then he died suddenly. Theodore moved in with his daughter Isabella. Victoria became mother to both.

Her mother married her uncle. Loved Isabella. Forgot Harrison existed.

When Isabella scored an A to Harrison's A+, Victoria struck her daughter's hands with a ruler. "Must you always outshine your sister?"

When chemotherapy stole Isabella's hair, Victoria shaved Harrison's head too. "Now you match. She won't feel ugly alone."

Night after night, Harrison stood outside their bedroom door, clutching her dead father's gift, listening to their laughter. "Mommy...I'm scared..."

Then Isabella claimed Victoria as "Mom" - and declared, "A mother should only have one daughter."

The memory still burned - rain pelting her face as Victoria's car disappeared down the muddy road, Harrison's desperate screams unanswered. "I'll be good! I'll let Isabella win! Mommy, please!"

She'd never forget Isabella.

Sebastian arrived breathlessly. "Isabella! This is...your sister Harrison!"

Isabella blinked. "Harrison?"

Harrison knew Isabella had always despised her.

Childhood beatings. Constant belittlement. Then Isabella blossomed into Willowbrook's darling - talented, beautiful, Nathaniel Falcon's lover. Coddled in admiration.

Sebastian gaped at Harrison's transformed beauty. "I never realized..."

Isabella's childhood memories were hazy - why notice an unloved stepsister? Wasn't Harrison supposed to be some country bumpkin?

Approaching with regal disdain, Isabella smirked. "Harrison. How...interesting to see you copying my style."

Harrison remained silent.

Straightening her spine, Harrison's ethereal beauty glowed under the chandeliers like a priceless jewel.

This wasn't the broken girl Isabella remembered.

Isabella's laugh dripped venom. "I heard about your divorce. Can't survive without male attention? Hiring escorts at a bar? If I were you, I'd find actual employment."

She glanced at Nathaniel, adopting a magnanimous tone. "Darling, Harrison did care for you. Even as your maid, you should help her find work."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Harrison's face.

Sebastian chuckled. "Jobs require degrees, Isabella. What's Harrison's education?"

Isabella's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "She dropped out at sixteen."
###Chapter 6

Sebastian's jaw dropped. "Sixteen?"

The reason people in Sebastian's circle admired Isabella wasn't just her beauty. It was her academic brilliance. A top student at Westfield University, she outshone even Willowbrook's elite.

She belonged with Nathaniel.

Beauty alone was worthless. Beauty paired with education? That was power. The higher the social ladder, the more they valued a woman's intellect.

Sebastian's admiration for Harrison evaporated. His voice turned condescending. "Harrison, you actually quit school at sixteen?"

Harrison glanced at Isabella, standing there like a peacock, and smiled faintly. "Yes, I stopped at sixteen."

Sebastian scoffed. "Funny. Nathaniel also left school at sixteen. But he's a genius—dual master's degrees from Westfield by that age, making history. And you? A high school dropout with nothing!"

His mocking laughter echoed.

Isabella stood taller, looking down her nose at Harrison.

Nathaniel remained silent under the corridor lights. His chiseled face betrayed nothing as his gaze settled on Harrison.

For three years, Harrison had been just a housewife orbiting his world. No surprise she lacked education.

Yet Harrison showed no shame. Her clear, luminous eyes met his directly. Then she smiled, graceful as ever. "Yes, what a coincidence."

'Indeed, what a coincidence.'

Nathaniel felt an inexplicable pang.

Suddenly, he noticed how striking Harrison's eyes were—alive with unspoken stories.

"Harrison!" Gabrielle rushed over, glaring at Isabella. "Isabella, bullying her again?"

Isabella lifted her chin. "We were discussing finding her employment. Given her... limitations."

Gabrielle blinked. "You're getting Harrison a job?"

Isabella's smile dripped false sweetness. "Even with her... background, we'll secure something suitable."

Gabrielle burst out laughing. "Do you even know who—" Harrison gripped her arm. "Gabrielle, let's go."

Gabrielle bit her tongue but shot Isabella a scathing look. "You'll eat those words."

She whisked Harrison away.

Sebastian fumed. "Who does she think she is? A dropout acting superior! I'd die of shame."

Isabella wasn't bothered. Harrison wasn't competition. Getting angry would demean her.

She patted Sebastian's arm. "Let it go. Some people live in ignorance."

Sebastian turned to Nathaniel. "Divorce her. She's beneath you."

Nathaniel's expression stayed neutral as he watched Harrison disappear.

"Let's go," he told Isabella.

She nodded. "Of course."

They left with Sebastian.

Outside The Velvet Lounge...

"Mr. Falcon?" a voice called.

Nathaniel turned. Julian Suarez, Westfield's president, stood there.

Nathaniel approached. "Julian, what brings you to Willowbrook?"

Isabella greeted him respectfully. Despite her academic success, she'd never cracked Westfield's elite circle.

Julian smiled. "Here for a conference. Funny—your junior's in Willowbrook too."

Nathaniel paused. "Junior?"

Julian nodded. "Westfield has two legends. You, and her. Dual master's at sixteen. A genius. Sadly, your paths never crossed."

Sebastian leaned in. "Who's better?"

Julian chuckled. "Equally matched."

Nathaniel's eyebrow lifted. A woman his equal? Unheard of.

Isabella's calm shattered. Jealousy clawed at her.

"Who is she?" she forced out.

Julian pulled out his phone. "Sent her WhatsApp. She's here—look out for your junior."

Nathaniel nodded. "Will do."

As Julian left, Sebastian buzzed. "Add her! I need to see this legend."

Nathaniel checked his phone. The contact showed simply 'H'—blank profile.

"What's 'H' stand for?" Sebastian pressed.

Nathaniel didn't know. He sent a request: "Nathaniel."

Pending approval.

Sebastian vibrated with excitement. "Introduce us! I'm already obsessed."

Isabella's smile turned brittle.

A Rolls-Royce glided up. Dominic, Nathaniel's secretary, had arrived.

Isabella seized the moment. "Nathaniel, the car's here."

"See you," Sebastian waved.

Inside the Rolls-Royce, city lights danced across Nathaniel's sharp features.

Dominic glanced back. "Sir, destination?"

"The office," Nathaniel clipped.

Isabella studied him, love burning in her gaze. She broke the silence. "That moment with Harrison... You're not actually interested now she's pretty?"

Nathaniel turned, eyes glinting. "She's my wife. Wouldn't that be natural? You're the one who handed her to me."

She knew he still blamed her—for abandoning him in a coma to marry Harrison.

"Nathaniel, she insisted—I had no choice—"

His gaze pierced her. "Believable?"

She faltered.

Biting her lip, she played her card. "Fine! I left you! If you can't forgive me, end it!" She turned to Dominic. "Stop the car!"

She moved to exit, but Nathaniel's hand shot out, yanking her against his chest.

She froze.

Above her, his voice softened to velvet. "Isabella... You're only this bold because I let you be."
###Chapter 7

Isabella smiled, her heart overflowing with sweetness. She melted into Nathaniel's embrace, lifting her flawless face to meet his gaze.

"I always knew you couldn't resist me. You'd never truly let me go."

Nathaniel, Willowbrook's most powerful man, carried himself with the effortless authority of someone who moved markets with a single word. He embodied every woman's fantasy of the perfect man.

But three years ago, when doctors declared he'd remain in a vegetative state after that horrific accident, how could she sacrifice her youth waiting for a man who might never wake?

So she ran.

Yet somehow, Harrison - the woman who married him in her place - managed to wake Nathaniel within three years.

Even now, Isabella couldn't comprehend his miraculous recovery. Was Harrison's destiny somehow intertwined with his?

Doctors called it impossible. A one-in-a-million chance.

So Isabella returned. She knew Nathaniel's heart still belonged to her.

Nathaniel studied Isabella's radiant face. "If not for what happened... would I still indulge you like this?"

At his words, guilt flickered across Isabella's features before she quickly changed the subject.

"Have you slept with Harrison?"

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. "Why would I touch her when I have you?"

She'd known the answer, but wanted to hear him say it. His teasing response sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

This was the Nathaniel she adored - the dangerous edge beneath his composed exterior that made her want to unravel him completely.

Isabella shifted boldly, straddling his lap. Her arms circled his neck as she brought her lips dangerously close. Her breath warmed his skin. "Do you want me?"

Dominic, Nathaniel's longtime secretary, discreetly raised the privacy partition in the Rolls-Royce.

Nathaniel remained silent.

Her red dress had ridden up, revealing those legendary legs - voted "Willowbrook's Most Beautiful" three years running. Now they wrapped around his tailored trousers in a deliberately provocative display.

Isabella tightened her thighs around him. "Say it. Do you want me right now?"

If he said yes, she'd give herself to him without hesitation.

Nathaniel understood perfectly.

But suddenly, an image flashed through his mind - Harrison's legs at the bar earlier that evening.

Perfectly proportioned. Elegant yet strong.

She'd asked which legs he preferred - hers or Isabella's.

Harrison had playfully dangled her stiletto, the delicate chain glinting as her toes brushed against his leg. Teasing him about whether Isabella's legs had ever wrapped around him like this.

Nathaniel removed Isabella's arms from his neck. "I'm still married."

Isabella frowned. "And?"

"I don't cheat on my wife," he said coolly.

The words shattered the moment.

Isabella slid off his lap, pride wounded. She'd only give herself if he truly wanted her.

"When are you divorcing Harrison?" she demanded.

Nathaniel's gaze shifted to the city lights. Truthfully, it was better this way - Harrison initiating the divorce fit perfectly with his plans.

"Soon," he replied, voice detached.

Meanwhile, Harrison returned to her apartment with Gabrielle. Collapsing onto her bed, she exhaled deeply. Tonight's indulgence was over - time to return to reality.

She pulled out her phone, switching WhatsApp accounts.

For three years, she'd used "Mrs. Falcon." That identity was officially retired now.

Logging into her original account, notifications exploded instantly. The group chat "One Big Happy Family" buzzed with activity.

[Harrison's back online!] Maxwell typed excitedly.

[Welcome home!] Evelyn added.

[Group hug!] Oliver chimed in.

Her three mentors showered the chat with virtual confetti.

[Three years ago, our Harrison left the mountains starry-eyed for love. So, was he worth it?] Maxwell asked.

[Not even close,] Harrison replied.

[Our girl got her heart broken! Haha!] Evelyn wrote.

[Even Harrison can't conquer everything? Hilarious!] Oliver added.

[Stop teasing her. Consider these three years her... worldly education. Sorry, can't help laughing! Hahaha!] Maxwell typed.

Harrison rolled her eyes.

She swiftly renamed the group "One Big Nosy Family."

Then Oliver turned serious. [Harrison, it's time to return. We're swamped. I've booked you for a complex cardiac procedure tomorrow at the naturopathy center.]

Harrison sent a thumbs-up emoji.

As she exited the chat, a friend request notification popped up - from Nathaniel.

The irony wasn't lost on her. For three years, she'd messaged him daily as "Mrs. Falcon" without a single reply. Now he was reaching out to her real account.

'You had your chance when I cared. Now you'll find I'm untouchable.'

Harrison's fingers hovered over the screen before decisively tapping her response.

At Falcon Enterprises...

The Falcon Tower dominated Willowbrook's skyline, its gleaming facade reflecting the city lights. After dropping Isabella home, Nathaniel returned to his office.

The sharp scratch of his pen filled the silence as he signed documents with bold strokes. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed him against the glittering cityscape - a king surveying his domain.

A WhatsApp notification chimed.

Nathaniel picked up his phone to see Harrison's response.

For the first time that night, a genuine smirk curved his lips as he let out a low chuckle.
###Chapter 8

Nathaniel's brilliant junior had flat-out declined his friend request!

Dominic entered with a steaming cup of coffee just as Nathaniel's phone screen caught his eye. His eyebrows shot up. "Someone actually rejected the CEO's request?"

This was unprecedented.

"Sir, your junior is...unique," Dominic remarked.

Nathaniel smirked. Unique was an understatement.

She was the first person to ever turn him down. If she didn't want to connect, fine by him.

He took a sip of the coffee and grimaced.

"Too bitter, sir? I'll brew another," Dominic offered.

Nathaniel's mind flashed to Harrison's coffee—always perfectly balanced to his taste.

Without expression, he ordered, "Prepare an eight-figure check. That's Harrison's divorce settlement."

She claimed she wanted nothing, but he knew better. A country girl who dropped out at sixteen? She was playing games, angling for more.

This sum would cover their three years. After this, they'd be square.

Dominic nodded. "Right away, sir."

Just then, Dominic's phone rang. His face lit up. "Sir! Dr. Sinclair has agreed to operate on Miss Isabella!"

Dr. Sinclair was a medical legend, her skills unmatched. Even billionaires waited months for her consultations.

Yet three years ago, she'd vanished without a trace.

Now she was back.

Isabella had battled heart disease since childhood, with no treatment proving effective.

Nathaniel had pulled every string to secure Dr. Sinclair's expertise.

The tension in Nathaniel's shoulders eased. Isabella would be saved.

The next day, Harrison arrived at the naturopathy center.

Suddenly, a squad of black-suited guards stormed in, clearing a path. Harrison and others were shoved aside.

Two women nearby whispered excitedly.

"What's happening?"

"That's Willowbrook's Jewel—Isabella! She collapsed during rehearsal. Mr. Falcon brought her here."

"With Mr. Falcon involved, no wonder it's a spectacle."

Harrison's breath hitched. Of all days to run into Nathaniel and Isabella.

"Look! There they are!"

Her gaze lifted to Nathaniel's commanding figure—tall, immaculate in a tailored black suit, radiating power.

He carried Isabella in his arms.

The medical staff swarmed around them like moths to a flame.

"Mr. Falcon, this way!"

Nathaniel strode forward.

One woman sighed dreamily. "He's so handsome! Textbook CEO material."

"And Isabella's stunning—that porcelain skin, that ballerina grace. They're perfect together!"

"A powerful CEO and his delicate dancer—it's like a fairy tale!"

Few knew of Harrison and Nathaniel's marriage. To the world, Nathaniel and Isabella were endgame.

Harrison watched them disappear. Nathaniel hadn't even glanced her way—his attention solely on Isabella. She was merely an extra in their love story.

Steeling herself, Harrison located Ward 109.

Inside, she found Nathaniel, Isabella, Theodore, and Victoria.

Isabella sat regally on the bed, flanked by her doting parents—still their cherished princess.

"Isabella, this is wonderful!" Theodore beamed. "Mr. Falcon secured Dr. Sinclair for you!"

Victoria wept joyfully. "You've suffered so much, darling! Soon you'll be healthy, ready to marry Mr. Falcon."

Isabella gifted Nathaniel a radiant smile.

He stood protectively beside her, gently stroking her hair.

The scene was picture-perfect.

Harrison froze in the doorway. The universe had a cruel sense of humor—Oliver had assigned her this case, and the patient was Isabella.

The cozy tableau burned her eyes.

Then Nathaniel turned.

His piercing gaze locked onto hers.

Caught off guard, Harrison met his stare.

His expression darkened as he advanced. "Harrison. Why are you here?"

"I—"

His voice turned glacial. "Are you following me?"

"N-no," she stammered.

Theodore and Victoria noticed her.

"Harrison! We arranged for Dr. Sinclair to save your sister!" Victoria screeched. "How dare you disrupt this?"

Theodore glowered. "Leave immediately!"

Isabella remained silent, her triumphant gaze slicing through Harrison.

Nathaniel loomed over her, gripping her wrist.

His words were razor-sharp. "Still playing games, Harrison? Had enough yet? Stalking me now? Don't waste my time. Get out."
###Chapter 9

No one wanted her there—they were all determined to push her out.

Harrison found it almost amusing. Her icy gaze flickered over Isabella, Victoria, and Theodore before she jerked her arm free from Nathaniel's grasp.

A faint smirk curved her lips. "Fine. I'll go."

Remember this—you're the ones sending me away.

Without another word, she turned and walked off.

But moments later, she returned. Tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, she asked, "Mr. Falcon, do you know why I came to the naturopathy center today?"

Nathaniel's eyes lingered on her flawless complexion, the soft glow of sunlight catching the delicate peach fuzz on her skin, making her ethereal beauty impossible to ignore.

His expression remained cold, indifferent. "Harrison, you're testing my patience."

She stepped closer, her smile dazzling.

"I came to help you find a specialist." She pulled a small card from her pocket and handed it to him. "Here. This might be useful."

Nathaniel glanced down at the slightly aged card—the kind that might be slipped under a door.

It read: Traditional Naturopath—Specializing in ED, premature ejaculation, infertility, and restoring masculine vitality. Contact: 138XXXX8888.

For the first time, his stoic mask cracked.

Harrison tucked the card into his suit pocket. "Isabella has her issues, Mr. Falcon. But you? You should get checked too."

She turned and left before he could respond.

Nathaniel's hand clenched at his side. This woman knew exactly how to provoke him.

Isabella broke the silence. "Nathaniel, forget her. She's not worth your anger."

Victoria nodded. "Exactly. Where is Dr. Sinclair? He should be here by now."

The mention of the renowned physician sent a ripple of tension through the room. He was Isabella's last hope.

Nathaniel checked his watch. The scheduled time had passed, but there was no sign of Dr. Sinclair.

Just then, a nurse entered. "Mr. Falcon."

Isabella, Theodore, and Victoria straightened. "Is Dr. Sinclair here?"

The nurse addressed Nathaniel. "Dr. Sinclair arrived earlier but has already left."

What?

Nathaniel scanned the hallway but saw no one—only Harrison disappearing around the corner.

His frown deepened. "I didn't see him."

The nurse hesitated. "He came, but... he chose not to stay."

"Why?" Isabella's face paled. Theodore and Victoria looked equally stunned. "Why wouldn't he treat me?"

The nurse lowered her voice. "I'm sorry. He refused to take Miss Isabella's case."

Isabella's breath hitched. Dr. Sinclair—refusing her?

Their hope shattered like glass.

Isabella's composure broke. "Why? Why won't he help me?"

Theodore and Victoria rushed to console her. "We'll fix this, Isabella. We'll bring him back!"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his gaze fixed on the empty hallway. His presence alone radiated danger.

Outside the hospital, a voice called, "Harrison."

She paused, turning slowly. Victoria had followed her.

Victoria approached, holding out a check. "Take this."

Harrison glanced down—$20,000.

"Nathaniel doesn't love you," Victoria said sharply. "Let him go. Give him back to your sister. Divorce him, take the money, and start over somewhere far away."

Harrison almost laughed. If she hadn't secretly done a DNA test, she might have believed Isabella was Victoria's real daughter.

But she wasn't.

Victoria was only Isabella's stepmother. Yet she adored Isabella—not Harrison, her own flesh and blood.

Harrison knew why. Victoria was obsessed with Theodore.

Her voice was calm, her smile faint. "So, being Mrs. Falcon is worth this little to you? Or is that all I'm worth?"

Victoria stiffened. "Harrison, I'm your mother. I'm trying to help you. You don't belong here—"

Mother?

The word tasted bitter. Harrison laughed softly.

"You sent me away once. Now you want to do it again. What a wonderful mother."

Without another glance, she stepped into a waiting taxi.

Inside, she sat quietly, pulling a candy from her bag. She unwrapped it and let the sweetness dissolve on her tongue.

The driver glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She wore a simple dress, elegant yet fragile, as if a strong wind might break her.

He smiled kindly. "You like sweets, miss?"

Harrison turned her face toward the window, the breeze lifting her hair. "A little sweetness makes the bitterness easier to swallow."

Victoria stood frozen, watching the taxi disappear.

Then a voice spoke behind her. "Mrs. Whitmore."

She turned to see Gregory Whalen, the head of the naturopathy center.

Victoria hurried to him. "Dr. Whalen, you have connections. Can you convince Dr. Sinclair to treat Isabella?"

Gregory smiled. "I know him personally. I can arrange an introduction."

Victoria's face lit up. "Thank you!"

His gaze drifted to where Harrison had vanished. A sly smirk curled his lips. "Mrs. Whitmore, was that your daughter? The one from the countryside? For a moment, I thought I'd seen an angel."

Victoria's expression turned to ice.
###Chapter 10
At the Whitmore family estate...

Darkness had settled over the grounds. Victoria lounged in the parlor, draped in a satin negligee, awaiting Theodore's return.

In her prime, she'd been the epitome of southern elegance, adored by Benjamin to the point of never needing to lift a manicured finger. After his passing, she'd married Theodore, who not only inherited Benjamin's empire but tripled its worth. As a society matron with flawless skincare routines, she remained striking decades later.

The grand foyer doors swung open as a maid ushered Theodore inside.

Victoria's face brightened instantly. She hurried to assist him with his tailored jacket. "Darling, what kept you so late?"

Unlike Benjamin's quiet sincerity, Theodore had always been rakishly charming. Now as CEO, his commanding presence made Victoria weak in the knees.

"Board meeting ran long," he dismissed.

As he spoke, Victoria caught the distinct floral notes of his assistant's perfume clinging to his collar.

Her smile vanished. "That little secretary again?"

Theodore's expression darkened. "Must we do this every night? Instead of these hysterics, perhaps focus on comforting Isabella? She's devastated Dr. Sinclair refused her case." He moved toward the staircase. "I'm exhausted."

Victoria's voice stopped him cold. "I've secured Dr. Sinclair for Isabella."

Theodore froze mid-step, spinning back with sudden warmth. He pulled her close. "My brilliant Victoria. You never disappoint. My greatest treasure."

No one played Victoria's heartstrings like Theodore.

She melted against him, pouting. "On one condition—that secretary gets fired tomorrow."

"Consider it done," he agreed instantly. Then without warning, he swept her into his arms.

Her cheeks flushed as silk slid to reveal lace beneath. "I thought you were tired?"

Theodore's grin turned wolfish. "Not when my wife wears this."

She swatted his shoulder. "You're impossible."

He carried her upstairs, chuckling. "And you love it."

The next afternoon found Harrison in her loft when Victoria called.

"Darling," came the uncharacteristically sweet tone. "I was wrong at the hospital. I've made all your childhood favorites. Come home for supper."

From the kitchenette, Gabrielle hissed, "Don't go! She's Theodore's puppet. At her age, still playing the blushing bride—pathetic."

Harrison's voice remained flat. "I'm busy." She moved to hang up.

Victoria rushed on, "Your father buried a vintage Bordeaux when you were born—to be opened when you came of age. I've unearthed it."

Harrison's breath caught. Victoria always knew which strings to pull.

The Whitmore mansion stood eerily quiet when Harrison arrived. Only Victoria waited beside a lavish spread and the dust-caked bottle labeled in Benjamin's uneven script: For My Harrison.

Her rough-handed, self-made father had adored her—unlike polished Theodore with his university pedigree. Harrison traced the faded ink, throat tight.

Victoria glowed with unnatural energy as she poured two glasses. "To new beginnings."

Harrison didn't lift hers. "How did Father really die?"

Victoria's hand jerked, wine sloshing. "I've told you—illness. You wouldn't understand—you're not a doctor!"

Harrison drained her glass in one bitter swallow. She'd uncover the truth.

As she stood to leave, a stranger blocked the doorway—Gregory from the Vitalis Health Center, leering like a starved wolf.

Victoria's mask slipped. "Harrison, sleep with Dr. Whalen, and Isabella gets Dr. Sinclair."

Heat exploded through Harrison's veins. The wine—drugged.

Her vision blurred with unshed tears. After everything, this?

Victoria avoided her gaze, shoving Gregory forward. "She's yours."

The moment Victoria left, Gregory lunged—only to collapse unconscious from Harrison's hidden sedative.

But the drug raged through her. Her emergency acupuncture needles—gone, likely discarded by Beatrice during her absence.

Stumbling to Benjamin's old study, she tore through drawers as the world spun.

Footsteps echoed in the hall.

Nathaniel?

The door burst open.

A burning body crashed into Nathaniel's arms.
###Chapter 11

Nathaniel caught Harrison as she stumbled into him. His piercing eyes swept over her, disapproval lacing his words. "Harrison, why are you back?"

She hadn't expected him home. Dressed in a tailored black suit that accentuated his broad shoulders, he carried the crisp winter air on his expensive fabric.

Instinctively, she leaned into his cool, controlled presence.

"Nathaniel, help me..." Her voice shook.

Before she could continue, he pushed her back firmly, brows knitting together. "What's wrong with you?"

Harrison hesitated, biting her lip. She couldn't believe she was about to beg him. "I've been drugged," she admitted softly.

Drugged?

Nathaniel's expression darkened. This woman was always in some kind of trouble.

"Stay here," he ordered.

He strode to the window, pulling out his phone. His tall frame was silhouetted against the night sky as he loosened his tie with effortless grace. The undone knot paired with his icy demeanor gave him a dangerously alluring edge.

Harrison forced herself to look away.

Sebastian answered on the second ring. "Nathaniel! What's going on?"

"Question. What do you do when a woman's been drugged?"

Sebastian laughed like he'd just heard juicy gossip. "Is Isabella in trouble? You know what to do—play the hero!"

"Be useful," Nathaniel snapped.

"Fine. Cold shower. Brutal but effective. Otherwise... well, things escalate."

Nathaniel hung up and turned to Harrison. "Can you handle a cold shower?"

She nodded weakly, cheeks flushed. "I'll try."

Without another word, she rushed to the bathroom.

Nathaniel shrugged off his jacket, draping it over a chair. As he rolled up his sleeves, a sharp cry cut through the air.

"Ahh!"

His jaw clenched as he marched to the bathroom. "Now what?"

Inside, Harrison stood under the showerhead, her thin camisole clinging to her curves. The delicate slope of her collarbone glistened under the lights. The water wasn't running yet—she was clutching her forehead with a pained expression.

"I hit my head," she whimpered, eyes brimming with tears.

Nathaniel's gaze narrowed. He pulled her hand away, revealing a red mark.

"You're impossible," he muttered.

"I'm not stupid," she protested weakly. "I'm dizzy..."

"Stay still."

What?

Before she could react, he turned on the shower.

Ice-cold water cascaded down, drenching her instantly. She gasped, instinctively throwing herself against him.

"It's too cold! I can't!" She trembled, pressing her soaked body into his, staining his white shirt and slacks.

He had no choice but to step back under the spray with her.

Harrison burned with heat. Like a parched fish, she craved relief. Her hands drifted to his waist, fingers tracing the ridges of muscle.

Nathaniel tensed immediately.

"Harrison, what are you doing?"

"Six-pack abs," she murmured, wonder in her voice.

He exhaled sharply.

Her gaze lifted to his face. "So handsome too," she breathed.

Nathaniel pinned her against the cold tiles, voice rough. "Behave."

Harrison smiled. "So strong. I like it."

He grabbed the showerhead and aimed it at her flushed face.

"Ahh!" She swatted at him. "Nathaniel, if it were Isabella, would you help her?"

He froze. "What?"

Her damp lashes trembled. "Because it's me, you make me suffer. None of you like me!"

Nathaniel noticed her red-rimmed eyes—had she been crying?

Suddenly, she lunged forward and bit his Adam's apple.

He hadn't expected that. Her teeth sank into the sensitive skin, sending a jolt straight to his spine.

This damn woman.

His arm encircled her waist—so soft, so small. Barely 20 inches. His fingers nearly met around it.

With her slender legs and narrow frame, he realized she was stunning.

His breathing grew uneven. He gripped her face, prying her off. Her flushed cheeks fit perfectly in his palm. "Do you always bite?"

Harrison had little control left. The alcohol and drugs made her pliant.

Tears shimmered in her eyes.

Nathaniel immediately released her.

But she clung to him, arms looping around his neck. "I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?"

Before he could answer, soft lips brushed his throat—a kiss.

A spark ignited in Nathaniel's gaze.

Her kisses trailed upward, marking his jaw with red imprints.

The little beast who'd bitten him now nuzzled like a kitten, lavishing him with affection.

"Have you and Isabella...?" she whispered.

His eyes darkened.

She rose on her toes, gaze fixed on his lips. "Nathaniel, I'm drugged. I'm still your wife. Won't you help me?"

His large hand tightened on her waist. Her delicate frame made him want to crush her closer.

Harrison leaned in, lips parting.

Nathaniel didn't pull away.

They were a breath apart—

Then his phone rang.

The screen flashed two words:

Isabella Whitmore.
###Chapter 12

The name 'Isabella' flashing on the screen snapped Nathaniel back to reality.

His shirt was half-soaked, his breathing ragged. Harrison's lipstick marks stained his collar. Moments ago, he'd been dangerously close to losing control.

He'd actually been aroused by Harrison.

Nathaniel didn't love Harrison. He convinced himself any man would react the same way to such temptation.

He answered the call, guilt softening his voice. "Isabella."

Loud rock music blasted through the phone. Isabella's sugary voice followed. "Nathaniel, I'm at The Velvet Lounge."

"Don't drink. Ask your assistant to get you juice," Nathaniel ordered.

"She always listens to you." Isabella giggled. "Come join me. I'm waiting."

Nathaniel turned to leave.

A small hand gripped his sleeve.

Harrison stood there, soaked. Her damp dress clung to every curve. Red-rimmed eyes pleaded silently as her fingers tightened.

Nathaniel tugged his arm. Harrison held firm, desperation in her gaze.

Before he could speak, she launched herself at him. Her arms locked around his neck. "Please don't go," she whispered against his ear.

Even grown, Harrison still feared abandonment. The thought of being left alone terrified her.

Isabella's voice chirped through the phone. "Nathaniel? Are you coming?"

Harrison rose on tiptoes. "Big Brother!"

The childhood nickname froze Nathaniel.

That name belonged to one girl.

But Isabella was that girl.

His expression darkened. "Something came up. I can't make it."

Ending the call, Nathaniel pinned Harrison against the wall. "Who told you to call me that?" His voice turned dangerous. "Who are you really?"

Harrison kissed him clumsily. Her soft lips tasted like strawberries.

Nathaniel kept his eyes open, studying her. Her expressive eyes mirrored his intensity.

Suddenly, he noticed—her eyes looked exactly like the girl from his past.

When Nathaniel didn't respond, Harrison pulled away, defeated.

She turned to leave.

Nathaniel yanked her back. His arms banded around her waist as he crushed his mouth to hers.

—

At The Velvet Lounge, Isabella twirled her cocktail straw.

"Mr. Falcon isn't coming?" her assistant asked.

Isabella's smile faded. Something felt off during that call.

She dialed Sebastian. "Is Nathaniel with you?"

"No," Sebastian said. "But he called earlier. Sounded like some woman got drugged."

A pause. "Wait—was it Harrison?"

Nathaniel's life revolved around Isabella—until Harrison appeared.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. 'He chose her over me?'

Her smile returned, sharp as broken glass. "Get me something special."

"What kind?"

Isabella's lips curved. "Something to make him regret leaving me tonight."

—

In the Rosewood Manor bathroom, Harrison's knees buckled under Nathaniel's kiss.

His arms kept her upright.

Her cheeks burned when his phone rang—a video call from Isabella.

Nathaniel answered, keeping Harrison in frame.

Isabella smiled from the bar, lifting a glass. "Is Harrison there? Did someone drug her?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

Isabella produced a powder packet, dumping it into her drink. She downed it in one gulp.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "What was that?"

"Let's call it... motivation." Isabella beamed.

Harrison's breath hitched. Isabella had drugged herself.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella's voice turned singsong as a handsome stranger approached.

"Buy you a drink, gorgeous?"

Isabella pointed at her phone. "That's my boyfriend. If he's not here in thirty minutes, I'm yours tonight."

The man smirked.

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "Isabella, stop this."

"Choose." Isabella's eyes glittered. "Her or me."

The call ended.

Nathaniel's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

'You can only pick one.'

The words echoed in Harrison's mind, transporting her back to childhood.

'Mom, you can only keep one daughter.'

Nathaniel was already moving, changing into dry clothes with military precision.

When he returned, his gaze pinned her. "What's your type?"

Harrison blinked. "What?"

Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. "I'll find you a man. Or two, if you prefer."
###Chapter 13

Harrison heard a strange ringing in her ears. Did Nathaniel just imply setting her up with other men?

His decision was final.

Without a second thought, he had chosen Isabella.

It felt like a jagged knife plunging into Harrison's chest, twisting mercilessly until she was nothing but shreds. Her hands shook violently as she fought to speak.

"Nathaniel, I'm still...your wife..."

Now impeccably dressed in his signature black ensemble, Nathaniel had transformed back into his usual detached self, as if the earlier turmoil never occurred. His voice was glacial as he extended something toward her.

"Take this."

Harrison looked down. A check with eight zeros stared back.

His cold baritone voice echoed above her. "Harrison, this concludes our marriage. It's over."

Nathaniel placed the check on the marble countertop and strode out, leaving Harrison paralyzed.

He was going to Isabella.

Just like her mother had done years before.

Harrison's vision blurred as hot tears spilled over. Once again, she'd been discarded. No matter how desperately she clung - whether to her mother or Nathaniel - their love always went to Isabella.

No effort was ever enough.

Voices soon approached from outside.

One of Nathaniel's men had arrived, speaking with Beatrice. "Mr. Falcon sent me. I'm here for Mrs. Falcon. Where is she?"

"In the master suite. This way," Beatrice answered.

Their footsteps grew louder.

Panic seized Harrison's throat. She couldn't believe Nathaniel's efficiency - he'd already dispatched someone.

The irony burned.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

The footsteps stopped right outside the door.

Harrison moved like lightning. She flung open the window. Though it was the second floor, she didn't hesitate. After climbing out, she jumped.

She landed hard on the manicured lawn below, white-hot pain shooting through her ankle. Biting back a scream, she ignored her disheveled appearance and fumbled for her phone, dialing Gabrielle.

The line connected. "Harrison? It's past midnight. Where are you? Out partying?"

Hearing Gabrielle's voice shattered Harrison's fragile composure. The dam broke as scalding tears streamed down her cheeks.

Meanwhile at The Velvet Lounge, Isabella sat at the bar, her flawless complexion flushed from the drugs, enhancing her allure.

The muscular man beside her couldn't resist sliding an arm around her shoulders. "Time's almost up, beautiful. Looks like your man stood you up. Guess you're mine tonight."

Isabella ignored him, watching her phone's countdown.

"Relax," she purred. "Five seconds remain. He'll come. Five...four...three...two...one..."

At "one," the weight on her shoulder disappeared.

Nathaniel had the man's wrist in a vice grip. With one brutal twist, bone snapped.

"Ahhh!" the man screamed, clutching his broken wrist.

Isabella turned to see Nathaniel.

He'd arrived.

Nathaniel's broad frame radiated cold fury, his presence dominating the space. Without sparing a glance at the whimpering man, he shoved him aside with enough force to send bottles crashing.

Another pained cry echoed.

Isabella stood, wrapping herself around Nathaniel's arm with a triumphant smile.

"Told you," she cooed. "My man always comes for me."
###Chapter 14

Between Isabella and Harrison, Nathaniel would always choose Isabella.

Harrison was never her match.

Nathaniel's icy stare cut through the man before him, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Get out."

The man scrambled away without a backward glance.

Nathaniel's sharp gaze shifted to Isabella as he freed his arm from her grasp. "Isabella, are you done with your theatrics?"

She stiffened, her face freezing. "You're blaming me? If I hadn't intervened, you'd be in bed with Harrison right now!"

His expression remained unreadable. "So you drugged yourself?"

Isabella, accustomed to Nathaniel's indulgence, lifted her chin defiantly. "Yes. Touch Harrison, and I'll let another man touch me."

Nathaniel's face darkened, the air around him turning frigid. Without another word, he turned on his heel and walked away.

He left.

No attempt to placate her.

As Nathaniel moved through The Velvet Lounge, every female eye followed his commanding presence. Their hungry gazes lingered on his striking features.

Isabella, ever the strategist, wouldn't give Harrison—or any of these women—a chance.

The spoiled princess swallowed her pride and lunged forward, wrapping her arms around Nathaniel's waist from behind. "Nathaniel, don't go." He stopped.

She clung tighter, her red lips forming a pout. "Nathaniel, I'm sorry. I just... love you too much. The thought of you with another woman destroys me."

Her face pressed against his back. "Nathaniel, I feel so dizzy."

After a tense silence, Nathaniel turned. Without speaking, he scooped her into his arms.

Her delicate frame looked perfect against his broad chest, drawing envious stares. Isabella looped her arms around his neck, a triumphant smile playing on her lips.


and
Thirty minutes later, Nathaniel carried Isabella into Rosewood Manor.

Unlike the marital home he shared with Harrison at Emerald Heights, this was his private sanctuary. The monochrome interiors screamed understated luxury, every detail oozing wealth.

In the master bedroom, Nathaniel deposited her on the plush bed.

As he turned to leave, Isabella's arms snaked around his neck. "Nathaniel, are you still angry?"

He reached to remove her hands.

But she leaned in, her face inches from his. "Big Brother," she breathed.

Nathaniel froze.

For a fleeting moment, Harrison's face flashed in his mind. Had Harrison ever called him that?

No, impossible. That endearment belonged solely to Isabella.

Placing his hands on either side of her, Nathaniel leaned closer. "Don't do this again."

Isabella knew "Big Brother" was her trump card—the one thing that guaranteed his forgiveness.

Suddenly, Nathaniel asked, "Isabella, where's the jade pendant I gave you?"

Her eyes flickered.

The pendant wasn't here. She needed to retrieve it before he found out.

"It's at home," she lied quickly, changing tactics.

Isabella tightened her grip, pulling him closer until their lips almost touched. The tension between them crackled. "Nathaniel, I've been drugged," she whispered.

His gaze dropped to her flushed lips. "And?"

"You're my antidote."

She closed the distance between them.
###Chapter 15

Nathaniel's thoughts drifted back to Harrison's delicate features, those soft lips that had tasted like summer blossoms. He could still feel the ghost of their recent kiss lingering on his mouth.

As Isabella leaned in, her perfume overwhelming his senses, Nathaniel abruptly turned his face away.

Her lips met empty air. "Why are you rejecting me?" Isabella's voice dripped with wounded pride.

The question echoed in Nathaniel's mind. Isabella was supposed to be the one he desired. Kissing her should feel natural. He didn't even like Harrison.

Yet Harrison's kiss haunted him. The memory of those lips burned brighter than any touch from Isabella. His obsessive need for cleanliness recoiled at the thought of moving between women so casually. It felt... dirty.

A sharp knock interrupted them.

"Sir, the antidote has arrived." Dominic's voice carried through the door.

Antidote?

Isabella froze. She'd taken those pills herself, and Nathaniel had actually gone to procure an antidote?

Nathaniel removed Isabella's clinging hands and stood. Enraged, she grabbed the nearest pillow and hurled it at his retreating form.

"Are you even a man, Nathaniel?"

She'd practically served herself on a silver platter, gone so far as to drug herself for him. Yet he still refused her.

The pillow bounced harmlessly off Nathaniel's back. He didn't even glance back. "Rest."

The door clicked shut behind him.

Isabella sat seething in the sudden silence.

In his study, Nathaniel stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silhouette cutting a sharp figure against the city lights. Dominic entered quietly.

"Sir, Isabella has taken the antidote."

Nathaniel didn't turn. "And Emerald Heights?"

"My assistant reported the room empty when he arrived. Mrs. Falcon had already left."

Nathaniel's profile tensed. "Where did Harrison go?"

What Harrison didn't know was that the visitor had come bearing the antidote Nathaniel sent.

Dominic hesitated. "Sir... someone collected her."

'Collected?' Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

She'd taken powerful aphrodisiacs. Who could have taken her?

His voice turned razor-sharp. "Man or woman?"

Dominic shifted uncomfortably. "That—"

"Never mind." Nathaniel cut him off sharply. What did it matter? He didn't care about Harrison. Their divorce was imminent. None of his concern.

"Dismissed."

As the door closed, Nathaniel stood alone, fingers working restlessly at his collar buttons. His reflection in the glass revealed a faint bite mark on his throat—small, precise, undeniably Harrison's doing.

Memories flooded back—Harrison lunging at him in Emerald Heights, teeth sinking into his throat before curling against him like a contented cat, her lips tracing fire across his skin.

Nathaniel squeezed his eyes shut, irritation twisting his handsome features. Since that bathroom encounter, unwanted thoughts of Harrison had invaded his mind repeatedly.

A fluke. A mistake.

The desire he'd felt for her meant nothing.

When his eyes opened again, all emotion had been locked away behind impenetrable ice.

Morning light filtered through gauzy curtains as Harrison sat curled in a wicker chair, a book lying forgotten in her lap. Gabrielle paced like a caged tiger.

"That bastard Nathaniel must have been kicked by a mule! Choosing that homewrecker Isabella over his own wife? And Isabella—God, I've seen desperate, but drugging herself? Trash doesn't even begin to cover it!"

Gabrielle's anger burned white-hot. Last night, when she'd arrived to collect Harrison, she'd found her best friend huddled on the floor, arms wrapped around her knees. Harrison had looked up with tear-streaked cheeks—a lost kitten abandoned in the rain.
###Chapter 16

Harrison found it amusing. Gabrielle hadn't stopped ranting about Nathaniel and Isabella since last night. Her persistence was truly impressive.

Truthfully, Harrison had long mastered the art of healing herself amidst chaos.

She unwrapped a large piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The burst of sweetness made her lips curl. "Gabrielle, take a breather. Right now, we focus on revenge. An eye for an eye."

Gabrielle knew Harrison was about to teach these people a lesson. She was more than capable.

Still, Gabrielle couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy. Every time Harrison shattered and had to piece herself back together, it must have been agony.

A muffled noise echoed from the storage room.

Harrison set her book aside, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Let’s go. We’ll start with Dr. Gregory."

Yesterday, she had drugged Gregory and dragged him here.

Harrison led Gabrielle into the storage room, where Gregory sat bound, hands and feet tied, a cloth stuffed in his mouth. His eyes widened when he saw her, and he thrashed against his restraints.

Gabrielle yanked the cloth from his mouth.

Gregory spat curses. "You drugged me? Do you have any idea who I am? I know Dr. Sinclair! Your mother begged for my help once. What the hell do you think you're doing, you backwater nobody? You should be grateful I even glanced your way!"

Gabrielle rolled up her sleeves, ready to strike, but Harrison stopped her.

She stepped forward, looking down at Gregory with cold amusement. "You claim to know Dr. Sinclair?"

Gregory’s face twisted with arrogance. "You’ve heard of Dr. Sinclair, haven’t you? Let me educate you—she’s a medical prodigy, a miracle worker! Someone like you would never get within ten feet of her. But me? I know her personally!"

Harrison arched a brow, lips curving. "Prove it."

Gregory scoffed. "I have her number. I’ll call her right now, in front of you."

Harrison nodded. "Go ahead."

Gabrielle untied him.

Gregory stood, fishing his phone from his pocket. He did have Dr. Sinclair’s number—he’d stolen it from the director’s office during Isabella’s surgery.

He grinned smugly. "Watch and learn."

He dialed.

The line rang once before connecting.

Gregory immediately adopted a sycophantic tone. "Dr. Sinclair! This is Gregory from the naturopathy center. I’ve admired your work for years. Would you honor me with a meeting?"

A smooth voice replied, "Turn around."

Gregory froze. "Turn around? What—?"

The voice wasn’t just in his ear. It came from behind him.

Slowly, he turned.

Harrison stood there, phone in hand. She winked, her smirk deepening. "Congratulations, Dr. Gregory. Now you really know Dr. Sinclair."

Gregory paled, gaping at her.

Harrison, draped in an elegant gown that pooled around her ankles, regarded him like he was nothing more than a circus act.

His knees gave out.

With a loud thud, he collapsed at her feet.
###Chapter 17

In the elegant living room of the Whitmore family villa, Theodore sat on the plush sofa, his gaze fixed on Victoria. "Victoria, are you absolutely certain Dr. Sinclair will agree to treat Isabella?"

A sly smile played on Victoria's lips. Last night, Harrison had left with Dr. Gregory under the influence of the drug. Those few hours must have been explosive between them. Now that Dr. Gregory had gotten what he wanted, he would surely arrange for Dr. Sinclair's treatment.

Victoria's smile widened. "Don't worry, darling. Dr. Gregory will bring us good news soon."

She slid onto Theodore's lap with practiced ease. The powerful CEO exuded that irresistible middle-aged charm. Looping her arms around his neck, she purred, "Sweetheart, I'm the one who made this connection with Dr. Sinclair. Don't I deserve a reward?"

Theodore pinched her nose affectionately. "Didn't I reward you thoroughly last night? Wasn't that enough for you?"

Victoria pouted playfully and produced a bottle of pills from her pocket. "Darling, I don't want to take these anymore. I want to give you a son."

Theodore's expression darkened instantly.

Throughout their marriage, Victoria had never conceived because Theodore wouldn't allow it. Those pills had been her constant companion for years.

Victoria knew Isabella was Theodore's precious daughter, the one he'd move heaven and earth for. After all, Isabella was that woman's child.

But...

Masking the cunning glint in her eyes, Victoria clung to Theodore, whining like a spoiled child. "Sweetheart, Isabella's all grown up now. Soon she'll be Mrs. Falcon. Let's have our own son together."

Theodore remained silent.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Gregory had arrived.

Victoria's eyes sparkled as she quickly slid off Theodore's lap. Once Dr. Sinclair agreed to treat Isabella, she could press Theodore about the baby.

"Dr. Gregory!" she greeted brightly. "Did Harrison satisfy you last night?"

In her excitement, she missed the unease flickering across Gregory's face.

Gregory's eyelid twitched. "Very much so."

Victoria beamed. "Then you'll arrange for Dr. Sinclair to treat Isabella, won't you?"

Theodore stood, hope shining in his eyes. "Dr. Gregory, name your price. Whatever Dr. Sinclair wants to treat Isabella."

Gregory glanced at Victoria. "Mrs. Whitmore, I'm here to deliver a message from Dr. Sinclair."

"What is it?" Both Theodore and Victoria tensed.

"Dr. Sinclair says to stop wasting your time. Isabella will never receive treatment from him."

"What?" Victoria's face drained of color. "Dr. Gregory, you must be mistaken!"

Theodore turned icy eyes on Victoria. "This was your brilliant plan? Getting Isabella blacklisted by Dr. Sinclair?"

"Darling, I don't understand what happened! Let me explain—"

Victoria grabbed for Theodore's sleeve, but he shoved her away violently. She stumbled backward, slamming into the wall with a sickening thud.

Her forehead connected with the wall, leaving an angry red mark. Tears sprang to her eyes from the pain.

"Theodore..."

His gaze fell on the contraceptive pills scattered across the coffee table. "You're right. You won't need these anymore. Because you'll never get the chance."

With that, he stormed out.

Victoria's face turned ashen. "Theodore!"

She whirled on Gregory, gripping his arm. "What happened? We had a deal! I delivered Harrison to your bed in exchange for Dr. Sinclair's treatment! How could this—"

Her voice died when she noticed the slender figure standing in the doorway.

Harrison had arrived.
###Chapter 18

Harrison stood motionless, her piercing gaze silently absorbing Victoria's panicked expression.

Victoria froze completely.

Theodore rushed forward immediately, bowing obsequiously. "Ms. Whitmore."

With deliberate slowness, Harrison pulled a fountain pen from her pocket and tossed it into the pool. "Dr. Gregory, I seem to have dropped something."

"Right away, Ms. Whitmore!"

Without hesitation, Theodore plunged into the chilly autumn waters.

Victoria watched in stunned silence as he emerged moments later, clutching the pen like sacred treasure. "Your pen, Ms. Whitmore!"

Harrison's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Surprised?"

Victoria's mind reeled. What power did Harrison wield to command such obedience?

"Frankly," Harrison continued, stepping closer, "I've never understood your hatred. You stole my father's estate, seized his company, abandoned his daughter, even poisoned the wine he left me."

Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Consider this a warning. The Harrison you knew is gone. Cross me again at your peril."

Victoria recoiled from the icy darkness in Harrison's once-bright eyes - now fathomless pits promising retribution.

Outside, a Rolls-Royce pulled up just as Harrison reached the lawn. Nathaniel had returned with Isabella.

Dressed in an impeccable black suit, Nathaniel exuded power. Isabella glowed in crimson silk beside him, the perfect couple.

Harrison's breath caught. Last night's betrayal flooded back - Nathaniel leaving her to find another man. The fresh wound tore open again.

"Harrison!" Victoria called mockingly. "Isabella didn't come home last night. She stayed at Rosewood Manor until morning."

The implication struck like a blade - Nathaniel's private estate where Harrison had never been welcome.

Victoria laughed cruelly. "Nathaniel doesn't love you. What does sabotaging Dr. Gregory matter? For Isabella, he'll simply get Dr. Sinclair!"

Harrison arched a brow. "Will he now?"

Just then, Nathaniel and Isabella approached. "Harrison?" Isabella feigned surprise, clinging to Nathaniel's arm. "You're not upset about last night, are you?"

Victoria smirked, awaiting Harrison's humiliation.

Harrison straightened, her smile razor-sharp. "Darling, I wouldn't waste anger on such... inadequate kissing."
###Chapter 19

Isabella and Victoria's faces transformed instantly.

Harrison turned to Isabella with feigned shock. "Oh dear! Don't tell me Nathaniel never mentioned our passionate kiss last night?"

She tapped her chin thoughtfully. "When Nathaniel kissed me, it was all teeth and desperation. Honestly, I've had better kisses from teenagers."

Isabella gaped at Nathaniel. He'd actually kissed Harrison?

Nathaniel's chiseled features turned glacial. Whether from Harrison's deliberate revelation or her public critique of his technique, his piercing gaze darkened dangerously as it locked onto her.

"Harrison!" His voice held clear warning.

She smirked. 'What?'

Was he seriously upset over her mentioning Isabella?

Her sharp eyes met his. "Stop yelling. With skills that pathetic, I wouldn't touch you again if you paid me. Let's end this farce!"

The stunned silence could have been cut with a knife.

Had Harrison completely lost her mind?

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Fine. We'll file the papers today."

Now seated in the back of Nathaniel's Bentley Continental, Harrison watched his rigid posture as he drove them toward city hall. The luxurious interior crackled with unspoken tension.

Nathaniel's tanned hands flexed on the leather steering wheel as he navigated the morning traffic with military precision.

"Who picked you up last night?" The question sliced through the silence.

Harrison's pulse jumped. "Your hired help didn't appeal to me. I found someone more... skilled."

She added deliberately, "A man who actually knows how to use his tongue."

The steering wheel creaked under Nathaniel's grip. His reflection in the rearview mirror showed eyes like shards of ice.

"Harrison, this obsession with last night's kiss - should I be flattered?"

She scoffed. "Projecting much? Sounds like you're the one who can't forget it."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line.

He clearly regretted asking.

The suffocating silence returned, heavier than before.

A melodic ringtone shattered the tension. The dashboard display showed a call from Falcon Estate.

Nathaniel answered via Bluetooth.

The butler's voice filled the car. "Young Master, your grandmother's condition has worsened. She's asking for Mrs. Falcon. You must bring her immediately."

Nathaniel's grip tightened. 'Of all times...'

He abruptly changed direction toward the family estate.

Harrison sat forward. "Where are we going?"

"Grandmother wants to see you." His tone brooked no argument. "You'll play your part."

She laughed bitterly. "Pretend we're happily married? That ship has sailed."

"Since when did you have principles?" Nathaniel sneered. "You've been acting this role for years."

The barb struck deep. Eleanor Falcon's fragile health had always weighed on Harrison. During their visits, while Nathaniel remained distant, she'd been the one maintaining the charade of affection.

Her one-woman performance.

And now he threw it in her face.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at Falcon Estate. As Harrison crossed the manicured lawns, she collided with someone leaving the main house - Arabella Falcon.
###Chapter 20

Arabella, Nathaniel's cousin, had always been particularly close to Isabella. The moment she spotted Harrison, her expression twisted with open contempt.

"Harrison, Nathaniel doesn't want you here. Yet you keep cozying up to Eleanor? Honestly, you're nothing but a charity case in this family! A country girl who only got to be his wife because Isabella was away. Do you really think you belong at Falcon Enterprises? You're not worthy of Nathaniel! Just sign the divorce papers already!"

Harrison barely flinched. She'd grown accustomed to this treatment from Nathaniel's family and friends alike.

Without acknowledging Arabella, she strode past her into the grand estate.

Eleanor's silver hair gleamed under the chandelier as her face lit up at Harrison's arrival. She reached out with trembling hands. "My dear, why has it been so long? Don't you miss your old grandmother?"

This was the only genuine affection Harrison had ever known in the Falcon household. Eleanor truly cherished her.

Harrison's lips curved into a soft smile as she gently embraced the older woman. "Of course I've missed you, Grandma."

Eleanor's joy was palpable, her smile refusing to fade.

Just then, Nathaniel's imposing figure filled the doorway.

Harrison immediately released Eleanor. "Grandma, I noticed you haven't had your herbal remedy this week. Let me prepare some for you."

She disappeared into the kitchen before Nathaniel could speak.

Nathaniel took the seat beside Eleanor. "Grandmother."

Eleanor's gaze followed Harrison's retreating form. "Nathaniel, have you been fighting with Harrison?"

Not wanting to upset his grandmother's fragile health, Nathaniel simply said, "No."

"Then why does she flee every time you enter a room? That never used to happen."

Eleanor's expression turned grave.

"Don't let Isabella cloud your judgment. Three years ago when you fell into that coma, she abandoned you without hesitation. It was Harrison who married you in that condition, who cared for you daily."

Her grip tightened on his hand.

"During those three years when I could barely function from grief, Harrison tended to us both. She prepared every remedy, managed this household. Without her, our family would have crumbled."

Eleanor's voice dropped to a whisper.

"I know people, Nathaniel. That girl loves you with her entire being. Don't make the mistake of taking that for granted. When a woman's heart breaks completely, she leaves without looking back."

Nathaniel's gaze drifted toward the kitchen. Harrison's raven hair was swept into a loose ponytail, revealing the elegant curve of her neck. The sight caught his breath.

The distinctive aroma of her herbal preparations soon filled the air - that same bittersweet fragrance he remembered from his coma. Though unconscious, he'd been aware of gentle hands tending him daily.

He'd assumed they belonged to Isabella.

Upon waking to find Harrison by his bedside, he'd been... confused.

That evening, Eleanor insisted they stay overnight. Neither could refuse her.

When Nathaniel entered their assigned bedroom, Harrison sat with her back to him, writing intently. Her phone on the desk played a message from Gabrielle:

"Sweetheart, you're about to be free! Stop playing housemaid for those people and meet me tomorrow. I've lined up three perfect candidates for you."
###Chapter 21

"A blind date?"

Nathaniel's entire demeanor turned glacial in an instant. His fingers moved to loosen his tie, jaw clenched tight.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

Gabrielle's rapid-fire WhatsApp messages flooded in, followed by auto-playing voice notes that filled the silent room.

"Harrison! Check out this absolute specimen - eight-pack abs, personal trainer. Imagine resting your head on those at night!"

"And this adorable puppy-dog type - shy but so much fun once he opens up!"

"Oh! The business tycoon with those gold-rimmed glasses - cold exterior but total heartthrob material! Should we make him serenade you on his knees?"

"Darling, consider this your personal selection of eligible bachelors. Take your pick!"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a razor-thin line. He hadn't realized his wife maintained an entire roster of potential suitors.

Harrison grabbed her phone and casually replied, "Got it. Be there soon."

When she turned, Nathaniel blocked her path. She extended a handwritten note.

"Mr. Falcon, Grandma Beatrice's herbal prescription. Simmer on high heat every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Must be consumed warm."

His gaze dropped to the elegant script detailing various medicinal ingredients.

"You studied medicine?"

"Just some basic knowledge," she shrugged.

Nathaniel didn't accept the paper. "I'll have our family physician verify this first."

Harrison expected nothing less. To Nathaniel Falcon, she'd always be that insignificant country girl beneath his notice. Not that she blamed him - born with a silver spoon, accustomed to the finest things.

She set the prescription on the table and grabbed her purse. "I won't be returning to Rosewood Manor. Find an appropriate time to tell Grandma about the divorce."

As she turned to leave, Nathaniel seized her wrist. "It's nearly midnight. Where exactly are you going?"

"Release me, Mr. Falcon," she demanded, twisting against his iron grip.

Nathaniel studied her frosty expression - such stark contrast to last night's passionate temptress who'd clung to him, stolen kisses with those irresistible eyes.

Now she looked at him like he was yesterday's trash.

A cold laugh escaped him. "Meeting your personal trainer? The shy boy? Or perhaps the bespectacled CEO? I never took you for such... adventurous tastes. Be careful what diseases you might bring home."

CRACK!

Her palm connected sharply with his cheek, the impact snapping his head sideways.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously. He shoved her backward onto the bed, looming over her trapped form. "Second time you've struck me, Harrison. Developing a habit?"

Isabella would never dare raise a hand to him. The slightest frown from Nathaniel would send her scrambling to please.

But this woman - who did she think she was?

Harrison met his fury with icy calm. "So you do understand the risks of promiscuity? How convenient you forgot that last night when offering to procure men for me."

###Chapter 22

Nathaniel froze for a moment.



Harrison lay beneath him, her raven-black hair fanned across the scarlet bedsheets—a color Eleanor had personally selected for their marital suite. The crimson fabric made her porcelain skin glow with an almost otherworldly radiance.

The scene should have been sensual. But the image of her like this with another man...

Nathaniel's hands clenched into fists without conscious thought.

He'd meant to explain that last night's "delivery" was medicine, not a lover. Yet the words stuck in his throat when he met her icy stare.

"Move."

She'd ordered him to move.

Nathaniel didn't.

Harrison began struggling, her delicate frame twisting beneath his muscular body. The memory of him bringing Isabella into his private wing last night flashed through her mind, making her recoil from his touch.

"Get off me, Nathaniel! After spending the night with Isabella, did you even shower?"

Nathaniel went rigid.

In one swift motion, he pinned Harrison's wrists above her head. "Stop squirming," he growled.

She fought harder, her lithe body writhing like a serpent beneath him. The thin fabric between them made every movement dangerously intimate.

Nathaniel's mind flashed to last night—how she'd melted against him, teasing him with those sinful lips. The memory combined with their current position ignited an unwelcome heat. His gaze darkened with unmistakable desire.

Harrison noticed immediately. She froze, her wide eyes filling with disbelief. "Are you...?"

Nathaniel cursed and released her, sitting up abruptly. "No."

Harrison sat up too, eyeing him warily. "But—"

A cold glare cut her off. "You're only this angry because I chose Isabella over you last night, aren't you? Did you really think I'd touch you?"

Harrison paled as if struck. She stood, her expression turning glacial.



"Then why care who I spend my nights with?" Nathaniel's face darkened. "You—"

Seeing his anger, Harrison smiled coolly. "Just let me know when the divorce is finalized. Until then, play all you want. I'll do the same."

As she turned to leave, a thought seemed to strike her. Those bright eyes flicked to Nathaniel's lips, and she smirked.

"Oh, and Mr. Falcon? Maybe practice your kissing. Do you even know how?"

With that, she was gone.

Nathaniel sat on the bed's edge, his broad chest heaving with suppressed fury. A storm of anger darkened his usually composed features.

"That damn woman!"

What was wrong with his kissing?

Why did she keep bringing it up?

A bitter laugh escaped him. He knew exactly what she was doing—playing her usual games, trying to provoke him into kissing her again. Just like when she'd implied he was... inadequate.

Her tricks hadn't changed.

Nathaniel reminded himself that Harrison was just a pretty face with no substance. Not his type. Any attraction was purely physical—just a natural male response.

His phone rang, cutting through the tension.

Isabella's custom ringtone.

Nathaniel's expression softened slightly as he answered. "Isabella."

Her cheerful voice bubbled through. "Nathaniel! Hurry to The Velvet Lounge! Alexander just returned from overseas—we're celebrating! Did you forget his welcome party?"
###Chapter 23
Nathaniel rubbed his temples, suddenly remembering.

Alexander Graves had come back to Willowbrook.

The Falcon and Graves families had always been the most prominent aristocratic dynasties in the city, their ties deep and unbreakable. He and Alexander had been inseparable since childhood.

Alexander's return was today, and now Isabella, Sebastian, and Arabella were all waiting at The Velvet Lounge.

Arabella's bubbly voice crackled through the phone. "Nathaniel, get your butt over here already!"

Arabella had been smitten with Alexander for years. Her ultimate fantasy was to become his wife, but the man had impossibly high standards—no woman had ever held his attention for long.

"I'm on my way," Nathaniel said, rising from his chair.

Honestly, Harrison going out to flirt with random men was none of his business. Why should it bother him?

A small-town girl with nothing better to do than chase after men—how utterly shallow. She could never measure up to Isabella.

Let her play her games. Who cared who she entertained?

That evening, a sleek Ferrari roared down the winding road.

Gabrielle, riding shotgun, laughed as the wind whipped through her hair. "Harrison, where the hell did you get this car?"

Harrison adjusted her oversized sunglasses, her dark hair flying wildly behind her. "Nathaniel gave it to me."

Gabrielle's irritation toward Nathaniel softened slightly. "Okay, the man might be a complete ass, but at least he's generous. Checks, cars, mansions—he throws them around like candy."

Harrison smirked. True enough.

A sudden engine growl cut through the night. A silver Lamborghini, heavily modified, pulled up beside them.

Some of Willowbrook's elite had a taste for street racing and custom cars.

The Lamborghini's driver—a devastatingly handsome man—leaned out, flashing a grin. "Hey, gorgeous. Never seen you around before. How about we exchange numbers?"

Harrison hadn't expected a pickup attempt mid-drive.

She ignored him and slammed the accelerator. The Ferrari shot forward like a bullet.

"Damn!" Gabrielle whooped, gripping the seat. "Harrison, you're insane!"



Harrison smirked. She'd raced professionally overseas—shaking off some rich playboy was child's play.

Then her smile vanished.

The Lamborghini was gaining. Fast.

The man arched a brow, his smirk widening—this just got interesting.

Harrison gritted her teeth.

She floored it again, the Ferrari screaming down the road.

The Lamborghini matched her move for move. The two supercars tore through the streets, drawing stares from bystanders.

At an intersection, Harrison feinted left, then swerved sharply into a narrow alley.

The Lamborghini tried to follow—only to be cut off by an oncoming truck.

Alexander slammed the brakes, watching helplessly as the Ferrari disappeared. Just before it vanished, a slender hand emerged from the window—flipping him off with a mocking thumbs-down.

He burst out laughing.

After years abroad, he'd returned to Willowbrook and found someone fascinating.

Alexander pulled out his phone and snapped a photo of the Ferrari's license plate.
###Chapter 24

The sudden chime of a phone shattered the tense silence. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

Harrison immediately knew. The Velvet Lounge. That's where Alexander wanted him.

With a sharp turn, Harrison redirected his car toward Willowbrook's elite district. If anyone could track down that Ferrari's owner in this city, it was Alexander.

Meanwhile, Gabrielle cheered as they sped through the narrow alley. "Harrison! You lost him!"

Her celebration was cut short by a deafening crash.

The Ferrari's front end crumpled against the brick wall.

Harrison's hands trembled on the wheel. Three years since her last race, and now this high-stakes chase had left her pulse racing.

They stepped out to survey the damage. The Ferrari's hood was now a mangled mess.

"Harrison... what now?" Gabrielle's voice shook as badly as her legs.

Taking a steadying breath, Harrison reached for her phone. "Dominic will handle this."

At The Velvet Lounge's most exclusive booth, two men commanded attention.

Alexander lounged in the center, Harrison taking the seat beside him. The undisputed kings of Willowbrook's elite circle. Every woman in the room stole glances their way.

Arabella practically glowed. Her long-time crush had finally returned! She batted her lashes at Harrison, inching closer on the plush seating.

Isabella occupied the space beside Alexander, surrounded by their usual entourage of wealthy heirs. Laughter and clinking glasses filled the air.

"Harrison! Years abroad and you finally grace us with your presence!" Sebastian raised his glass.

The group erupted in good-natured teasing.

"Tell us, Harrison - are the women overseas really more exciting than our Willowbrook beauties?"

Harrison swirled his drink, lips quirking. "None compare to what Willowbrook offers."

"Exactly! Our finest ladies are right here - Isabella and Arabella!"

Isabella preened at the compliment, accustomed to such praise as Willowbrook's reigning beauty.

Arabella gazed at Harrison through her lashes, hoping to catch his eye.

But Harrison's attention remained fixed on Alexander. "I need you to find someone."

Their glasses clinked. "Man or woman?"

"A woman."

Alexander smirked. "That explains your tardiness. Someone caught your interest?"

Harrison chuckled.

Years of friendship meant Alexander could read him effortlessly. "Must be someone special. What's she like?"

Harrison considered. "Like a storm wrapped in silk. One look and your world tilts."

The group fell silent. Sebastian blinked. "A Willowbrook woman?"

"Not Isabella or Arabella? Who could possibly intrigue our elusive Harrison?"

The question hung in the air. Harrison, known for his discerning tastes, had never shown interest in any woman before.

Isabella's smile faltered. Arabella stiffened.

Harrison pulled up the Ferrari's license plate photo. "Find out who owns this."
###Chapter 25


Nathaniel's gaze dropped to the photograph, his icy blue eyes narrowing dangerously. That Ferrari was unmistakable.

He looked at Alexander. "Was the woman driving this car?"

Alexander nodded, a smirk playing on his lips. "Yes. And she lost me. Quite impressive, actually."

Nathaniel remembered clearly—he had gifted that exact Ferrari to Harrison. Along with a hefty check, he'd given her several cars and properties. At the time, Dominic had mentioned she'd only chosen the sports car. It had struck him as odd—why would a woman from the countryside pick a high-performance vehicle?

Nathaniel knew Alexander's driving skills well. They raced together occasionally. But Harrison? She shouldn’t have been able to handle a car like that, let alone outmaneuver Alexander.

Just then, Dominic approached. "Sir."

Nathaniel stood. "Excuse me for a moment."

He stepped out of the lavish private room into a dimly lit corridor. Dominic lowered his voice. "Sir, Mrs. Falcon called earlier. She took the Ferrari out tonight. Reports say she was involved in a street race—ended up crashing into a wall. The front end is completely wrecked."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Is she hurt?"

Dominic shook his head quickly. "No injuries, sir. Should we send the car back to Italy for repairs?"

A cold edge crept into Nathaniel's voice. "No. Scrap it."

Dominic blinked. "Sir?"

"Destroy the car. I don’t want a single trace left. Understood?"

Dominic swallowed hard. Whoever had provoked the boss had a death wish—his temper was lethal when provoked. "Yes, sir."

"Go."

Dominic hurried off, leaving Nathaniel standing alone. A slow, humorless smile curved his lips.

He had clearly underestimated Harrison.

She had caught Alexander’s attention.

Alexander was looking for her.

Nathaniel hadn’t expected Alexander—a man with impossibly high standards—to show interest in someone like Harrison. They could all play their little games, but not Alexander.

Nathaniel returned to the private room. Alexander glanced up. "Everything alright?"

Nathaniel’s face remained impassive. "Just urgent paperwork. I’ve instructed Dominic to look into the car. You’ll hear if there’s news."

Alexander nodded. "Good."

Both Isabella and Arabella wore displeased expressions. Tonight was supposed to be about welcoming Alexander back, with Willowbrook’s most beautiful women by his side. Instead, the conversation had shifted to some unknown woman.

Arabella clenched her fists. Who was this nobody who had somehow caught Alexander’s eye?

Isabella, too, couldn’t fathom who in Willowbrook could possibly outshine her. Determined to reclaim the spotlight, she rose with a dazzling smile.

"Nathaniel, Alexander—how about a dance to liven things up?"

The room erupted in excitement. Sebastian and the other wealthy heirs cheered.

"Isabella! The prima ballerina performing for free?"

"We’re beyond lucky tonight!"

"Who could possibly compete with Isabella’s dancing?"

"Give her a round of applause!"

Under the eager gazes and thunderous applause, Isabella began her performance.

She had trained in ballet since childhood. Every movement was effortless, every spin mesmerizing. She lifted her leg gracefully, twirling with breathtaking precision, holding the room captive with her beauty.
###Chapter 26

All heads turned toward Isabella as she commanded attention at The Velvet Lounge. With effortless grace, she spun across the floor, stopping directly before Nathaniel.

Nathaniel remained motionless, his tall frame towering over her. Isabella pressed her lithe body against his, moving in perfect sync to the pulsing rhythm.

The electric connection between the striking man and captivating woman sent waves of excitement through the crowd.

Just then, Harrison and Gabrielle made their entrance. Harrison's gaze immediately locked onto Nathaniel and Isabella.

Bathed in swirling colored lights, the pair stood center stage - Isabella molded against Nathaniel, his intense focus solely on her. They were undeniably the main attraction.

Gabrielle scoffed loudly. "How shameless! Flirting like that with a married man."

Harrison merely smiled. "Nathaniel and Isabella have always been the golden pair. Let them be."

As they settled into their booth, Gabrielle couldn't resist needling. "Harrison, didn't you used to dance too?"

Memories flooded back. Harrison had indeed trained alongside Isabella. Where Isabella struggled through lessons, Harrison mastered routines instantly. Their instructor had adored her natural talent.

One evening, Isabella returned home in tears. That night, Victoria took a needle to Harrison's leg, hissing, "Still want to dance? Must you always outshine your sister?"

Young Harrison had curled into a corner, blood trickling down her leg, sobbing apologies. "It hurts...I won't dance anymore...I promise..."

She never did. Hearing of Isabella's ballet success always stirred complicated emotions.

Gabrielle suddenly yanked Harrison up. "Come on! Let's show them how it's done."

She dragged Harrison onto the dance floor.

At first hesitant, Harrison soon relaxed under Gabrielle's enthusiastic gyrations. "Stop punishing yourself for others' cruelty," Gabrielle shouted over the music. "Look at her! Throwing herself at your husband. If Nathaniel likes that style, let's give him a real show!"

The heavy bass pulsed through Harrison's veins. Muscle memory took over as her limbs began moving with instinctive precision.

Dancing came as naturally as breathing. Soon, Harrison and Gabrielle were executing an electrifying routine that turned heads across the club.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel watched Isabella with admiration as they danced. When she melted into his arms, his hand settled on her waist. "Tired?" he murmured.

Isabella smiled coyly. "Just want you to hold me."

Nathaniel's lips quirked, dark eyes gleaming with appreciation. He did admire Isabella - her talent, her drive.

Suddenly, the energy in the room shifted. Even the VIP section's elite turned their attention elsewhere.

"Check that out!" someone yelled.

"Who's the goddess on the dance floor? Damn!"

Nathaniel and Isabella both turned to see Harrison.

Nathaniel's expression transformed instantly.

Across the room, Alexander shot to his feet, stunned. "It's her!"
###Chapter 27

Nathaniel recognized Harrison instantly.

Isabella never expected to see Harrison on the dance floor, let alone moving with such sensual confidence. Harrison's body flowed with the music, every motion effortless yet electrifying. Her hips rolled with a rhythm that would make professional dancers envious, each movement more captivating than the last.

As a trained ballerina, Isabella hated admitting Harrison outshone her. Harrison possessed a raw, magnetic energy she couldn't replicate - more precise, more alluring, undeniably sexier.

Every man in The Velvet Lounge watched Harrison with hungry eyes. Whistles and cheers erupted around the dance floor. The atmosphere crackled with masculine appreciation.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. How could this provincial nobody dance like that? She, the prima ballerina, was being upstaged by Harrison's natural talent.

Why did Harrison always steal her spotlight?

Then Nathaniel's arm slipped from Isabella's waist. He stepped forward, his gaze locked on Harrison with unsettling intensity.

Nathaniel was staring at Harrison.

Isabella's blood boiled.

Sebastian and his wealthy friends rose from their seats, shock evident on their faces as they recognized the woman commanding the dance floor.

"Sebastian, you know her?" Alexander asked, eyes gleaming.

"Is that...Harrison?" Sebastian gasped.

Alexander's expression brightened. "Harrison?" His excitement was palpable. "She's exactly who I've been searching for!"

The group froze. The woman who'd captured Alexander's attention - this ethereal yet fiery dancer - was Harrison?

Sebastian looked skeptical. "Alexander, are you certain? There must be some mistake."

Arabella, who despised Harrison, gaped in disbelief. The country mouse she'd always mocked was now drawing Alexander's admiration? "Alexander, what could you possibly see in Harrison?" she blurted.

Isabella scoffed. "Alexander, stop joking. This isn't amusing!"

Alexander ignored them all. His eyes remained fixed on Harrison, a slow smile forming. "She's intoxicating."



Nathaniel's expression darkened. He'd already handled the Ferrari situation, but this new development unsettled him. Harrison - dancing like that, so provocatively - stirred something dangerous inside him.

What was she thinking? If she moved like that with a woman, how would she dance with a man? Was she deliberately seeking attention?

As the music faded, Harrison, glistening with sweat, exited the dance floor with Gabrielle. Their path led them directly past Nathaniel's VIP section.

Alexander intercepted them. "Hello, gorgeous. Fancy seeing you here."

Harrison paused, recognizing the man who'd flirted with her from the sports car.

"You," she said.

Alexander grinned. "Alexander, at your service. Fate seems determined to bring us together. May I buy you a drink?"

"Alexander?" Harrison didn't know him.

Then she felt it - that familiar, icy stare. Looking up, she met Nathaniel's glacial gaze. His eyes cut through her like shards of glass.

Why was he looking at her like that? Was he still upset about Isabella's earlier performance?

Alexander glanced between them. "Do you two know each other?"
###Chapter 28


Harrison deliberately ignored him. "I don't recognize him."

Those four words made Nathaniel's lips twist into a sardonic smirk, silently mocking Harrison.

Harrison might not know Alexander, but Gabrielle certainly did. This was about to get interesting. Alexander was Nathaniel's closest confidant.

Gabrielle laughed lightly. "Alexander, I think we should skip drinks tonight. Harrison needs to get home."

Alexander immediately grabbed his keys. "Then I'll drive you both."

He followed Harrison and Gabrielle as they walked away.

As the trio left, Sebastian and the other wealthy heirs exchanged shocked whispers. "What's happening? Is Alexander interested in Harrison?"

"But Harrison is still married to Nathaniel. Does this mean Nathaniel's about to be betrayed by both his wife and his best friend?" Sebastian blurted.

The moment the words left his mouth, Nathaniel's razor-sharp gaze sliced through him. Sebastian instantly clamped his mouth shut.

Nathaniel snatched his keys. "Enjoy your night. I'm leaving."

Arabella tugged helplessly at Isabella's sleeve. "Isabella, how could Alexander possibly like Harrison? First, she secretly marries Nathaniel, and now she wants them both?"

Isabella's expression darkened with displeasure. She hadn't anticipated Alexander showing interest in Harrison either.

She scoffed. "Her? Don’t waste your worry. Neither Nathaniel nor Alexander would ever seriously want someone like Harrison—a country girl. She doesn’t belong in their world."

Both Nathaniel and Alexander were the most coveted bachelors in Willowbrook’s elite circles. Harrison, with her background, had no place among them.

Isabella hurried after Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, wait for me!"

Arabella stomped her foot, seething. "Harrison, this isn’t over!"

Gabrielle pulled Harrison into Alexander’s sleek sports car, and they sped off.

Soon, Alexander noticed in the rearview mirror—a Rolls-Royce Phantom tailing them. Nathaniel’s car.

Alexander frowned. "Why is Nathaniel following us?"

Gabrielle glanced back, sensing the brewing drama. "Alexander, can you lose Mr. Falcon’s car?"

Alexander grinned. "Nathaniel and I race all the time. He’s methodical—I usually can’t beat him."



His eyes flicked to Harrison in the mirror, admiring her delicate features. "Nathaniel rarely meets his match. Maybe you should race him someday—see who’s better."

Harrison smiled faintly but stayed silent.

The Rolls-Royce clung stubbornly behind them. Alexander slammed the accelerator, determined to shake Nathaniel off.

Behind them, Nathaniel’s grip tightened on the wheel. He matched Alexander’s speed effortlessly. Isabella sat rigid in the passenger seat.

The car lurched forward violently.

Isabella’s stomach dropped. "Nathaniel, slow down! You’re going too fast!"

Nathaniel’s expression remained icy, his sharp profile cutting through the neon-lit streets like a blade. He ignored her completely.

Isabella, already pale, clutched the seat. Her heart pounded erratically. "Nathaniel, stop the car—STOP! NO—AHHH!"
###Chapter 29
"Ahhh!"

Isabella's piercing scream forced Nathaniel to slam on the brakes, bringing the Bentley to an abrupt stop.

She gasped for air, her heart pounding wildly. "Nathaniel! What were you thinking driving like that?"

His expression remained icy as he glanced in the rearview mirror. The Ferrari that had been tailgating them had already sped past during their sudden stop.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Are you injured?"

Isabella shook her head quickly. "I'm fine."

Then she muttered under her breath, "I can't believe Harrison managed to catch Alexander's attention. Did you see how she was moving on the dance floor? A country girl who dropped out at sixteen, yet she's mastered every trick in the book to seduce men. She's completely shameless!"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened as images of Harrison's sensual movements flashed through his mind. Isabella wasn't wrong - Harrison had clearly learned those seductive techniques somewhere. Even Alexander, who rarely showed interest in anyone, had been captivated.

"Nathaniel, have you finalized the divorce with Harrison yet?" Isabella pressed.

"Not yet."

Her eyes widened. "Why? Weren't you supposed to sign the papers today?"

She'd been certain it would already be done by now.

"Eleanor is very fond of Harrison. For her health, we've decided to postpone the divorce temporarily," Nathaniel explained coldly.

Eleanor was involved?

Isabella knew Eleanor disapproved of her. The old woman favored Harrison and was Nathaniel's biggest supporter.

A wave of panic washed over Isabella. As long as Eleanor lived, Nathaniel might never divorce Harrison, and she would never become Mrs. Falcon.

Frustration bubbled up inside her. "Nathaniel, why do you always obey your grandmother? What about me? I'm not getting any younger! A woman's prime years are precious. How much longer must I wait?"

Nathaniel shot her a chilling look. "If you'd wanted this three years ago, you could have been Mrs. Falcon already. This has nothing to do with Harrison now."

Isabella's mouth snapped shut, the verbal blow striking deep. She'd been expertly silenced.

But she was nothing if not adaptable. Within seconds, she softened her posture, leaning seductively against him and tracing his jawline. "Nathaniel, darling, I'm sorry. I just want to be your wife so badly. Don't you want that too?"

Her honeyed words seemed to bounce off him. He removed her hand with deliberate indifference. "I'm taking you home now."

Defeated, Isabella slumped back into her seat, her eyes darkening with malice. She hated waiting. She preferred action. She would make Nathaniel divorce Harrison immediately - even Eleanor couldn't stop her!

Thirty minutes later, the Bentley rolled onto the manicured lawns of Falcon Estate. Nathaniel had returned home alone.

He strode into the grand foyer, but Harrison was nowhere to be seen. She still hadn't returned.

His temper flared. She was out later than him.

By his calculations, Alexander should have dropped her off by now. Unless... she'd gone somewhere else with him.

Nathaniel yanked out his phone and dialed Harrison's number.

It rang once before connecting. His grip tightened on the device as he demanded, "Harrison, why aren't you home?"

Her clear voice came through the line. "Mr. Falcon, have you forgotten? I told you I wouldn't be returning there."

His voice turned dangerous. "How am I supposed to explain your absence to Eleanor? Harrison, get home now! Why must you always disappear? Who are you with?"
###Chapter 30

The call ended abruptly with two sharp beeps. Nathaniel stood frozen, staring at the blank screen in disbelief.

She actually dared to hang up on him!

Reginald approached just then. Nathaniel's voice was clipped as he ordered, "Tell Harrison that Grandmother Eleanor has taken a turn for the worse. She needs to return immediately."

The butler hesitated. "But sir, Madam Eleanor took the medicine Mrs. Falcon prepared and is resting comfortably."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously. "Lie to her! Is that so difficult to understand?"

Reginald shifted uncomfortably. "Sir, Mrs. Falcon has cared for you and your grandmother tirelessly these past three years. Surely she deserves one evening out—"

"Reginald." Nathaniel's voice cut like ice. "Make the call. Now."

Under that piercing gaze, the butler immediately reached for his phone. "Right away, sir."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw, frustration simmering. 'This household has gone completely mad. Ever since Grandmother took her under her wing, no one follows my orders anymore!'

Thirty minutes later, Harrison rushed through the estate gates. She burst into the darkened foyer, breathless. "What's happened to Grandmother Eleanor?"

Silence greeted her. The entire mansion stood eerily dark.

"Why are all the lights—"

Before she could finish, a powerful hand seized her wrist, yanking her forward. Harrison gasped as she collided with a hard, familiar chest.

Nathaniel pinned her against the wall with bruising force.

She knew that scent anywhere. Only Nathaniel would manhandle her like this in his own home.

Her hands flew up to push against his chest. "Nathaniel, have you lost your mind?"

His laugh was dark. "Oh, now you remember my name? Weren't you just pretending not to know me?"

Moonlight streamed through the windows, illuminating his furious expression as Harrison's eyes adjusted to the dark.

She frowned in confusion. "Are you seriously angry about that? Aside from your inner circle, no one knew we were married. Should I have introduced myself as Mrs. Falcon while you paraded Isabella around as your mistress?"

"That sharp tongue!" Nathaniel gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Did your new lover teach you to speak to me this way?"

"New lover?" Harrison's breath hitched as realization dawned.

"Alexander."

She stiffened, understanding Nathaniel's twisted assumption.

Rather than explain, she smirked. "We agreed to live separate lives, Nathaniel. You were practically dry humping Isabella at The Velvet Lounge, and I said nothing. What Alexander and I do is none of your concern."

When she tried to push past him, Nathaniel slammed her back against the wall. Pain shot through her shoulder as it connected with the hard surface.

Harrison's usually gentle eyes turned to ice. Her voice was steel. "Listen carefully. I treated you well before because I loved you. But that doesn't give you the right to mistreat me. That love is gone now."
###Chapter 31


Harrison might have endured a difficult past, but she never stopped believing in love.

Whether it was Victoria or Nathaniel, she had always loved with her whole heart. Loving someone didn't mean surrendering her dignity, and it certainly didn't give anyone the right to mistreat her—especially now that her feelings had faded.

She no longer loved Nathaniel.

Nathaniel studied her calm expression with icy detachment, his lips curling into a derisive smirk. "You're seriously telling me you don't love me anymore?"

"Yes—mmph!" Harrison barely got the word out before he crushed his lips against hers.

Her mind short-circuited. A dizzying wave of blankness swallowed her thoughts. Her eyes flew open in shock—he had actually kissed her.

This wasn't their first kiss, but last time, in the shower, she had been the one to initiate it. Now, he was the one taking control.

Harrison immediately fought back, shoving against his chest. "Nathaniel, let go of me!"

His powerful frame pinned her against the wall as his kiss deepened, rough and possessive, like he was staking a claim. Before she could react, he seized the chance to slip past her parted lips, invading her mouth with ruthless dominance.

Instantly, his crisp, masculine scent overwhelmed her. It was intoxicating.

Harrison had never been intimate with another man—she was inexperienced, untouched. Her body was hypersensitive, unfamiliar with this kind of contact. The heat of his lips and the slick slide of his tongue sent a flush burning through her. She felt herself melting, her resistance crumbling.

Her hands, which had been braced against his chest, slowly curled into fists, gripping the fine fabric of his designer shirt as her body went pliant against his.

Nathaniel felt her weakening and hooked an arm around her slender waist, pulling her flush against him. Then, abruptly, he broke the kiss.

Harrison's face was flushed, her lips swollen. "Why did you—"

His voice was a dark, mocking drawl. "Still sure you don't love me? One kiss and you're practically liquid in my arms."

Like this, she had the nerve to criticize his skills? Look at how wrecked she was already.

It was like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over her. The heat in her cheeks drained, replaced by humiliation. She realized then—his kiss had been nothing but a calculated humiliation.

He hadn't even closed his eyes. He had watched her unravel, cold and detached, taking pleasure in her helpless response.

Nathaniel smirked, his gaze lingering on the lingering haze in her eyes. "So responsive, aren't you?"

A man like him knew exactly what he was doing. And right now, his only goal was to make her feel small.

Harrison burned with shame. He had truly humiliated her.

She hated him—but she hated herself more, because her body still reacted to him. Maybe part of her still loved him, and that was exactly what he was mocking.

But Harrison wasn't the type to take humiliation lying down. If someone struck, she struck back—hard.

She steadied herself, then leaned in until her face was inches from his.

"Exactly. And if you can't satisfy me, I'll find someone who can. You've been sleeping with Isabella—why shouldn't I do the same? Nathaniel, what exactly are you so proud of? If Alexander kissed me, I'd react the exact same way."

She deliberately emphasized Alexander's name, her voice sharp with challenge.

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. A cruel smile twisted his lips.

"What a shame. I should've recorded what just happened and shown it to Alexander—let him see who's really playing his part."
###Chapter 32

This man!

Harrison was furious. She rose on her toes and sank her teeth into Nathaniel's lower lip.

"Damn!" Nathaniel hissed, tasting copper. She'd drawn blood.

His hands shot up to grip her face, squishing her lips into a pout. Fury burned in his gaze. "What the hell? Are you some rabid animal?"

Harrison met his glare with defiance. "You should worry about explaining that lip to Isabella tomorrow. Even with Alexander standing in for you, isn't she still getting my leftovers?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

Leftovers?

This infuriating woman!

"You can sleep around, but stay away from Alexander!"

"Why?" Harrison's voice dripped with mock innocence.

Truth was, Nathaniel considered Alexander a brother. The thought turned his stomach. His eyes raked over her with contempt. "You really think Alexander would want you? Dream on! All you know is shaking your ass in nightclubs. A high school dropout with no degree, no career. He'd play with you for a week tops before tossing you aside."

Harrison's chest constricted. So that was his opinion of her.

Typical male mentality - if they discard something, no one else can have it either.

Instead of anger, a slow smile curved her lips. "Did I look good dancing at The Velvet Lounge tonight?"

Nathaniel blinked. "What?"

Harrison shoved him hard. "From now on, I'll dance for him daily. Different routines every time. I'll make sure he never loses interest."

She spun on her heel and marched upstairs before he could respond.

Nathaniel stood frozen.

Harrison!!!

Harrison entered the bedroom, but Nathaniel followed, his expression stormy. "Eleanor's condition is worsening. We're postponing the divorce. You're staying tonight and playing the doting wife. Understood?"

Though his tone was harsh, Harrison recognized the gravity of Eleanor's health crisis. She nodded.

She turned, offering a sweet smile. "I don't mind. But I wonder if Isabella can wait."

Nathaniel's glare could freeze lava. "You take the bed. I'm on the couch. Showering first."

He disappeared into the bathroom.

Harrison's phone chimed - Oliver calling.

She answered. "Harrison, did you reject Isabella's appointment?"

"Yes."

Oliver's voice turned grave. "You can't. When we accepted, Nathaniel paid an enormous deposit. His legal team just served us papers. They're the best in the country - undefeated. He's demanding compensation that could bankrupt us."

Harrison's stomach dropped.

"Harrison, don't cross Nathaniel. He insists you show at Vitalis Health tomorrow. He wants to see you personally!" Oliver sounded frantic.

Harrison exhaled. Nathaniel always played to win. From the moment Oliver accepted that appointment, she'd been trapped.

"Fine. Tell him I'll be there." Resignation edged her words.

She hung up just as the bathroom door clicked open. Nathaniel emerged, steam curling around his towel-clad form.
###Chapter 33

Nathaniel stepped out of the shower, water droplets clinging to his toned physique. The black silk pajamas clung to his damp skin, his usually styled hair now falling in loose, wet strands that made him look years younger.

Harrison couldn't help but stare. The man was unfairly attractive.

His phone buzzed. Dominic's name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Falcon, Dr. Sinclair agreed to meet tomorrow at the wellness center." Dominic's voice came through crisp and professional.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Last time, the good doctor left without explanation. Tomorrow, I'll finally meet this elusive person."

A shiver ran down Harrison's spine. This was disastrous.

Nathaniel never forgot slights. Dr. Sinclair's previous cancellation had been noted, and now he'd get his answers.

"Going to shower?" Nathaniel's deep voice snapped her from her thoughts.

"Right." Harrison practically sprinted to the bathroom.

Nathaniel frowned, ending the call. Both Dr. Sinclair and Harrison seemed determined to test his patience. He towel-dried his hair before settling with some files.

"Nathaniel!" The honeyed voice floated through the door.

He set down his papers. That wasn't Harrison's usual sharp tone. It dripped with sweetness, like warm caramel.

The bathroom door cracked open, steam escaping. Harrison's damp face appeared, cheeks flushed pink from the heat. "Can I borrow a shirt?"

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "No sleepwear?"

She held up black lace lingerie. "Unless you'd prefer this?"

His expression went blank. Eleanor's meddling was obvious. He grabbed the nearest white shirt and launched it at her face. "Don't embarrass yourself."

The oversized fabric engulfed her completely.

Harrison yanked it off, glaring. With perfect aim, she smacked the lingerie against his chiseled face. "Maybe it'll look better on you."

The bathroom door slammed with enough force to rattle the mirror.

Nathaniel stared at the lace in his hands. Eleanor had certainly chosen... creatively. Without hesitation, he tossed it in the trash.

He'd barely returned to his files when the bathroom door clicked open.

Harrison emerged, drowning in his shirt. The white fabric emphasized her golden skin, the hem brushing mid-thigh. Her legs seemed endless.

Nathaniel swallowed. He'd been wrong earlier - Harrison's figure was perfection.

She ignored him, settling at the vanity. Bottles clinked as she applied skincare, leaving the air sweet with jasmine.
###Chapter 34


Three years of marriage, yet Nathaniel had never shared a bedroom with Harrison. In truth, he'd never shared a bed with any woman, making this moment entirely unfamiliar.

He watched as she meticulously applied her skincare, moving from serum to moisturizer. The ritual fascinated him.

Harrison caught his stare and turned sharply.

Their eyes locked before Nathaniel could look away.

She narrowed her gaze. "What? Never seen a woman before?"

"You should invest in books, not creams. Beauty fades. Intelligence doesn’t," he retorted coolly.

The "vase" comment made her fingers twitch. One day, she’d outshine his arrogance so brightly he’d need sunglasses.

Silent, she yanked the covers up and slid into bed.

A soft chime broke the quiet. Nathaniel glanced at his phone—Julian from Westfield had created a group chat, adding him and one other: W, the freshman prodigy who’d ignored his friend request.

Now they were trapped in the same digital space.

Julian’s message popped up:
[Welcome, Westfield’s finest! We’re beta-testing a speed-based coding game. Think you can handle it?]

Nathaniel typed a single OK.

W responded with the same.

The link appeared. Both clicked instantly, diving into the challenge.

Nathaniel finished in 10.4 seconds—flawless. His gaze flicked to W’s shadowy avatar. How fast was this mystery student?

Days ago, Julian had mentioned a girl edging closer to Nathaniel’s records. He’d dismissed it. Now, curiosity prickled.

Julian sent a screenshot:
[10.4 seconds. Both of you. Mind. Blown.]

Nathaniel’s fingers froze. No one had ever matched his time. Until now.

A smirk tugged his lips as he typed a new message, tagging W directly:
[Why reject my request?]

Across the bed, Harrison stared at her screen. Nathaniel was waiting for W’s reply, oblivious to her smirk.

Her fingers flew:
[You’re exhausting.]

Ding.

Nathaniel read it twice. A laugh escaped him. Exhausting? What had he done to earn that?

And why did this stranger’s disdain intrigue him so much?
###Chapter 35

Being labeled "annoying" without warning left Nathaniel utterly bewildered.

He dismissed the comment. Setting his phone aside, he refocused on the documents spread across his desk. When he finally finished, midnight had long passed.

Nathaniel rose to pour himself water. Turning toward Harrison, he noticed she'd already drifted into sleep.

Just as he prepared to return to the sofa, a soft chime sounded from her phone resting near the pillow. A text notification lit up the screen.

Nathaniel's sharp gaze landed on the device, then narrowed abruptly.

The glowing profile picture matched exactly with that of the prodigious freshman known as W.

He moved swiftly toward the bed, reaching for her phone.

Harrison stirred in her sleep, pressing her delicate cheek against his outstretched hand.

Nathaniel froze mid-motion. This couldn't be happening - was Harrison truly the same genius student W?

Impossible.

She was merely a decorative ornament.

His palm grew unexpectedly warm as Harrison, still dreaming, nuzzled against his hand like an affectionate kitten.

The soft lamplight illuminated her flawless complexion. Dark curls framed her slender neck, stray strands brushing against crimson lips. The striking contrast of pale skin, ebony hair, and scarlet mouth held him captive momentarily.

A woman's beauty could indeed be lethal, especially to a man's resolve. Nathaniel found himself staring despite himself.

With sudden determination, he withdrew his hand. He'd encountered countless beauties before - none had ever swayed him, and neither would she.

Nathaniel returned to the sofa and closed his eyes.

Morning found Harrison waking to an empty room. A glance at the clock sent panic through her - she'd overslept.

Their appointment at the naturopathy center was set for 9:00 AM. Given Nathaniel's icy demeanor the night before, missing it again would have severe consequences.

Harrison rushed through her morning routine and bolted downstairs.

Eleanor called out, "Harrison, you're awake! Nathaniel left already. Join me for breakfast."

"Grandmother, I can't - I'm running late!" Harrison dashed out the door.

Eleanor frowned in concern. "How can she leave without eating?"

At that moment, Reginald approached with an envelope. "Mrs. Eleanor, this arrived for you. Marked for your eyes only."

"What is this?"

As Eleanor opened it, a photograph slipped out.

Harrison reached the center just before nine, spotting familiar figures in the waiting area.

Nathaniel and Isabella had arrived, accompanied by Arabella.

Isabella practically vibrated with excitement. "Nathaniel, is Dr. Sinclair really coming today?"

Her lifelong heart condition fueled two burning desires: restored health, and becoming Mrs. Falcon by marrying Nathaniel. She intended to achieve both.

Nathaniel nodded. "Dr. Sinclair will be here."

Arabella clutched pen and paper, beaming. "This is incredible! I finally meet the legendary Dr. Sinclair. I'm such an admirer - I must get an autograph!"

Scanning the room eagerly, Arabella suddenly paused. "Where is Dr. Sinclair? Dr. Sinclair... Wait, Harrison?"
###Chapter 36

Harrison spotted Arabella approaching.

Nathaniel and Isabella noticed her too. Isabella's eyes widened in shock. "Harrison, what are you doing here?"

Arabella gave Harrison a look dripping with contempt. "Harrison, you'll regret what you did with Alexander last night! Get out now. We're all waiting for Dr. Sinclair, and we certainly don't have time for your nonsense!"

Nathaniel's sharp gaze landed on Harrison, his dark brows drawing together slightly. Though silent, his entire demeanor radiated disapproval. He clearly thought she was here to stir up trouble.

Harrison remained unbothered. Their reactions amused her. She flashed them a playful grin, winking at Nathaniel before saying, "I know you're waiting for Dr. Sinclair."

Isabella snapped, "Then why are you still standing there?"

Harrison straightened her posture, radiating confidence before the trio. "Actually, I'm the one you've all been waiting for-"

Before she could finish, another voice interrupted. "Harrison, what are you doing here?"

Harrison turned to see Penelope Whitmore.

Harrison's grandmother, Margaret Whitmore, had three sons - Benjamin, Theodore, and Frederick Whitmore. Penelope was Frederick's daughter.

Penelope was exceptionally accomplished - her academic credentials surpassed even Isabella's. Holding a medical doctorate, she'd spent three years abroad and assisted in groundbreaking surgeries. More ambitious and self-assured than Isabella, she was the golden child of the Whitmore family.

Both Isabella and Penelope shared one thing in common - their utter disdain for Harrison.

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Penelope, what brings you here?"

Penelope approached Nathaniel with confident strides, offering him a polished smile. "Mr. Falcon, good morning. Dr. Sinclair sent me."

Harrison blinked. 'I sent her?'

"I'm Dr. Sinclair's assistant, here to assist with Isabella's cardiac treatment," Penelope continued.

Suddenly Harrison remembered - Oliver had mentioned this last night. He'd told her about an eager assistant wanting experience. Now it made sense - that assistant was Penelope.

What a twisted coincidence.

When Isabella heard Penelope was Dr. Sinclair's assistant, her lips curved into a smug smile. "Penelope, it's been three years. I never imagined you'd become Dr. Sinclair's assistant upon your return."

Arabella, ever the gossip, turned to Penelope. "Penelope, is Dr. Sinclair male or female? What do they look like? I'm dying to know!"

Penelope's face lit up with reverence. "Dr. Sinclair is a medical legend we all admire. For years, I've worked tirelessly to earn this position as the doctor's assistant. Yet I still haven't had the privilege of meeting them in person."

Arabella gasped dramatically. "Penelope, that's incredible! The Whitmore daughters are truly exceptional, except..." She shot Harrison a scathing look. "Harrison, how can you be such a disgrace? You're a Whitmore too, yet the gap between you, Penelope and me is astronomical." Arabella spread her arms wide for emphasis.

Penelope regarded Harrison with icy detachment. "Harrison, I've heard about your situation. You should divorce Mr. Falcon and return to the countryside. Stop humiliating the Whitmore name."

Isabella chuckled. "Penelope, Harrison dropped out at sixteen. What exactly do you expect her to do?"

Harrison had no rebuttal.

Nathaniel, visibly impatient, glanced at Penelope. "Where's the doctor? Dr. Sinclair should have arrived by now. Our appointment was for 9 AM sharp."
###Chapter 37


Nathaniel only cared about meeting Dr. Sinclair. As time ticked by with no sign of the renowned physician, his expression turned icy.

Arabella checked her watch, her tone gentle but firm. "Mr. Falcon, Dr. Sinclair must have been held up. Who knows what groundbreaking research the doctor is immersed in? It's been three years since the doctor stepped away from public view."

Dr. Sinclair's vanishing act had become the medical world's greatest enigma. No one knew the reason behind the prolonged absence.

Isabella, lingering by the doorway, rolled her eyes. She wanted Nathaniel to finally acknowledge that she'd kept her promise and shown up. Even Gabrielle, Arabella, and Victoria were her witnesses.

Seeing Nathaniel's hardened expression, Arabella spoke up. "Mr. Falcon, I'll begin by examining Isabella."

Twenty minutes later, Nathaniel and Arabella stood outside the room. Arabella, dressed in a crisp white silk blouse and tailored black skirt, exuded professionalism.

She met Nathaniel's commanding gaze and said, "Mr. Falcon, based on my initial assessment, Isabella's condition appears to be an acquired ventricular septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus. Surgical intervention could correct it."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly. "Are there risks?"

Arabella's lips curved into a practiced smile. "That depends on the surgical approach. Let's exchange contact details to discuss further, Mr. Falcon."

She pulled out her phone, ready to capture Nathaniel's number.

Harrison, who hadn't left, watched the exchange with quiet amusement dancing in her bright eyes.

Arabella's motives were transparent. It baffled her why the Whitmore family's distinguished women were so infatuated with Nathaniel.

Before Nathaniel could respond, a clear voice cut through. "Isabella doesn't have an acquired condition. It's congenital heart disease."

Arabella stiffened before turning to find Harrison standing there. Nathaniel's gaze shifted to her as well.

Harrison stood with effortless poise, her dark hair swept behind one ear, radiating quiet confidence. Her striking eyes locked onto Nathaniel's handsome face. "Stop wasting time. Isabella needs a heart transplant."

Arabella's composure cracked. "Harrison! How dare you question my diagnosis! What would a dropout know about medicine?"



Nathaniel studied Harrison, who stood there with an undeniable magnetism, an aura that commanded attention.

"Mr. Falcon, I've said what needed to be said. The choice to believe me is yours." Harrison turned to leave.

Behind her, Arabella seethed. A sixteen-year-old without formal education daring to challenge her expertise? The insult burned.

"Mr. Falcon, don't listen to her!"

As Harrison rounded the hospital corridor, her steps slowed when she spotted Isabella waiting for her.

Isabella had been lying in wait.

"I heard Eleanor is backing you. She's preventing Nathaniel from divorcing you." A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "As a woman, I pity you. Nathaniel doesn't love you. When you can't keep your husband, you resort to hiding behind an old woman. Harrison, you're pathetic."

Harrison met Isabella's scornful gaze with a knowing smile. "Isabella, you're the one to be pitied. I won't be divorcing Nathaniel, which means you'll remain his dirty little secret forever. Look at how desperate you've become."

Isabella's fists clenched. "You little—"

Then she smiled again. "Do you really think Eleanor's protection will save you? You're about to learn a painful lesson."
###Chapter 38

Isabella spun on her heel and walked away without another word.

Harrison's brows knitted together in suspicion. What kind of twisted game was Isabella playing now?

A blood-curdling scream shattered the silence moments later.

"Nathaniel! Something terrible has happened!"

Harrison whirled around, pulse quickening.

Arabella clutched Nathaniel's arm, her face contorted with panic. "Nathaniel! They've taken Isabella!"

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. "Who took her?"

"It was Eleanor! She sent her guards to kidnap Isabella!" Arabella gasped, her voice trembling.

What?

The air around Nathaniel turned arctic, his presence suddenly lethal.

Arabella spotted Harrison approaching and immediately pointed an accusing finger. "Harrison, this is all your fault! Nathaniel, someone sent Eleanor a photo - that intimate dance between you and Isabella at The Velvet Lounge last night. When Eleanor saw it, she flew into a rage and ordered Isabella's capture. I know Harrison sent that photo!"

Harrison maintained her composure, though internally she reeled. She had no knowledge of any photo being sent to Eleanor.

"Nathaniel, Harrison is pure evil! She knows Eleanor favors her and will take her side. With Isabella's fragile health, she's using Eleanor to eliminate her!"

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Harrison as he strode toward her with predatory grace.

Harrison met his eyes unflinchingly. "Nathaniel, I didn't do this."

His lips thinned into a cruel line, voice dripping with venom. "Harrison, you'd better pray Isabella comes to no harm."

He turned on his heel and stormed away.

Arabella shot Harrison a triumphant smirk before scurrying after Nathaniel.

Harrison's face drained of color. Nathaniel didn't believe her - he must think she was behind the photo. And truthfully, she was the obvious suspect.

A cold dread settled in her chest. She hurried to Falcon Manor.



As Harrison reached the estate, Eleanor's shrill voice carried through the study door before she even entered.

"Isabella, have you no shame? Nathaniel is married to Harrison now! That makes him your brother-in-law. Yet you throw yourself at him like some common harlot! You abandoned us three years ago, and now you think you can waltz back in whenever it suits you? Do you imagine the title of Mrs. Falcon has been waiting for you all this time? You're nothing but a selfish, greedy little tramp!"

Isabella stood with her head bowed, delicate features pale. "Eleanor, please, it's not what you think-"

Eleanor's fury erupted. "I'm giving you one final chance! Leave Nathaniel immediately. Return overseas and never set foot in this country again!"

Trembling violently, Isabella shook her head. "I can't do that. I love Nathaniel! I want to be with him forever!"

"You shameless wretch!" Eleanor's voice shook with rage. "If your parents won't discipline you, then I'll do it myself today!"

Reginald handed her the Falcon family's ceremonial whip.

Eleanor raised the whip high and brought it down with terrifying force.

"NO!" Isabella screamed in terror.

The crack of the whip echoed through the room, its sound alone enough to make bystanders flinch.

But the lash never touched Isabella.

Nathaniel had arrived just in time.

He threw himself forward, wrapping Isabella in his arms and shielding her with his own body.

The whip struck his back with a sickening thud.
###Chapter 39

Eleanor gasped. "Nathaniel!"

Harrison stood frozen outside the door, stunned. She never expected Nathaniel to shield Isabella from the whip.

The message was clear - Isabella had his undeniable favoritism.

Nathaniel's voice was firm as steel. "Grandmother, that's enough. I chose to be with Isabella. She's innocent - this is all my doing. If punishment is needed, direct it at me! Leave her out of this!"

Isabella immediately clung to Nathaniel's arm. "No! Grandmother, don't hurt Nathaniel! If anyone deserves punishment, it's me!"

In that charged moment, they appeared as tragic lovers defying the world, while Eleanor became the villain separating them.

A bitter ache spread through Harrison's chest.

Eleanor's grip on the whip trembled with barely contained fury.

"Nathaniel, Harrison is your wife! Have you forgotten those three years in a coma when she never left your side? How could you betray her like this? That woman has clearly bewitched you! Today, I'll beat some sense into you!"

Blinded by rage, Eleanor swung the whip toward Nathaniel.

"Grandmother, stop!" Harrison rushed forward, placing herself between them.

Eleanor snapped, "Harrison, don't be afraid. I won't let anyone mistreat you!"

Warmth bloomed in Harrison's heart at those words.

Then Isabella cried out dramatically, "Nathaniel! The pain...it's unbearable!"

Nathaniel whirled around to see Isabella clutching her chest, face twisted in exaggerated agony.

"Isabella!"

Harrison moved to check Isabella's pulse. "Let me examine her."

Before her fingers could make contact, Nathaniel's hand shot out, gripping Harrison's wrist with bruising force.

Their eyes met - his glacial, hers startled. His voice cut like ice. "Save your fake concern!"

He shoved her away violently. Harrison's hip collided with the desk's sharp corner.

Tears sprang to her eyes from the sudden pain.

Eleanor rushed to Harrison's side, fury radiating from every word. "Nathaniel! Have you gone mad? How dare you hurt Harrison?"

Reginald stepped between them. "Mr. Falcon, this is unacceptable!"

Nathaniel stared at Harrison - her reddened eyes, the unshed tears making her appear heartbreakingly fragile.

His clenched fist twitched at his side. He seemed poised to step forward when Isabella moaned theatrically.

"Nathaniel...everything's spinning..."

She performed an Oscar-worthy near-faint.

Nathaniel reacted instantly, sweeping Isabella into his arms. "Get the car! We're going to the hospital immediately!"

Harrison looked up to see Isabella, moments ago playing the fragile victim, now smirking triumphantly from Nathaniel's embrace.

This round belonged entirely to Isabella.

Eleanor stamped her foot in outrage. "Nathaniel, if you walk out that door, don't bother coming back—"

Her vision blurred as she collapsed in a dead faint.

"Grandmother!"

"Madam!"

Harrison sprang into action, inserting silver needles with practiced precision. As she withdrew them, Eleanor's breathing steadied.

Reginald hovered anxiously. "Mrs. Harrison, how is Mrs. Eleanor?"

"She'll be fine," Harrison said, setting the needles aside. "Let her rest."

Reginald's anger flared anew. "I can't fathom Mr. Falcon's behavior! Protecting that woman at all costs!"

Isabella was clearly his weakness, and love could make even the strongest man foolish.

Harrison winced, the lingering pain in her side mirroring the ache in her heart. While Isabella likely basked in attention at the hospital, Harrison - the legitimate wife - bore the true burden of their twisted dynamic.
###Chapter 40

Nathaniel had created Isabella's arrogance with his own hands. She was the woman he'd indulged beyond reason, and now she wielded that privilege like a weapon.

Harrison gave a bitter laugh. "Reginald, what really happened today? Did someone send Eleanor a photo?"

Reginald produced the damning photograph - clear evidence of Nathaniel and Isabella dancing intimately at The Velvet Lounge the previous night.

"This morning, an anonymous sender delivered this to Mrs. Eleanor. They exposed Mr. Falcon and Isabella's affair. Mrs. Eleanor saw it and flew into a rage. She immediately dispatched guards to apprehend Isabella."

Eleanor genuinely cared for Harrison and couldn't bear seeing her distressed.

Harrison studied the photo thoughtfully. "Reginald, who do you think sent this?"

"Whoever exposed Mr. Falcon and Isabella's affair is clearly aligned with your interests," Reginald observed.

A soft smile touched Harrison's lips as her thoughts wandered. No wonder Nathaniel didn't trust her - everyone seemed to draw the same conclusion.

At surface level, she stood to gain from this situation. Either she or one of her allies could have orchestrated it, using Eleanor's influence to punish Isabella and exact revenge on her behalf.

Just then, Eleanor murmured from the bed, "Nathaniel..."

Reginald leaned closer. "Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Eleanor is calling for Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel had upset Eleanor today, and Harrison feared this might create permanent damage between them.

The ringing phone shattered the moment. Victoria was calling.

Harrison answered to immediate accusations. "Harrison, look what you've done! You got Isabella hospitalized. Get here immediately!" Victoria demanded her presence at the hospital.

Harrison remained impassive. "Very well. I'll be there shortly."

She hung up, grabbed her purse, and headed for the door.

"Mrs. Harrison, are you certain you should go?" Reginald's concern was palpable, fearing for Harrison's safety.

Harrison reassured him calmly, "Don't trouble yourself, Reginald. I know precisely what I'm doing."

At the hospital, Harrison entered the VIP suite. Isabella sat wrapped in a hospital gown, her pallor accentuating her delicate features - the perfect image of a fragile beauty. Nathaniel and Victoria flanked her protectively.

Victoria launched her attack immediately. "The doctor just examined Isabella. Thankfully no permanent damage. But you manipulated Eleanor into attacking her! If Nathaniel hadn't intervened, Isabella could have been seriously injured - or worse. You're absolutely heartless!"

Harrison maintained her silence.

Nathaniel, towering and composed, stood beside the bed, handing Isabella a glass of warm water.

Isabella pouted. "Feed me."

Nathaniel obliged, bringing the glass to her lips.

Tilting her face upward, Isabella gazed at Nathaniel with saccharine sweetness. "Nathaniel, after this incident with Harrison, your grandmother will surely despise me even more."

She tugged at Nathaniel's sleeve playfully. "You'll have to love me twice as much now. Compensate me for all the affection I've lost from your grandmother."

Nathaniel looked down at her, his expression softening as he gently stroked her hair.

Isabella's triumphant gaze shifted to Harrison, eyes glittering with provocation.

Harrison stood motionless by the doorway, watching her husband's intimate gestures with another woman. The isolation cut deeper than any insult.

"Harrison, why are you just standing there? This is entirely your fault! Apologize to Isabella immediately!" Victoria sneered.

The entire summons had been orchestrated solely to force Harrison's humiliation.

Nathaniel finally lifted his head, his icy dark eyes locking onto Harrison's face with unsettling intensity.
###Chapter 41


Their gazes collided like thunder.

Harrison met Nathaniel's piercing stare, her voice steady despite the storm inside. "Nathaniel, I swear on my life, I didn't send that photo to Eleanor. I won't confess to a crime I didn't commit."

Isabella tugged Nathaniel's sleeve with practiced innocence. "Nathaniel, look at her! Still lying through her teeth. No shame at all!"

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. "Harrison. Apologize. Now."

His command sliced through the air like a blade.

Harrison's silver-blue eyes shimmered, but her spine remained steel-straight. "I'll say it one last time—I didn't do it. No apology."

Nathaniel's obsidian eyes darkened dangerously. "Harrison. Your friend Gabrielle works at Vogue Paris, doesn't she?"

Ice flooded Harrison's veins. Was he threatening her loved ones now?

Isabella and Victoria exchanged triumphant smirks, their satisfaction practically radiating heat.

Harrison's fists clenched. In this moment, Nathaniel had stripped her bare, and these vipers were savoring every second. Humiliation burned behind her eyelids, but she forced the words through numb lips.

"Isabella... I'm sorry."

Defeat tasted like ashes.

Isabella's grin turned predatory. "This time, I'll be generous. But cross me again..."

"Harrison, clinging to Eleanor's favor won't save you. Nathaniel doesn't love you," Victoria purred.

Harrison's face drained of color, leaving her ghostly pale.

Nathaniel strode out without a backward glance. The room now held only three: Harrison, Isabella, and Victoria.

Harrison turned slowly. "So this was your little lesson?"

Isabella dropped the act, smirking as she examined her manicure. "Consider it a free tutorial, darling. Women like us? We conquer men, not grandmothers."

Harrison's breath hitched. "Isabella... you sent that photo?"

Isabella's silence was confirmation enough.

"You risked Eleanor's wrath on purpose." Harrison's voice shook. "This whole thing was staged."



"Bravo, Harrison." Isabella's laugh was poison wrapped in silk. "Eleanor despises me anyway. If she wants to lose her precious grandson? That's her funeral."

Harrison recoiled. "She's Nathaniel's grandmother!"

Isabella's eyes glittered with malice. "And? She's in my way."

"You're monstrous."

Harrison turned toward the door, but Isabella's voice followed like a curse.

"This was just Act One, sweetheart. Remember—neither you nor that meddling old bat can touch me."

Harrison's back remained rigid, hiding the icy smile spreading across her face.

Oh, Isabella had miscalculated. Badly.

As Harrison stepped into the hallway, Nathaniel stood silhouetted against the window, phone in hand.

The call she'd placed earlier was still connected—he'd heard every damning word.
###Chapter 42

Harrison had known the truth from the moment she stepped into the Falcon estate. Isabella was behind that photo.

Earlier in the hospital room, she'd skillfully manipulated the conversation, coaxing Isabella into confessing to Nathaniel. She wanted to hear the admission directly from Isabella's lips.

Nathaniel ended the call and locked eyes with Harrison.

Her crimson lips curled into a mocking smile. "You're going to be disappointed, Nathaniel. That photo wasn't from me - Isabella sent it."

His chiseled features tightened, but he remained silent.

Harrison turned to leave. As she brushed past him, Nathaniel grabbed her slender wrist.

She jerked away violently, refusing any contact.

"After I left, Eleanor collapsed. She kept calling my name in her sleep." Her voice dripped with venom. "Maybe you should visit her sometime."

With that, she strode away.

Dominic materialized from the shadows. "Mr. Falcon, Mrs. Falcon misunderstands. You weren't taking Isabella's side, were you? You heard everything from outside the door."

A man like Nathaniel didn't accept things at face value. He'd orchestrated the entire scene, stepping away to observe both women. What surprised him was Harrison seeing through his game. The way she'd maneuvered Isabella into confession was masterful.

While Isabella thought she was playing Harrison, she'd been outmaneuvered.

Dominic watched Harrison disappear down the hall. "Mrs. Falcon is... more than she appears."

Nathaniel had underestimated his wife. A country girl with such composure and strategic thinking? How many layers did she possess?

"Return to the estate," Nathaniel commanded.

Dominic hesitated. "Ms. Isabella will call when she can't find you."

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. Dominic immediately fell silent.



Isabella had grown too accustomed to Nathaniel's indulgence. She'd crossed a line without realizing it, still basking in her imagined victory.

Eleanor was awake when Harrison returned to Rosewood Manor.

Harrison threw herself into the older woman's arms. "You terrified me, collapsing like that."

Eleanor patted her back. "I'm not going anywhere, dear. I worry more about Isabella taking advantage of you."

Harrison's pale eyes reddened. No one could bully her now.

But wrapped in Eleanor's embrace, something unexpected happened. A foreign warmth spread through her chest. This unconditional love made her feel fragile. Tears welled as she clung tighter.

"Mr. Falcon has returned!" Reginald announced excitedly.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, watching Harrison - usually so composed - clinging to his grandmother like a child. It was a side of her he'd never seen.

Harrison immediately straightened, wiping her eyes. "I should rest now."
###Chapter 43

Eleanor's voice softened as she gestured toward the door. "Go on, my dear."

Harrison gave a small nod before slipping out of the room.

Nathaniel approached the bedside, only to be met with Eleanor's sharp reprimand. "What are you doing here? Get out this instant!"

A genuine smile touched Nathaniel's lips as he murmured, "Grandmother, I apologize. I was wrong."

Eleanor's expression softened marginally, though her tone remained firm. "Your apology means nothing to me. The one who deserves it is Harrison!"

Reginald chimed in indignantly. "Exactly, Mr. Falcon! You ran off with that Isabella without a second thought. When Mrs. Eleanor fainted, it was Mrs. Harrison who stayed by her side! It's as if she's the true family, and you're merely adopted!"

Nathaniel stood frozen, words failing him.

"And then you shoved Harrison into that table!" Eleanor added sharply. "Just because she didn't cry out doesn't mean it didn't hurt!"

"Mr. Falcon, you must search your conscience," Reginald continued. "You can't keep treating Mrs. Harrison this way!"

The verbal assault continued, with Nathaniel remaining silent throughout. His gaze flickered toward the doorway where Harrison had disappeared before he finally spoke. "Grandmother, since you're recovering well, I'll return to my room now."

Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel and left.

Once the door closed, Eleanor sighed deeply. "Harrison is such a remarkable woman. How could Nathaniel be so blind to her worth?"

Reginald leaned closer. "Mrs. Eleanor, when you were unconscious earlier, you kept calling for Mr. Falcon. Mrs. Harrison heard you—that's why she went to the hospital to bring him back. She never said a word about it, but I know she did it to prevent any rift between you two."

Eleanor nodded, touched by the revelation. She'd always recognized Harrison's exceptional qualities.

"Harrison has spent her life starved for love, while Nathaniel... Nathaniel understands love too well. Harrison knows this, which is why she loves him so completely."

Nathaniel had been born with every advantage—charming, cultured, and skilled in the art of affection. He'd spoiled Isabella to the point of ruination, a fact obvious to anyone with eyes.

Harrison recognized this truth, which explained both the depth of her devotion and the frequency of her heartbreak.



"Don't worry, Mrs. Eleanor," Reginald reassured. "I believe one day Mr. Falcon will love Mrs. Harrison. And when that day comes, he'll love her beyond reason."

Eleanor chuckled softly. "I share your belief. And I suspect that day may come sooner than we think!"

Back in their suite, Nathaniel found Harrison freshly showered, dressed in one of his white dress shirts as she applied skincare at the vanity. She didn't acknowledge his entrance.

Nathaniel perched on the edge of their bed. "Harrison."

Silence.

He loosened his tie and tried again. "Harrison."

Still nothing.

She rose from the vanity, clearly intending to go straight to bed without acknowledging his presence. As she moved past him, Nathaniel's hand shot out, capturing her delicate wrist. With one smooth motion, he pulled her onto his lap.

The impact hurt.

His muscular thighs were like granite beneath her, the sheer masculine power of him making her feel she might break in two.

Harrison winced and struggled. "Release me."

Nathaniel held firm, keeping her trapped against him. Amusement colored his deep voice as he murmured, "Why the silent treatment?"
###Chapter 44


"Why won't you look at me?" Nathaniel's voice was velvet soft, almost pleading.

For a man of Nathaniel's wealth, power, and influence, this rare moment of vulnerability could easily be mistaken for genuine devotion—a dangerous illusion that threatened to pull Harrison into his emotional orbit.

But Harrison knew better. She was painfully aware that Nathaniel's heart had never belonged to her.

It had always been Isabella's.

Harrison kept her gaze lowered, long lashes trembling slightly as she attempted to stand. "Release me!"

Nathaniel's lips curved into an amused smile. "Are you angry with me?"

Harrison let out a dry laugh. "Why would I be?"

His voice dropped to a concerned murmur. "Did I hurt you earlier? When you fell—did you injure your back?"

She shook her head. "No."

Yet Nathaniel's large hand found the small of her back, fingers tracing the spot with surprising gentleness as he leaned closer. "Here?"

The exact spot.

Harrison had seen the bruises earlier—dark purple blooms against pale skin that would take weeks to fade. Now, with Nathaniel's warm palm pressed against the tender area, she hated how his touch could still make her pulse stutter.

She despised this game—the way he alternated between cruelty and kindness. She didn't want his pity. She'd rather he remained cold. The bruises would heal regardless.

Harrison shoved his hand away. "I'm fine. Let go!"

This was new. Nathaniel had seen anger before—Isabella's fiery outbursts that demanded immediate appeasement.

But Harrison's anger was different. Quiet. Withdrawn. Like a stray cat that curled into itself rather than hissing, making you want to coax it out.

Now she fought him, refusing to let him touch her.

Nathaniel studied her freshly washed face—dewy and untouched, like morning dew on a rose petal.

"If you won't tell me, I'll have to check myself." His fingers hooked under her shirt hem, lifting it slowly.



The sudden chill on her thighs made Harrison gasp. She immediately slapped a hand over the rising fabric.

Her wide, startled eyes locked onto his. "What are you doing? I'm not wearing anything under this, you creep!"

Nathaniel froze.

That hadn't been his intention.

He'd only meant to examine the injury, but as the fabric lifted, reality struck. She'd been sitting across his lap this whole time, her bare legs draped over his tailored trousers—pale skin against dark fabric, soft curves against hard muscle.

The image burned into his mind—those slender thighs pressing together instinctively. Warm. Smooth.

Being called a "creep" was a first. Nathaniel found himself at a loss for words.

"I didn't mean to," he finally managed.

Harrison wasn't having it. "That's what they all say!"

Then his phone rang—the shrill tone cutting through the tension.

It sat on the nightstand where he'd left it earlier. Harrison's gaze flicked to the screen, where a familiar name flashed: Isabella.noveldrama

Isabella was calling.

Harrison knew why. She'd been waiting at the hospital, wondering where Nathaniel was.

The thought made her shove Nathaniel away, scrambling off his lap.

Was he going back to Isabella tonight?

###Chapter 45 
Harrison adjusted her crisp white blouse before turning to face Nathaniel.

The phone kept ringing on the nightstand, its persistent chime filling the room. Yet Nathaniel didn't even glance at it. He ignored Isabella's call completely.

This might have been the first time he'd ever done that.

Nathaniel stood up, his tall frame unfolding gracefully as he removed his tailored black jacket. The white dress shirt beneath revealed a dark stain spreading across the back - blood. Harrison's mind flashed to the lash Eleanor had struck him with earlier.

That whip had cut deep, yet he hadn't flinched. Not a single sign of pain had crossed his face.

Those wounds needed immediate attention before infection set in.

"I'll get the medical kit," Harrison said, already moving toward the bathroom.

Nathaniel turned, his lips quirking into that infuriating half-smile. "A moment ago, you couldn't even look at me."

Harrison retrieved the first aid supplies without meeting his gaze. "I didn't want your grandmother to worry."

Nathaniel sat on the edge of the bed.

"Take off your shirt," Harrison instructed, her voice clipped.

He complied, revealing a torso that made Harrison's breath catch. Broad shoulders tapered to a narrow waist, muscles defined but not overly so. Six perfect abs led down to where his belt buckle gleamed against black trousers.

Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks. She focused intently on preparing the antiseptic.

Nathaniel's deep voice broke the silence. "Now we're even."

Harrison frowned. "What?"

"You saw me shirtless," he said, amusement coloring his tone. "Just like I saw you earlier."

Her face burned hotter. "I wasn't looking!"

"Then why are you blushing?"

Harrison wanted to kick herself. This was exactly why she shouldn't have offered to help.

She dabbed gently at the angry wound. The lash had broken skin, leaving an inflamed gash across his back. She worked carefully, trying not to cause more pain.

Nathaniel's voice interrupted her concentration. "Isabella caused this mess. I apologize for her behavior."

Harrison's hands stilled. He was apologizing for Isabella? As if she were his responsibility.

"Is this how you always clean up her messes?" Harrison couldn't keep the bitterness from her voice. "She involved your grandmother this time. What's next? You've spoiled her rotten."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He seemed to realize how much Isabella had changed.

"She wasn't always like this," he murmured.

Harrison pressed too hard on the wound. "What was she like before?"

A softness crossed Nathaniel's features. "Before... she was sweet. I cared for her deeply."

His words struck like a physical blow. Sweet. Cared for deeply.

And what was she? Harrison had always wanted to ask - what did their past mean to him? But clearly, he only had eyes for Isabella. The man she once knew seemed to have forgotten her completely.

Her hand slipped, driving the cotton swab deep into the wound.

"Christ!" Nathaniel jerked, his face paling. "Was that payback?"

Harrison's eyes flashed. "Does it hurt? Good. Maybe next time you'll think twice before defending her!"

Nathaniel stared at her, bewildered.

What had he done to deserve this?

Women. Completely incomprehensible.
###Chapter 46
Harrison had just finished dressing Nathaniel's wound. The injury had worsened, infected and inflamed. The moment he lay down, his temperature spiked dangerously high.

He was shaking violently from chills. She cranked up the thermostat and piled every blanket she could find onto him, but his teeth kept chattering. Beads of icy sweat dotted his forehead, his lips drained of color.

A petty part of her thought he deserved this. Why hadn't he bothered to treat his wound properly when he'd taken Isabella to the hospital?

She administered an antibiotic shot to help his system fight, but the fever would have to run its course. Once it broke, he'd recover.

Harrison hesitated, then slid under the blankets beside him.

His skin was like marble against hers - shockingly, unnaturally cold. She couldn't just watch him suffer. Gritting her teeth, she pressed her slender frame against his back, trying to transfer her warmth.

Careful of his injury, she wrapped her arms around him from behind.

Nathaniel felt her immediately. The way her soft curves molded against him, separated only by thin layers of fabric. Then her small hand began tracing idle patterns across his abdomen, fingertips brushing over each defined ridge of muscle with deliberate, teasing strokes.

He squeezed his eyes shut. "Harrison," his voice scraped raw, "I'm sick."

She knew. That's exactly why she was doing this. If basic physical stimulation could help regulate his temperature, she'd try it. She wasn't Isabella though - no guarantee this would even work.

Instead of answering, her explorations grew bolder. Her palm slid upward, coming to rest over his pounding heart. The contact sent electric currents through them both.

Nathaniel felt her growing restless against him, her touch turning from therapeutic to tantalizing despite his weakened state.

His restraint shattered. He seized her wrist, a rough growl tearing from his throat. "Harrison, stop."

Pressed flush against him, she could feel the exact moment his body temperature began rising. The way his muscles tensed beneath her touch.

A flush crept up Harrison's neck. "Your body doesn't seem as indifferent to me as you claim, Nathaniel."

He went rigid. The last thing he wanted was to acknowledge this visceral reaction to her.

Truth was, she'd stirred him before. Now, fever-addled and vulnerable, his body responded to her with humiliating immediacy.

He rolled toward her abruptly, jaw clenched. "You're impossible." A tempting little vixen.

First she'd drugged him in the shower, teased him with those maddening kisses. Now she was tormenting him while he was defenseless with fever.

Nathaniel clung to this justification for his desire. What man could resist her like this?

His skin burned where they touched. Mission accomplished, Harrison calmly closed her eyes. "Sleep."

Nathaniel lay stunned. Was she seriously going to leave him like this?

Exhaustion eventually pulled him under. In his dreams, he saw her - the girl from years ago.

During a mission gone wrong, betrayed by his own teammate, he'd plunged from a crashing plane into dense wilderness. Bleeding out as enemies closed in, vision blurring, he'd collapsed certain death was coming.

Then a child appeared through the trees, clutching a tattered doll.
###Chapter 47

Nathaniel warned her the area wasn't safe. His pursuers were getting closer. If she stayed, she wouldn't survive.

But Harrison didn't run.

Instead, she fought to pull him along, dragging him into a concealed cave.

"Big Brother, we'll be safe here. They won't find us," she whispered.

He studied her—so young, barely more than a child. Winter had already settled in, yet she wore only a threadbare dress, faded from countless washes.

She clutched a ragged doll, her only companion in this desolate forest.

Nathaniel was bleeding, his body numb with cold.

Harrison wrapped her arms around him. "You're freezing. Hold onto me—you'll warm up."

Her eyes were bright, clear as morning dew.

"Why are you alone?" he asked. "Where's your family?"

A pause. Then, softly, "I don't have one. No one wants me."

He pulled her close. "If I make it out of here, I'm taking you with me. I want you by my side."

He unclasped the crystal pendant from his neck and fastened it around hers.

They huddled together through the night, sharing what little warmth they had. By some miracle, they survived.

But when dawn broke, she was gone.

His team arrived by helicopter, forcing him to leave without her.

"Where are you? Don't go!" Nathaniel gasped, jerking awake.

Another dream.

He'd found her years ago—that girl was Isabella.

Their relationship was the envy of their circle. He'd spoiled her, molded her into the radiant woman she was now.

Everyone knew she was his most treasured possession.

Yet still, he dreamed of that fragile girl in the woods.

Her determination as she dragged him to safety.

The warmth of her small body pressed against his.

And the crushing emptiness when she vanished.

Nathaniel shifted—then froze.

A soft, warm weight lay against his chest.

Harrison.

Memories of last night rushed back.

She'd curled into him, her back against his chest, and he'd wrapped his arms around her.

They'd slept like that, tangled together.

Morning light spilled through the curtains, painting the room gold.

Harrison slept soundly in his embrace, her delicate features peaceful. The faintest dusting of lashes rested against her cheeks.

For a moment, the world stilled.

It was as if that lost girl had returned to him.

He couldn't look away.

She stirred slightly, her oversized shirt slipping off one shoulder. The smooth curve of her skin glowed in the sunlight.

Nathaniel's breath hitched.

Fully healed now, his body reacted instantly to her closeness. He forced his gaze upward.

The wound on her waist.

Carefully, he lifted the hem of her shirt, keeping his eyes averted from what lay below.

Bruises marred her pale skin—ugly, violent marks.
###Chapter 48

How much agony must she have endured back then?

Nathaniel's fingers brushed lightly against Harrison's slender waist, his heart softening unexpectedly. The realization startled him - when had his feelings for her grown so tender?

He leaned closer, his morning voice rough with sleep. "Harrison, did I hurt you? I'm sorry." The words slipped out, barely audible.

Harrison remained still in her dreamlike state. Her breathing was feather-light, her entire being radiating delicate sweetness. Even her hair carried that intoxicating fragrance.

Nathaniel's throat tightened with heat. He fought the urge to stare at her youthful curves. Yet against his better judgment, he found himself drifting closer, lips nearly grazing her silken strands.

Just then, Harrison stirred with a soft murmur, her lashes fluttering open.

Awake.

Nathaniel jerked back, shocked by his own actions. What madness had possessed him? He'd nearly kissed Harrison's hair!

Him, Nathaniel Falcon, who'd never lacked for beautiful women. Yet here he was, losing composure over his own wife. Heart pounding, he threw off the covers and practically leaped from the bed.

Harrison sat up, rubbing sleep from her eyes with tiny fists. "You're awake? Has your fever broken?"

She moved to check his temperature, but Nathaniel intercepted her hand with surprising force.

Harrison froze. What was this about? She only wanted to help.

Without explanation, Nathaniel strode toward the bathroom. "Cold shower."

The water roared to life behind the closed door.

Harrison stood bewildered. "Nathaniel! It's freezing! And your back wound can't get wet. Are you listening?"

Silence.

She sighed, deciding to let his strange behavior pass.



That evening at The Velvet Lounge...

Nathaniel found Sebastian in a plush booth. "Did you bring what I asked for?"

"Right here." Sebastian produced a small jar of healing balm - the Falcon family's secret remedy.

"Rub this on the bruise, it'll vanish overnight." Sebastian smirked. "Isabella get hurt? She's the only one who'd make you ask for this."

Nathaniel pocketed the jar, turning to leave.

Then he spotted her - Harrison had arrived with Gabrielle.

"Who dared hurt your back?" Gabrielle fumed. "I'll chop their hands off myself!"

Nathaniel froze mid-step.

His gaze shifted to Alexander, his longtime friend, approaching Harrison with concern.

"Harrison, Gabrielle told me about your injury." Alexander extended an identical jar. "This should help."

Sebastian's jaw dropped. "Damn! Nathaniel, he's giving her the same balm!" His eyes widened. "Wait... you didn't ask for this for Harrison, did you?"

Harrison accepted Alexander's gift with a warm smile. "Thank you."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He tossed the jar back at Sebastian. "Shut up."

As he turned to leave, a slender arm hooked through his.

Isabella appeared, clinging possessively. "Nathaniel, there you are!"

Across the room, Harrison's icy gaze met his.
###Chapter 49

Harrison spotted Nathaniel with Isabella. Isabella, already released from the hospital, stood radiant beside him, her arm possessively linked through his. They looked like the perfect couple, completely at ease in each other's presence.

Gabrielle scoffed. "Nathaniel truly adores Isabella, doesn't he? After all that nonsense with Mrs. Eleanor, he just picks up right where they left off."

Harrison hadn't anticipated running into Nathaniel and Isabella at The Velvet Lounge, but their quick reconciliation didn't surprise her.

Not a flicker of shock crossed her face. She simply arched an eyebrow and murmured to Gabrielle, "You're just now realizing Nathaniel's feelings for Isabella?"

Once, this might have stung. Now, she felt nothing.

The sharp click of heels interrupted her thoughts.

"Mr. Falcon! Isabella! What a pleasant surprise," came Penelope's voice.

Harrison looked up, surprised to see Penelope had arrived.

Penelope wore a slinky black dress that hugged every curve, her wild curls and crimson lips creating a striking contrast. Her gaze lingered on Nathaniel with unmistakable interest.

Harrison smirked. Tonight just got more interesting.

Isabella, oblivious to Penelope's intentions, kept her grip on Nathaniel's arm, flashing a saccharine smile. "What a coincidence, Penelope."

Sebastian, who'd been waiting for this moment, clapped his hands. "Since we're all here, let's play a game! Alexander, Harrison, care to join?"

Alexander turned to Harrison. "Let's play together."

Harrison opened her mouth to decline, but Gabrielle cut in. "We're in."

Penelope's eyes widened when she noticed Alexander and Harrison together. "Since when are Alexander and Harrison a thing?"

Isabella, ever the instigator, smirked. "Penelope, didn't you know? Alexander has his eye on Harrison."

"What?" Penelope gasped, her voice dripping with disdain. "Alexander fancies Harrison? But she's just some country bumpkin. She's not in his league."

Isabella shrugged, grinning. "You don't get it. Harrison knows how to work her charms. Alexander's already hooked."

Penelope sneered. "How embarrassing to be related to someone like her. She doesn't belong in our circles."

Isabella laughed, clearly enjoying the drama.

Suddenly, Nathaniel pulled his arm free and walked away.

Isabella's hand dropped to her side, her smile freezing. Last night, Nathaniel hadn't returned to the hospital. Her calls went unanswered. Never in their relationship had he treated her so coldly.

Panic set in. Terrified another woman might steal him, she hurried after him.

Catching up, she pouted. "Nathaniel, why didn't you answer my calls?"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his chiseled features as cold as marble.

Harrison, Alexander, and Gabrielle joined the group with Penelope, Sebastian, and other wealthy heirs. As everyone took their seats, Isabella had no choice but to drop the subject, sitting stiffly beside Nathaniel.

Sebastian produced a beer bottle. "Truth or Dare rules: spin the bottle. Whoever the mouth points to chooses someone the tail points to for a question or dare."

The first spin landed with the mouth pointing at Penelope and the tail at Nathaniel.
###Chapter 50
The bottle spun and landed on Nathaniel first, electrifying the air with anticipation.

Penelope smirked at him, her crimson lips curling with mischief.

"Mr. Falcon, Truth for you. Tell us—have you and Mrs. Falcon ever... consummated your marriage?"

Every heir at the table except Alexander—who'd just returned from overseas—knew Harrison was Mrs. Falcon. Penelope's question was a calculated jab, meant to humiliate Nathaniel and expose the state of his marriage.

The wealthy socialites erupted into whistles, hungry for scandal.

Penelope shot Harrison a sly glance before turning back to Nathaniel. "Three years of marriage, and you've never touched your wife? Just how much do you despise her?"

Isabella seized the moment, tossing her hair with a haughty laugh. "I told Nathaniel not to lay a finger on Harrison. Of course he hasn't."

Their synchronized attack was deliberate, designed to strip Harrison bare in front of everyone.

Sebastian and the others drummed the table. "Come on, Nate! No lying—Truth or Dare!"

Gabrielle's fingers twitched, her glare murderous. Harrison calmly pressed a hand to her wrist.

"They're doing this on purpose," Gabrielle hissed.

Harrison smiled bitterly. "It's true. He's never touched me. Let them laugh. I'm used to it."

The truth stung, but it was reality. Whether Isabella had forbidden it or not, Nathaniel had never wanted her.

Harrison's gaze flicked to Nathaniel at the head of the table.

Dressed in all black, sleeves rolled to reveal corded forearms, he looked every inch the ruthless tycoon. When his icy eyes met hers, she couldn't read him.

Isabella leaned in, nails digging into his arm. "Tell them, Nathaniel. Say you've never touched Harrison!"

Under the weight of the room's anticipation, Nathaniel's voice cut like winter. "I'll take the penalty."

He grabbed the whiskey bottle and downed three shots in quick succession.

Isabella froze. Penelope's smirk vanished.

Gabrielle arched a brow, unable to resist. "Seems your orders don't hold much weight, Isabella."

The heiress flushed scarlet.

Harrison studied Nathaniel, pulse quickening. He could've answered. He chose not to. Why?



Sebastian hastily spun the bottle again. "Next round!"

This time, it landed on Harrison—with the neck pointing straight at Penelope.

Harrison's eyes sparkled with mischief. After their little stunt, it was her turn to play.

Penelope lifted her chin. "Well, Harrison? What do you want me to do?"

Harrison smiled sweetly. "Dare. Kiss one of these gentlemen—passionately—for three full minutes."

The room erupted.

Penelope's pride was legendary. There was only one man here who could make her comply.

And Harrison was about to watch her squirm.
###Chapter 51

But Nathaniel belonged to Isabella.

What could she do?

This was getting interesting.

The elite crowd buzzed with anticipation. Penelope was known as Willowbrook's most eligible bachelorette, still unattached - many admired her from afar.

Harrison flashed a knowing smile. "Penelope, it's your turn to choose."

She shot Isabella a mischievous glance. "Isabella, we all know your cousin has certain... standards. Who do you think she'll pick?"

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "Obviously Penelope is exceptional. Half of Willowbrook's bachelors chase after her. She has every right to be selective. That's common knowledge."

Harrison simply smiled, letting the tension simmer.

All eyes turned to Penelope, including Isabella's. No one could predict her choice.

Since returning from abroad, Penelope had become Dr. Sinclair's protégé. With Frederick's family in Margaret's favor, Penelope was selecting from Willowbrook's crème de la crème.

Isabella leaned forward. "Well? Who's the lucky man?"

The room held its breath as Penelope stood gracefully.

Her gaze lingered momentarily on Nathaniel, sparking visible interest. "Very well, I'll make my choice now."

She moved past Harrington first.

Isabella perked up. "Penelope, are you choosing Mr. Harrington?"

But Penelope continued walking.

Isabella grew more animated. "Penelope, is it Mr. Maxwell?"

Not quite.

Penelope bypassed every eligible bachelor until only one remained... Nathaniel.

Isabella gasped, springing up to block Penelope's path. "Penelope! Who are you choosing? Surely not Nathaniel?"

Face-to-face now, Penelope met Isabella's shocked stare. "Actually yes, Isabella. I'm selecting Mr. Falcon."

Isabella's eyes dilated in disbelief. Her perfect cousin, eyeing her man?

Nathaniel was hers. This was outright theft!

"Penelope, no! You can't pick Nathaniel!"

As Dr. Sinclair's assistant, Penelope considered herself Isabella's equal. "Why not? It's just a game. Harrison said I could choose any man here - that includes Mr. Falcon. Can't you handle the rules, Isabella?"

"You—!"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. "The Whitmore women are fighting over Mr. Falcon!"

"One minute playing happy family, now tearing each other apart!"

The spectators ate it up.

Gabrielle discreetly gave Harrison a thumbs-up. "Brilliant move! You've turned them against each other perfectly."

The cousins who'd united to humiliate Harrison now clashed. Harrison smirked, enjoying the show.

Suddenly, she felt an icy stare. Looking up, she met Nathaniel's glacial gaze.

He wasn't watching Isabella or Penelope. Those frozen daggers were aimed solely at her, chilling her to the bone.

Harrison quickly averted her eyes, standing abruptly. "Gabrielle, I need the restroom."

Splashing cold water on her face, Harrison composed herself before exiting.

As she passed the men's room, a powerful hand shot out, yanking her inside.

"Ah!"

Her back hit the cold tiles. Looking up, Nathaniel's striking features filled her vision.

She frowned. "Mr. Falcon! What are you— Why did you pull me in here?"
###Chapter 52

Nathaniel's towering figure cornered Harrison against the wall, his muscular frame trapping her. "Harrison," he growled, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "was that little stunt intentional?"

She pressed her palms against his chest, her slender fingers making no impression. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Don't play innocent with me." His piercing gaze darkened dangerously. "You deliberately pushed me toward Penelope."

The realization hit her - he'd seen through her scheme. He knew she'd been using him as a pawn in her game between Isabella and Penelope.

The thought that she'd so casually thrown him into another woman's arms, forcing that three-minute kiss, made his jaw clench.

Harrison dropped the act. Meeting his stare with wide, guileless eyes, she stated simply, "Mr. Falcon, Penelope has feelings for you."

"That's her problem," Nathaniel snapped, clearly uninterested. "Why should I care?"

Countless women desired him - did he owe each one an explanation?

Harrison fell silent, understanding his indifference toward Penelope. Isabella still held his heart.

"Mr. Falcon," she said evenly, "why the anger? Having two beautiful women fighting over you should be flattering. Now let me go."

Instead of releasing her, Nathaniel leaned closer, his voice dropping to a velvet threat. "Did you forget what I told you that night? Why are you still playing games with Alexander?"

A mocking smirk twisted his lips.

"Harrison, you're just using Alexander to provoke me, aren't you? Trying to get my attention?"

The arrogance took her breath away. "Mr. Falcon, you're delusional. I don't love you anymore!"

This marked the second time she'd declared it.

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cold smile as he traced her delicate jawline, his touch feather-light yet electrifying. His voice softened to that irresistible whisper that made her pulse race.

"Really? No love left at all? Seems you've forgotten how I kissed you senseless at Rosewood Manor."

The memory flooded back - his open-eyed kiss, the way he'd mocked her helpless response. That he dared mention it now!

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, mischief dancing in his eyes. "Let's test that claim."

He moved to capture her lips.

Harrison refused to let this arrogant bastard believe he still owned her heart. With lightning speed, she drove her knee upward.

Nathaniel gasped, doubling over in pain.

Seizing the moment, Harrison stepped back. "Mr. Falcon, I hope that proves my point clearly enough."

She walked away without a backward glance, leaving Nathaniel clutching his stomach, his expression unreadable.

Returning to the VIP lounge, she found Isabella and Penelope already reseated. The Truth or Dare round had clearly ended - no more catfights over Nathaniel tonight.

Nathaniel returned moments later, his stormy expression warning everyone to keep their distance.

Harrison avoided his gaze, pretending nothing had occurred.

The game's third round began. This time, the bottle pointed to Sebastian, with Alexander at the opposite end.

Sebastian rubbed his hands together gleefully. "My turn at last! Alexander, your dare is simple - just like Penelope, pick any woman here and kiss her for three glorious minutes."

###Chapter 53

The audience erupted in gasps as tension crackled through the air.

"The moment we've all been waiting for - which Willowbrook beauty will capture Alexander's heart? The answer is finally here!"

Alexander rose gracefully and strode directly toward Harrison, his choice unmistakable.

Isabella and Penelope both stiffened, their faces twisting in shock.

Nathaniel remained motionless, his cocktail glass clenched in white-knuckled fingers, his expression as icy as ever.

Gabrielle, however, squealed with exaggerated delight. "Oh my! Has Alexander truly fallen for Harrison?"

Harrison looked up at Alexander with wide eyes. Fresh from dealing with Nathaniel's drama, romance was the last thing on her mind. She couldn't lead Alexander on.

Just then, Alexander leaned down until their faces were inches apart. Harrison stammered, "A-Alexander, I can't-"

He flashed a roguish grin and winked. "Harrison, I need a tiny favor."

Her breath caught.

"It's just a silly game," he murmured. "You wouldn't let me suffer the consequences alone, would you? For old times' sake - that muscle rub you owe me?"

Realizing escape was impossible, Harrison sighed. "Can I just give you the cream back instead?"

Gabrielle began chanting from the sidelines. "Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!"

Alexander cradled Harrison's face gently between his palms, drawing nearer.

Closer...

Almost touching...

Their lips nearly met...

Nathaniel's grip on his glass tightened dangerously, his knuckles bleaching white under the strain.

The crowd exploded as Alexander and Harrison actually kissed.

They kissed!

Isabella yanked Nathaniel's sleeve furiously. "Nathaniel! Look! Harrison actually seduced Alexander!"

Nathaniel's glacial gaze narrowed at the spectacle.

Alexander still held Harrison's face, their lips locked as cheers surrounded them. Harrison finally turned away, cheeks flaming, burying her face against Alexander's shoulder.

He gazed down at her with unexpected tenderness. Harrison peeked up through her lashes, her expression soft and affectionate.

Nathaniel's vision burned red. How dare she look at Alexander like that? He'd believed only he could draw such reactions from her. Had she truly moved on?

The wealthy heirs roared with laughter.

"Alexander! You promised three minutes! That was barely sixty seconds!"

"Go again! We want a proper show!"

Alexander smiled down at Harrison. "She's shy. Don't scare her off." He grabbed a bottle instead. "I'll take the penalty."

He began drinking as the crowd whooped.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Penelope could only watch in stunned silence as Harrison became the evening's unexpected star. While they'd been clawing for Nathaniel's attention, Harrison had effortlessly stolen Alexander's. How?

Isabella turned to complain to Nathaniel just as his glass shattered violently in his grip.

He'd crushed it barehanded.

Blood dripped steadily from his lacerated palm.

"Nathaniel! Your hand!" Isabella shrieked. "Let me call a doctor!"

But no one noticed Nathaniel's injury amidst the revelry.

Without a word, Nathaniel stood and walked away, leaving crimson droplets in his wake.
###Chapter 54

Nathaniel walked away, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit.

"Wait!" Harrison called out, hurrying after him.



The Velvet Lounge was emptying as the night wound down. Gabrielle adjusted her purse while Alexander turned to Harrison with a grateful smile.

"Harrison, I owe you for earlier."

Harrison shook her head. The staged kiss had been clever - Alexander had only pressed his fingers to his own lips while cradling her face. But the illusion had been perfect.

She smirked. "Consider us even for that skincare favor."

Before Alexander could respond, Penelope's sharp voice cut through the dim lighting. "Alexander, stop!"

Harrison turned to see her cousin storming toward them.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Ms. Whitmore? Something wrong?"

Penelope's glare could have melted steel as she pointed at Harrison. "Don't let this snake fool you! I'm here to reveal her true colors!"

Harrison's expression remained impassible. She'd expected this move from Penelope.

Alexander crossed his arms. "Enlighten me."

"Alexander, do you know who Mrs. Falcon really is? It's Harrison!"

Alexander stilled, his gaze snapping to Harrison.

"Three years ago, Nathaniel became comatose after that accident. This country bumpkin swooped in and married him for his money! She's the unwanted wife Nathaniel never even touched! Tell me you're not actually interested in your best friend's discarded trash!"

Just then, Nathaniel and Isabella approached.

Harrison's eyes immediately found the stark white bandages wrapping Nathaniel's right hand.

When had that happened? His hands had been fine in the restroom earlier.

Isabella smirked at Alexander. "Penelope's right. Harrison is Nathaniel's wife - Mrs. Falcon. Surely you don't want someone else's leftovers?"

The dim lighting shadowed Nathaniel's chiseled features, but Harrison caught the mocking glint in his eyes as they met hers.

She understood. He'd made his position clear at Rosewood Manor - Alexander wouldn't inherit his castoffs.

Like Isabella and Penelope, Nathaniel was waiting to watch her humiliation when Alexander rejected her.

Alexander turned to Harrison. "Is this true?"

She met his gaze squarely. "Yes."

Penelope crowed triumphantly. "See? She admits it!"

Isabella sneered. "What else could she say?"

To everyone's shock, Alexander's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Actually... I'd already figured that out."

What?

Both women froze.

Alexander addressed Nathaniel directly. "Nathaniel, I've known about your relationship with Harrison for a while now. That actually... reassures me."

Reassures him? What game was Alexander playing?

Isabella and Penelope exchanged confused glances. This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go. Harrison - the backwoods nobody - wasn't supposed to capture Alexander's attention. They needed to stop this!

Harrison belonged in whatever hick town she'd crawled from. Once Alexander learned she was Nathaniel's unwanted wife, he'd drop her instantly.

They were waiting for her downfall.

But something was wrong. The script had flipped.

"Nathaniel, I know you love Isabella. But since you have no interest in Harrison... may I officially pursue her from now on?"

Alexander reached for Harrison's hand, his fingers gently enveloping hers.

"Nathaniel... I have feelings for Harrison. I want to be with her."
###Chapter 55

Alexander didn't just accept Harrison's confession - he declared his feelings for her right in Nathaniel's face.

Isabella and Penelope stood frozen in shock. "Alexander!"

Had he gone completely mad? Was he seriously considering taking his best friend's discarded wife?

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to their intertwined hands. The air around him turned glacial as his eyes darkened. His lips parted to address Alexander.

"By all means. Do whatever you want with her."

With that, Nathaniel turned on his heel and strode away.

Isabella scrambled after him.

Harrison watched his retreating figure, a hollow chill settling in her chest. Nathaniel truly had no heart. He'd given Alexander permission to pursue her - even encouraged him to take whatever liberties he desired.

"Harrison, I've known Nathaniel for years. He and Isabella will never separate," Alexander murmured quietly.

She yanked her hand from his grasp. "I know."

Suddenly, Alexander closed the distance, pinning her against the wall. A devilish grin played on his lips. "Then why not become my girlfriend? I'll pamper you just like Nathaniel spoils Isabella."

Harrison trembled slightly, unwilling to entangle herself with another heir from the Graves family.

"Alexander, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not worthy. Just a country girl with no education, no career... Someone like you deserves better."

As she spoke, she shoved him away and fled. "Goodbye, Alexander."

He watched her retreat, an authentic smile spreading across his face.

This woman was truly something special. Exactly his type.

Nathaniel emerged from The Velvet Lounge where a sleek Bentley awaited at the curb. Dominic respectfully opened the rear door.

Just then, Isabella came running out and threw herself at Nathaniel from behind. "Nathaniel! What's wrong? Why are you being so distant?"

Her heart pounded. She couldn't fathom his sudden coldness.

Nathaniel peeled her arms away, his expression unreadable. "I have business at Falcon Enterprises. You should go home."

He slid into the backseat. Dominic took the wheel and pulled away.

Isabella stomped her foot in frustration. "Nathaniel!"

Inside the car, Dominic ventured cautiously, "Mr. Falcon, it appears Mr. Graves is quite serious about Mrs. Falcon..."

Nathaniel loosened his tie with one hand, revealing a glimpse of his sculpted collarbone as if struggling to breathe.

Alexander had surprised him today. Nathaniel knew how selective his friend was, yet he'd pursued Harrison regardless.

Nathaniel's voice turned arctic. "She certainly knows how to ensnare men."

He remembered how Harrison had blushed when Alexander kissed her - that shy, hesitant expression. What man could resist that?

He hadn't been able to resist either. His body had betrayed him more than once.

When she failed to trap him, she'd set her sights on Alexander.

"Mr. Falcon, shall we return to Rosewood Manor?"

"No. To the office. I'll be staying there for the foreseeable future."

He couldn't bear to see Harrison right now.

Nathaniel rolled down the window, letting the cold air slap his face. Even now, he still felt a dull ache between his legs. Was she trying to destroy his manhood?

That slap, that kick to his groin - only she would dare.

"Nathaniel, I don't love you anymore."

Her words echoed in his skull.

If she didn't love him, so what? Who needed her affection?

The whole situation was absurd.

He couldn't believe he'd asked for the massage oil and gotten punished in the game's first round because of her.
###Chapter 56

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around the shattered wine glass.

For days, Harrison's beauty had consumed him, twisting him into someone he barely recognized.

He'd decided to let her play her games with Alexander. She was nothing but a siren, luring men to their doom.

At the Whitmore estate, Isabella was sprawled across the living room sofa, throwing a fit. "Dad! Mom! Nathaniel doesn't care about me anymore!"

Theodore frowned. "Isabella, that’s impossible. Has he divorced Harrison yet? When is he marrying you?"

Isabella kicked the coffee table in frustration. "He hasn’t even filed for divorce! It’s all Harrison’s fault—she refuses to let him go!"

Theodore shot Victoria a sharp look. "What’s going on? Isn’t Harrison your daughter? Can’t you make her behave? Why does she keep interfering with Isabella?"

Victoria forced a sweet smile. "Don’t worry, darling. I’ll handle it. They’ll be divorced soon."

"How?" Theodore demanded, skepticism lacing his tone.

"Margaret’s 80th birthday is coming up. I have the perfect plan—everything will fall into place there," Victoria purred, her confidence unshaken.

Theodore patted Isabella’s shoulder. "Just hold on a little longer, sweetheart."

Isabella huffed and stormed upstairs.

Theodore stood, ready to leave.

Victoria caught his arm. "It’s late, darling. Stay home tonight."

Ever since her failed attempt to drug Harrison, Theodore had been distant, spending nights elsewhere. Victoria had been left alone in their cold, empty bed.

She pressed against him, her crimson nails tracing his chest. "I’ve missed you."

Theodore shoved her away. "I’ll come back when Nathaniel divorces Harrison. You know what to do."

With that, he walked out.

Victoria’s face darkened. She knew exactly where he’d been—entangled with his secretary.

She wasn’t about to share her husband.

Now, she just had to wait for Margaret’s birthday party. Her plan would ensure Nathaniel and Harrison’s marriage ended—once and for all.

The grand celebration for Margaret’s 80th birthday was in full swing. The Whitmore estate glittered with lights, filled with Willowbrook’s elite.

Harrison had arrived. She spotted Margaret seated regally, surrounded by the Whitmore family—Theodore, Victoria, Isabella from the second branch, and Frederick, Cassandra, and Penelope from the third.

Margaret beamed, clasping Penelope’s hand. "I heard Penelope is now Dr. Sinclair’s assistant. Is it true?"

Frederick and Cassandra puffed with pride. "Of course! Dr. Sinclair is a miracle worker, and she personally chose Penelope."

Harrison overheard and forced a tight smile.

"Wonderful! Penelope brings such honor to our family," Margaret gushed.

Theodore quickly interjected, "Mom, Isabella is now the principal dancer at the ballet company."

Though the Whitmores appeared united, the rivalry between the second and third branches simmered beneath the surface. Theodore and Victoria wouldn’t let the third branch steal the spotlight.

Sure enough, Margaret grabbed Isabella’s hand. "Both my granddaughters are exceptional! The Whitmore name shines because of them!"

She held Penelope and Isabella’s hands, radiating pride.

Victoria, unusually cheerful, suddenly noticed Harrison standing near the doorway.
###Chapter 57

Harrison slipped through the doorway unnoticed. The lively chatter continued without pause, leaving her standing awkwardly by the wall.

Victoria's voice cut through the noise. "Harrison, you're here."

Every head turned in unison, eyes locking onto her figure.

Margaret's smile froze. Disgust flickered across her face. "Why did you invite Harrison?"

Victoria gave a light laugh. "Mother, it's your birthday. I thought she should come."

Margaret's tone turned icy. "I don't want her here. Look at Penelope and Isabella - accomplished young women. Then there's Harrison. A country girl with no status. She doesn't belong at my celebration."

The message was clear - Margaret didn't consider Harrison family.

Isabella and Penelope had dressed to impress, their makeup flawless. They exchanged smug glances before addressing Margaret sweetly.

"Grandmother, she's still your granddaughter. You can't just send her away," Isabella cooed.

"Don't let this ruin your special day," Penelope added with a practiced smile.

Margaret's responding smile didn't reach her eyes. "I'm perfectly content with you two as my granddaughters."

Harrison felt her chest tighten. The Whitmore family had been destitute until her father Benjamin built their fortune from nothing.

Benjamin sent Theodore to university, making him the family's first graduate. He helped Frederick establish a steel business that made him wealthy.

Yet after Benjamin's death, they'd divided his assets like vultures.

Margaret was the worst - she only valued those who brought prestige to the Whitmores.

###Chapter 58 

The Whitmores' status had skyrocketed. Having Nathaniel as a son-in-law exceeded their wildest dreams.

Isabella basked in the admiration, feeling she'd reached life's pinnacle. Nathaniel embodied every woman's fantasy.

She gazed up at him with shining eyes.

Nathaniel looked down briefly, his expression softening.

Harrison watched from the shadows, glass in hand. Nathaniel and Isabella stood center stage, bathed in golden light. This was the honor he bestowed upon her.

When Nathaniel spoiled a woman, he did so completely.

Memories surfaced - Nathaniel holding her in that cave years ago. "I'll get you out. I want you with me."

She still didn't understand why he'd abandoned her.

Her shoulders slumped. With a quiet sigh, she turned to leave.

Nathaniel's gaze followed her retreating figure through the crowd.

Several executives noticed. "Mr. Falcon, do you know that woman?"

Isabella's pulse spiked. Not Harrison again!

Nathaniel's voice was cool. "I don't know her."

He claimed not to know her.

Isabella exhaled in relief. Of course Nathaniel wouldn't acknowledge some country girl.

She caught Victoria's subtle nod. The night's planned performance was just beginning.

Harrison carried her glass toward the kitchen when a maid intercepted her.

"Hurry! Take this soup to Mrs. Victoria's room."

Nathaniel gave a brief nod. "Indeed."

The Whitmore family had risen dramatically in status with Nathaniel's backing. Margaret, always eager to climb the social ladder, had developed a taste for rare antiques. She'd spent years searching for The Enchanted Maiden, and now, thanks to Nathaniel, it was finally hers.

"Extraordinary!"

The crowd pressed closer, murmurs of admiration filling the air. "Mr. Falcon certainly knows how to make an impression. This piece is truly one-of-a-kind." Margaret beamed, clearly thrilled. "Mr. Falcon, your generosity knows no bounds."

Isabella, her face glowing with adoration, gazed up at Nathaniel. To her, he was the epitome of perfection—wealthy, powerful, and willing to indulge her every whim. He was the kind of man who made other women seethe with envy.

Her lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Nathaniel, I can't thank you enough."

Several executives seized the opportunity to join the conversation. "Mr. Falcon, Ms. Isabella, you two are truly a match made in heaven. When can we expect wedding invitations?"

"At this rate, we'll be calling her Mrs. Falcon before long."

Theodore and Victoria, lingering nearby, finally made their approach. Despite his position, Theodore still wasn't quite on par with these men. Their recent business proposal had been rejected, after all.

Still, he forced a jovial grin. "Mr. Pembroke, Mr. Chamberlain, you must stay for another round tonight."

Lawrence Pembroke chuckled. "Bring that proposal by tomorrow, Mr. Whitmore. We might just reconsider."

Theodore's face lit up. "You mean it? Thank you!"

Winston Chamberlain smirked. "Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a daughter like Ms. Isabella."

Victoria squeezed Isabella's hand. "She's our family's greatest blessing."

Theodore and Victoria were practically floating. Nathaniel's presence at the party had elevated their status beyond measure. They could only imagine the prestige once he officially became part of their family.

Basking in the admiration, Isabella felt invincible. Nathaniel was every woman's fantasy—powerful, attentive, and utterly devoted to her.

She looked up at him, eyes shining.

Nathaniel met her gaze, his expression unreadable but soft.

Harrison, standing near the edge of the room, watched them silently. Nathaniel and Isabella stood at the center, bathed in golden light, the envy of everyone present. This was the ultimate privilege Nathaniel had granted her.

When Nathaniel spoiled someone, he did so extravagantly.

Harrison's mind drifted back to years ago—to that cave, to Nathaniel holding her close and whispering, "I'll get you out of here. I want you with me."

Even now, she couldn't fathom why the man who'd once wanted her had turned away so completely.

Her shoulders slumped. With a quiet sigh, she turned and slipped through the crowd.

Just then, Nathaniel glanced up. His eyes tracked her retreating figure until she disappeared.

A few executives followed his gaze. "Mr. Falcon, do you know that woman?"

Isabella's stomach twisted. Not her—not Harrison!

Nathaniel's voice was cool, detached. "I don't."

He claimed not to know her.

Isabella exhaled in relief. Of course Nathaniel wouldn't spare a thought for someone like Harrison—a nobody from the countryside, unworthy of his attention.

She caught Victoria's eye, receiving a subtle nod in return. The performance Victoria had planned for tonight was only beginning.

Harrison carried her glass toward the kitchen, but a maid intercepted her.

"Hurry! Take this soup to Mrs. Victoria. She'll want it soon."

The maid shoved a tray into Harrison's hands, sending her off to deliver it.
###Chapter 59

Harrison remained silent.

One maid scoffed, "Harrison, don't flatter yourself thinking you're suddenly a Whitmore heiress. Let's be clear—there are only two heiresses in this family: Penelope and Isabella."

Another maid joined in with a mocking laugh. "Exactly! Ms. Penelope is Dr. Sinclair's protégé, and Ms. Isabella is about to become Mrs. Falcon. What are you? Nothing but a country girl! Now hurry up and take this soup to Mrs. Victoria!"

The maids glared at her with contempt, but Harrison didn't react. She simply took the tray and walked toward the bedroom.

As she crossed the grand hall, Nathaniel noticed her while conversing with businessmen. His brow furrowed slightly.

Wasn't Harrison supposed to be a Whitmore daughter? Why was she being treated like a servant? Was this how her own family treated her?

Nathaniel's expression darkened. She had been so bold with him before, yet now she endured this humiliation in silence. Her courage only surfaced when bullying him.

Harrison entered the empty room and set the soup on the bedside table.

Then she caught it—a faint, almost imperceptible scent. Her instincts flared.

Her vision blurred. Before she could react, her legs gave way, and she collapsed onto the bed.

The door creaked open. Someone slipped inside.

Roland Whitmore, Victoria's nephew—a spoiled, lecherous man who lived off his family's wealth—approached with a predatory grin.

"Aunt Victoria never mentioned how stunning this peasant girl was," he murmured, raking his gaze over her unconscious form. "Today's my lucky day."

His fingers reached for the buttons of her blouse.

"Don't blame me. You're the one standing in Isabella's way, clinging to the title of Mrs. Falcon. Once Aunt Victoria 'catches' us, your reputation will be ashes."

Guests murmured outside. "What's happening?"

Victoria exchanged a knowing smirk with Isabella. The show was about to begin.



Isabella linked arms with her mother, grinning. "Mom, is this your plan?"

Victoria chuckled. "Mr. Falcon will divorce her soon. You'll be Mrs. Falcon before the season ends."

Isabella pouted playfully. "You're amazing, Mother."

Victoria turned to Theodore. "Darling, you're staying with me tonight."

Theodore pulled her close. "As long as you handle this perfectly, I'm yours."

Victoria exhaled, then raised her voice. "What's that noise? It's coming from the guest room!"

The crowd followed eagerly. Frederick and Cassandra were among them, all rushing toward the scene.

A maid stood outside—one of Victoria's accomplices. "Mrs. Victoria," she feigned panic, "I just saw Harrison go in there."

"Harrison?" someone gasped. "That country girl? Is she... having an affair?"

Whispers erupted.

Margaret slammed her cane. "That uncultured brat! Ruining my birthday with her vulgarity!"

Victoria and Isabella exchanged triumphant glances. If Harrison was caught in scandal before Willowbrook's elite, her reputation would never recover.

With false concern, Victoria declared, "I can't believe Harrison would do this. I must see for myself."

She pushed the door open—revealing the exact scene she'd orchestrated.

On the bed, Roland loomed over a motionless figure, violently tearing at her clothes...
###Chapter 60

Harrison's strike went wide.

A strong hand clamped around her delicate wrist in an instant. The voice that followed was icy with irritation.

"Harrison, explain yourself."

The silver needle clattered to the marble floor. Recognition flashed across Harrison's face - it was Nathaniel.

Nathaniel had arrived.

"Y-you're here?" Her voice trembled.

He released her wrist, his piercing gaze sweeping the room before landing on Roland. "Who is this?"

Nathaniel had spotted Roland lurking downstairs, following Harrison, and decided to trail him.

Harrison opened her mouth when footsteps echoed outside. Her surprise for Victoria was arriving.

She yanked Nathaniel behind the heavy drapes.

"What are you-"

Her hand flew to cover his mouth as the door burst open.

"Not a sound," she breathed against his ear.

In the grand ballroom, Isabella, Theodore, Victoria and Margaret were entertaining executives. Frederick and Cassandra stood apart, shooting envious glances.

Cassandra muttered bitterly, "Penelope outshines Isabella in every way, yet Isabella plays the love game so well. Now that she's snagged Mr. Falcon, the second branch is practically untouchable."

Frederick leaned closer. "Don't worry! Penelope will find someone equal to Mr. Falcon."

They both pinned their hopes on Penelope's marriage prospects, determined she wouldn't lose to the second branch.

A bloodcurdling scream shattered the festivities.

Guests exchanged alarmed looks. "What was that?"

Victoria hid a smirk. The show was just beginning.

Isabella linked arms with her mother, grinning. "Mother, is this part of your plan?"

Victoria chuckled. "Mr. Falcon and Harrison are divorcing soon. You'll be Mrs. Falcon before long."

Isabella pouted adoringly. "You're amazing, Mother."

Victoria turned to Theodore. "Darling, you're staying with me tonight."

He pulled her close. "As long as everything goes perfectly, I'm yours."

Victoria exhaled, then addressed the crowd. "That noise came from the east wing! Let's investigate!"

The group surged forward eagerly. Frederick and Cassandra joined the procession.

A flustered maid stood outside the door - one of Victoria's accomplices.

"Madam Victoria," the maid feigned distress, "I just saw Harrison enter."

"Harrison?" someone gasped. "That country girl? Is she...compromising herself?"

The whispers swelled.

Margaret slammed her cane. "That uncultured brat would dare ruin my birthday!"

Victoria and Isabella exchanged triumphant glances. If Harrison was caught in scandal before Willowbrook's elite, her reputation would never recover.

With false concern, Victoria declared, "I can't believe Harrison would do this. I must see for myself."

She threw open the door to reveal the perfect scene.

On the lavish bed, two figures thrashed violently. Roland had a woman pinned beneath him, tearing at her clothes...
###Chapter 61

The woman beneath Roland thrashed violently, her screams piercing the air. "Get off me! Someone help!"

Victoria's heart soared. This was the exact scenario she'd envisioned.

She immediately cried out, "Harrison! So this is how you betray Nathaniel with another man! I'm utterly disgusted!"

The crowd behind her erupted in shocked whispers. "Is that really Harrison from the countryside? How disgraceful!"

Frederick and Cassandra pushed forward eagerly, their faces twisted with contempt as they glared at Harrison like she was vermin.

"Mother, Harrison is nothing but a stain on the Whitmore name. We must cut ties immediately!" Frederick spat, his voice dripping with venom.

Margaret nodded in agreement.

Suddenly, the struggling woman turned her face toward them. "Mother! Father! It's me! Help!" she wailed.

Frederick and Cassandra froze. Their blood ran cold when they recognized their daughter Penelope beneath the man.

"Oh god! Penelope!" Cassandra shrieked, lunging forward to grab Roland. "Release my daughter this instant!"

Frederick reacted immediately, delivering a brutal kick that sent Roland crashing to the floor. The impact shook the room.

Penelope's dress was torn, her pale skin exposed. She trembled uncontrollably, her face drained of color.

Cassandra quickly wrapped her coat around Penelope's shoulders. "Darling, what happened? Explain this!"

Margaret stood rooted to the spot, barely whispering, "Penelope... what are you doing here?"

Victoria's jaw dropped. Penelope?! Where was Harrison? Where had she gone?

Isabella tugged at Victoria's sleeve, her expression horrified. "Mother, how could this happen?"

Victoria floundered, unable to form words.

The murmurs grew louder. "It's not Harrison - it's Penelope!"

"My god! Penelope was caught with a man!"

Cassandra shielded her daughter protectively. "Stop these vile accusations! Penelope doesn't even date! She would never!"

Frederick was beside himself. "Penelope, tell us what occurred!"

Sobbing, Penelope collapsed into her mother's arms. "I don't know! A maid spilled something on my gown, so I went upstairs to change. This... this monster attacked me when I entered the room. He forced me onto the bed and tried to... to..."

Penelope's virtue meant everything to Frederick and Cassandra. They'd dreamed of her marrying someone like Nathaniel. Now, before Willowbrook's elite, their daughter had been publicly violated. The thought made them shake with rage.

Frederick stormed toward Roland, delivering another vicious kick. "Who the hell are you? Explain yourself!"

Roland's eyes were glazed from the aphrodisiac he'd inhaled earlier. Seeing Penelope, he'd lost all control.

Now writhing in pain, Roland gritted his teeth and cried out, "Aunt Victoria! Aunt Victoria, help me!"

"Aunt Victoria?" Cassandra whirled on Victoria, her eyes blazing. "Victoria, is this animal your nephew?"

Victoria's face went deathly pale as realization dawned.

"Victoria! Why would you bring your nephew to Mother's birthday without telling anyone? What game are you playing?" Frederick roared, his entire body trembling with fury.

Cassandra flew at Victoria, delivering a stinging slap that echoed through the room. The sharp crack left everyone stunned.

Victoria clutched her reddening cheek. "Cassandra, have you lost your mind? How dare you strike me?"

"You planned this!" Cassandra seethed, her voice shaking with rage. "You wanted your nephew to ruin Penelope at this party! How could you be so heartless?"
###Chapter 62

Isabella moved forward, attempting to explain. "Please listen—"

"Back off!" Cassandra shoved Isabella violently.

Isabella lost her balance and slammed into the wall, a crimson bruise blooming on her forehead.

Victoria lunged to restrain Cassandra by the wrist. "How dare you—"

Without warning, Cassandra seized a handful of Victoria's hair and raked her nails across Victoria's face. "Victoria, who the hell do you think you are? Just a gold-digger who married her dead husband's brother!"

The room plunged into stunned silence. As the Whitmore family's influence had grown, Victoria's scandalous past had been carefully erased. Now Cassandra had ripped open old wounds in front of everyone.

The murmurs spread like wildfire. "Victoria married her brother-in-law?"

"You didn't know? Her first husband was the elder Whitmore brother. When he died, she seduced the younger one."

"Sleeping with both brothers? How revolting!"

Enraged, Victoria attacked Cassandra, yanking her hair viciously. "I'll rip your lying tongue out!"

The women became feral, clawing and screaming. Theodore tried to intervene, but Frederick punched him square in the face, sending him reeling with blood gushing from his nose.

Meanwhile, Penelope grabbed Isabella, and the two began shoving each other violently. The elegant gathering dissolved into utter chaos as both families joined the brawl.

Margaret stood frozen, watching the nightmare unfold.

"Enough! Stop this madness!" she shrieked.

CRASH!

The sound of splintering wood echoed as Victoria and Cassandra collided with the gift table. Delicate crystal ornaments shattered across the marble floor.

"My heirlooms!" Margaret wailed, her voice cracking.

In the frenzy, the women knocked over an ornate box. Nathaniel's precious gift, "The Lady in Bloom", tumbled to the ground and was trampled beneath their feet.

Margaret collapsed to her knees, devastated. "The painting! Stop this! You're destroying my birthday!"

Behind the heavy velvet drapes, Harrison observed the pandemonium with icy detachment.

This was her gift to Victoria.

She'd orchestrated everything—the maid "accidentally" spilling wine on Penelope's gown had been the perfect catalyst.

Harrison studied the chaos with clinical precision. No one understood their hypocrisy, malice, and self-interest better than she did. Had she been the target today, both families would have united to crucify her.

Yet when their own interests were threatened? They turned on each other like rabid dogs.

Margaret's eightieth birthday party had certainly become... memorable. Harrison lowered her lashes, masking the predatory glint in her eyes.

Suddenly, a deep, velvety voice cut through the noise. "Are you going to remove your hand?"

Harrison stiffened, abruptly aware that she and Nathaniel were concealed behind the curtains. Her palm still covered his mouth, her skin brushing against his sinfully soft lips.

She jerked her hand away, confused. Nathaniel wasn't part of her carefully laid plans.

Why was he here? He should have been with Isabella.

Nathaniel loosened his tie, his voice rough. "Harrison."

He said her name.

"What?"

Those smoldering eyes locked onto hers. "I'm burning up."

Burning?

Harrison's pulse stuttered when she recognized the hunger in his gaze. His eyes were dark with desire, pupils dilated with primal need.

Her stomach plummeted.

Oh god. He must have inhaled the remnants of the aphrodisiac gas lingering in the room.

###Chapter 63

"Nathaniel." Harrison's voice trembled slightly, laced with urgency. "Mr. Falcon, you've been poisoned!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. He'd already noticed the unnatural heat spreading through his limbs.

They'd been concealed behind heavy drapes, her curves molded against him, her delicate fingers silencing his lips. Fire pulsed through his veins, scattering his thoughts and hardening his body against his will.

The trap had snapped shut.

With iron grip, Nathaniel seized Harrison's wrist and dragged her through the chaotic scene. Outside, the Whitmore family's civil war raged, guests oblivious to their escape.

Dominic stood waiting by the sleek black Rolls-Royce. "Where to, sir?"

"Rosewood Manor." Nathaniel's reply came through gritted teeth.

•

Harrison had never stepped foot inside Nathaniel's private sanctuary before. The manor's understated opulence mirrored its owner - cool, controlled, intimidating.

Now she stood in his bedroom, heart pounding, after he'd inhaled that... substance.

"Stay." Nathaniel's command brooked no argument before vanishing into his study.

Alone, Harrison surveyed the masculine space. Dark woods, crisp linens, everything meticulously arranged. So different from their shared home at Emerald Heights.

In the study, Nathaniel shrugged off his jacket, muscles taut with restraint. Dominic's voice cut through the tension. "Victoria used aphrodisiac gas to lure Mrs. Falcon. She intended for Roland to compromise her, but Penelope got caught instead."

Nathaniel's lips curled. "No accident. Harrison turned Victoria's scheme against her. She orchestrated tonight's spectacle."

Dominic's eyes widened. "Remarkable."

Indeed. This fragile-looking woman had outmaneuvered the entire Whitmore clan. First exposing Isabella's schemes, then dismantling her alliance with Penelope with a single barb. Now turning Margaret's birthday into a battlefield.

Harrison was like ivy - delicate yet indestructible, thriving in adversity. Nathaniel had mistaken her for another socialite chasing his fortune. How wrong he'd been.

"Sir..." Dominic hesitated. "That Victoria would do this to her own daughter... Mrs. Falcon deserves better."

Nathaniel's chest constricted. Yes, she did.

Back in the bedroom, Harrison jumped when Nathaniel's voice rumbled behind her. "See anything you like?"

She whirled, losing her balance. The bed swallowed her in a tangle of limbs. Heat flooded her cheeks as Nathaniel loomed over her.

"Did you... find an antidote?" Her voice cracked. "I could help."
###Chapter 64
Harrison desperately tried to diffuse the tension.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze dropped to meet hers, his lips curling into that infuriating smirk.
"Help me?"

He was clearly under the influence, and here she was offering assistance.

Harrison's entire face burned crimson. She flailed her hands wildly.
"That's not what I meant! There are other ways I can help!"

"Really?" Nathaniel arched one perfect brow, thoroughly enjoying her flustered state. His voice dripped with amusement. "Do enlighten me."

Words failed her.

Was he toying with her deliberately?

The usually composed businessman seemed to relish watching her squirm.

Standing mere inches away, Nathaniel's tailored slacks hugged his powerful thighs, that ridiculously expensive black belt drawing attention to his lean waist.

Harrison's eyes darted everywhere but lower. She couldn't. Wouldn't. Yet her eye level aligned dangerously close to...

Then his large hand captured her face. His smirk deepened. "Harrison, where exactly are you looking?"

First she'd been inspecting his bedroom, now stealing glances at him.

Scarlet-cheeked, she stammered, "N-nowhere!" She tried to bolt, but Nathaniel held firm. His thumb brushed her cheekbone. "Why were you exiled to the countryside?" The question came casually, but his grip tightened.

Harrison froze. Her wide eyes searched his.

"Did no one want you?" he pressed.

No one wanted her.

The words struck like a physical blow. Tears pricked her eyes—not just from sadness, but from the raw sting of rejection. The crushing knowledge that even the man who'd once claimed to want her had changed his mind.

Her gaze locked onto his, brimming with unspoken longing. Nathaniel towered over her, his powerful frame radiating dominance. With ease, he could shield any woman in those strong arms.

Right now, Nathaniel thought she looked heartbreakingly fragile. Perched on his bed, her delicate features still held traces of youthful innocence. Those clear eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

She was temptation incarnate—begging to be claimed, protected, desired.

An electric current crackled between them, thick with unspoken hunger.

The fire Nathaniel had been restraining roared to life. His fingers tightened on her soft cheeks, forcing her lips into a perfect 'O' that revealed pearly teeth and a flash of pink tongue.

Swearing under his breath, Nathaniel abruptly released her. "I need a cold shower."

He turned sharply toward the bathroom.

Harrison remained on the bed, trembling. She'd told herself she didn't need anyone. Yet seeing Nathaniel, that overwhelming urge to lean on him resurfaced—to cling to the man who'd once promised sanctuary when the world cast her out.

But he didn't want her anymore.

He wanted Isabella.

Meanwhile, chaos reigned at the Whitmore estate. Frederick and Cassandra had stormed out with Penelope, cursing viciously. Margaret, overcome with rage, had been rushed to the hospital.

Isabella and Victoria sat slumped on the sofa, their flawless makeup now smeared—clear evidence of their humiliating defeat against the third branch.

The birthday gala had turned the Whitmores into Willowbrook's laughingstock.

Isabella's jaw clenched. Then realization struck—where was Nathaniel? The guests had dispersed, but Nathaniel was nowhere to be found.

"Nathaniel? Nathaniel!"
###Chapter 65

Silence filled the air.

Theodore remained outside, bidding farewell to the guests. With a strained smile, he escorted Lawrence and Winston to their limousines. "Mr. Pembroke, Mr. Chamberlain, regarding our business deal..."

Lawrence couldn't suppress his laughter at Theodore's battered appearance. "Mr. Whitmore, you might want to visit a plastic surgeon," he remarked, eyeing Theodore's injuries.

The executives entered their luxury vehicles and drove away.

Theodore stormed back inside, his expression thunderous. He marched straight to Victoria, fury radiating from him. "Victoria, did you plan this disaster? You've completely humiliated me!"

Victoria stood frozen, utterly bewildered. Her meticulous planning had somehow backfired spectacularly.

She reached for Theodore's arm desperately. "Darling, please let me explain—"

Theodore violently shook her off and grabbed his coat. "I never want to see you again!" he spat before slamming the door behind him.

Victoria remained rooted to the spot, her face and neck marred with scratches, her complexion ghostly pale. This night was supposed to redeem her in Theodore's eyes—instead, it had driven him further away.

She turned to Isabella, clinging to her daughter like a drowning woman. "Isabella, you have to understand—"

Isabella shoved her mother away without hesitation, her voice icy. "Mother, what's wrong with you lately? You keep ruining everything!"

Harrison... This was all Harrison's fault!

Victoria's eyes burned with venom. Before Harrison returned, her life had been perfect. But ever since that wretched girl came back, everything had gone wrong. Harrison was her curse!

Just then, Roland rushed over, groveling at Victoria's feet. "Aunt Victoria, I'm so sorry."

Victoria grabbed Roland by his collar. "What the hell happened? Why was Penelope in that room instead of Harrison?"

Roland struggled to recall, his face contorted in confusion. "Aunt Victoria, it's all blurry. I think I saw Mr. Falcon, then Penelope entered. I... I breathed in that scent and completely lost control. I couldn't tell who was who anymore."

Isabella gasped. "Wait—Nathaniel was in that room too?" No wonder she couldn't find him!

Roland nodded weakly. "Yes."

Victoria clutched Isabella's arm urgently, her eyes suddenly alight with realization. "Isabella, go find Mr. Falcon immediately!"

Isabella frowned. "Why?"

"Listen carefully—Nathaniel inhaled that scent too! This isn't over yet. You must get to him now. Tonight, you need to sleep with him!"

Understanding dawned on Isabella's face. Of course! Nathaniel had been affected—he'd need a woman, and that woman should be her. She bit her lip thoughtfully. They hadn't reached that level of intimacy yet—she knew men valued women more when they waited until marriage.

She would tease him, dance for him, but not give herself completely. Tonight, she'd let him have her—but only if he divorced Harrison first.

Victoria was right. They still had a chance!

With renewed determination, Isabella left.

Victoria smirked to herself. Harrison probably thought she'd won, but Victoria knew better. As long as Nathaniel still loved Isabella, Harrison would never truly win.

At Rosewood Manor, Nathaniel stood under the shower's scalding spray while Harrison prepared to leave.

Despite the aphrodisiac's effects, he clearly didn't need her help. There was no reason to stay.

Just then, her phone chimed with Alexander's custom ringtone. She answered immediately. "Alexander?"

"Harrison, where are you?" Alexander's voice came through warmly. "Let me take you for a midnight drive."
###Chapter 66
The bathroom door flew open, releasing a swirl of steam that framed Nathaniel's imposing figure as he stepped out, water droplets glistening on his toned physique.

Nathaniel wore a deep crimson silk robe that clung to his damp skin. His sharp ears immediately caught Alexander's playful invitation to Harrison for a night out.

Harrison turned and found Nathaniel watching them with predatory intensity.

"I'll text you later, Alexander," she said abruptly, ending the call. Her voice remained steady but icy. "I'm leaving."

She grabbed her purse, but Nathaniel's voice, smooth yet dangerous, stopped her mid-step. "Running off to Alexander so soon?"

Harrison ignored him, turning toward the door. Nathaniel moved like lightning, his fingers encircling her slender wrist like a manacle.

She stiffened. His skin burned against hers, feverish and unrelenting. The cold shower had done nothing to quell whatever fire raged inside him.

When she tried to pull away, Nathaniel pinned her against the wall with terrifying ease. "Tell me, Harrison. How intimate have you and Alexander become?"

Her phone hit the carpet with a sickening crunch, the screen shattering.

In the dim light, Nathaniel loomed over her, demanding answers about her relationship with another man.

Harrison's dark lashes fluttered like trapped butterflies, her eyes blazing with humiliation and fury. "That's none of your business!"

Nathaniel tilted his head, a dark chuckle rumbling in his chest as he studied her captive wrist. His smirk never wavered.

The aphrodisiac pulsed through his veins, but he'd believed himself stronger than this. Yet one look at her defiant expression had shattered his control. The cold shower had only stoked the flames.

And now she wanted to run to another man?

His gaze dropped to her parted lips. He traced them with his thumb, eyes glinting dangerously. "Tell me, Harrison. Would you rather have his lips on you... or mine?"

Harrison gaped at him, stunned by his audacity. The man had clearly lost his mind.

She shoved against his chest. "Release me this inst—"

Her words were cut off as Nathaniel crushed his mouth to hers.

Harrison's eyes flew wide as he dominated the kiss, forcing her lips apart with ruthless precision. She gasped for air, twisting in his grasp. "Nathaniel, don't—"

He trapped her delicate hand in his larger one, squeezing just shy of painful. His voice emerged rough with need. "Harrison... I need you."

Every inch of him burned for her. She was his greatest temptation, his most dangerous addiction.

Panicked, Harrison struggled against his iron grip.

But Nathaniel only pulled her closer, his breath hot against her neck. "Nathaniel, stop! There are other ways to help you—ah!" Her cry sliced through the tension.

Nathaniel's vision blurred red. He buried his face in her hair, lips brushing her ear. "Tell me, Harrison. Who holds your heart? Him... or me?"

His gravelly voice dripped with cruel charm, mocking her predicament.

Harrison's knees threatened to buckle as she twisted away from his seeking mouth. "Nathaniel, I swear if you don't—"

A sharp knock interrupted them. "Mr. Falcon? Ms. Isabella has arrived."
###Chapter 67

Isabella arrived.

Nathaniel froze instantly.

The haze of desire that had clouded his mind moments ago dissipated like smoke. He jerked his head away, shame flooding through him.

What had he been about to do? He'd nearly crossed an unforgivable line with Harrison.

Harrison felt his grip loosen and stepped back, finally free.

"Stay here. Don't move," Nathaniel commanded, his voice strained.

He turned on his heel and stormed out, undoubtedly searching for Isabella.

Just seconds ago, he'd been consumed with passion. Now, at the mere mention of Isabella's name, he abandoned Harrison without hesitation. As if Harrison meant nothing.

The flush of embarrassment faded from Harrison's cheeks. A bitter smile twisted her lips. How ironic - she, the legal wife, felt like the other woman. As if she were the mistress sneaking around with Nathaniel while Isabella was the true wife.

What would he do with Isabella now? Undoubtedly finish what he'd started with her.

Harrison knelt to gather the shattered pieces of her phone from the carpet, carefully reassembling it.

The device rang almost immediately. Victoria was calling.

Harrison answered.

Victoria's voice dripped with amusement. "Harrison, I'm certain Isabella went to see Nathaniel, didn't she?"

Harrison's expression remained icy as she stayed silent.

Victoria sounded positively gleeful. "I'll bet you were with Nathaniel when she arrived. And I'll bet he dropped you the moment she appeared. Oh, and remember when Nathaniel brought Isabella to Rosewood Manor? She slept in his master bedroom. In his bed."

Harrison ended the call abruptly. Her gaze drifted to the bed in the bedroom.

His bed. Where Isabella had slept just days before.

At the Whitmore estate, Victoria hung up with a satisfied smile.

Roland, grinding his teeth, spoke up. "Aunt Victoria, Harrison caused all this trouble. Are we really letting her off so easily?"

Victoria's eyes gleamed with cunning. "By my calculations, Harrison's foster father from the countryside should be out of prison by now."

Roland's anger faded into a smirk. "Vincent Blackwood? He was released just two days ago."

Victoria's smile deepened. "Now that Harrison's all grown up and married to Nathaniel, the richest man in Willowbrook - living in luxury and favored by Grandmother - we should bring her foster father to visit. He deserves to benefit from his daughter's success."

Roland nodded approvingly. "I'll handle it, Aunt Victoria."

He paused, then added, "Harrison truly is heartless. She blinded Vincent in one eye and sent him to prison."

Victoria chuckled darkly. "Harrison thinks the show's over? No, darling. This is just the beginning. I wonder how the Falcon family will react when they learn about your dark past."

Nathaniel entered the study, expecting to find Isabella.

Since Nathaniel had brought Isabella home days ago - the first woman he'd ever brought to Rosewood Manor - the staff had let her in without question.

But the study stood empty.

Where had she gone?

Suddenly, delicate hands covered his eyes. A playful voice whispered, "Guess who?"

Nathaniel pulled the hands away to find Isabella's radiant face before him.

He sank onto the couch. "What is it?"

Isabella gave him a sultry look, then slowly lifted her hands to her coat. The garment slid effortlessly from her bare shoulders, pooling at her feet. Now she stood before him wearing nothing but a strapless mini dress.
###Chapter 68

From childhood, Isabella had devoted herself to ballet, investing heavily in monthly spa treatments to maintain her porcelain skin. The strapless mini dress clung to her toned figure, accentuating every curve of her dancer's body.

Nathaniel lounged on the sofa, his gaze tracking her movements. She toyed with her hair, fully aware of his attention. His eyes kept drifting to her silhouette, admiring the graceful lines of her body.

In all of Willowbrook, Isabella was considered one of the most stunning women. She knew exactly what made Nathaniel look twice.

Noticing his stare, she smirked and sauntered closer. Her stilettos clicked against the marble floor as she boldly climbed onto his lap, straddling him.

Her manicured fingers traced the contours of his chest through his shirt. "Nathaniel, you're so tense."

She tilted her head, voice dripping with playful challenge. "With you this worked up, how could I resist giving you this surprise? Are you pleased?"

She was positioning herself as the gift.

Nathaniel remained silent, watching her with detached amusement as she continued her performance.

With a calculated smile, Isabella looped her arms around his neck. "Nathaniel," she whispered, lips brushing his ear, "if you want me, you'll need to sign this first."

She produced a document from her clutch.

Nathaniel glanced at it. Divorce papers.

"Sign this and end things with Harrison tonight. Otherwise..." She trailed off, confident in her leverage. What man could refuse her?

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "I'm still married to Harrison. Is your family that impatient?"

Isabella stiffened. "What do you mean?"

"Your family must be devastated their little plan failed. No public scandal with Harrison and Roland at the gala?"

Her pupils dilated as she met his icy stare. His expression remained unreadable.

Nathaniel removed her hands from his neck. "Harrison remains my wife. Don't try this again."

He pushed her off and stood, heading for the door.

Isabella stood frozen, the rejection hitting like a physical blow. She'd arrived so certain of her victory, planning to use her body as bargaining chip. She'd imagined their first night together would be tonight.

But reality was cruel. Nathaniel's concern wasn't for her. It was for Harrison. His words were clear - Harrison was still his wife. This was unacceptable.

Was that a threat? For Harrison?

Heart pounding, Isabella rushed forward, wrapping herself around Nathaniel from behind.

He stopped.

Her hands roamed his chest, feeling the heat beneath his shirt. "Nathaniel, stay with me tonight."

Surely he couldn't resist now?

The aphrodisiac should have been taking full effect by now. And she was giving him every opportunity.

But Nathaniel simply removed her hands. "Not interested tonight. I'm leaving."

Isabella froze, the words like a slap.

Nathaniel didn't turn back. "My driver will take you home. Get some rest."

Without another glance, he walked out.

Isabella stood trembling in her designer dress. "Nathaniel!"

He'd actually walked away?

As a woman, she could sense the change. Why was he different now?

Nathaniel entered the master suite, calling out, "Harrison..."
###Chapter 69

The master suite stood eerily vacant, Harrison's presence completely erased.

A sharp knock interrupted the silence. Dominic appeared at the threshold. "Mr. Falcon, I spotted Mrs. Falcon leaving as I arrived."

She left? After I explicitly told her to wait?

"I've dispatched our team to locate the antidote for that aphrodisiac Dominic administered."

Nathaniel barely moved his lips. "Unnecessary."

He strode into the marble bathroom, twisting the shower knob to its coldest setting.

The drug's effects had mostly dissipated after Harrison's intervention, leaving only residual traces in Nathaniel's system. His iron will could overpower what remained.

Icy needles assaulted his sculpted torso as the water cascaded down. Droplets danced across his defined abs before shattering against the tiles - a physique that could make saints falter.

Nathaniel kept his gaze lowered, yet Harrison's delicate features haunted him. The memory of her gentle touch burned hotter than the water was cold.

Desire flared unexpectedly. He cursed under his breath, dragging a hand down his stubbled jaw.

Morning light stabbed through Harrison's eyelids as her phone screamed. Gabrielle's name flashed on screen.

Chaos erupted through the receiver before Harrison could speak. "Harrison! Sebastian just stormed into Vogue Paris with his goons!"

"What?" Her pulse stuttered. Sebastian attacking Gabrielle's workplace? "Are you hurt?"

"I'm fi-- AHH!" The phone clattered before Sebastian's sneering voice replaced hers.

"Harrison, your little friend's my guest now. Come play if you want her back!"

Gabrielle's muffled protests cut through. "Don't come, Harri--"

"Shut her up!" Sebastian barked.

Only desperate whimpers remained.

Harrison's vision sharpened to lethal focus. "Touch one hair on her head, Sebastian, and I'll dismantle you piece by piece."

She arrived at the magazine offices in record time. Sebastian lounged amidst his black-suited enforcers. Gabrielle struggled against duct tape binding her mouth.

Their eyes met. Gabrielle shook her head violently, pleading silently for Harrison to flee.

Harrison squared her shoulders. "What's your game, Mr. Blackwood?"

Sebastian - Willowbrook's most notorious bully - feared only Nathaniel. He smirked around his chewing gum, surveying Harrison like roadkill.

"Faster than I expected, country girl. Isabella called last night - said you're clinging to Nathaniel like some desperate groupie. Can't fathom why trash like you thinks it belongs with royalty."

So Isabella had poisoned his ear.

Sebastian had always considered Harrison unworthy. After Isabella's failed seduction attempt, she'd weaponized Sebastian's disdain.

He traced a finger along Gabrielle's cheekbone, eyes glinting maliciously. "Since you've made Isabella's life difficult, I'll return the favor. Let's see how tough you really are."

His hand tightened in Gabrielle's hair.

"Stop!" Harrison's voice cracked like a whip.

Sebastian paused, grinning. "Scared, peasant? Beg nicely and maybe I'll go easy on her."

Harrison's gaze turned arctic. "You've always despised me, Sebastian. Here's my offer: A challenge. If I lose, I'll grovel at your feet. If you lose, Gabrielle walks free."
###Chapter 70

Sebastian's eyes lit up with curiosity. "What sort of challenge did you have in mind?"

Harrison knew Sebastian was obsessed with mobile gaming. "Let's settle this with one round. Winner takes all."

"You're joking!" Sebastian burst into laughter. "You're challenging me? I'm ranked top 100 globally, Harrison! Do you honestly think you stand a chance?"

A sly smile played on Harrison's lips. "We'll see about that."

Sebastian whipped out his phone. "Game on! Prepare to get schooled."

Both screens illuminated as the match began.

In-game, Sebastian's avatar executed a perfect aerial spin, his legendary sword gleaming. "Say goodbye, Harrison!"

Then came the deafening "DEFEAT" notification. The match had ended abruptly.

Sebastian shot up from his chair, face frozen in shock. While he'd been showing off his signature move, Harrison had descended from above with a radiant battle-axe, delivering the killing blow.

Impossible.

He was a pro gamer. A tournament champion.

His voice trembled. "You... you actually beat me?"

Harrison's smirk widened. "Looks like you owe me, Mr. Willowbrook."

She pocketed her phone and moved to Gabrielle, gently removing the gag. "Are you hurt?"

Gabrielle straightened her clothes. "I'm fine, Harrison."

"Let's get out of here."

As they turned to leave, Sebastian blocked their path. "Not so fast!"

Harrison's gaze turned glacial. "A deal's a deal. You lost. We're leaving."

Sebastian's face twisted in frustration. "That was a fluke! Best two out of three!"

A deep baritone voice cut through the tension. "Sebastian. Explain yourself."

Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, dressed in all black. His piercing stare made Sebastian shrink back.

"Nathaniel? What are you doing here?" Sebastian stammered.

Harrison answered coolly, "I called him."

Their eyes met across the room - an unspoken understanding passing between them.

Sebastian spluttered, "That's cheating! You can't just-"

Nathaniel's palm connected sharply with the back of Sebastian's head. "What were you thinking?" His voice dripped with warning. "Apologize. Now."

"You want me to apologize to Harrison? But-"

Nathaniel raised his hand again.

Sebastian immediately cowered. "Fine! Harrison, I'm sorry."

Harrison stepped forward, her petite frame radiating authority. "Listen carefully, Mr. Willowbrook. First - I'm not the one clinging to this marriage. Your precious Nathaniel refuses to sign the papers. Maybe direct your energy toward convincing him instead of harassing me."

Sebastian's face flushed crimson. "You little-"

"Second." Harrison closed the distance between them. "Touch my friends again, and I'll finish what Nathaniel started."
###Chapter 71

Sebastian gasped sharply, his face draining of color.

What was this country bumpkin saying? She wanted to teach him a lesson on Nathaniel's behalf? Was she out of her mind?

In all of Willowbrook, the only person who could stand up to him—the local troublemaker—was Nathaniel!

Harrison tugged Gabrielle's hand. "Let's go."

As they turned toward the exit, Nathaniel reached out and caught her slender wrist.

His long fingers wrapped around hers, sending an electric jolt through them both. Memories of that night at Rosewood Manor flashed through their minds—when he had pinned her against the wall...

Harrison yanked her hand free.

Nathaniel studied her delicate features, his Adam's apple bobbing slightly. "Harrison," he said coolly, "this won't happen again."

She met his gaze with icy disdain. "Sort things out with Beatrice soon. I'm ready to file for divorce anytime. I've been wanting to hand Isabella her rightful title as Mrs. Falcon for a while now."

With that, she turned and left, Gabrielle in tow.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure, his brow furrowing.

Sebastian whined, "Nathaniel, what was that about?"

Nathaniel shot him a warning glare.

Sebastian clamped his mouth shut, then grumbled, "Harrison just destroyed me in a mobile game! She killed me!"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "She beat you?"

Sebastian was no amateur—few could match his gaming skills.

"I demand a rematch!" Sebastian pulled out his phone and sent Harrison a challenge.

She was still online. She accepted.

Another round began.

This time, Sebastian didn’t hold back. He charged at her with his massive sword, roaring, "Die!"

Game Over.

"Damn it!" Sebastian nearly threw his phone. He’d been shouting threats, yet Harrison had effortlessly crushed him again.

He was losing his mind. She was dominating him completely.

How? He was a champion!

Nathaniel’s dark eyes flickered with surprise. He hadn’t expected Harrison to be this skilled. Sebastian couldn’t even land a hit.

Then Nathaniel remembered—her lightning-fast reflexes during their last confrontation.

Was there a connection? He quickly dismissed the thought.

Sebastian suddenly yelled, "Nathaniel, look what she just sent me!"

Harrison had messaged him in-game. Nathaniel glanced at the screen.

Get lost, rookie.

Sebastian’s face burned with humiliation. "She’s mocking me!"

Nathaniel smirked, a low chuckle escaping him. She was... fascinating.

Through the polished glass, Nathaniel watched Harrison walk down the street with Gabrielle. Her raven-black hair cascaded over her shoulders, soft and luminous, enhancing her delicate beauty.

He couldn’t look away.

"Challenge her!" Sebastian urged. "You’ve never met someone who could actually compete with you. Crush her and teach her some respect!"
###Chapter 72

Sebastian couldn't defeat Harrison in the game. Frustrated, he turned to Nathaniel with puppy-dog eyes.

Nathaniel arched one perfect eyebrow, his face unreadable. "The office is waiting."

Harrison's avatar had disappeared from the screen - offline again.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, disappointment written across his face. "Nate, you have to play against Harrison next time."

Nathaniel didn't object. He studied Sebastian briefly before responding, "Why?"

Suddenly, Sebastian's face lit up with realization. "Nate! Did you add that professor of yours yet?"

Nathaniel's eyebrow climbed higher. "Why the sudden interest?"

"She's my dream girl!" Sebastian practically vibrated with excitement.

"We're in the same group chat," Nathaniel revealed.

Sebastian's eyes turned starry. "Seriously? Add me right now! I need to connect with my queen!"

After relentless begging, Nathaniel finally pulled out his phone and added Sebastian to the chat group.

The moment Sebastian spotted W in the members list, his pulse skyrocketed. His goddess!

He regretted wasting time playing with that country mouse Harrison. But now? Pure euphoria flooded his system at the thought of messaging his idol.

Sebastian immediately sent W a friend request.

"Nate," he whispered shakily, "what should I say when she accepts? I'm freaking out here."

Nathaniel offered a cryptic smile. "Let's see if she accepts first."

Truth was, his brilliant junior still hadn't approved his own request.

Meanwhile, Harrison's phone pinged. Sebastian's friend request popped up with the message: "Hello, Queen."

Gabrielle burst into laughter. "Harrison, I'd pay to see Sebastian's face when he realizes his 'queen' is the same person he constantly mocks. The irony is delicious."

Harrison smirked, tapping her screen decisively.

Sebastian's phone chimed. "She's responding!" He nearly dropped the device in his excitement.

His face fell instantly. Harrison had rejected his request.

Nathaniel didn't react. Exactly as predicted.

Sebastian looked devastated. "Why would she reject me?"

He tagged W in the group chat: [My queen, why won't you accept me?]

Ding.

Harrison's reply came lightning fast: [Because you're irritating. Like him.]

Sebastian gaped at his screen. Irritating? Him?

Nathaniel's lips twitched. At least he wasn't alone in this treatment.

What baffled him was why his brilliant junior found them both annoying. What exactly had they done to deserve this?

A sugary voice interrupted their thoughts. "Nathaniel, Sebastian, what's so fascinating over here?"

Isabella had appeared.

Sebastian brightened immediately. "Issy! We were talking about Nate's genius junior - my queen! She just rejected me."

That junior again.

Jealousy flashed in Isabella's eyes. Sebastian had always been her loyal lapdog, defending her just last night against Harrison. Now he was calling some professor his queen? Would he abandon her too?

But Isabella had news.

"Nathaniel," she said sweetly, "you're needed at the family estate. Harrison's foster father from the countryside was just released from prison. He's at Falcon Manor right now."
###Chapter 73

Harrison stepped back into the Falcon estate, her breath catching as she recognized the figure in the living room. Vincent Blackwood. The man who haunted her nightmares.

A decade ago, Victoria had shipped her off to the countryside - straight into Vincent's so-called care. Now here he sat, perched on Eleanor's antique sofa like he belonged.

"Harrison thrived in the countryside thanks to you," Eleanor gushed, pouring tea. "You raised such a refined young woman. Now she's the lady of Falcon Enterprises."

Vincent's single working eye darted across the gilded room, lingering too long on the Ming vases. His massive frame seemed to swallow the delicate furniture whole. The same man known for breaking his wife's ribs during drunken rages now played the humble farmer.

"You're too kind, Mrs. Eleanor. I hope my girl hasn't embarrassed you since marrying into such a fine family."

"Embarrassed us? Harrison's been perfect."

Vincent's lips twisted into that familiar, predatory smile. "Oh yes, my Harrison was always... perfect."

Harrison's nails bit into her palms. Bile rose in her throat.

"Mrs. Harrison, you've returned." Reginald's voice cut through the tension.

Vincent's head snapped up. Ten years had transformed the scrawny girl into this elegant woman. His gaze crawled over her body like filthy hands.

"Harrison." He stood, voice dripping false warmth. "Ten years I've waited. Not a day passed without me thinking of you."

Eleanor beamed. "Your foster father traveled so far to see you, dear."

Harrison's blood turned to ice. Every childhood terror came rushing back. Her limbs locked in place.

Then - warmth. A strong arm encircled her shoulders. Calloused fingers pressed gently into her skin.

"Why are you standing here?" Nathaniel's deep voice vibrated against her back.

She looked up into those piercing eyes. For a moment, the world blurred. She swayed slightly.

Nathaniel shrugged off his jacket, handing it to a maid. His thumb stroked her collarbone. "You're freezing."

His heat seeped through her blouse, thawing the fear. She unconsciously leaned into his solid frame.

"Perhaps I dressed too lightly," she murmured.

Eleanor gestured proudly. "Nathaniel, this is Harrison's foster father. He came all the way from Wintervale."

Nathaniel's gaze turned arctic as it landed on Vincent.

Vincent's jaw clenched as he took in Nathaniel's commanding presence. That worthless brat had landed herself a king. Rage burned behind his smile.
###Chapter 74

Nathaniel chuckled awkwardly. "Mr. Falcon, hello. I never imagined Harrison would marry so well. Seeing you two together, such a perfect match, I can finally rest easy. I should be going now."

Eleanor quickly intervened. "Stay for dinner, Vincent. You've traveled so far, and I've already instructed the staff to prepare a meal. It'll be lovely to have a family gathering."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze met Vincent's. "Stay."

Both men extended the invitation.

Vincent smiled nervously. "Well, if you insist-"

Harrison's icy voice sliced through the air. "He won't be staying."

Vincent froze mid-sentence, his eyes snapping to her.

She met his stare without flinching. "You just got released. Don't come back to Rosewood Manor again."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

Eleanor gasped. "Wait... prison?"

Harrison's face remained impassive. "Ten years."

Eleanor turned to Vincent. "What happened?"

Vincent smirked, shifting his gaze to Harrison. "Ask her. She knows better than anyone."

He was testing her - would she reveal his secret?

Harrison stayed silent.

Eleanor attempted to diffuse the tension. "Anyone who raised such an extraordinary daughter can't be all bad. People deserve second chances."

Seeing Harrison's silence, Vincent's smirk widened. He thought he'd won. "I'll skip dinner. But Mr. Falcon, may I speak with you privately?"

Harrison opened her mouth, but Nathaniel gently squeezed her shoulder. "Of course. My study."

Vincent followed Nathaniel into the luxurious study, his eyes greedily taking in the tasteful decor - the rich mahogany, the understated elegance that screamed wealth. Every detail fueled his envy.

One thought consumed him: during his decade behind bars, Harrison had never left his mind.

She'd taken his eye and his freedom. Now she lived in this palace? Married to this man?

He wouldn't let her forget him.

Vincent turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, Harrison grew up in the countryside with little education. She's... fortunate to have married into your family."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "You're mistaken. She's exceptional."

Vincent blinked, caught off guard.

Nathaniel's stare became unnervingly intense. "Was that all?"

Vincent squirmed under the scrutiny. The man's gaze felt like an X-ray.

He forced a laugh. "Well... I'm recently released and struggling financially. As Harrison's foster father, perhaps you could..."

Nathaniel's expression didn't change. "You need money?"

Vincent swallowed his pride. Greed won. "Yes. Surely helping family isn't too much to ask?"

Nathaniel leaned back in his leather chair. "Name your price."
###Chapter 75

Nathaniel's generosity made Harrison hesitate before responding. "Mr. Falcon, whatever amount you deem suitable will be fine."

One dark eyebrow arched. "How about a million?"

A million dollars?

Harrison's eyes sparkled with surprise. He hadn't anticipated Nathaniel offering such a substantial sum without hesitation.

"That should suffice."

Nathaniel produced a check and passed it to Harrison.

Harrison quickly verified the amount. Six zeros confirmed it was indeed a million. "Thank you, Mr. Falcon. I'll take my leave now."

Clutching the check, Harrison departed with visible satisfaction.

Nathaniel returned to their bedroom where Eleanor awaited him.

She glanced up from her seat. "What did Harrison want to discuss?"

Casually loosening his onyx dress shirt's top button, Nathaniel revealed his sculpted collarbone with a smirk. "What do you imagine he wanted?"

Eleanor's brow furrowed. "I'm being serious. This isn't a joke."

Nathaniel removed his platinum wristwatch, placing it on the dresser. Noticing her tense expression, his eyebrow lifted. "He didn't say much. Just requested financial assistance."

Her expression shifted. "Did you give him money?"

"I did."

"How much?"

"One million."

Eleanor stared in disbelief. "Why would you give him anything? And why that amount?"

Nathaniel closed the distance between them. "Eleanor, what's gotten into you tonight? That's your foster father. A million is nothing."

She studied his aristocratic features, radiating effortless elegance. Nathaniel had always been generous with her. To him, a million was pocket change - barely noticeable charity.

Her clear gaze locked onto his handsome face. "Give him a million today, he'll demand two tomorrow. You're feeding his greed. I'm getting that money back."

She turned to leave, but Nathaniel caught her slender wrist.

"Eleanor, explain yourself." His voice dropped to a murmur. "Why was your foster father imprisoned for ten years? That's a serious sentence."

He was inquiring about Vincent's crime.

His gaze remained gentle, showing no judgment despite Vincent's visit. Raised in privilege and educated among elites, Nathaniel carried himself with natural refinement. He'd always been decent, as had Eleanor - accepting her past without prejudice. This was true aristocracy.

When Vincent had posed the question earlier, Eleanor hadn't answered - not from shame, but because it wasn't relevant.

She met Nathaniel's eyes. "That's personal. It doesn't concern you."

Nathaniel's lips curved knowingly. Pulling her closer, he chuckled while reprimanding, "Eleanor, remember your position."

She spoke deliberately. "Nathaniel, don't interfere if you won't take responsibility. Don't offer hope where there can be none."

She extracted her wrist from his grasp and turned away.

He was a good man, but not hers. Their divorce loomed, after which he'd belong to Isabella. No matter how much she might crave his support, it could never be.

Years ago, he'd promised to rescue her from that dark place. He'd never know how many days she'd waited there, watching for him. He never came.

Instead, Vincent had claimed her.

He'd abandoned her.

In the VIP lounge of The Velvet Club, Vincent sprawled across a leather sofa, slapping the million-dollar check onto the glass table. Extending his legs, he smirked at the staff.

"Bring all your finest girls here. See this? I've got real money now!"
###Chapter 76

Vincent had spent a decade behind bars. Now free, he craved indulgence.

The Velvet Lounge's madam's eyes lit up at the sight of the million-dollar check. "Ladies! We have a VIP!"

A parade of glamorous women filed in, lining up before Vincent.

The madam purred, "Vincent darling, who catches your eye?"

His gaze swept over them dismissively. "Too seasoned. I prefer them tender - the fresher, the better."

"Vincent, these beauties are barely twenty," the madam countered.

His tongue darted out, eyes glinting with perverse hunger. "I want younger."

The madam's smile faltered. This man reeked of depravity.

The VIP door burst open. Harrison strode in, icy fury radiating from her.

The madam gasped. "Sweetheart! Who are you-"

Harrison cut her off with a glacial stare at Vincent. "Hand over that check."

"Well, well. Harrison graces us," Vincent leered, drinking in her flawless beauty. The club's women paled in comparison.

He waved the check tauntingly. "This is your husband's gift to me. I raised you, didn't I? Shouldn't you support your dear foster father?"

Disgust coiled in Harrison's gut. She lunged for the check.

His face twisted. "You ungrateful bitch! Think you're too good now?"

As his hand shot toward her hair, a silver needle flashed through the air.

Thunk. It pierced clean through his palm. Vincent collapsed like a puppet with cut strings, howling.

Harrison plucked the check from his limp fingers. "Still think you can touch me?"

Vincent writhed, his screams echoing off the velvet walls.

She turned to leave.

"Wait!" Vincent's voice turned venomous. "Your precious husband should know how his wife used to sit on my lap in her little skirts. Like a doll, all milk and honey. Remember how I kissed you?"

Harrison's fists clenched.

"Think Nathaniel will still want you after that? Eleanor dotes on you, but you're just trash."

Without a word, Harrison walked out.

The city lights blurred as she wandered streets thrumming with laughter. Memories assaulted her - Victoria paying Vincent to take her, the countryside house, the drunken rages.

The wife who jumped into the river.

Then just the two of them. Alone.
###Chapter 77

Vincent Blackwood towered over the frail girl, his drunken breath reeking of cheap whiskey as he stared at Harrison with predatory eyes.

The cabin walls seemed to shrink around her. Vincent would lurk by the doorway, watching. Always watching. His bloodshot eyes followed her every move with sickening hunger.

As Harrison grew older, the danger intensified. Vincent's leering gaze traced her developing curves with increasing boldness. One evening, he yanked her onto his lap, his body radiating heat and the cloying sweetness of rum. She froze as his calloused hands slid up her thighs.

Nightmares became reality. She learned to lock the bathroom door completely, yet still felt his presence. Through the crack, she'd see his dilated pupils gleaming with perverse excitement.

Then came the worst night. Vincent brought home two equally drunk companions. "Why don't you remarry, Vince?" they slurred between laughs.

Vincent's chuckle sent ice through her veins. "Got myself a bride right here. Just needs more... ripening."

Their eyes lit up with sudden interest. "Damn, you lucky bastard!"

Trembling, Harrison fled into the night. Her numb fingers dialed Victoria's number at a payphone. When the line connected, her tears fell like shattered glass. "Mom! Please—"

Isabella's smug voice cut through. "Who is this? My mother only has one daughter!" Then Victoria's cooing voice: "Darling Isabella, your pearl tiara's ready! All your friends are waiting for your ballet performance."

It was Isabella's birthday.

Harrison's hope died. She hung up and wandered deeper into the woods, where she found Nathaniel bleeding beneath the pines.

"I'll take you away," he promised feverishly. "I want you." They clung to each other for warmth, but by dawn, Nathaniel was burning up, muttering about water.

She foraged desperately for medicinal herbs. When she returned, the cave stood empty. She waited for days, clinging to his promise.

Vincent found her first.

The slap sent her sprawling. "My property doesn't run!" he snarled, pinning her down. Fabric tore as his whiskey-sour breath hit her face. "Time to learn your place—"

Her fingers closed around the sharpened branch she'd hidden. With a scream, she drove it into his eye.

The courtroom echoed with Vincent's howls as the judge sentenced him. Ten years.

Harrison exhaled, pulling herself from the memory. They say childhood wounds never fully heal. For years, she'd been stitching herself back together.

Working tirelessly. Fighting to free that terrified girl from the past's shadows.
###Chapter 78
She was fighting for survival.

The night air carried a sharp chill as couples strolled along the boulevard, laughter floating between them. But Harrison shivered, wrapping her arms around herself as if shielding her fragile heart from the cold.

She returned to the Falcon family estate, intending to check on Eleanor. As she neared Eleanor's door, she caught the murmur of voices—Eleanor speaking to Nathaniel in that gentle, knowing tone.

"Harrison's adoptive father visited today," Eleanor said softly. "I could see how much it affected her. You should spend time with her, Nathaniel. She's endured so much."

A quiet sigh followed.

"Harrison was sent away as a child. Her real father died young, and her mother never showed her kindness. I see the loneliness in her, the way she aches for love. Despite her adoptive father's prison sentence, look at the woman she's become—strong, resilient. She married into our family, and for that, we owe him gratitude. If he needs anything—a home, work, financial support—ensure it's provided. Consider it honoring Harrison's father."

Under the dim glow of the lamplight, Nathaniel's sharp features softened as he nodded. "I'll take care of it, Grandmother."

Harrison lingered outside the door, her lashes suddenly damp. She didn’t enter. Instead, she turned and retreated to her room.

Nathaniel worked late in his study, only returning to their bedroom when the night had deepened. Harrison was already asleep, curled into herself beneath the covers.

After his shower, Nathaniel noticed something on the nightstand—the million-dollar check he’d given to Vincent. Harrison had retrieved it.

Now, it lay there, returned to him.

A faint smile touched his lips as his gaze settled on Harrison’s sleeping face. The soft glow of the bedside lamp painted her in warm light, but her rest was uneasy. Her delicate brows knitted together, and a whisper escaped her lips. "Mom… Mom…"

Her long lashes trembled, and then tears spilled over, tracing silent paths down her porcelain cheeks.

Nathaniel stilled. Without thinking, he reached out, brushing away a tear with his thumb.

At his touch, Harrison—still lost in sleep—grabbed his hand. "Mom… don’t go…"

Nathaniel stiffened. Did she think he was her mother? "Harrison, I’m not—"

He tried to pull away, but Harrison nuzzled into his palm, her face pressing against his skin. "Please… don’t leave me…"

Exasperated, Nathaniel muttered, "I told you, I’m not your mother."

Then, Harrison’s body trembled. A sob broke free, raw and aching. "Mom…"

Something twisted in Nathaniel’s chest. Tears streaked her face, her sorrow so palpable it clawed at him.

His resistance crumbled. This was the first time he’d seen her cry. And he couldn’t stand it.

Instead of retreating to the couch, Nathaniel slid into bed beside her. His hand settled on her back, patting gently—awkward at first, then with growing certainty.

He wasn’t used to comforting anyone. But his voice softened anyway.

"Shh… it’s alright. I’m here." A pause. Then, reluctantly: "…Mommy’s here."
###Chapter 79

The moment the word "Mommy" slipped from his lips, Nathaniel was profoundly grateful no witnesses were present to hear it.

His pride as a man would never recover from such an incident. Never in his thirty-two years had he uttered anything so undignified!

Yet Harrison seemed to find comfort in those words. She nestled deeper into Nathaniel's embrace, her delicate fingers clutching his shirt as she drifted back into peaceful slumber.

Nathaniel observed her with quiet amusement. Such a clingy little thing. Her tear-stained lashes fluttered against flushed cheeks, the picture of vulnerability that inexplicably tugged at his heartstrings.

A rare smile curved his lips. "I'm not your mother, darling. Try calling me Daddy instead," he murmured into the darkness.

Harrison remained lost in dreams, offering no response.

With a sigh, Nathaniel adjusted his hold on her slender frame and surrendered to sleep.

Morning light painted golden streaks across the bedroom when Harrison stirred awake.

Something felt...different. The weight of a muscular arm draped possessively over her shoulder registered belatedly. She wasn't alone.

Turning slowly, she found herself nose-to-nose with Nathaniel's sleeping form. When had he joined her in bed? Memories of the previous night remained frustratingly elusive.

Taking advantage of his unconscious state, Harrison inhaled his distinctive scent - nothing like Vincent's nauseating odor. Nathaniel smelled of sandalwood and crisp linen, with an undercurrent of something distinctly masculine that made her pulse quicken.

Her gaze traced the sharp angles of his jawline. Before rational thought could intervene, her fingertips brushed against the faint stubble shadowing his chin.

The rough texture sent unexpected sparks dancing along her skin.

Nathaniel chose that moment to wake.

Harrison jerked her hand back as if burned, scrambling upright. "What are you doing in my bed?" she demanded, voice thick with sleep.

Nathaniel's drowsy smirk did nothing to calm her racing heart. "Don't you remember last night, sweetheart?"

"Remember what?" She frowned, recalling only an early bedtime after her evening routine.

"You practically dragged me into bed," Nathaniel drawled, propping himself up on one elbow. "Kept calling me Daddy too."

Harrison's eyes widened to saucers. "That's absurd!" She hurled a pillow at his smug face with all her strength.

Nathaniel dodged effortlessly, capturing her wrist in one smooth motion. He pulled her flush against his chest, his morning voice rough with amusement. "Say it again for me, darling. Call me Daddy."

Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks. She twisted in his grasp, only to yelp in pain when her hair snagged on his pajama button.

"Hold still," Nathaniel commanded as she flailed. The more she struggled, the tighter the golden strands wound around the offending fastener.

Harrison froze at the dangerous edge in his voice when he spoke her name. "Harrison."

His grip tightened.
###Chapter 80

He called her name sharply.

With a sudden jerk, Harrison finally freed her tangled hair from Nathaniel's grasp. The stubborn knot gave way with an audible snap.

She sat up abruptly, voice shaking. "What is it?"

Nathaniel's dark eyes studied her, his expression unreadable. "Was that intentional?"

Only then did Harrison realize their compromising position. In her struggle to untangle herself, she'd somehow ended up straddling him.

Now he lay beneath her, his muscular frame pressed against her thighs.

Her mind blanked. Instinctively, she clenched her legs tighter around his waist.

Nathaniel's firm torso was trapped between her smooth, pale thighs - the contrast of her fair skin against his dark pajamas almost blinding.

The moment she moved, Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously. His muscles tensed visibly beneath the silk fabric as his hands gripped her slender waist. "Relax," he growled, voice rough.

Harrison's face burned crimson. Her dark hair tumbled wildly around her shoulders as her wide eyes darted nervously like a cornered rabbit. She didn't understand.

"What do you mean?"

Nathaniel swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Your legs. They're squeezing too tight."

Harrison couldn't form a coherent response.

She could feel the scorching heat radiating from his body. The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

Suddenly, a phone rang sharply - the sound slicing through the charged atmosphere.

Nathaniel's phone lit up on the nightstand. Harrison glimpsed "Isabella" flashing across the screen.

Still reclined, Nathaniel shielded his eyes with one hand, his gaze smoldering as he answered. "Isabella."

The call shattered the moment completely.

Harrison's blush vanished instantly. She scrambled off Nathaniel in a flustered hurry, nearly tripping in her haste.

Nathaniel threw back the covers and rose from bed as Isabella's cheerful voice carried through the phone. "Nathaniel, you're awake already?"

"Mm," he responded absently.

His piercing gaze followed Harrison's frantic retreat into the bathroom.

He'd been awake since her first movement, though he'd kept his eyes closed. He'd felt every hesitant touch of her fingers tracing his jawline. He knew exactly how badly she wanted to touch him - and how terrified she was to do so.

"Nathaniel! Are you even listening?" Isabella's sharp tone snapped him back to reality.

"What?" He shook his head slightly to clear it.

"I'm having friends over today. You should come!"

Isabella was inviting him to the Whitmore estate.

Nathaniel refused without hesitation. "Important meeting today. Office."

Isabella sighed dramatically. "Fine. Good luck with work then."

He ended the call and stared at his phone for a long moment before glancing down at his obvious predicament, his handsome features strained.

Every interaction with Harrison tested his control. He couldn't comprehend why his body reacted this way when he didn't even like her.

Nathaniel stalked into the adjoining bathroom and turned the shower to cold.

When he emerged, Dominic was already waiting. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel had regained his usual icy composure, every inch the powerful CEO. "Investigate Vincent Blackwood."

Dominic blinked. "Mrs. Falcon's adoptive father?"

Nathaniel nodded. "Vincent served ten years. Dig up the original case files. I want every detail."
###Chapter 81

Harrison emerged from the bathroom to find Nathaniel absent. That call from Isabella must have summoned him away. A wry smile touched her lips as she shook her head at the predictability.

Her phone vibrated - Victoria was calling.

She answered immediately. "Harrison, Isabella invited some friends over today. Why don't you join us?"

Was this genuine kindness from Victoria?

"Sure, I'll be right there," Harrison replied simply.

Gabrielle rushed over upon hearing the news. "Harrison, I don't trust Victoria's motives! Now that Vincent is out of prison, are you certain about visiting the Whitmore residence?"

Harrison remained composed. "I just need to verify something."

Unconvinced, Gabrielle insisted on accompanying her.

The Whitmore house buzzed with activity when they arrived. Isabella's guests had all assembled - Sebastian and several other wealthy heirs from their social circle.

Sebastian's face darkened when he spotted Harrison. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella smiled sweetly. "I invited Harrison."

Sebastian scowled. "Why would you do that? Nobody wants her here."

Unfazed, Harrison blinked playfully and smirked. "I don't waste time with amateurs either."

Sebastian froze, speechless.

Amateur? He was a champion!

The memory of his humiliating defeat at Harrison's hands resurfaced, and before he could think, Sebastian jumped up.

"Harrison, you dare challenge me again?"

He needed redemption.

Harrison arched an eyebrow dismissively. "Too busy for games."

Sebastian's face turned crimson. "You little-"

Gabrielle burst into laughter. The notorious Sebastian only feared Nathaniel. And now, Harrison had joined that exclusive club.

She knew someday Harrison would make this brat grovel.

Victoria reappeared. "Harrison, you're here! Let me introduce someone."

Vincent stepped forward.

Victoria smiled. "This is Harrison's adoptive father from the countryside."

Sebastian and the other heirs stared at Vincent in confusion. "Her father? Why's he missing an eye?"

Harrison's expression remained unreadable as she realized their true purpose in summoning Vincent.

Vincent shuffled toward Harrison. "Harrison, it's been-"

Before he could finish, Gabrielle stepped between them, her voice icy. "Stay away from her. Haven't you done enough damage?"

Vincent hesitated, then adopted a wounded expression. "Harrison, I raised you in the countryside. How can you pretend not to know me? Now that you're living in luxury, you've forgotten your roots?"

Isabella intervened with feigned concern. "Harrison, he's still your father. You should take responsibility for him."

Harrison's cold gaze never left Vincent. Beneath his pitiful act, she saw the malice in his eyes - a silent threat.

Vincent's expression shifted to exaggerated sorrow. "Harrison, I shouldn't have come. If you're happy, that's enough. I'll return to the countryside."
###Chapter 82

Nathaniel turned to leave.

"Wait!" Sebastian's sharp command froze him mid-step.

Nathaniel halted.

Sebastian's furious glare burned into Harrison. "Harrison, have you no humanity? He's your adoptive father, and you refuse to even recognize him?"

The elite socialites flanking Sebastian chimed in with sneering contempt.

"Harrison, your lowly origins were bad enough. Now you show your true colors - selfish, heartless, only caring about money!"

"How could Nathaniel marry trash like you? You're nothing but a disgrace to his name!"

The accusations rained down on Harrison.

Isabella stood beside Sebastian, her smug smile widening. Gabrielle opened her mouth to defend her friend, but Harrison's firm grip on her arm silenced her.

Victoria stepped forward, her voice dripping with false concern. "Harrison, you're being unreasonable. Vincent is your adoptive father. You should take responsibility for him."

Victoria and Isabella had banked on Harrison staying silent about Vincent's abuse. They knew most victims would rather bury their trauma than expose it.

This was Victoria's cruel design - she wanted Vincent to haunt Harrison forever, to keep her drowning in darkness.

Harrison's piercing gaze locked onto Victoria's face. "Did you arrange this?"

Victoria remained silent.

A cold smile curved Harrison's lips, but her eyes blazed with defiance. "So you knew everything."

Victoria had abandoned her in that village, never once checking on her.

Harrison had wondered if Victoria was ignorant of her suffering. Now she knew the truth - Victoria had known all along.

Victoria was fully aware of every horror Harrison had endured. Gabrielle trembled with rage as she stepped forward. "You knew! And you still brought this monster here to torment Harrison? What kind of mother are you? You're worse than an animal! Mark my words, karma will destroy you, you vile woman!"

Victoria's face darkened at Gabrielle's outburst.

Isabella smirked, her voice laced with mockery. "Harrison, are you really going to abandon your adoptive father like this?"

Sebastian and his privileged circle closed ranks around Isabella. "Harrison, you're despicable!"

Harrison's ice-cold eyes glittered with dangerous intensity. "Gabrielle, we're leaving."

Gabrielle shot them all a final scathing look before following Harrison out.

Isabella, thoroughly pleased with the outcome, turned to Sebastian. "Sebastian, what's wrong with Harrison? After everything her adoptive father did for her, she shows no gratitude."

Sebastian's face twisted in disgust. "Isabella, you're too kind. If Harrison had even a shred of your goodness, she might be tolerable. I'm telling Nathaniel and Alexander about this. They'll despise her too."

Isabella's lips curled in satisfaction. "You're wonderful, Sebastian."

Sebastian grinned. "I can't wait to toast your wedding with Nathaniel."

As Sebastian and his entourage departed, Isabella savored her victory. Mission accomplished.

Victoria noticed Vincent still staring hungrily in Harrison's direction, his expression lecherous.

She smiled. "Vincent, you seem quite taken with Harrison. If you want her, you'll need to be clever about it. You wouldn't want to fail again, would you? Not after she blinded you ten years ago."

Vincent sneered. "Don't worry. I know her dirty little secret. She won't dare defy me!"
###Chapter 83

Nathaniel departed, leaving Victoria to loop her arm through Isabella's.

"What do you think Harrison has on Nathaniel, Mother? What kind of hold does she have over him?"

Victoria's lips curved into a satisfied smile, eyes glinting. "Darling, that's not our concern. The only thing you need to know is that Harrison could never compete with you. She'll never be more than a temporary distraction for Nathaniel."

Isabella smirked. In her mind, a country bumpkin like Harrison wasn't fit to breathe the same air as Nathaniel. What right did she have to claim the title of Mrs. Falcon?

"You're absolutely brilliant, Mother."

Victoria's gaze sharpened. "Isabella, your father hasn't come home in days. Why don't you call him? He never refuses you."

Theodore truly doted on his daughter. When Isabella made requests, he always complied.

"Consider it done." Isabella pulled out her phone. "I'll have him home before dinner."

Victoria exhaled in relief. With Harrison out of the picture, her future looked brighter than ever.

At Falcon Enterprises, Nathaniel sat reviewing documents in his sleek office when Alexander dropped by unannounced.

Alexander lounged against the desk, swirling his coffee. "Need your advice on something."

Nathaniel didn't glance up from his files. "Must be serious if you're asking me."

"I need to know how to win Harrison over." Alexander leaned forward. "You lived with her for years. You know what she likes."

Nathaniel's pen froze mid-signature.

"Come on, you must know what would impress her. Flowers? Jewelry? What's her weakness?"

Setting down his pen, Nathaniel met Alexander's gaze. "As your friend, I have to be honest. You and Harrison aren't compatible."

"Why not?"

"She's... unrefined. No education, no career. Just a pretty face with too many flaws."

Alexander stared, dumbfounded.

Nathaniel frowned. "What?"

"That's the first time I've heard you trash-talk a woman in twenty years of friendship."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

When Alexander had dated that supermodel last year, Nathaniel had barely glanced her way. But Harrison? Suddenly he had opinions.

Alexander's eyes narrowed. "Wait... are you trying to keep her for yourself? Have you developed feelings for her?"

Nathaniel scoffed. "Don't be ridiculous."

He couldn't possibly have feelings for Harrison. The idea was absurd.

Alexander nodded slowly. "Right. You're practically engaged to Isabella. Of course you'll marry her."

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "Naturally."

He would marry Isabella.

Yet the thought of Alexander pursuing Harrison left a bitter taste in his mouth.

"So? What should I do? What does she like?" Alexander pressed.

Nathaniel hesitated. He'd never given Harrison gifts. Truthfully, he had no idea what she liked.
###Chapter 84

Nathaniel recalled when Isabella had first returned from abroad. She'd been eyeing a Chanel purse, and he'd instructed Dominic to purchase it for her. Dominic delivered the bag to Emerald Heights, where Harrison happened to spot it.

Harrison's face brightened instantly as she admired the purse, her eyes sparkling with delight.
"This is absolutely stunning," she murmured.

She clearly adored it.

Nathaniel remarked, "She has a weakness for Chanel."

Alexander smirked. "Purses? That's simple enough. Thanks for the intel."

Just then, Sebastian strode in. "Nathaniel! Alexander! Didn't expect to see you here."

Alexander shot him a glance. "Sebastian, weren't you supposed to be at the Whitmores'?"

"Yeah, I was. And guess what? I ran into Harrison and her foster father. Nathaniel, Alexander—you won't believe this. Harrison outright rejected him! Didn't even acknowledge him as family."

Sebastian recounted the entire incident at the Whitmore residence.

"Alexander, how can you still defend Harrison? She's not worth your time. Now that you've seen her true colors—shallow, materialistic, heartless—there's no excuse!"

His frustration was palpable.

Alexander frowned. He turned to Nathaniel. "What's really going on between Harrison and her foster father?"

"Not entirely sure," Nathaniel replied.

Unconvinced, Alexander looked back at Sebastian. "Sometimes what you see isn't the full picture. I refuse to believe Harrison is that cruel. There must be more to it."

"You're unbelievable, Alexander! After all this, you're still taking her side?" Sebastian was livid. He'd expected Alexander to cut ties after hearing the truth. "Alexander, she's clouded your judgment. Nathaniel, talk some sense into him!"

Nathaniel's icy gaze was unreadable, his expression stoic as he remained silent.

Meanwhile, at the Falcon estate, Harrison stepped into the living room, where Eleanor sat waiting. "Harrison, you're back. Reginald, bring the soup."

The butler, Reginald, presented a steaming bowl. "Mrs. Falcon, Mrs. Eleanor had this prepared specially for you. Best while it's hot."

Harrison settled onto the sofa with a sweet smile. "Thank you, Grandma."

Eleanor beamed. "Harrison, did you sort things out with Vincent? I was thinking of inviting him for dinner tomorrow. Family shouldn't let these formalities slide."

Harrison's lashes fluttered slightly. "Grandma, don't trouble yourself. I'll handle it."

Eleanor tsked playfully. "Stubborn girl. He's still your foster father."

At that moment, a maid entered carrying a small package. "Mrs. Falcon, this arrived for you."

Harrison took it. "Who sent it?"

"Your foster father," the maid replied.

Vincent had sent her something.

Eleanor raised a brow. "Why didn't he come in? Open it, dear."

Harrison carefully unwrapped the package, revealing a single photograph inside.

It was a childhood picture—one Vincent had taken of her during a bath. He'd barged in unannounced, capturing the moment. Young Harrison had barely managed to cover herself with a towel, her shoulders, legs, and arms exposed. Her wet hair clung to her terrified face, her wide eyes filled with shock. The dim lighting and her vulnerable expression made it clear this image would appeal to twisted minds.

"Harrison, Vincent sent you a photo? Let me see," Eleanor said, reaching for it.
###Chapter 85

Eleanor didn't manage to see the photograph because Harrison swiftly returned it to the box. "Grandmother, this is just an old childhood picture. It's terribly embarrassing. I can't possibly show you."

Eleanor chuckled and withdrew her hand. "My dear, I'm certain you were never anything less than adorable."

Reginald nodded in agreement. "Absolutely."

Hearing their kind words, Harrison lowered her gaze and took a sip of the herbal soup.

The moment was interrupted by the maid's announcement. "Mr. Falcon."

Harrison looked up to see Nathaniel entering.

Eleanor beamed. "Nathaniel, you're home early!"

Nathaniel handed his coat to the maid before striding into the parlor.

Harrison frowned at her bowl. The soup had an unusual aftertaste. "Grandmother, did you add something special to this? It tastes... different."

Eleanor's eyes twinkled. "Clever girl! I had them include some fertility herbs."

Fertility?

Harrison's grip tightened around the bowl. No amount of herbs could help when she and Nathaniel hadn't even shared a bed.

"Grandmother!" she protested.

Eleanor clasped Harrison's hand earnestly. "Darling, it's time you and Nathaniel started a family. At my age, holding a great-grandchild is my greatest wish."

Harrison's heart sank at the hopeful look in Eleanor's eyes.

Nathaniel settled beside her, his arm protectively around her shoulders. "Grandmother, Harrison is still young. There's no need to rush."

Harrison glanced at Nathaniel's chiseled profile. Was he shifting the burden onto her?

"Actually, I do want children," Harrison declared.

Nathaniel stiffened in surprise. His gaze dropped to hers. Harrison fluttered her lashes mischievously. "But Nathaniel's been so exhausted from work lately. By bedtime, he's simply... incapable."

Incapable?

Nathaniel's face darkened instantly.

"Nathaniel! At your age?" Eleanor scrutinized him. "No wonder there's no progress. The problem lies with you, doesn't it?"

"It's not what you think, Grandmother—"

"Tomorrow I'll have the cook prepare special tonics," Eleanor declared. "We'll restore your vitality until you give this family an heir!" Nathaniel looked utterly defeated.

Harrison bit back a laugh, her lips curling triumphantly.

Nathaniel shot her a warning glare.

Back in her chambers, Harrison reopened the box and studied the photograph. It showed her younger self in a moment of heartbreaking vulnerability.

Her phone chimed with an incoming call.

She answered to hear Vincent's mocking laughter. "Enjoying my little gift, Harrison?"

Her expression turned icy. "What do you want?"

"Money, of course," Vincent sneered. "Mr. Falcon gave me a million before, but you took it back. Now, unless you pay up, this photo goes to Nathaniel. To Eleanor. To everyone. Imagine what they'll think of you then."

"How much?" Harrison kept her voice steady.

"One hundred million!"

Harrison's lips curved into a cold smile. "One hundred million? You've got nerve."
###Chapter 86

"Enough with the threats! You bring me 100 million tonight or your scandalous photos will be plastered across every tabloid in Willowbrook by morning. I'll be waiting!" Vincent Blackwood snarled before slamming the phone down.

Harrison's fingers turned white around her device. Just then, Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the tension. "Was that Vincent?"

She spun around to find him standing in the doorway.

His piercing gaze locked onto the box in her trembling hands. Towering over her, his broad frame blocked the fading sunlight. "Grandmother mentioned he sent you something. What exactly did he send?"

Her throat tightened. Should she confess everything about Vincent? How would Nathaniel react?

"It's just a..."

Her phone buzzed again. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

She answered to his excited voice. "Harrison! Get outside right now. I've got something special for you!"

She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Alexander, this really isn't a good time..."

"I'm parked outside Falcon Estate's gates. Either you come out or I'm coming in," he insisted.

"Don't you dare. I'll be right there," she snapped.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "That was Alexander?"

She nodded. "I need to step out briefly. We'll discuss the photo when I return."

Outside, Alexander's cherry-red Lamborghini gleamed in the driveway. He emerged holding an embossed gift bag, his cocky grin firmly in place.

"Harrison, this is for you." He thrust the bag toward her.

She crossed her arms. "Alexander, what is this?"

He produced a quilted Chanel purse from the bag. "Limited edition. Just released last week. Do you like it?"

Her eyes flickered over the designer item. "It's generous, but I don't want it."

Alexander blinked. "But Nathaniel said you loved handbags."

Her breath hitched. "He told you that?"

"Absolutely. When I asked him how to win you over today, he specifically mentioned your fondness for Chanel."

The memory struck her like a physical blow - Nathaniel's study, her birthday, that identical purse she'd mistaken as his gift. She'd gushed about its beauty before discovering it was meant for Isabella.

How ironic that Nathaniel remembered her admiration but not the crushing humiliation that followed.

Alexander continued obliviously. "If bags aren't your thing, just tell me what you prefer. Jewelry? Designer clothes? Private jets?"

Her chest constricted. Nathaniel was coaching Alexander on how to pursue her?

"Listen carefully," she said through clenched teeth. "I don't need your gifts or your attention. Stop wasting both our time."

She turned on her heel and marched back inside.

Nathaniel stood silhouetted against the twilight on their balcony. He turned slowly as she entered.

"So Alexander's gift didn't meet your standards?"
###Chapter 87

Nathaniel had witnessed everything from the balcony earlier. His sharp eyes followed as Alexander presented Harrison with that exclusive Chanel purse, only for her to reject it outright.

Harrison turned to face him, her crimson lips curling into a smirk. "Did you tell Alexander about my supposed love for handbags?"

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow, his chiseled features radiating confidence. "Don't you? I distinctly recall your collection."

A mischievous glint appeared in Harrison's eyes. "Bags are passé. I prefer more... substantial investments. Diamond necklaces, perhaps. Next time, advise Alexander accordingly."

For a fleeting moment, Nathaniel's expression darkened, the air between them growing thick with tension.

He cleared his throat, deliberately changing the subject. "What photograph did Vincent send you today?"

Harrison had intended to disclose the photo and Vincent's involvement, but something made her hesitate. "Just an old childhood picture he took," she replied smoothly.

"Did Vincent—"

Nathaniel began probing further, but Harrison cut him off sharply. "Mr. Falcon, if you're so free, perhaps you should focus on mastering the art of procreation."

The reference to her previous jibe about his "performance issues" visibly affected Nathaniel. His gaze turned glacial.

"My reproductive capabilities are none of your concern. Save your worries for someone who cares."

Without another word, he stormed out, leaving Harrison standing alone.

She stared at the empty doorway, her mind reeling. His ability to father children concerned only one person—Isabella.

Her face paled. After composing herself, she left the room determined to confront Vincent.

Harrison arrived at The Velvet Lounge, Vincent's current haunt where he indulged in nightly excesses.

Inside the opulent VIP section, Vincent lounged between two glamorous women. They recognized Harrison immediately. "Look who's back. Here to cause more trouble?"

Vincent's eyes lit up at the sight of Harrison's porcelain features. "Relax! This time she's bringing me money."

Harrison remained unfazed—she'd anticipated his greed.

Her icy glare made the women shrink back. "Leave. Now."

The women clung to Vincent. "We want to stay with Vincent."

But Vincent, suddenly bored, waved them away. "Scram. Business calls."

They departed reluctantly—Vincent was a generous patron. He turned to Harrison with a wolfish grin. "Where's my money?"

Harrison produced a check and handed it over.

Vincent's eyes bulged at the staggering sum. He'd never held such wealth in his life.

He was rich. Filthy rich!

"Harrison, you've outdone yourself. Who knew marrying Nathaniel would make you so generous?"

"Enough. The deal was money for the negative. Where is it?" Harrison demanded.

Vincent gestured lazily toward a box on the side table. "In there."

As Harrison reached for it, a vicious blow struck her neck. Pain exploded behind her eyes as she crumpled to the floor.

Vincent loomed over her, clutching the check with greedy triumph. "I'll take the money... and you. You're mine now."

His laughter echoed as darkness swallowed Harrison whole.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel sat in his study reviewing documents when Dominic rushed in. "Mr. Falcon, we've uncovered the truth about Vincent's prison sentence."
###Chapter 88

Nathaniel didn't look up from the documents. "Proceed."

"Ten years back, Vincent was convicted for child molestation, abuse, and attempted rape."

The pen in Nathaniel's hand froze mid-air, its tip digging into the paper. His head snapped up to meet Dominic's gaze, shock evident in his features. "And Harrison was the victim?"

Dominic gave a grim nod. "Correct, Mr. Falcon. Vincent is pure filth."

Nathaniel's chiseled features turned to stone, his expression sharpening into something dangerous. He'd suspected some dark history between Harrison and Vincent, but nothing this horrific.

A sudden ringtone shattered the tense silence. His phone.

Nathaniel answered to hear Gabrielle's panicked voice. "Mr. Falcon! Harrison's in danger!"

His grip tightened on the device. "What happened?"

"She took a check to meet that monster Vincent. I followed her to The Velvet Lounge, but when I got inside, she'd vanished. He took her!"

What the hell?

Nathaniel was on his feet instantly, storming out of the study. He threw open the bedroom door - empty.

Gone. While he'd been occupied, she'd slipped away to face Vincent alone.

"Why would she take a check to meet him?"

"Because Vincent has a photo of her," Gabrielle rushed to explain.

A photo? The one sent today?

Nathaniel's gaze landed on a box on the nightstand. He flipped it open to reveal a single photograph inside.

He picked it up. One glance was all it took before his fingers clenched around the image, crumpling it in his fist. His handsome face darkened with a terrifying rage.

That bastard! Why hadn't she told him? She could have come to him.

Then something caught his attention. The young girl in the photo... she looked familiar. He'd seen her before.

His ice-cold eyes widened with realization. This was the girl who'd saved him in that cave years ago!

But Isabella had always claimed that role.

Had he been wrong all this time? Was Harrison his actual savior?

Nathaniel's mind reeled. He'd been half-dead back then, barely conscious. Never got a clear look at her face. By morning, she was gone.

So was it Harrison who'd pulled him from death's door? Had she been his mystery girl?

"Mr. Falcon! Are you listening?" Gabrielle's voice yanked him back to the present.

Nathaniel blinked, refocusing. Gabrielle sounded desperate now.

"Sir, you need to send people after Harrison immediately. She's back in that animal's clutches. You have to find her and bring her home!"

Right. Finding Harrison was priority one.

Once he had her safe, he'd get answers. If she was indeed the girl from that night...

If he'd abandoned her to that monster, left her to suffer alone... He'd never forgive himself.

How terrified must she have been?

He'd promised to take her with him. Promised he wanted her by his side.

Nathaniel's eyes burned crimson with fury as he locked gazes with Dominic. His voice was razor-sharp. "Pull all security footage. Track Vincent's car. Lock down every exit from Willowbrook. I want him cornered - he's not escaping this time!"
###Chapter 89

Vincent raced down the highway in a white van, his eyes darting to the rearview mirror every few seconds. Harrison lay motionless in the backseat, her porcelain skin ghostly pale under the dim interior lights.

His gaze traveled over her unconscious form with predatory hunger. The thought of having her completely at his mercy sent a rush of adrenaline through his veins. But he forced himself to stay focused. He needed to put distance between them and Willowbrook - somewhere remote where no one would think to look. Once there, she'd have no chance of escape. Then he could take his time.

The anticipation made his palms sweat. Just as his fantasies grew darker, the car ahead slammed its brakes, forcing him to swerve violently.

"What the hell?" he growled, squinting through the windshield.

A sea of brake lights stretched before him. Drivers were leaning out their windows, voices rising in confusion.

"Roadblock ahead!" someone shouted. "They're searching every vehicle!"

Vincent's blood ran cold. His grip on the steering wheel turned white-knuckled as snippets of conversation reached him.

"Who has the authority to shut down an entire highway?"

"Are you joking? That's Nathaniel Falcon, CEO of Falcon Enterprises. This city answers to him. If he wants a road closed, it's closed."

"Mr. Falcon blocked the highway? Do you think he's searching for his runaway wife?"

"Don't be ridiculous. You've been reading too many romance novels."

Vincent's stomach dropped. Nathaniel was looking for Harrison.

Damn Victoria and her lies! She'd sworn Nathaniel didn't care about Harrison - that she was just a discarded wife. If that were true, why would the most powerful man in Willowbrook mobilize such resources?

Up ahead, uniformed officers moved systematically from car to car, drawing closer with each passing second.

Vincent couldn't wait to be caught. With a snarl, he threw open the van door, hauled Harrison's limp body into his arms, and disappeared into the dense forest lining the highway.

Harrison stirred as something cold and slimy touched her cheek. Her eyes flew open to find herself in a damp, shadowy cave, lying on a bed of musty straw.

Vincent loomed above her, his fingers tracing her jawline with revolting familiarity.

"Awake at last," he murmured, his voice thick with sickening satisfaction.

Pain throbbed at the base of Harrison's skull. His touch made her skin crawl, like insects skittering across her flesh. "Get your hands off me," she spat, her voice like ice.

Vincent only chuckled, his expression darkening with twisted amusement.

"Harrison, even as a child in that backwater village, you were breathtaking. I knew then that men would kill to possess you." His grip tightened painfully. "So why should I let anyone else have what's rightfully mine? You'll make the perfect wife."

Rage contorted his features as he continued.

"But you had to fight back. You took my eye and sent me to rot in prison for ten years!" He leaned closer, his breath hot against her face. "Look at you now. Still beneath me. No one's coming to save you, Harrison. You'll lie here and take what I give you. Just like you should have all those years ago."

Vincent's restraint shattered. He'd waited too long already, needing her awake to fully savor his revenge.

With a growl, he grabbed the collar of her blouse.

"Don't touch me!" Harrison screamed, thrashing wildly. Vincent's breathing grew ragged, his voice dripping with malice. "Who do you think will rescue you? Your precious husband Nathaniel?"

His lips curled into a vicious sneer as he remembered his narrow escape.

"Too late, princess. By the time he finds you, you'll be ruined. No man will want you after this - not even him!"
###Chapter 90

Vincent's fingers dug into Harrison's collar. The fabric tore with a sickening rip, exposing her porcelain skin to the cave's icy air.

Memories flooded Harrison's mind. That same damp cave years ago. Vincent's crushing weight. The stench of sweat and alcohol. The paralyzing terror that had stolen her voice.

She'd been a breath away from death that night.

Where was Nathaniel now?

Vincent's body pressed down again. Harrison squeezed her eyes shut. After all these years, her first instinct was still to call for Nathaniel.

Some wounds never healed. Some prayers never stopped.

Her fingers twitched toward her waistband...

A boot connected with Vincent's ribs before she could move. He flew across the cave, smashing into the stone wall. Blood sprayed from his lips.

Harrison's gaze snapped upward.

Nathaniel stood there, his tailored black coat swirling around him like dark wings. Ice clung to his lashes, his expression carved from winter itself.

He'd come.

Nathaniel's eyes locked onto Harrison's tear-streaked face. The way she looked at him - like he was some impossible miracle - made his chest tighten.

His coat settled over her trembling shoulders. "I'm here."

The warmth of his body heat seeped into her frozen skin.

Vincent writhed on the ground, blood bubbling at his lips. "Mr. Falcon! She tempted me! That little slut's been begging for it since-"

Nathaniel's kick silenced him. Ribs cracked under the force.

"You dare touch my wife?" Nathaniel's voice could have frozen hell.

Vincent whimpered. "Mercy, please-"

Nathaniel's polished shoe pressed down between Vincent's legs. "Let's remove the problem permanently."

The scream echoed off the cave walls. Blood spread in a dark pool.

Dominic arrived with a team of security. "Mr. Falcon."

"Dispose of him." Nathaniel didn't glance back.

He gathered Harrison into his arms, her face buried against his neck. Her fingers clutched his shirt like she'd never let go.
###Chapter 91

Harrison was carefully lifted into the back of Nathaniel's Bentley Continental, her slender form settled gently into the plush leather seat.

Nathaniel slid behind the wheel, his strong hands gripping the steering wheel effortlessly. The powerful engine roared to life as he pressed the accelerator, sending the luxury car gliding down the rain-slicked road.

Wrapped in his tailored coat, Harrison inhaled his crisp cedarwood scent mixed with the faintest hint of bergamot. His residual warmth seeped into her chilled skin, making her cheeks flush pink. An unfamiliar flutter stirred in her chest. She never expected him to come.

Five years ago, he hadn't.

But tonight, he appeared like a storm.

Harrison turned to study his sharp profile—the strong jawline, the slight furrow between his brows.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Nathaniel's fingers tightened on the wheel. His voice came out clipped. "Why didn't you tell me?"

Her breath hitched.

"I asked repeatedly. Why keep silent?" His tone turned glacial. "Do you realize what could've happened if I'd arrived thirty seconds later?"

Harrison felt his anger like physical heat. Tears pricked her eyes. "Why are you shouting at me?"

Nathaniel went silent, his stormy gaze scanning her tear-streaked face. The injustice in her expression made his chest constrict.

She could've avoided this. That bastard had been on top of her, her blouse torn—another minute and—

But seeing her now, so fragile with those shimmering eyes, his anger dissolved. She looked breakable, like porcelain.

He adjusted the climate control. "Still cold?"

She shook her head.

"Harrison." His voice deepened.

She met his gaze.

"When you were young, did you ever—"

Nathaniel needed to know if she was the girl from his past.

A deafening crack of thunder interrupted. Rain hammered the windshield like bullets.

The radio buzzed with a weather alert: "Category 4 tornado approaching Willowbrook. Seek immediate shelter."

They were two hours from home on an exposed highway. The storm had escalated into a monster.

Nathaniel swerved onto an exit ramp, pulling into a roadside inn's parking lot.

"We're staying tonight," he stated.

Harrison nodded.

The inn was modest but clean. The middle-aged clerk gaped at Nathaniel. "Checking in alone, handsome?"

Harrison almost laughed. Nathaniel commanded attention wherever he went—six-foot-three in a custom suit, radiating power.

"One suite," Nathaniel said flatly. "With my wife."

The clerk blinked as Harrison stepped from behind his broad frame. Her polite smile softened the woman's disappointment.

"Room 512." The clerk handed over the key. "Mini-bar items have additional charges—price list's on the nightstand."
###Chapter 92

Nathaniel gave a brief nod before guiding Harrison toward the room.

Harrison's brow creased slightly, curiosity dancing in her gaze. "What exactly did she mean by extra charges?"

He glanced at her innocent expression, those wide eyes brimming with questions. Without answering, he turned away.

They stepped into Room 503. The space was immaculate, but only one bed dominated the center.

Harrison's stomach twisted. How would they manage this sleeping arrangement tonight?

"Harrison."

Nathaniel's voice came from behind her.

This marked the second time he'd spoken her name.

She turned to face him. "Yes?"

Suddenly, she remembered their interrupted conversation. "Earlier in the car - you wanted to ask me something. What was it?"

"Did you-"

His phone chimed sharply, slicing through the moment.

Isabella's message flashed on screen, accompanied by a photo attachment.

Nathaniel opened the image to reveal Isabella's childhood picture.

As he studied it, realization struck - the young Isabella bore an uncanny resemblance to Harrison.

His body went rigid. Staring at the photo, he read Isabella's message: [Found this in old albums today. Remember how I looked back then, Big Brother?]

The truth hit him like a physical blow. Isabella had been the girl from his memories all along.

Not Harrison.

Harrison's childhood photo had merely triggered a mistaken association.

A bitter chuckle escaped him. How could he have ever confused the two?

No, Harrison wasn't the one.

"Mr. Falcon," Harrison's soft voice broke through his thoughts.

He met her gaze. "Never mind. I'm going to shower."

"Alright."

The bathroom door clicked shut behind him, water soon cascading against tiles.

Harrison stared at the closed door, puzzling over his aborted question. Since he'd chosen not to ask, she let it go.

Powering on her previously silenced phone, she winced at dozens of missed calls from Gabrielle.

Warmth flooded her chest as she quickly typed a response.

Gabrielle replied instantly: [Harrison! Do you know how worried I've been?]

[I'm fine. Just stranded at this inn with Nathaniel because of the storm.]

Harrison's gaze drifted to the bedside table items with their conspicuous price tags.

Her face burned crimson. Was that...a condom display?

Various types - ultra-thin, ribbed, flavored...

Good lord.

Now she understood the innkeeper's meaning. She'd asked so naively about the extra-charge items.

He'd known exactly what she meant but said nothing. Probably thought she was teasing him.

Shifting uncomfortably, Harrison noticed another item - black mesh fabric she didn't recognize.

Gabrielle responded immediately to the photo: [Harrison, you innocent thing! Those are fishnets!]

Fishnet stockings?

Gabrielle's next message arrived with a teasing emoji: [Does Nathaniel have a thing for fishnets?]

Harrison's mouth went dry. How should she know?

Ding!

Gabrielle's voice message arrived. Harrison hesitated before playing it.

"Harrison! You should totally wear those fishnets tonight and surprise Mr. Falcon!" Gabrielle's excited voice filled the room.

As the message played, Harrison suddenly noticed the bathroom door had opened silently. She looked up to find Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto hers.
###Chapter 93

Nathaniel emerged from the bathroom, having caught every word of that disastrous voice message.

Harrison stood frozen, her mind completely blank. She sprang up in panic. "Wait, I can explain-"

In her frantic state, her phone slipped from trembling fingers onto the bed.

Gabrielle's voice continued blaring: "Nathaniel must have killer abs under that shirt! And I've heard men with long fingers are incredible in bed. Harrison, you should totally sleep with him tonight!"

Harrison's attempted explanation died in her throat.

She wanted to jump out the window.

Holy hell. What had started as a serious conversation had spiraled into this inappropriate mess.

The air between them thickened with unbearable tension.

Harrison forced a laugh, glancing at the man by the bathroom door. "That was all Gabrielle talking, just so we're clear."

Better to sacrifice her best friend than face this humiliation alone.

Nathaniel stood there freshly showered, water droplets still glistening on his sculpted shoulders. His expression remained unreadable as he simply said, "Go shower."

"Right."

Harrison practically sprinted into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.

Three seconds later, Nathaniel heard her muffled scream of frustration through the door. His lips quirked in amusement as he leaned against the doorframe.

Harrison took an eternity in the shower, scrubbing away her embarrassment.

When she finally emerged, Nathaniel was already in bed, his muscular frame propped against the headboard as he scrolled through his phone.

One bed. No sofa. The hardwood floor looked painfully uninviting.

Nathaniel glanced up. "Stop hovering. Get in."

They were sharing the bed tonight.

It wasn't their first time, so Harrison swallowed her nerves and slid under the covers, squeezing her eyes shut.

Soon she heard Nathaniel set his phone aside and settle beside her.

Outside, thunder rumbled while lightning flashed, but the warm bedside lamp created a cozy cocoon.

Harrison's tense muscles gradually relaxed as sleep crept in - until the unmistakable sound of creaking bedsprings from next door shattered the peace.

The guesthouse walls might as well have been paper. The rhythmic squeaking grew louder, accompanied by breathy feminine moans - pleasure barely restrained.

It took Harrison's inexperienced brain a full ten seconds to process what she was hearing.

Her flawless complexion burned crimson from neck to hairline.

Of all nights. Trapped in bed with Nathaniel while strangers put on an X-rated performance.

She peeked at Nathaniel. He lay perfectly still, eyes open but giving nothing away.

Face still flaming, Harrison mumbled, "The walls are... thin."

Nathaniel turned his head, taking in her blush with visible amusement. "I thought you'd ask what they're doing."

Harrison went rigid.

Of course he'd think she was being suggestive.

Just like when she'd asked about the extra charges earlier. She yanked the covers over her head, wishing the earth would swallow her whole.

Nathaniel's smirk deepened. Her adorable embarrassment was clearly the night's best entertainment.
###Chapter 94

The racket from the adjacent room grew increasingly boisterous. How could anyone rest with such commotion?

Nathaniel's knuckles rapped sharply against the wall twice. The sharp sound reverberated through the quiet space.

Instant silence fell next door.

He closed his eyes again.

Sleep remained elusive. The restless energy of his youthful body thrummed beneath his skin in this charged atmosphere. Harrison lay mere inches away, her delicate floral scent teasing his senses. His mind flashed to that heated moment at Rosewood Manor when he'd pinned her against the wall, forcibly capturing her wrist...

Then the noise resumed with renewed vigor.

Nathaniel's eyes snapped open in irritation. He threw off the covers and swung his legs over the bed's edge.

As he stood, slender fingers caught his shirt sleeve.

He turned to find Harrison peeking from beneath the blankets. Her freshly awakened face glowed with a rosy hue, her wide doe eyes sparkling with such innocence it made his throat tighten.

"Where are you going?" Her grip tightened with concern.

She recognized his simmering anger, his posture telegraphing impending violence. His brutal takedown of Vincent in the cave had been her first glimpse of his temper. Who knew such refined nobility could fight with such savage efficiency? The memory unsettled her.

Had his mood been dark all day because she'd wasted his time?

She recalled his timely rescue earlier. Of course he'd intervene - she remained his legal wife, if only on paper. Beneath his cold exterior, Nathaniel had principles.

His expression softened momentarily at her worried gaze, then he abruptly pulled his sleeve free. "Go back to sleep."

He strode out before she could protest.

Nathaniel delivered three firm knocks on the neighboring door. A male voice called, "Coming!"

The door swung open to reveal the source of the disturbance.

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "It's past midnight. Either control your activities or find another hotel."

The young man immediately attempted camaraderie, offering a cigarette. "My apologies, friend. Newlyweds, you understand?"

Nathaniel ignored the proffered smoke.

The stranger's gaze turned curious. "Traveling alone?"

Just then, a melodic voice interrupted. "Nathaniel."

Both men turned to see Harrison's exquisite face peering through their partially open door. Her luminous eyes locked onto Nathaniel, silently pleading.

The stranger's breath caught. An absolute vision.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "I told you to stay inside!"

Harrison immediately retreated, the door clicking shut.

The young man whistled appreciatively. "With a beauty like that waiting, why are you bothering with us?" His smirk turned suggestive. "Unless... you're having performance issues?"

Nathaniel froze.

Before he could react, Harrison's voice floated through the door again. "Nathaniel, please come back."
###Chapter 95

Harrison kept calling his name.

That honeyed voice immediately drew Nathaniel's attention again, making him turn back instinctively. It was the kind of voice that demanded attention, impossible to ignore.

Nathaniel could only glare before retreating to his side of the room.

Harrison had already slipped back under the covers. Nathaniel shot him an irritated look. "What's with all the calling? Trying to summon demons?"

Harrison was speechless. He was only trying to help!

"I need another cold shower," Nathaniel muttered, striding toward the bathroom.

Minutes later, he emerged, skin still damp as he climbed back into bed.

Silence stretched between them, thick with tension. From the adjacent room, muffled laughter and intimate whispers drifted through the walls - the couple next door clearly hadn't finished their evening.

Nathaniel was about to get up for yet another cold shower when movement beside him stopped him. Harrison, who had been clinging to the far edge of the bed, had shifted closer. His slender frame now pressed against Nathaniel's side.

The air between them warmed instantly with Harrison's subtle citrus scent.

Nathaniel froze. They were both grown men, fully aware of what this proximity meant, especially with the charged atmosphere. Harrison was clearly making a move, the invitation unmistakable.

He looked down, voice dropping to a husky murmur. "What are you doing?"

Harrison lifted those liquid brown eyes, gaze playful beneath long lashes. "What does it look like?"

Nathaniel's throat worked as he swallowed hard. Before he could respond, his phone buzzed with Isabella's call.

He answered immediately. "Isabella?"

Her teasing voice filled the space between them. "Nathaniel, why are you ignoring my texts?"

She'd sent childhood photos earlier that he'd forgotten to reply to.

"I've been-" His words cut off as Harrison smoothly climbed into his lap, lips brushing against his throat.

Every muscle in Nathaniel's body locked at the unexpected contact. Heat flooded his veins, darkening his gaze.

He placed a firm hand on Harrison's shoulder, pushing him back slightly in warning.

This was deliberate. Harrison knew exactly when to kiss him - right when he was on the phone with Isabella. A test of his control.

Those soft lips lingered on his neck, teasing along the sharp line of his throat that mirrored his chiseled jaw. Intoxicating.

The room fell eerily silent except for Isabella's voice. "Nathaniel? Are you even listening? What are you doing right now? Are you alone?"

Harrison, clearly not finished, nipped lightly at his throat.

Nathaniel couldn't possibly continue this conversation. He ended the call abruptly and hauled Harrison off by the shoulders, voice strained. "No biting."

Harrison had already left one mark on his throat before - a small but noticeable impression that had taken days to fade. He'd been forced to keep his shirts buttoned to the top for meetings.

And now Harrison was doing it again.

Harrison loved marking him, especially because of Nathaniel's usual icy control. Testing boundaries was his favorite game.

Tilting his head back, Harrison found Nathaniel's jaw, pressing soft kisses along the strong line.

Nathaniel's grip on his shoulders tightened instinctively. Part of him wanted to push Harrison away. The other part wanted to pull him closer.

His dark eyes fluttered shut briefly as he wrestled for control. But he couldn't bring himself to reject Harrison, allowing those lips to trail over his skin with increasing boldness.

Then his phone buzzed again. Isabella calling back.

Nathaniel reached for it, but Harrison's lips found his first - soft yet insistent, stealing his breath away.
###Chapter 96

Her lips met his in a sudden, electrifying kiss.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened to a dangerous crimson as he pushed her away abruptly. "Harrison!"

Harrison gazed up at him through her lashes, her expression deceptively innocent yet laced with playful defiance. "Aren't you going to answer Isabella's call?"

His jaw tightened before he crushed his mouth against hers again.

The persistent vibration of his phone filled the room - Isabella calling repeatedly. A thrill shot through Harrison, the forbidden nature of their embrace making her pulse race. Though legally married, this felt like stolen moments behind Isabella's back.

Nathaniel kissed her with punishing intensity, nipping at her swollen lips before claiming her breath in a storm of passion.

This little temptress - she knew exactly how to provoke him.

Theodore had been right - Harrison possessed an innate ability to seduce. Even as a girl, she'd attracted the worst kind of attention.

Her fingers slipped beneath his collar, tracing heated patterns across his skin.

Nathaniel broke away with a sharp inhale. "Harrison, are you serious?" His voice was rough with restraint.

Her cheeks burned with the flush of desire. "Don't you want this?"

That night at Rosewood Manor, he'd pinned her against the wall...

Neither had spoken of it since, yet neither could forget.

"Why?" Nathaniel's question came out hoarse.

Harrison held his gaze steadily. "Repayment for saving me today. After this, we're even." She needed to settle this debt between them.

His eyes burned with barely leashed hunger.

"Don't worry," she added, tracing his jawline. "This stays between us. Isabella won't hear a word."

At her words, something dangerous flickered in Nathaniel's darkened gaze.

Harrison pressed another featherlight kiss to his lips, mischief dancing in her eyes. "Nathaniel, I'm quite skilled at this... mmm!"

She meant every word. Years of medical training had taught her exactly how to please a man's body.

But her confession ignited something primal in Nathaniel. He claimed her mouth with unrestrained ferocity, losing himself completely in their passion.

When they finally came up for air, Nathaniel cradled Harrison against his chest, their bodies still thrumming with shared heat.

After a comfortable silence, Harrison stirred. "I need the bathroom."

"Let me carry you." His voice remained gravelly with spent desire.

"No, I'm fine."

As she tried to move away, Nathaniel reached for her, causing her to bump her forehead against the headboard in her haste to evade him.

"Ouch!" Harrison winced.

Nathaniel's large hand immediately cradled her head, his touch unexpectedly gentle. "Did I hurt you?"

She looked up to find his eyes still dark with passion, but now softened with concern.

So this was Nathaniel after intimacy - attentive and protective.

"I'm fine," Harrison murmured, melting into his embrace.

A sudden knock came from the adjoining wall - their neighbor again. Harrison froze.

Nathaniel smirked. The young man had doubted his stamina earlier. Now he'd been thoroughly proven wrong.

Pulling the blanket over them, Nathaniel took Harrison's hand. "Tired?"
###Chapter 97

Harrison's eyes sparkled beneath the blanket's dim glow before she suddenly burst into laughter.

Nathaniel's voice came out rough. "What's so amusing?"

She met his gaze with a teasing smirk. "Should I say I'm exhausted... or not exhausted at all?"

The charged atmosphere between them crackled with unspoken desire.

Nathaniel chuckled darkly, his lips curving into a predatory grin as he leaned down to claim her mouth again.

The following morning at the Whitmore estate...

Victoria lay curled against Theodore in their bedroom, her arms draped around his neck as she playfully scolded, "You were absolutely savage earlier. You hurt me."

Theodore's thumb traced her jawline possessively. "But were you satisfied, darling?"

"Stop that..."

After Isabella's call had summoned him home, Theodore had made sure to thoroughly attend to Victoria's prolonged loneliness.

As they lay entwined, he murmured, "Did Vincent really take Harrison away?"

"Yes," Victoria purred. "That irritating obstacle is finally removed. Soon Isabella will be Mrs. Falcon, and you'll be father-in-law to Willowbrook's wealthiest man."

Theodore's booming laughter filled the room. "Brilliant work, my love."

Victoria basked in her triumph. With dawn breaking, Harrison was undoubtedly Vincent's plaything now. Nothing would disrupt her happiness ever again.

Watching Theodore's delighted expression, Victoria smirked inwardly. He'd never discover Harrison's true parentage.

When they entered the living room, they found Isabella fidgeting with her phone, anxiety written across her features.

"Isabella, what's troubling you?" Theodore inquired.

"Father, Nathaniel isn't answering my calls. He's never ignored me like this before." Isabella's sharp intuition screamed that something was wrong.

Victoria waved dismissively. "Mr. Falcon is an important man, darling. You mustn't cling so desperately. Vincent has taken Harrison away - why are you still worrying?"

At the reminder, Isabella's mood instantly brightened. She linked arms with Victoria, gushing, "Harrison's finally gone! You're amazing, Mother."

Turning to Theodore, she demanded, "Father, fire that secretary immediately. From now on, you'll only be good to Mother."

Theodore sat beside his beaming daughter, eyes full of adoration. "Anything you wish, princess." Isabella's satisfied smile radiated spoiled privilege.

Suddenly, the butler rushed in. "Madam Whitmore, you have a visitor."

Victoria arched an eyebrow. "Who is it?"

"Madam Whitmore, help!"

Vincent's agonized voice preceded his stumbling entrance. Pale and battered, he collapsed onto the Persian rug.

The trio jumped to their feet, staring in shock at Vincent's broken form. What had happened?

"Vincent! Didn't you leave with Harrison last night?" Victoria demanded.

Theodore's voice turned sharp. "Explain yourself."

Vincent gasped for breath. "Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore... I took Harrison... but Mr. Falcon locked down all of Willowbrook... He took her from me!"

What?

Nathaniel?

Isabella's face drained of color. "You're saying Nathaniel rescued Harrison?"

Their meticulously crafted plan had been perfect - until Nathaniel intervened.

Nathaniel had saved Harrison!

Their earlier elation evaporated instantly. Isabella suddenly understood why Nathaniel hadn't answered her calls last night - he'd been with Harrison the entire time.
###Chapter 98

"Mrs. Whitmore, you must help me! Nathaniel locked me up—I barely escaped, but if he finds me, I'm done for!" Vincent's voice shook with terror, the memories of his past still tormenting him. He clutched Victoria's arm desperately.

Victoria would never refuse. Vincent was her golden ticket, the perfect leverage against Harrison. She couldn't let this opportunity slip through her fingers.

"Mother, what's our next move?" Isabella whispered, her brow furrowed with worry.

Theodore's expression darkened. Just when Victoria had finally pleased him, another problem arose.

"Victoria, explain yourself," he demanded, irritation lacing his tone.

She turned to him, placing a soothing hand on his arm. "Darling, don't fret. This isn't the end."

Isabella's eyes lit up. "You have a plan?"

"Call Sebastian. He'd do anything for you, wouldn't he? Now's the time to cash in that favor."

Sebastian genuinely adored Isabella, treating her like royalty.

She nodded eagerly. "I'll contact him immediately."

Within half an hour, Sebastian arrived at the Whitmore estate. "Isabella, what's so urgent?"

She grabbed his hand. "Sebastian, there's someone you need to meet."

Vincent immediately dropped to his knees before Sebastian. "Mr. Gondale, please! Save me!"

Sebastian frowned. "Aren't you Harrison's adoptive father? What's happened?"

Tears streamed down Vincent's face. "Harrison despises me because I'm from the countryside. She denies our relationship—calls me a stain on her perfect life. She even sent thugs to beat me! Look at these wounds—all her doing! She wants me dead!"

Victoria sighed dramatically. "I never imagined Harrison could be so cruel."

Sebastian's face twisted in rage. "That ungrateful wretch! How dare she treat her own father this way!"

"Should we let her get away with this?" Isabella's voice turned icy.

"What do you propose?"

A calculated smile played on Isabella's lips. "Let's hold a press conference. Invite every major outlet in Willowbrook. We'll expose Harrison's true nature to the world."

Sebastian nodded instantly. "Consider it done. It's time Alexander and Nathaniel see her for the monster she is."

Victoria and Isabella exchanged triumphant glances.

They knew Harrison would never admit what Vincent had done to her—doing so would ruin her forever. Once that secret was out, she'd be finished.

With this leverage, they could control Harrison through Vincent, keeping her trapped in their web forever.

This press conference would be their grand performance—a chance to watch Harrison crumble under pressure.

Victoria squeezed Isabella's hand. "Sebastian is wrapped around your finger. Make sure you use that advantage."

Isabella smirked. "Don't worry, Mother. Sebastian loathes Harrison. He's the perfect weapon."

She knew exactly how to manipulate Sebastian's feelings for her.

Meanwhile, at Falcon Enterprises...

Nathaniel had just returned with Harrison for an important business meeting when Dominic burst into the office, panic-stricken.

"Mr. Falcon, we have a problem—Vincent has escaped!"
###Chapter 99

Nathaniel's perfect features twisted into a frown as he looked up from the documents. His piercing gaze locked onto Dominic. "Where is he?"

"Vincent fled to the Whitmore estate," Dominic answered quickly. "Mr. Blackwood has already gathered thirty-six media outlets from Willowbrook for a press conference. They intend to accuse Mrs. Falcon of mistreating and abandoning her adoptive father."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his irritation palpable. What was Sebastian thinking? "Explain this incompetence. You had Vincent detained, yet he escaped?" Seeing his boss's anger, Dominic broke into a cold sweat. "Mr. Falcon, it's—"

"It was my decision," Harrison interjected clearly.

Nathaniel turned sharply toward her. "Yours?"

Harrison nodded. "Yes, I instructed Dominic to let Vincent go intentionally."

Nathaniel's dark eyes deepened with intensity. "Why would you do that? They're preparing to publicly crucify you! That parasite wants to cling to you forever. I'll have my men retrieve Vincent from the Whitmore estate immediately. The press conference will be canceled. This entire mess will disappear as if it never happened. No one will ever know what you wish to keep private."

Harrison understood the extent of Nathaniel's power. He could erase this scandal with a single command.

She had once feared his reaction if he discovered her past with Vincent. Yet now, he showed no judgment—only protection.

He was shielding her from painful wounds too deep to expose, sparing her from society's cruel whispers, guarding her from further harm.

Harrison interrupted him. "Mr. Falcon, your intervention isn't necessary. I'll handle this myself."

Handle it alone? How?

Nathaniel's skepticism showed. "Harrison, what exactly—"

"Mr. Falcon," Harrison cut in with a playful smirk, her eyes twinkling as she winked at him. "You've already saved me once. I'd hate to accumulate more debts."

The air shifted instantly. Harrison remembered exactly how she'd repaid him last night.

Nathaniel's thoughts clearly mirrored hers. He abruptly returned his attention to the documents, his voice icy. "Do as you please."

Harrison observed how he'd reverted to his usual detached demeanor since leaving that hotel. Last night remained their shared secret.

Suddenly, a familiar voice filled the room. "Nathaniel, what's this about a press conference? Why is everyone saying Harrison..."

Alexander had arrived.

The moment Alexander spotted Harrison, his face lit up. "Harrison! What are you doing here?" Harrison smiled and settled onto the sofa. "Alexander, what exactly are people saying about me?"

Alexander sat beside her. "They're calling you a gold-digger who abandoned and abused her adoptive father. Claiming you rejected him because he's from a rural village."

"Alexander, do you believe that?"

Alexander chuckled, shaking his head. "If you were truly materialistic, you'd have accepted my advances by now." He was, after all, extremely wealthy.

Harrison didn't know how to respond.

Nathaniel, seated at his desk, glowered. Were they seriously flirting right in front of him?

"Harrison, where were you last night?" Alexander asked suddenly.

Last night...

Harrison's pulse quickened. "Why do you ask?"

"I called repeatedly but couldn't reach you. Nathaniel's phone was also unavailable." Alexander's suspicious gaze darted between them. "Were you two together last night?"
###Chapter 100

"Absolutely not!" Harrison's denial came swift and sharp. "I wasn't with Nathaniel last night!"

As she spoke, Nathaniel fought back a smirk. She was so terrified Alexander might discover their secret encounter that she'd fabricated this entire story.

What a cunning little fox.

Alexander shot Nathaniel a questioning look. "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Nathaniel's chiseled features remained impassive, his icy gaze unreadable. "She's already said everything, hasn't she?"

He chose to play along with her deception.

Feeling the tension thicken, Harrison made a hasty retreat. "Mr. Falcon, Alexander, I'll let you two talk. I need to step out."

She vanished from the office, leaving the men in charged silence.

Alexander exhaled in frustration, moving closer to Nathaniel. "You need to work on your social awareness."

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow in silent inquiry.

Alexander rolled his eyes dramatically. "When Harrison and I are together, you should make yourself scarce. Give us some privacy. Understand?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. This was his damn office. Why should he leave?

His voice dripped with irritation. "Then you should be the one to go."

Alexander blinked in disbelief. "What's with the attitude? I'm your best friend! And you're kicking me out when I'm trying to romance a girl? You're supposed to help me! Besides, you were the one who pushed me toward Harrison in the first place."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, his patience wearing thin.

Harrison remained his wife, and he wasn't about to be made a fool of.

His lips pressed into a thin line. "You're the love expert. Is there really a woman you can't conquer?"

Alexander chuckled. "Harrison's different. She's too innocent. I don't want to scare her off."

Nathaniel froze. Innocent?

Her angelic face might suggest purity, but Nathaniel knew better. This was the same woman who'd kissed him passionately last night, who'd pressed her body against his, whose exploring hands had slipped beneath his shirt.

Memories flooded back—the electric sensations coursing through him, the explosive pleasure that had left him breathless. Just the recollection made his pulse quicken and his thoughts scatter.

Harrison was anything but innocent in matters of intimacy.

She knew exactly what she was doing.

That angelic face hid bedroom skills that could bring any man to his knees. The contrast between her sweet exterior and her commanding presence in private? Irresistible.

Nathaniel remained silent, lost in thought.

Dominic entered abruptly, his voice hushed. "Mr. Falcon, Mrs. Falcon has left for the press conference."

What? She'd gone alone?

Nathaniel's lips curled into a dangerous smile. She'd promised to handle the situation, but instead of stopping the event, she'd marched straight into the lion's den.

What game was she playing now?

Was she about to drop another bombshell?

Nathaniel surged to his feet. "Get the car ready. We're going to the press conference."

He needed to see this unfolding disaster with his own eyes.

Alexander followed closely. "Nathaniel, I'm coming with you."

The press conference was a media circus. Thirty-six of Willowbrook's most prominent news outlets filled the room, cameras flashing nonstop as reporters jostled for position.

Vincent Blackwood stood before the sea of journalists, his practiced humility on full display. His voice trembled with manufactured emotion. "Though Harrison is my adopted daughter, I've always treated her as my own flesh and blood..."
###Chapter 101

"I gave up everything to send her to school. Sold all my possessions to get her to the city. And now? She won't even look at me. Says I embarrass her. Told me to go back to where I came from..."

Vincent Blackwood's sobs were so convincing, he nearly believed his own lies. The performance deserved a standing ovation.

Camera shutters clicked rapidly. Reporters salivated over the scandal—a foster father abandoned by his ungrateful daughter was front-page gold. Each journalist prayed to break the story first. Sympathy for Vincent swelled. The crowd turned on Harrison.

"Some people are just born wicked," one reporter muttered.

Sebastian handed Vincent a tissue, voice dripping with righteous fury. "This press conference exists to expose Harrison's true nature. Too many still believe her lies. She can't discard her foster father like trash—she must face consequences!"

Vincent wiped his face, a smirk hidden beneath the tissue. Even with Nathaniel's protection, Harrison wouldn't escape this. Victoria and Isabella exchanged smug glances.

Theodore hadn't bothered attending. This spectacle would ruin Harrison without his presence. He was busy wining and dining executives at The Grand Celeste. All that remained was waiting for Victoria's triumphant call.

Victoria manufactured a pained expression. "I must apologize. Harrison is my daughter. My failure as a mother created this monster."

Isabella rushed to her defense. "Mother, this isn't your fault!"

The reporters rallied instantly. "Mrs. Whitmore, you're an exemplary parent. Look how perfectly you raised Isabella!"

"Some souls are just rotten to the core. No upbringing could fix that."

Victoria's hidden smile widened. Harrison's destruction was cementing her own saintly image.

Sebastian seized the moment. "The conference has begun, yet Harrison remains absent. Guilt keeps her away!"

A cool voice sliced through the murmurs. "Mr. Gondale, were you mentioning me?"

All heads turned.

Harrison stood framed in the doorway, radiant and composed. She'd arrived.

Alone.

She strode forward with lethal grace. Reporters parted like the Red Sea. She stopped inches from Sebastian.

His face purpled. "Harrison! How dare you show your face here!"

She tilted her head, a razor-edged smile playing on her lips. "Mr. Gondale, make up your mind. Do you want me here or not?"

"You wretched—" Sebastian choked on his rage. Harrison always knew how to gut him with words.

Victoria's eyes gleamed. Harrison's appearance was perfect. A subtle nod to Vincent.

He lunged, grasping for Harrison's arm. "Harrison—"

She recoiled as if burned. "Don't touch me with those filthy hands. I'll vomit."

Vincent froze.

Victoria pounced. "Harrison! How can you be so cruel to the man who raised you?"

Isabella chimed in. "Apologize immediately! Take him home where he belongs!"

Sebastian roared, "You're despicable!"

The reporters became a snarling pack. "We see your true colors now, Harrison! This ends today!"

Nathaniel and Alexander entered just as the mob closed in. Harrison stood encircled by wolves.
###Chapter 102

The press conference erupted in chaos. Every accusing finger pointed at Harrison.

Nathaniel's icy stare pinned her in place. She deserved every bit of this reckoning, he thought.

Had she lost her mind coming here alone? This was a battlefield, not some tea party.

"Bloody hell!" Alexander cursed under his breath, moving to shield Harrison.

But someone was faster. Nathaniel had already positioned himself front and center, his commanding presence cutting through the noise.

Alexander froze, confusion flashing across his features.

What the hell? Since when did Nathaniel act without calculating every move?

The room's deafening uproar dissolved into stunned silence.

All eyes locked on Harrison as she lifted her gaze - calm as still waters yet radiating undeniable power. One sweeping look from her silenced the crowd like a switch had been flipped.

Nathaniel's breath caught. He'd never seen this side of his wife before.

Reporters exchanged bewildered glances. Where had this commanding aura come from? Yet none could deny its effect - Harrison's energy made them all hesitate, their accusations dying on their lips.

Harrison's piercing gaze found Vincent Blackwood. "Did you really think I'd come unprepared?"

Vincent blinked. "What are you talking about?"

Gabrielle's voice rang out before he could continue. "That's him! Vincent Blackwood, right there!"

Uniformed officers marched in, making straight for Vincent. The metallic click of handcuffs echoed as they snapped around his wrists.

"Vincent Blackwood, you're under arrest for extortion, kidnapping, attempted rape, and multiple other charges."

Chaos erupted anew. The narrative had flipped in an instant.

The supposed victim was actually the predator?

Sebastian looked like he'd been struck. "Officers, there must be some mistake! This man's just a simple farmer. How could he possibly—"

"He tried to rape me." Harrison's voice cut through the noise like a blade.

Gasps filled the room. All heads swiveled toward Harrison in shock - especially Vincent, Victoria, and Isabella, who looked utterly shattered.

Gabrielle rushed to Harrison's side. No way would she let her best friend face this alone.

Harrison produced the damning photo - the one Vincent had used to blackmail her. She held it high for all to see, her voice steady and strong.

"Yes, Vincent was my foster father. He's also a convicted child predator. Ten years ago, he was sentenced for molesting minors."

The room went deathly quiet as the horrifying truth sank in.

Harrison continued, unwavering. "After his release, he came for me again. First extorting 100 million, then drugging and kidnapping me from a nightclub. Later, he attempted to rape me in a cave."

She tapped a small device clipped to her collar, locking eyes with Vincent. "I've been recording everything. Every sick word, every threat - it's all here."

Vincent paled. She'd been wired this whole time? That scheming little—

Harrison stepped closer, though her burning gaze found Victoria. "I knew the moment you were released. You thought you'd trapped me? I've been waiting for you. Ten years wasn't enough. This time, I'll personally ensure you never see daylight again."
###Chapter 103

Nathaniel's breath caught in his throat as realization struck him like a lightning bolt. The pieces finally clicked into place.

Harrison had known the moment Vincent was released from prison. She'd been waiting, biding her time. Everyone assumed she'd never speak about the horrors of her childhood - what proper society woman would risk her reputation?

Yet she never broke her silence. Not to Eleanor. Not even to Nathaniel.

When Vincent demanded money, Harrison complied without protest. His attack and kidnapping seemed to confirm his control over her.

But that was the illusion she crafted.

The tiny surveillance device hidden on her person captured everything - the extortion demands, the attempted assault in the cave. All part of her meticulous plan.

She played the obedient victim, feeding his arrogance while secretly documenting his crimes. Step by step, she led him to his own destruction.

After ten years, she became both the bait and the executioner, sending him back to prison with enough evidence for a life sentence - or worse.

Victoria understood before anyone else. The day Roland brought Vincent to the Whitmore estate, Harrison had been watching from the shadows.

Victoria stared at her daughter, shock rendering her speechless. This wasn't the broken child who'd chased after her car, the terrified girl who'd cried for help, the lost soul wandering the woods.

Time had forged Harrison into something unbreakable. Her steady gaze held neither fear nor hesitation, only quiet, terrifying resolve.

Turning back to the cameras, Harrison's voice rang clear. "I refuse to feel shame for surviving. We punish ourselves enough for others' crimes. So if you've endured what I have - if you've suffered that particular childhood hell - remember this: Fear is their weapon. Stand anyway. No knight in shining armor is coming. Your rescue begins with you."

She'd saved that little girl herself.

Beside her, Gabrielle wept openly, clapping with unrestrained pride.

The reporters shifted uncomfortably, their earlier skepticism replaced with shame.

"Ms. Whitmore, our deepest apologies. We misjudged you completely."

"Harrison, as a father of daughters... your courage humbles me."

One by one, they offered gestures of respect, genuine admiration in their eyes.

From the back of the room, Nathaniel watched the scene unfold, unable to look away. He'd underestimated her - again. She'd orchestrated this entire reckoning alone, outmaneuvering everyone with flawless precision.

When she said she'd handle her own battles, she meant it.

Alexander stood frozen beside him. "You knew about this the whole time?"

Nathaniel's silence spoke volumes.

Alexander's face darkened. Why hadn't Nathaniel warned him? He'd lost his chance to play the hero.

Something fundamental had shifted between them, something Alexander couldn't name.

Across the room, Victoria and Isabella stood like statues, their faces bloodless, their hands trembling. This wasn't how the day was supposed to go. Not at all.
###Chapter 104

The press conference had spectacularly imploded in their faces.

Victoria's voice trembled as she reached for Harrison. "Darling, please forgive me. I didn't understand the situation earlier. Let me explain—"

Harrison cut her off with a piercing gaze. "Are you certain about that?"

A police officer stepped forward, his badge glinting under the harsh lights. "Victoria Whitmore, you knowingly harbored Vincent during his escape. We have reasonable grounds to consider you an accomplice. You'll need to come with us."

Strong hands clamped around Victoria's arms.

Her mind reeled. She remembered that night clearly—the way she'd hidden Vincent, given him money, helped him disappear.

Victoria's eyes widened in horrified realization. "You planned this?" she hissed at Harrison.

Harrison had orchestrated everything—Dominic's release of Vincent, knowing full well the predator would seek out the Whitmore family.

Innocent confusion painted Harrison's features as a slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "I'm afraid I don't follow. Mother, save your explanations for the authorities."

Victoria's mouth worked soundlessly. "You vicious little—"

Vincent's desperate wail cut through the room as officers dragged him away. "I can't go back to prison! Mrs. Whitmore! Help me, please!"

All eyes swiveled to Victoria as murmurs erupted through the crowd.

Her carefully cultivated image of maternal perfection was crumbling before everyone's eyes.

Victoria's face turned ashen. "Silence him! Someone shut him up!"

The reporters' whispers grew louder. "That monster Vincent was imprisoned for child molestation a decade ago. How could Mrs. Whitmore not know?"

"She knew and still associated with the man who hurt her own daughter... What kind of mother does that?"

"I heard Mrs. Whitmore's just a desperate old woman, chasing after Theodore first, then Isabella."

Victoria's face twisted in fury. She despised these labels—loathed them with every fiber of her being.

"Lies! All lies!"

Her protests were cut short as officers seized her arms, dragging her toward the exit. Isabella stood frozen, mind racing. This wasn't supposed to happen. What was she supposed to do now? Their carefully planned ambush had backfired spectacularly—instead of destroying Harrison, they'd annihilated their own reputations.

"Mother!"

Isabella's cry died in her throat as hundreds of eyes turned toward her. She immediately fell silent.

The most bewildered person in the room was Sebastian. His mind struggled to process the rapid developments.

Then he noticed a pair of sharp, intelligent eyes studying him—Harrison's.

Truthfully, Sebastian felt a twinge of guilt. He'd been unaware of what Harrison had endured.

At that moment, Harrison approached him, her tone deceptively light. "Mr. Willowbrook, are you hungry?"

Sebastian blinked. "What?"

Harrison's smile didn't reach her eyes. "If you're thirsty, perhaps try some walnuts. Excellent for brain function."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away.

Gabrielle muffled a laugh before following Harrison.

Sebastian's momentary guilt evaporated as anger surged through him. Walnuts for his brain? Did she truly think him that much of a fool?

"Harrison! Get back here and explain yourself!" he roared.

Isabella seized the moment to approach him. She couldn't afford to lose Sebastian now. "Sebastian," she whispered tearfully, "I had no idea Vincent was such a monster."

Sebastian's expression darkened with disgust. "Don't speak of that filth. He'll rot in prison where he belongs. Isabella, this isn't your fault—you're too kind, too trusting. He deceived us all."
###Chapter 105

Sebastian's presence beside her calmed Harrison's nerves slightly.

After the press conference concluded, Nathaniel retreated to his sleek Bentley. His voice was low and smooth as he addressed Dominic in the front seat. "Make sure the media team understands—no details about Isabella get leaked."

Dominic nodded. "Already handled, Mr. Falcon. Several reporters deleted all footage of Mrs. Falcon immediately. They won't be reporting on her."

A faint smirk curved Nathaniel's lips. "She knows how to work a crowd."

Dominic's tone held admiration. "Mrs. Falcon has remarkable courage."

Nathaniel's brow arched. Yes, she did.

He pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Uncle Alistair."

Nathaniel's uncle was the dean of Willowridge University, one of the nation's most prestigious institutions, and a man utterly devoted to medicine. His reputation commanded respect everywhere.

Alistair's voice crackled through the line. "Nathaniel! To what do I owe this rare call?"

"I need a favor."

"Color me intrigued. What could possibly make you reach out personally?"

"I'm sending a woman to your university."

"A woman? Who?"

"Her name is Harrison. Enroll her in the medical program."

"Harrison? Isn't that your wife?" Alistair chuckled. "Well, since you're asking personally, tell her to come to Willowridge tomorrow. I'll meet her myself and assess her."

Nathaniel ended the call. Dominic, clearly surprised, turned slightly. "Sir, you're enrolling Mrs. Falcon at Willowridge?"

Nathaniel gazed out at the passing cityscape. "Harrison has a quick mind, but she lacks refinement. She dropped out at sixteen. Now I understand why—with a foster father like Vincent Blackwood, education was hardly a priority. So I'm sending her to Willowridge. She's shown interest in medicine. This is her chance."

Dominic's eyes brightened. "Sir, you're thinking ahead."

"I don't expect her to dazzle on stage like Isabella, commanding attention. I just want her to better herself—get an education, find stability. Anything is better than..."

Better than drifting aimlessly, wasting time with worthless men.

Dominic smiled. "You're absolutely right, sir. I'm sure Mrs. Falcon will make you proud."

Nathaniel exhaled, watching the city blur past. He hoped so. He just needed her to stay out of trouble.

In an opulent private dining room at The Grand Celeste, Theodore sat with Lawrence Pembroke, Winston Chamberlain, and Edwin Zander, savoring an extravagant meal.

After the humiliation at Margaret's 80th birthday, Theodore had pulled strings to arrange this dinner with the three powerful men.

He raised his glass. "Mr. Pembroke, Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Zander—I look forward to your guidance in business."

The men clinked glasses with him. "Mr. Whitmore, you're too modest," Lawrence said smoothly. "With your daughter involved with Mr. Falcon, you'll soon be his father-in-law." Their willingness to entertain Theodore stemmed entirely from Nathaniel. Over the years, Nathaniel had elevated the Whitmore family to undeniable success.

Theodore laughed, pleased. He knew the press conference was happening. Soon, Victoria would call, and he'd officially be Nathaniel's future father-in-law.

He grinned. "Soon enough. Drinks are on me when it's official."
###Chapter 106

The glasses clinked as everyone drained their drinks.

Suddenly, the television in the private room flickered to life with a breaking news report. A poised anchor held her microphone, announcing, "Tonight, authorities have apprehended a criminal involved in child molestation and attempted rape, along with a suspected accomplice."

The screen cut to footage of Vincent Blackwood, his head concealed beneath a black hood, being shoved into a police car. Then, the camera panned to Victoria, her hands cuffed as officers led her away.

The three businessmen didn't recognize Vincent, but they knew Victoria instantly. Their expressions froze mid-conversation.

"Theodore," one of them muttered, "doesn't that woman look like your wife?"

Theodore, who had been pouring another round of wine, halted. His gaze snapped to the screen.

There she was—Victoria.

His face paled. The glass trembled in his grip.

The anchor continued, voice dripping with disdain, "If you're wondering who the biggest fool of the decade is, look no further. This woman sold out her own daughter just to chase after a man. The sheer audacity is staggering."

Theodore stood motionless, his jaw clenched.

The businessmen exchanged glances, their smiles vanishing. Without a word, they pushed back their chairs and stood.

"Gentlemen, wait—" Theodore called after them, but it was too late.

Lawrence, Winston, and Oliver merely smirked. "Theodore," Lawrence said dryly, "your family certainly knows how to make headlines."

Then they were gone.

Victoria had become the laughingstock of the city—and now, so had Theodore.

With a furious roar, he hurled his glass to the floor, shattering it into glittering shards.

His phone buzzed—a soft, melodic ringtone.

Isabella.

"Dad!" Her voice was frantic. "The press conference was a disaster! Mom's been arrested—you need to get a lawyer and bail her out now!"

It was past midnight when Theodore arrived at the police station, his lawyer in tow.

Victoria looked haggard, her face drained of color. This was her first time behind bars.

"Theodore, please, let me explain—"

His palm cracked across her cheek before she could finish.

Her head snapped to the side, a vivid red mark blooming on her skin.

Theodore's voice was a venomous hiss. "You've made me a joke in front of my associates. How am I supposed to show my face in business circles now? This is your doing, Victoria. You've humiliated me."

Victoria clutched her stinging cheek, too stunned to speak.

Rage burned through her. This was all Harrison's fault.

Isabella watched from the sidelines, her expression cold. She made no move to intervene. To her, Victoria was just a stepmother—nothing more.

"Dad," she said coolly, "what's our next move?"

Theodore exhaled sharply. "Nathaniel's feelings for Harrison have shifted. He's the key now. You need to secure him—keep him wrapped around your finger."

Isabella smirked, tilting her chin up. "You think Harrison actually believes Nathaniel cares about her? Let me show her exactly how wrong she is."

Even now, she refused to see Harrison as a threat.

Sure, Harrison had won a few petty battles. But when it came to Nathaniel? She would never win.

Isabella was certain of that.

And if Harrison needed proof, she’d be happy to deliver it.

Back at the Falcon Estate, Harrison's phone lit up with an incoming call.

Isabella.

"Harrison," her voice was sickly sweet. "Are you free? Let's grab coffee."
###Chapter 107

Isabella actually invited Harrison for coffee.

Harrison didn't respond right away. Isabella arched an eyebrow, her lips curling into a smirk. "What's wrong, Harrison? Scared? You've been winning so much lately, riding high on your success. Are you afraid of little old me?"

Harrison's lips curved into a faint smile. "I'll be there soon."

She ended the call and prepared to leave.

Her phone chimed. A message from Alistair Whitmore appeared - a complex surgical case file.

[Ms. Whitmore, this was a challenging procedure I encountered last week. When you have time, I'd appreciate your guidance.]

Alistair served as dean of Willowridge University and was one of her former students. Penelope, who also came from Willowridge, had been Alistair's top recommendation to become her assistant.

In essence, both Alistair and Penelope were her protégés.

Harrison typed a quick reply: [Understood.]

Thirty minutes later, Harrison entered the café and immediately spotted Isabella.

Rather than waiting at a table, Isabella stood poised on the staircase, watching her approach.

Harrison ascended the steps. "Isabella, we're hardly on coffee-sharing terms. If you have something to say, say it."

Isabella stood confidently in her crystal heels, the crimson spaghetti-strap dress emphasizing her prima ballerina status. "Harrison, congratulations on winning the press conference."

"Thanks," Harrison replied evenly.

"But what does it matter? Victory doesn't mean you can have Nathaniel, does it?" Harrison met Isabella's gaze without flinching. "Your point?"

"So..."

Isabella's eyes flickered toward the café entrance as the door swung open, revealing a tall, striking figure.

Moving to the stair's edge, Isabella lowered her voice with a venomous smile. "Harrison, you've grown too arrogant. Time to knock you down a peg."

Before Harrison could react, Isabella grabbed her sleeve while screaming, "No! Ah!" before tumbling down the stairs. Harrison's pulse spiked. Whatever game Isabella was playing, she'd just raised the stakes dangerously.

A deep, icy voice cut through the space. "Isabella!"

Harrison looked up to see Nathaniel standing there.

Nathaniel had arrived.

The setup became instantly clear.

Nathaniel had walked in just in time to see Isabella's dramatic fall. He rushed forward urgently. "Isabella! Isabella!"

Harrison descended the stairs calmly. "Nathaniel, she's pulling the same stunt again. Can't you see she threw herself down?"

Isabella writhed in apparent agony, sweat beading her forehead as she sobbed, "Nathaniel, my legs... The pain is unbearable..." Nathaniel glanced down, noticing his hands growing warm and sticky with blood. Isabella's legs bore severe injuries, crimson flowing freely.

Without even glancing at Harrison, Nathaniel immediately gathered Isabella into his arms and headed for the exit.

Harrison called after him, "Nathaniel, don't fall for her act!"

Nathaniel turned slowly, his frigid gaze locking onto hers. "Harrison, how can you be so cruel? Isabella is a dancer. Her legs are her life. And now they're injured!"

With that, Nathaniel carried Isabella away.

Harrison stood frozen, disbelief and anger warring within her. He called her cruel? She hadn't laid a finger on Isabella. The woman had orchestrated her own fall.

The truth glared painfully obvious - Nathaniel couldn't bear seeing Isabella hurt. As the ballet company's star, Isabella's injury devastated him completely. His concern for her ran bone-deep.
###Chapter 108

Harrison's lips curled into a bitter, self-deprecating smile.

In the private hospital suite, Isabella's leg injuries had been properly treated by the medical team. Nathaniel stood rigidly by the bedside, his jaw clenched as he addressed the physician. "How serious are the injuries? Will she still be able to dance professionally?"

The doctor offered a reassuring smile. "Mr. Falcon, the X-rays show only soft tissue damage. No fractures or tendon injuries. With proper rehabilitation, Ms. Whitmore will make a full recovery."

Once the medical staff exited, Nathaniel felt slender fingers intertwine with his own. He looked down to see Isabella's delicate hand gripping his, her touch feather-light yet possessive.

Meeting her gaze, he found Isabella smiling weakly, her usually vibrant face now pale and fragile. "Nathaniel, really... I'm fine. You don't need to worry so much."

His visible tension seemed to please her, a secret satisfaction warming her chest.

His voice turned sharp. "Why would you throw yourself down those stairs?"

Isabella hesitated only momentarily before answering with calculated honesty. "Nathaniel, haven't you been... distant lately? I can't feel your love anymore. It terrifies me."

The accusation struck true. Nathaniel had indeed withdrawn since her confrontation with Eleanor. The innocent girl from the cave had become someone he barely recognized.

And then there was Harrison. Against all reason, Nathaniel found himself inexplicably drawn to his wife. That stormy night at the countryside inn haunted him - their unexpected intimacy replaying in his mind.

Seeing Isabella's vulnerable state now twisted his gut with guilt.

He lowered himself onto the hospital bed's edge, voice softening. "You could have been seriously hurt. Dancing means everything to you."

Isabella seized the moment, pressing her body against his chest as her arms encircled him. "Nathaniel," she whispered with practiced fragility, "I was afraid you didn't want me anymore. Remember your promise in the cave? If you've changed your mind, I'd rather break my legs - or even die - than live without you."

The cave reference worked like magic. Nathaniel's resistance crumbled instantly.

He pulled her closer. "Don't talk like that. I'll never abandon you." A Falcon's promise was binding for life.

Isabella hid her triumphant smile against his shoulder. The stair incident had been a masterstroke.

Worth every bruise.

She tilted her head up with an artful pout. "I understand about your grandmother's condition delaying the divorce. But starting today, you're not to share a bed with Harrison. I know you've been sleeping together. That ends now."

The thought of Nathaniel and Harrison's intimacy burned like acid in her veins. Worse still - his obvious physical responses to his wife.

Unacceptable.

She was his chosen one. His cave girl. Harrison's temptations had to be eliminated.

Nathaniel stroked her hair soothingly. "I've already arranged for Harrison to reside at Willowridge University. She'll stay in campus housing. We won't be sharing quarters anymore."
###Chapter 109

What? Nathaniel was sending Harrison to which university?

Willowridge University?

Had he completely lost his mind?

Willowridge was among the most prestigious institutions in the country—what qualifications did Harrison possess to attend there?

Isabella's expression darkened as she processed this information. "Nathaniel, Harrison dropped out at sixteen. She's just some country bumpkin who only knows how to seduce men. How could someone like her possibly belong at Willowridge?"

Nathaniel's gaze remained steady, his silence speaking volumes. His decision was final—Harrison would attend Willowridge University, and there would be no further discussion.

Isabella quickly adjusted her approach. They'd only just reconciled; now wasn't the time for confrontation. Besides, someone like Harrison would only humiliate herself at such an elite institution. Eventually, Nathaniel would grow tired of her incompetence.

All Isabella needed to do was wait and watch the inevitable disaster unfold.

With practiced sweetness, Isabella smiled. "Of course, Nathaniel. I trust your judgment completely."

Nathaniel reached out, affectionately pinching Isabella's nose. "That's my girl."

Beaming, Isabella melted into his embrace.

Meanwhile, Harrison returned to the Falcon family estate, waiting in her bedroom for Nathaniel's return.

Hours dragged by. Not until midnight did twin beams of light pierce through the darkness as Nathaniel's Rolls Royce Phantom finally appeared.

Harrison assumed he'd spent all this time at the hospital with Isabella—hence the late return.

The bedroom door creaked open, Nathaniel entering with an icy presence that chilled the air.

"How's Isabella?" Harrison asked, looking up.

Tall and commanding, Nathaniel smoothly removed his suit jacket. "Just superficial injuries. No broken bones."

Harrison's expression didn't change. "Naturally, she wouldn't risk actual harm."

Nathaniel turned, his dark eyes meeting Harrison's calm gaze. "I know you didn't push her. Isabella threw herself down those stairs."

Harrison remained silent, waiting.

Nathaniel's chiseled features flickered in the dim light, unreadable. "I can't allow her to take another fall."

Harrison nearly laughed. Isabella was nothing if not clever—especially when manipulating Nathaniel.

This wasn't about framing Harrison. Isabella had simply needed Nathaniel to witness her "accident."

Mission accomplished.

She'd secured his concern, his guilt. Nathaniel was wrapped securely around her finger once more.

Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze evenly. "You have something to tell me."

Nathaniel studied her—the quiet grace of her posture, so different from Isabella's dramatic presence. Harrison stood composed, intelligent. She'd already deduced his purpose.

Clearing his throat, Nathaniel's voice dropped to a murmur. "Isabella insists we no longer share a bedroom."

Isabella had forbidden them from sleeping together.

The words struck like a physical blow. Pain flared sharp and sudden in Harrison's chest, lingering like a slow poison.

She could practically hear Isabella's triumphant whisper: "Getting too confident, Harrison? Let me remind you of your place."

And she had. Perfectly.

Harrison's flawless face revealed nothing, though her complexion paled slightly. Long lashes lowered as she spoke softly, "I'll move out tonight. I'll speak with Eleanor. I won't be returning."

She turned to leave.

Nathaniel caught her wrist, his grip firm yet gentle. "It's late. Stay until morning." His voice softened. "I'll sleep in the study."

Harrison fought back bitter amusement. A few words from Isabella, and Nathaniel transformed into a paragon of virtue.
###Chapter 110

Harrison lifted her eyes to meet Nathaniel's intense gaze. "No, I'm leaving tonight."

She attempted to wrench her wrist free from his iron grip, but Nathaniel's hold remained unbreakable. His strength was immovable, rendering escape impossible. His lips parted, voice steady as always.

"Tomorrow, report to Willowridge University for registration."

Harrison froze. "What?"

"You'll be attending medical school there. Everything's arranged."

Her breath caught in her throat.

Was he seriously sending her to Willowridge University? Had he lost his mind?

"Absolutely not!" Harrison snapped instantly.

Nathaniel's perfect brows knitted together. "Harrison, Willowridge is the nation's top medical institution. This opportunity doesn't come twice. I know you left school at sixteen, but now I'm giving you this chance. Don't you want to practice medicine? Study hard and you could shine like Isabella does on stage."

Harrison stood motionless, stunned into silence.

He truly believed her incapable!

White-hot fury surged through her veins.

Clenching her jaw, she swallowed her rage. "Fine. I'll go."

With a sharp twist, she freed her wrist and stormed out.

Harrison entered Eleanor's chambers where the elderly woman sat knitting by lamplight, reading glasses perched on her nose as she worked on a sweater.

"Grandmother, you should be resting." Harrison approached her.

"Perfect timing, dear. I've made you a vest. Try it on." Eleanor secured the final stitch and draped the delicate garment over Harrison's shoulders.

"Oh Lady Eleanor, it fits her beautifully," Reginald observed with a smile.

Nathaniel lingered outside the doorway, drawn by the laughter within. His gaze fell upon Harrison wearing a butter-yellow knitted vest. The garment hugged her petite frame, accentuating her slender waist. Raven locks cascaded over her shoulders, framing an angelic face that glowed in the lamplight.

Eleanor had chosen well - the soft hue complemented Harrison perfectly. "Grandmother, I have more than enough clothes. Don't strain your eyes for me."

"Autumn approaches, child. I won't have you catching chill." Eleanor patted the knitted wool. "This will keep you warm."

Harrison's nose pinkened, warmth blooming in her chest.

Reginald chuckled. "Miss Harrison, Lady Eleanor hasn't knitted in years. Not even Master Nathaniel owns anything made by her hands."

Eleanor swatted playfully at him. "Nathaniel has staff to keep him warm. But our Harrison only has herself."

Harrison had always been alone.

Something fragile in Harrison's chest cracked open. She threw her arms around Eleanor.

Tears pricked her eyes as she buried her face in Eleanor's shoulder, clinging tightly. "Thank you, Grandmother."

Gratitude overflowed.

For the warmth. The understanding. The belonging.

For welcoming her into the Falcon family.

Rosewood Manor was the warmest place she'd ever known. Her sanctuary. Her home.

Yet it could never truly be hers.

No matter how she wished otherwise.

Soon, she would have to leave it all behind.
###Chapter 111
The truth was, Harrison had long accepted her transient existence.

Drifting through life had been her norm since childhood. But now she understood—it wasn't hardship that shattered her. It was kindness. The warmth she'd never known made her chest tighten unbearably.

Eleanor reached out, pulling Harrison into an embrace as if she were a child. "My dear, why so formal with me?"

"Grandmother, I need to tell you something."

"Of course, sweetheart. What is it?"

Outside the door, Nathaniel stood motionless. Harrison leaned against Eleanor's shoulder, silent tears tracing her cheeks like morning dew.

"Grandmother, I can't stay here anymore. I'm leaving."

Eleanor stiffened. "What? Why? Has that boy Nathaniel been cruel again? I'll deal with him right now!"

Reginald materialized with a feather duster. "Madam Eleanor, here!"

She snatched it, scowling. "Harrison, you're not going anywhere. If anyone leaves, it's him!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched.

Had his grandmother forgotten he was her blood relative? At this point, adoption seemed plausible.

And Reginald—that traitor would regret his allegiance.

Harrison's soft voice cut through the tension. "You misunderstand. Nathaniel has been... unexpectedly kind."

Eleanor scoffed. "Truly?"

Nathaniel watched as Harrison wiped her tears, forcing a bright smile. "Absolutely. Actually, he's arranged for me to attend Willowridge University. I'm moving to campus tomorrow."

Eleanor blinked. "Willowridge? Well... that's impressive. For once, the boy makes a decent decision."

Harrison disentangled herself. "Registration is tomorrow."

"I'll accompany you."

"No need, Grandmother."

"Nonsense! Every student needs family during registration. You have me."

Harrison's eyes shimmered again. She bit her lip. "Arriving in a luxury car would draw attention. I just want to focus on my studies."

Eleanor opened her mouth to protest, but Harrison continued quickly—before the dam broke. She couldn't afford to hesitate. Lingering would make leaving impossible.

"Grandmother, don't distract me. I'll visit often."

Eleanor sighed. "Very well."

"Thank you. Rest now."

As Eleanor settled back, Harrison stepped into the hallway—where Nathaniel waited.

"Grandmother's calm now. I'm leaving."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on her tear-streaked face. Her eyes, though swollen, shone brighter. Flushed cheeks. Pink nose. That stubborn posture couldn't disguise how fragile she looked.

How utterly breakable.

His voice dropped. "I'll have the car ready."

"No thank you."

Without a backward glance, Harrison walked away.

Nathaniel watched the estate gates swallow her slender figure into the night.

Something heavy settled in his chest. He yanked off his tie and flung it aside.

Fine. Let her go.
###Chapter 112

Harrison was merely a replacement. A temporary solution, nothing more.

Nathaniel acknowledged there had been a fleeting moment of weakness, but love wasn't part of the equation. His heart belonged to Isabella. She was the one he truly wanted by his side.

This messy entanglement between two women needed to end. His relationship with Harrison was over.

The knock came late at night. Gabrielle hastily wrapped herself in a silk robe and hurried to the door. "Who is it?"

Harrison stood on the threshold.

She carried nothing except the cream-colored cardigan Eleanor had gifted her. A bitter smile played on her lips as she met Gabrielle's concerned gaze. "I've got nowhere left. Can I stay with you?"

Gabrielle yanked her inside without hesitation. Harrison's hands felt like ice. Gabrielle rubbed them between her own. "What happened? Why are you wandering alone at this hour? It's dangerous out there."

Harrison gave a hollow laugh. "Isabella threw herself down the staircase today. Told Nathaniel she wouldn't share a house with me. So here I am."

Gabrielle stiffened momentarily before crushing Harrison in a fierce embrace. "Those despicable bastards!"

Tears welled in her eyes as her voice cracked. "How dare they treat you this way?"

Morning found Harrison at Willowridge University for registration. Alistair had smoothed the process in advance. She was assigned to Medical Department, Class 12.

Harrison chose a solitary seat in the back. Her classmates seemed friendly enough, introducing themselves with enthusiasm.

Excited whispers rippled through the room. "Professor Whitmore is lecturing today! He's practically a medical legend - brilliant and completely obsessed with research."

"This was a last-minute addition to the schedule. We're incredibly fortunate!" The esteemed professor in question happened to be Harrison's former apprentice, Alistair.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Harrison after her sleepless night. She stifled a yawn and rested her head on the cool desk surface, seeking momentary respite.

The classroom's chatter died abruptly as Alistair entered. His reputation commanded instant silence and respect from the students. His sharp gaze swept across the room, searching for one particular face.

This entire lecture had been arranged specifically for her.

Nathaniel was his nephew, and the stories about this wife of his had piqued Alistair's curiosity. Especially since Nathaniel had personally intervened on her behalf.

Alistair cleared his throat. "Is the new student, Harrison, present?"

Several fingers pointed toward the back. "Professor Whitmore, she's over there."

His eyes followed the direction to find Harrison fast asleep at her desk. He hesitated momentarily.

Family ties demanded some courtesy. Alistair descended from the podium and approached her desk. He cleared his throat again, louder this time.

Harrison remained undisturbed, lost in deep slumber. Alistair sighed in resignation.

A sharp rap on the desktop finally roused her.

Blinking sleepily, Harrison lifted her head to regard him through half-lidded eyes.

As Alistair studied her, he realized with some surprise that she was studying him right back.

He began to speak. "So you're—"

Harrison interrupted bluntly. "You're Alistair Whitmore?"

The question caught him off guard. For decades, no one had dared address him so informally. The title "Professor Whitmore" had become his identity.

Yet this woman had just shattered that protocol without hesitation.
###Chapter 113

Alistair stood rigidly while Harrison remained seated. By all rights, the professor should have held the advantage.

Yet Harrison sat with impeccable posture, her piercing gaze calmly assessing Alistair. Her composed demeanor somehow made the dean feel diminished.

Alistair cleared his throat. "Y-yes, that's correct."

He mentally kicked himself. What kind of response was that?

Only his esteemed mentor, Dr. Sinclair, ever dared address him by his full name. Yet this niece-in-law did so without hesitation.

Alistair opened his mouth to reprimand her. "You insolent-"

Before he could continue, Harrison gave a slight nod. "Very well. Proceed with your lecture."

Alistair froze.

Who was the educator here? She was giving him orders now?

Something in Harrison's commanding presence made his body move against his will. Without another word, he turned toward the chalkboard and began writing.

Why was he obeying her?

He didn't want to comply, yet found himself powerless to resist.

Alistair launched into his lecture, but Harrison, still exhausted from the previous night, soon drifted off again. Her earlier nap clearly hadn't been enough. Within minutes, she was sound asleep at her desk.

She slept through the entire session.

As Alistair gathered his notes to leave, his eyes fell on the slumbering student. Part of him wanted to shake her awake and deliver a scolding, but something held him back - an unidentifiable quality about her that gave him pause.

With a resigned sigh, he exited quietly.

At that moment, Arabella arrived with two companions in tow. A dance major at Willowridge University, Arabella dreamed of becoming a prima ballerina like her idol Isabella. She worshipped the woman.

Arabella possessed breathtaking beauty with curves that commanded attention - particularly her ample bosom, which made her the campus sensation. Crowned Willowridge's reigning beauty, she dominated the university's social scene.

When Arabella learned Harrison had enrolled at Willowridge, fury consumed her.

What was Nathaniel thinking, sending this backwater nobody here? Did she even belong at such a prestigious institution?

To Arabella, Harrison was nothing but a stain on the university's reputation.

Peering through the window, Arabella spotted Harrison still asleep at her desk. Her two lackeys giggled as one whispered, "Arabella, I heard she sleeps through every lecture. Is there something wrong with her?"

"No surprise there," the other chimed in. "She's just here to embarrass herself at Willowridge." Arabella's mood lifted instantly. She pulled out her phone, snapped a photo of the sleeping student, and immediately posted it to the university forum.

Her caption dripped with venom. [Let's give a warm Willowridge welcome to our newest student, Harrison.]

Comments flooded in immediately.

[Professor Whitmore lectured today and this girl slept through it? Seriously?]

[Is she the 'Sleeping Goddess' or something?]

Two others agreed, writing [Yeah, Sleeping Goddess fits perfectly.] Seeing Harrison crowned with this mocking title sent Arabella into fits of laughter.

Just then, her phone rang with a familiar tone.

Isabella.

"Hello Arabella, how's Harrison's first day at Willowridge going?" Isabella inquired.

Arabella smirked, her voice thick with disdain. "Isabella, why waste your time on Harrison? She's beneath your notice. Here's something amusing - Harrison became campus famous on her very first day..."

Isabella chuckled. "Come to The Velvet Lounge tonight. Nathaniel's taking me to play cards. Bring that amusing story to share with Nathaniel and the others."

After a full day of classes, Harrison finally returned to her dormitory.
###Chapter 114

Harrison's dormitory was shared by two people. Herself and Rosalind Fairchild.

Rosalind flashed a bright smile. "You must be Harrison! I'm Rosalind. Looks like we're stuck with each other."

Rosalind was vibrant and full of life. A prominent birthmark stretched across her left cheek - an inky stain against porcelain skin.

Noticing Harrison's gaze, Rosalind didn't flinch. "This beauty mark? Doctors say it's permanent. My classmates call me 'Patchwork Girl' when they think I can't hear." She gave a careless wave. "If you want to request a transfer, I won't blame you."

Harrison grinned. "Perfect. I'm just a small-town girl. We'll make quite the pair." She extended her hand.

Rosalind's face lit up as she clasped it.

The two clicked instantly. Harrison admired how Rosalind carried herself - that mark didn't define her. She radiated confidence.

Without warning, Rosalind linked arms with Harrison. "We're hitting The Velvet Lounge tonight."

A nightclub?

Harrison barely had time to protest before being whisked away.

At The Velvet Lounge, Rosalind flagged down a waiter. "Your best VIP room, please!"

Harrison tugged her sleeve. "Can you afford this?"

Rosalind winked. "Daddy's credit card has no limit."

The waiter looked apologetic. "Our premier suite is reserved for Mr. Willowbrook tonight. He's entertaining Mr. Falcon."

The Velvet Lounge belonged to Sebastian's family. Tonight, he hosted Nathaniel.

Rosalind perked up. "Nathaniel Falcon is here?"

"Yes, with Ms. Whitmore. They're playing cards with Mr. Willowbrook and other guests. That's Mr. Falcon's private area."

Harrison's breath hitched. Nathaniel and Isabella, together. What were the odds?

Her eyes found the exclusive lounge at the back. Nathaniel's domain.

Rosalind pulled her forward. "Let's get a closer look."

At the doorway, Harrison saw the gathering. Cards scattered across the table. Nathaniel commanded the center seat.

Tonight, he was devastating. A crisp white shirt hugged his frame, top buttons undone to reveal tantalizing collarbones. He handled his cards with lazy precision - all effortless charm and lethal grace.

Isabella sat beside him in a rose-print dress, petals blooming across the fabric. Stunning. They looked like something from a magazine spread.

Sebastian and two other heirs laughed over the game.

Sebastian grinned. "Another loss, Nathaniel. Your luck's terrible tonight."
###Chapter 115

Nathaniel's luck had abandoned him tonight. Loss after loss darkened his handsome features with icy detachment.

Isabella remained focused on her cards, a bowl of ripe seasonal fruits at her elbow. She selected a plump grape, peeled it with care, and pressed it to Nathaniel's lips.

Distracted by the game, he accepted the offering without thought. His attention divided between the cards and Isabella's affectionate ministrations. She leaned closer, the picture of devoted companionship, even extending her palm to catch the discarded pit.

She played the role of doting wife to perfection.

The young men at the table exchanged knowing glances. "Only Mr. Falcon could command such devotion from Willowbrook's reigning beauty," one remarked.

"Seems you can't have both luck and love," another teased. "No wonder you're losing tonight."

Isabella pouted playfully. "Enough teasing, gentlemen."

Outside the door, Harrison watched the scene unfold. This marked her first glimpse of Nathaniel socializing with Isabella among friends.

A sharp pang pierced her chest.

Another loss. Nathaniel tossed his cards down, pushing chips forward. "Split it."

Sebastian and the others laughed, clapping. "Always generous, Nathaniel!"

"Mr. Falcon's burning through cash tonight," someone observed.

Nathaniel remained impassive, lounging against his chair with bored indifference.

Isabella gazed at him adoringly. "Tired of playing, darling?"

"Seems Nathaniel's lost his edge," one man joked.

Another grinned. "Perhaps Ms. Isabella could...reinvigorate him?"

The group erupted in suggestive laughter.

Isabella poured wine with a smile. "Care for a drink, Nathaniel?"

He watched her silently.

Before the assembled company, Isabella climbed onto Nathaniel's lap. Elevated slightly, she leaned forward, hand braced against his chair back, effectively pinning him in place.

Nathaniel's bored expression finally flickered with interest. One eyebrow arched as amusement lit his features.

Isabella caught the wineglass rim between her teeth, tilting it to let crimson liquid spill forth. Nathaniel chuckled, allowing the wine to trickle into his mouth.

"Bravo!"

Sebastian's laughter led the chorus of approval. "Ms. Isabella, what a performance!"

"Now we see why you're his favorite," another heir remarked.

The luxurious room's atmosphere grew charged. Harrison watched as a flushed Isabella returned to her seat beside Nathaniel.

Though silent, Nathaniel's left arm draped possessively over her chair back, drawing her into his orbit.

The teasing continued, met with Isabella's playful scolding. Nathaniel simply watched her with indulgent tenderness.

Harrison couldn't deny Isabella's cleverness. She understood men like Nathaniel - accustomed to being the center of attention, to being served. Isabella crafted the perfect atmosphere of devotion.

Harrison could bear no more. This was self-flagellation.

This was Nathaniel and Isabella's world - a world where she didn't belong.

"Rosalind, let's go."

Rosalind turned. "Wait, Harrison. Look - Arabella's arrived."
###Chapter 116

Harrison noticed Arabella lounging on the plush sofa, her laughter ringing through the room as she stirred up mischief. The atmosphere was electric with amusement.

Arabella flashed a playful grin. "Nathaniel, Isabella, since everyone's in such high spirits, let me share a joke."

Isabella leaned forward, eyes sparkling with curiosity. "What joke?"

Arabella's smirk widened. "It's about Harrison!"

Just beyond the doorway, Harrison froze. Her stomach twisted uncomfortably. This wasn't how she wanted to be included—especially not with Nathaniel and Isabella sharing such a joyful moment.

Earlier, she'd convinced herself she didn't belong in their glittering world. Yet here was someone determined to thrust her into it anyway.

Arabella continued, voice dripping with amusement. "Today was Harrison's first day at Willowridge University, and she's already legendary!"

Sebastian sneered. "Her? Really?"

Arabella giggled. "Oh yes. They're calling her the 'Sleeping Goddess.' She slept through every single class!"

The room exploded with laughter.

Sebastian roared with mirth. "Now I understand why Nathaniel enrolled her at Willowridge. He wanted to provide us with daily entertainment! Comedy gold!"

The entire group joined in, their mocking laughter washing over Harrison. Isabella looked particularly delighted, her smug satisfaction radiating.

Harrison clenched her fists. If their happiness came at her expense, so be it.

Inside the opulent room, Nathaniel remained stone-faced. Isabella's antics had mildly amused him earlier, but this "joke" about Harrison sent a chill through him.

His arm, which had been draped casually over Isabella's chair, withdrew abruptly.

With sudden intensity, he turned toward the doorway, his piercing gaze scanning the threshold.

But it was empty.

Harrison and Rosalind had already slipped away.

Nathaniel rose abruptly, his expression stormy, and strode toward the exit.

Isabella blinked in confusion. "Nathaniel? Where are you going?"

"Bathroom," he replied curtly.

Entering a private lounge, Nathaniel pulled out his phone and dialed.

Alistair's voice answered. "Nathaniel?"

Standing before the floor-to-ceiling windows, Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Alistair, how did Harrison perform today?"

He'd gone straight to the source.

Alistair hesitated. "Not... ideal. She slept through all her classes."

Nathaniel's aristocratic features twisted in irritation. "I sent her to university to learn, not to sleep through lectures! Alistair, why didn't you intervene?"

Alistair recalled Harrison's earlier words.

"You're Alistair Whitmore? Fine, go ahead with your lecture."

A dry chuckle escaped him. "Why don't you deal with her?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "She's your student. That makes it your responsibility."

Unfazed, Alistair countered, "And she's your wife. Shouldn't you handle her?"

Nathaniel ended the call with a sharp click.

Back in his study, Alistair stood motionless, listening to the dead tone.

"Unbelievable. The audacity of these two."

His thoughts circled back to Harrison. He wasn’t intimidated—he was her professor, after all. Tomorrow, he’d put her in her place.

Ding.

His phone chimed.

A message from his most revered mentor, Dr. Sinclair, appeared. Just yesterday, the renowned physician had meticulously reviewed his surgical proposal, marking it with precise red annotations.

Alistair’s eyes gleamed as he scanned the notes, admiration swelling in his chest. "Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant."

With deep reverence, he recorded a voice reply.

"Thank you, Dr. Sinclair."
###Chapter 117

Harrison had already pulled Rosalind out of the restroom, their footsteps echoing through the marble hallway as they headed toward the exit.

Her phone buzzed with a voice message from Alistair. Harrison quickly typed back, [Alistair, you've got this.]

In his study, Alistair's lips curved into a smile at the encouraging words. He responded immediately, "I won't let you down!"

Tucking her phone away, Harrison felt Rosalind grab her arm. "Let's move," Rosalind urged.

They were steps from freedom when the bathroom door swung open. Two figures blocked their path.

Isabella and Arabella.

The confrontation happened in a heartbeat.

Isabella's smirk was venomous. "Harrison, what a surprise. Heard Nathaniel threw you out of Falcon Manor. Dorm life at Willowridge treating you well?"

She'd been waiting for this moment since her humiliating fall down the stairs, desperate to gloat over her rival's downfall.

Harrison merely arched a brow, her smile razor-sharp. "Isabella, I've never seen someone so eager to claim my castoffs."

Castoffs? Isabella blinked in confusion.

Harrison's grin widened. "That bed you're sleeping in? My old one. Nathaniel? Secondhand goods. You're practically scavenging through my trash, and you call that a victory? How...pathetic." The barb hit its mark. Isabella's face went white.

Rosalind, silent until now, let out a chuckle. "So this is the famous 'mistress' you mentioned?"

The word stung. Isabella's glare shifted to Rosalind. "And who asked you?"

Then her eyes landed on the distinctive birthmark marring Rosalind's cheek. A cruel smile twisted her lips. "God, you're hideous."

Arabella linked arms with Isabella, adding fuel to the fire. "This is Harrison's new pet, Rosalind Fairchild. Campus joke, really." Her giggle was saccharine. "Perfect match, don't you think? The country hick and the circus freak."

Isabella nodded eagerly. "Like trash attracts trash."

The insults rolled off them like water. Harrison simply turned to Rosalind. "Let's go. The stench of desperation is overwhelming."

"Agreed," Rosalind said, turning on her heel.

Isabella's smile vanished. Her voice turned icy. "Arabella, you're Willowridge's golden girl. Handle this. I want them gone."

Arabella's eyes gleamed with malice. "Consider it done."

Satisfied, Isabella turned to the mirror to fix her lipstick. Then a thought struck her. "Any progress finding Professor Whitmore's daughter, Bebe?"

Alistair had married late and cherished his only child. Bebe Whitmore, youngest scion of the powerful Whitmore clan, was Nathaniel's beloved cousin. The Whitmores' influence stretched deep into Capitol politics.

Despite months of searching, Isabella had hit a wall. The Falcon and Whitmore families had buried the girl's trail completely.

Arabella frowned. "Rumor says she's at Willowridge, but I've checked every Whitmore on campus. Nothing."
###Chapter 118

Isabella's delicate brows knitted together. "Arabella, Eleanor has never truly welcomed me. Securing the Whitmore family's backing is essential. Gabrielle holds the key to that."

Her fingers traced the rim of her wine glass. "If I can win her over, make her trust me, I'll be closer to becoming Nathaniel's wife."

Isabella had a gift for charming people. Sebastian, Arabella, and all the wealthy heirs in Nathaniel's circle adored her. Now she needed to work her magic on Gabrielle.

The Whitmore family's support was non-negotiable. They were Nathaniel's maternal relatives, and their approval meant everything.

Arabella nodded. "I'll keep searching for her. Honestly, I'm dying to know who this Gabrielle really is."

Back in the opulent private suite, Isabella noticed Nathaniel's absence. He hadn't returned since stepping out earlier. She moved through the lavish lounge and found him sprawled across a velvet sofa.

Nathaniel had been drinking heavily. His mood remained dark. His phone lay discarded on the marble coffee table. His long legs stretched across the furniture, one arm draped carelessly over the backrest.

His eyes were closed. The platinum watch on his wrist glinted as he massaged his temples.

Even now, Nathaniel's presence made Isabella's pulse quicken. Their attraction had begun with admiration - for his power, his wealth, his effortless dominance.

He commanded attention even in repose. The way he occupied space made her ache with desire. She approached silently, positioning herself behind him. Her manicured fingers began kneading his temples with practiced precision.

Nathaniel's hand dropped away. The tension in his jaw eased slightly.

A coy smile played on Isabella's lips. "You didn't even open your eyes. Do you let just anyone touch you like this?"

Nathaniel's arm shot up, capturing her wrist. With one swift motion, he pulled her onto his lap.

His hooded gaze met hers. "Who else would I allow, if not you?"

At thirty-two, Nathaniel's raw magnetism was undeniable. When he flirted, it carried a dangerous edge that set her skin ablaze.

Isabella laughed throatily, draping her arms around his neck. "Why didn't you come back to the suite?"

The question made Nathaniel's expression darken. Harrison's face flashed in his mind, stirring something restless within him.

"By the way," Isabella continued, "I ran into Harrison in the ladies' room earlier. You'll never guess what she said."

They hadn't spoken since Harrison moved into Willowridge University. Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "Do tell."

"She called you her sloppy seconds!" Isabella's voice dripped with venom. "And implied I was... unclean!"

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. A dry chuckle escaped him.

Only Harrison would dare say something so brazen. He could practically hear her biting sarcasm, see that defiant tilt of her chin.

Isabella traced Nathaniel's sharp jawline. His perfect features could make any woman weak. Her breath hitched as she leaned closer.

"Kiss me," she demanded, her lips hovering inches from his.
###Chapter 119

Isabella leaned in, her lips parted expectantly. "Kiss me, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel's gaze traced the delicate curve of her flushed cheeks. Unlike Harrison's sharp, angular features, Isabella possessed a soft, youthful beauty that seemed to glow under the dim lighting. Where Harrison constantly challenged him with her stubbornness, Isabella was refreshingly compliant - a warm presence that never failed to soothe his temper.

His head dipped lower...

Across town, Harrison and Rosalind had just finished their drinks at The Velvet Lounge. They stepped onto the crowded sidewalk, scanning the street for available cabs.

The nightlife district was packed, making taxis scarce.

Harrison had an idea. "Rosalind, let's just grab those rental bikes."

Rosalind smirked. "No need. I'll call my cousin to pick us up."

"Cousin?" Harrison blinked. "Since when do you have family in Willowbrook?"

Rosalind winked mysteriously. "Since always."

"It's late though. Don't trouble him."

But Rosalind was already dialing. "He's out with his mistress anyway. Might as well make himself useful."

Harrison gasped. "Your cousin has a mistress?"

"Married man playing house with some gold-digger." Rosalind rolled her eyes. "Total scumbag."

Harrison froze. The story sounded painfully familiar - another woman trapped in a loveless marriage, just like her.

Back in the private lounge, Nathaniel had closed the distance between them. Isabella could practically taste the expensive whiskey on his breath.

His masculine scent enveloped her, making her knees weak. She wound her arms around his neck, anticipating the kiss.

Instead, Nathaniel's deep voice rumbled. "Your lipstick's bleeding."

Isabella's eyes flew open.

A phone rang, shattering the moment. Nathaniel reached for his device, gently disentangling himself to answer.

Frustrated, Isabella grabbed her compact from her Chanel clutch. Sure enough, her earlier touch-up had smeared at the corners. She dabbed furiously at the mistake.

Nathaniel strode to the panoramic windows. "Gabrielle."

Isabella's breath hitched. Gabrielle was calling?

She strained to hear the conversation but caught only Nathaniel's calm response. "Understood. I'll arrange transportation immediately."

As he hung up, Isabella pressed herself against his back, her hands roaming his sculpted torso. She wanted to reclaim their interrupted moment.

Nathaniel removed her hands firmly. His expression cooled. "Raincheck. Falcon Enterprises needs me. My driver will take you home."

Isabella's face fell. Though she tried to hide it, disappointment flooded her. But Nathaniel's demeanor had already shifted to detached professionalism. The moment was lost.

Her gaze dropped to the floor, humiliation burning her cheeks. Men like Nathaniel demanded perfection. One flaw, and their interest evaporated. Just like that night at Rosewood Manor when he'd walked away despite obvious desire. His body remembered the rejection even if his mind didn't.


###Chapter 120

This was a red flag waving violently in the wind.

Nathaniel stretched his long legs and rose from his seat, exiting the room with purposeful strides. He ordered Dominic to prepare his car immediately.

Isabella noticed how Bebe seemed to hold a special place in Nathaniel's heart. One phone call from her, and he dropped everything to respond.

She clenched her fists. She needed to discover Bebe's identity. She would become her closest confidant.

Meanwhile, Harrison and Rosalind remained standing on the bustling sidewalk. Soon, a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop beside them, its engine humming softly.

The chauffeur opened the rear door with practiced elegance. Both girls slid into the plush leather seats.

Harrison's eyes widened. "Rosalind, is your cousin loaded?"

A Rolls-Royce - Nathaniel's personal vehicle was the same make. Did all wealthy jerks favor this brand?

Rosalind chuckled. "Filthy rich. Harrison, let me introduce you to my cousin. You could be family."

What?

Harrison shook her head vigorously. "Thanks, but no thanks. That's not really my scene."

Rosalind smirked mischievously.

She wanted to reveal that Harrison was already family - through marriage to Nathaniel!

The next day at Willowridge University, Harrison and Rosalind were walking back to their dorm when a voice cut through the air. "So you're the Sleeping Beauty, Harrison?"

Harrison looked up to see Julian Ashford blocking their path.

Julian stood surrounded by his usual entourage, eyeing Harrison with a predatory grin. "Well, well. Didn't expect the campus legend to be such a knockout."

Rosalind leaned in urgently. "Harrison, that's Julian Ashford. Heir to the Ashford fortune. Campus royalty and resident bully."

Harrison's gaze turned icy. "Don't know you."

She tried to walk past, but Julian stepped directly into her path. "No need to be shy, gorgeous. Let's get acquainted."

The closer he got, the more Julian found himself captivated. Sienna had sent him to drive Harrison out of school, but failed to mention her breathtaking beauty.

"I like you, princess," Julian purred, moving closer. "From today, you're mine. I'll give you everything you've ever wanted."

His hand reached for Harrison's face.

Harrison jerked away with a hiss. "Back off!"

She grabbed Rosalind's wrist to leave, but Julian's goons formed a tight circle around them.

Rosalind glared. "Julian, don't push your luck!"

"Push my luck?" Julian laughed cruelly. "I make my own luck. Harrison, stop playing hard to get. Small-town girl like you should be grateful for my attention."

His gaze flicked to Rosalind with disdain. "Boys, Harrison's mine. As for Clown Face here... she's all yours. Probably still untouched - not that anyone would want her."

The group erupted in crude laughter, their eyes raking over both girls. Even calm-tempered Rosalind trembled with rage. "You little-"

Harrison stepped protectively in front of her. Julian raised his hand dramatically. "Take them!"
###Chapter 121

The mob surged toward Harrison and Rosalind.

Shouts erupted across the campus grounds. "Fight! There's a fight happening!"

Alistair had been reviewing student files in his office when the commotion reached him. He rose abruptly, his voice icy. "What's happening out there?"

"Professor Whitmore," a breathless male student gasped, "Julian Ashford and his gang cornered Harrison and Rosalind near the quad... it's bad... they're pulling hair, scratching faces..."

Alistair's expression darkened instantly. He rushed out with Gregory Thornton, the department chair.

From a distance, the scene unfolded before them. Julian's cronies lay unconscious on the grass, victims of Harrison's sleeping powder. Julian himself was pinned to the ground, with Harrison yanking his hair while Rosalind clawed at his face in furious retaliation.

"Ow! My scalp! My face!" Julian howled.

Alistair stood frozen.

He'd expected to find Harrison and Rosalind being attacked. Instead, they'd turned the tables completely. The two women had Julian at their mercy, exacting brutal revenge.

They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Alistair was witnessing that truth firsthand.

"Let me go! Do you know who my family is? The Ashfords own half this town! My parents will have you expelled from Willowridge!" Julian shrieked.

Gregory stomped his foot in frustration. "This behavior is unacceptable! Brawling on campus? All of you - call your parents immediately!"

He turned to Alistair. "Professor Whitmore, you sponsored Harrison's enrollment, correct? What do you propose we-"

Alistair straightened his tie, distancing himself. "I merely facilitated the paperwork. Harrison has a legal guardian. Contact them."

A crowd had gathered outside Gregory's office, eager spectators to the unfolding drama.

Harrison, Rosalind, and Julian had been separated when Julian's parents arrived.

Reginald Ashford slammed his fist on the desk, his face crimson with rage. "This is outrageous! Were these hooligans raised by wolves? Look what they've done to my boy! I demand justice!"

Beatrice Ashford clutched her son protectively. "Our precious Julian has never been struck in his life! Expel these two troublemakers immediately!"

Julian, still seething, added, "Yes! Expel them! Or I'll make sure this isn't over!"

Harrison and Rosalind stood against the wall, supposedly reflecting on their actions.

Rosalind argued, "We fought back, but he harassed us first!"

Julian jumped up. "Lies! Where's your proof? But everyone can see what you did to me!" He pointed to his visible injuries.

Rosalind clenched her fists, lacking concrete evidence. "You little-"

Harrison placed a calming hand on her arm, shaking his head subtly.

Julian touched his bruised face. "They must be expelled today!"

Outside the office, Arabella watched the proceedings with satisfaction. Seeing the Ashfords' intimidating presence and their demands for expulsion, a smug smile crept across her face.

Everything was going exactly as planned.

She'd been the one to secretly orchestrate Julian's harassment of Harrison. Now the results were even better than she'd hoped.

Arabella slipped away from the crowd and immediately called Isabella, eager to share her victory.

"Isabella? You'll never guess what happened! Harrison's about to be kicked out of Willowridge!"

Isabella's delighted laughter crackled through the phone. "Seriously, Arabella? You're incredible! I can't believe you managed to get her expelled so quickly."
###Chapter 122

Arabella's lips curled in satisfaction. Willowridge University was her domain, and handling Harrison would be child's play.

"Isabella, Harrison's time at Willowridge will be cut short this time. We'll be laughing about this ridiculous situation for years to come..."

In the executive boardroom of Falcon Enterprises, senior leaders wearing platinum access badges sat around the mahogany conference table.

The quarterly financial review was underway. Only the CFO's voice echoed in the tense silence as he presented the company's performance.

Nathaniel Falcon, CEO, occupied the head seat. His custom navy suit accentuated his commanding presence. He studied the reports with sharp focus, his angular features radiating quiet authority.

The door burst open without warning. Dominic entered hastily, clutching a phone. "Mr. Falcon..." His voice held uncharacteristic urgency.

Nathaniel didn't look up. "Speak."

The room froze as all eyes turned to Dominic.

Beads of sweat formed on Dominic's brow. "Sir, Willowridge University called. Mrs. Falcon was involved in an altercation on campus."

A collective gasp filled the room.

Nathaniel's hands stilled on the documents. He lifted his piercing gaze slowly. "Repeat that."

"Your wife got into a physical confrontation. The university requests her guardian's immediate presence."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly.

Two days. That's all it took. First sleeping in class, now brawling? And they wanted her guardian?

She was testing his patience.

His jaw tightened visibly. The report slammed onto the table as he stood abruptly.

Chaos erupted in the boardroom. "Wait - Mr. Falcon is married?"

"His wife is a student? Getting into fights and needing parental intervention?"

"This must be the first time Nathaniel Falcon has ever been summoned to a school office!"

Within minutes, the scandalous news spread through Falcon Enterprises' entire headquarters. Their formidable CEO had abandoned a crucial meeting because his college-student wife required a guardian's presence.

Outside Gregory's office, the crowd of curious students had dispersed. Julian Ashford's parents had taken him to the infirmary.

Harrison and Rosalind stood in tense silence, awaiting judgment. Gregory's stern voice broke the quiet. "Harrison, your guardian is on their way."

Harrison blinked in shock.

Guardian? Victoria? Who else could it be?

She didn't even have a legal guardian.

As she opened her mouth to protest, Gregory announced, "They're here."

The office door swung open violently. A cold draft swept in, followed by an imposing figure.

Nathaniel had arrived.

Harrison's dark eyes widened in disbelief.

They actually called him?!
###Chapter 123
Harrison gaped at Gregory in disbelief. "Wait, Mr. Thornton, you must have dialed the wrong number..."

Her voice faltered as a towering figure stepped between them, blocking her view. Nathaniel had positioned himself directly in front of her.

His piercing gaze swept over Rosalind before locking onto Harrison. "Who initiated the altercation? Step forward!"

The fury radiating from him was suffocating. Rosalind instinctively retreated, her face paling.

In a cowardly move, Rosalind shoved Harrison forward, sending her stumbling straight into Nathaniel's chest.

His body was unyielding, like forged steel. The aura of a powerful CEO, fresh from a high-stakes board meeting, made his presence even more intimidating—no one dared approach.

Harrison, still off-balance, felt her cheeks burn as she pressed against him. She couldn't believe Rosalind had betrayed her like this.

Traitor!

Nathaniel looked down at her, his voice sharp. "Stand properly."

"Right." Harrison quickly righted herself, smoothing her rumpled clothes.

"Look at me," he commanded, his tone brooking no argument.

Harrison obeyed, lifting her chin.

Nathaniel's frown deepened as he studied her. Bruises marred her face, her hair tangled from the fight. Though she and Rosalind had overpowered Julian, his physical advantage had left its mark—her clothes were torn, dust smudged her porcelain skin, and she looked utterly pitiful.

Yet her eyes remained bright and clear, meeting his without flinching.

For a moment, Nathaniel's reprimand died on his lips.

Just then, Gregory approached. "Mr. Falcon, my sincerest apologies for the disturbance. However, the situation with Harrison and Rosalind brawling is severe. The Ashfords are demanding Harrison's expulsion. What would you advise?"

Nathaniel's mouth thinned into a razor-sharp line. "I'll take them to clean up first."

Gregory nodded. "Understood."

Nathaniel escorted Harrison and Rosalind to the dormitory. Rosalind snatched her basin and bolted. "Harrison, I'll use the shower down the hall."

Harrison could only stare after her, speechless.

Nathaniel waited outside with impeccable decorum while Harrison showered, washing away the grime of the fight.

When she emerged, Nathaniel still stood guard outside.

His imposing figure drew whispers and awed glances from every girl in the building. They peeked through doorways, their voices hushed with admiration.

"Is that Nathaniel Falcon? He's even more striking in person!"

Nathaniel ignored them, his expression unreadable.

Dominic appeared, murmuring, "Sir, shall we handle this discreetly? The Falcons and Ashfords have ties. A word from you could retract the expulsion demand."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Harrison had been at Willowridge University for barely two days and already caused an uproar.

Then, as if sensing her gaze, he turned.

His intense stare made Harrison flinch. She hastily stepped aside. "Mr. Falcon, please come in."

Nathaniel strode into the dorm.

It was his first time in a girls' dorm. The space was a riot of pastels—peach-colored bedding, pop star posters, and an overwhelming air of youthful femininity. A stark contrast to his own austere world.
###Chapter 124

Harrison had been staying here since moving out of the Falcon family estate.

Nathaniel's gaze swept across Harrison's small bed. The linens were perfectly arranged, but her silk camisole lay discarded carelessly after her shower.

His eyes flickered over it before shifting to the young woman behind him.

Harrison attempted to explain. "I hit Julian today because—"

"Harrison," Nathaniel interrupted sharply. "I enrolled you at Willowridge University to study medicine, not to sleep through lectures and pick fights. You might never match Isabella's excellence, but must you constantly cause trouble? The Ashfords are demanding your expulsion! I don't have time to keep fixing your mistakes."

His bottled-up frustration finally exploded in a torrent of harsh words.

Harrison stood motionless, absorbing each cutting remark while watching his barely contained rage.

He clearly had no interest in her side of the story.

To him, she remained nothing but a perpetual disappointment—unworthy of his time or attention, unlike perfect Isabella.

The same man who'd let Isabella feed him grapes and sip wine from her fingers in The Velvet Lounge's private room last night now stood before Harrison, cold and impatient.

Isabella was his beloved.

Harrison was his burden.

Her clear eyes met his. "Mr. Falcon, I apologize for wasting your time."

Nathaniel froze momentarily, caught off guard.

A faint smile touched Harrison's lips. "I don't know why Mr. Thornton contacted you, but I'll handle it. You're not my guardian. Please don't concern yourself with me anymore."

She moved toward the door. "You may leave now."

Nathaniel's fury erupted. In one swift motion, he seized her slender wrist. "Harrison, what kind of attitude is this?"

She struggled against his grip but couldn't break free. Nathaniel stepped back, his knee hitting the bed. Suddenly, he pulled her down with him, and they tumbled onto the mattress.

Harrison's bed enveloped them in her soft, floral scent—a fragrance Nathaniel knew intimately from their two previous encounters.

Since Harrison left Rosewood Manor, he'd been sleeping in his office lounge. Now, unexpectedly surrounded by her familiar aroma again, his body tensed.

As she fell, Harrison's delicate frame pressed against his muscular form. Her freshly washed hair cascaded around them, the floral shampoo sending an electric jolt through Nathaniel.

His muscles locked instantly. His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard.

Harrison gasped, realizing their compromising position—her straddling him, just like their previous encounters.

Who would've guessed she kept ending up on top?

Her small hands scrambled to push off his chest.

But Nathaniel gripped her wrist, holding her in place. His voice dropped to a dangerous rasp. "Harrison, watch where you put your hands."

Her pale fingers, stiff from the sudden fall, had landed squarely on his sculpted abs.

"I—" Words failed her.

Nathaniel pulled her closer, his exhausted gaze fixed on the ceiling as he murmured, "Harrison, why can't you just behave?"
###Chapter 125

"Harrison, why must you always be so difficult?"

Nathaniel's deep voice rumbled through the room, sending an unexpected shiver down Harrison's spine.

He genuinely wanted her compliance.

During their three-year marriage, while she'd cared for him in his coma, he'd repaid her with extravagant material comforts. Sending her to Willowridge University was meant to be their final transaction.

Yet she remained defiant. Last night's "Goddess of Slumber" incident at The Velvet Lounge had irritated him. Now today's classroom brawl forced him to attend this disciplinary meeting as her guardian.

Nathaniel never dealt with such trivial matters.

The young woman straddling him suddenly spoke. "You don't actually want obedience."

What?

Harrison pushed against his sculpted chest, sitting upright. Her sparkling eyes locked onto his chiseled features as a knowing smirk played on her lips. "Don't pretend, Nathaniel. You prefer...troublemakers."

His aristocratic features darkened instantly. That innocent face shouldn't be saying such provocative things.

Harrison held his gaze, her eyes deliberately trailing downward to linger on his sensual mouth. "I saw everything last night outside the private room. How Isabella fed you wine. How much you enjoyed it."

Her bold stare burned with challenge.

Nathaniel had sensed her presence. Though he hadn't spotted her when glancing back, she'd clearly witnessed everything.

"You demand obedience while chasing after wild women? Hypocrite." Harrison moved to dismount.

Her slipper slipped off, forcing her to remain seated on the bed.

Now Nathaniel lay sprawled across her peach-colored sheets, his bespoke black suit clashing provocatively with the childish heart patterns.

Harrison stretched her bare foot, nudging his thigh. "Get off my bed!"

Nathaniel's glare could freeze fire. "Do that again, Harrison."

As you wish.

She delivered another sharp kick without hesitation.

Her delicate foot, with its soft pink toes, brushed against his tailored trousers. Nathaniel's gaze ignited with something dangerous.

In one swift motion, he captured her ankle. "Isabella may be wild, but you're downright wicked."

Isabella's flirtations were obvious. Harrison's? Subtle and devastating - impossible to resist.
Last night involved simple wine feeding. Today? Bedroom assaults.

Isabella couldn't compare.

This was precisely why Nathaniel wanted to sever ties. He needed to reject Harrison's advances.

His dark eyes studied her. Fresh from her shower, she wore only a thin camisole with a beige shawl slipping off one shoulder, revealing delicate straps.

Her flawless skin glowed with post-shower radiance. No makeup enhanced her natural beauty - just dewy skin and naturally rosy lips radiating youthful innocence.

Isabella with her heavy makeup and smudged lipstick paled in comparison. Last night's smeared cosmetics had actually killed his mood.

Harrison remained silent.

She was clever. Everything came naturally to her - including manipulating men.

Yet nothing she did appealed to him.

His heart belonged only to Isabella.
###Chapter 126
Nathaniel chose to drop the issue.

His fingers had accidentally brushed against Harrison's bare foot—a particularly sensitive spot for any woman. She jerked back immediately, her voice sharp as a blade. "Release me!"

Realizing his mistake, Nathaniel met her furious gaze and instantly let go.

Her pale foot disappeared beneath the folds of her skirt like a startled bird retreating to safety.

Nathaniel straightened, forcing his attention back to the matter at hand. "I'll have someone take care of this for you—"

Harrison curled tighter on the bed, shaking her head. "I appreciate the offer, but it's unnecessary."

His eyes narrowed. "Don't be stubborn, Harrison. Do you think I enjoy cleaning up your messes?"

"Then don't," she snapped, her tone unyielding. "The moment you threw me out of Falcon Estate, my problems ceased to be your concern!"

The air between them crackled with tension. Nathaniel's temper flared.

Harrison arched a delicate brow, her sharp gaze sweeping over him. "Didn't Isabella satisfy you last night?"

Nathaniel froze.

"If she did, why are you here?" Harrison pressed, her voice laced with venom. "Just another excuse to make me indebted to you, isn't it?"

That night—the storm, the secrecy between them—flashed through his mind. He'd helped her once, and she'd repaid him in ways that still haunted him.

His expression darkened. He stood abruptly. "I must have lost my mind coming here."

With one last icy glare, he turned and strode toward the door, his long legs carrying him away without another word.

As the door slammed shut, Harrison hugged her knees to her chest.

Good. He should stay out of her life. No more false kindness, no more twisted favors. She didn’t need his pity.

The door creaked open again. Rosalind slipped inside, frowning. "Harrison, why did Mr. Falcon leave so soon? He came all this way, and you didn’t even try to keep him here. Are you really handing him over to Isabella?"

Rosalind had discreetly left earlier to give them privacy.

Harrison knew exactly what her friend had been hoping for. She gave a bitter smile. "It's pointless, Rosalind. He'll never choose me."

Rosalind opened her mouth to argue, but Harrison cut her off. "Right now, we have bigger problems to handle."

Rosalind's eyes brightened. "You have a plan?"

Of course she did.

Harrison didn’t need Nathaniel's help. She never had.

Swinging her legs off the bed, Harrison gathered her dark hair into a loose bun, exposing the elegant curve of her neck. She turned to Rosalind with a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Let's go."

Rosalind blinked. "Go where?"

Harrison smirked. "To deal with Julian Ashford."

Rosalind laughed. When Harrison had stopped her in Gregory's office earlier—gripping her wrist, urging patience—she'd known her friend had something brewing.

"Perfect. Let's do this!"

Nathaniel slid into the backseat of his Rolls-Royce, jaw clenched. Dominic, his driver, glanced at his stormy expression and ventured carefully, "Mr. Falcon, how should we handle Mrs. Falcon's situation?"

Nathaniel's voice was glacial. "Leave her to it. She can handle her own problems."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Once Willowridge University finally kicks her out, I'll wait for her to come crawling back, begging for my help."

Dominic wisely stayed silent.

Another fight, then.

A notification pinged. Dominic checked his phone, then stiffened.

"Mr. Falcon—there's been a development in Mrs. Falcon's case!"
###Chapter 127

In Nathaniel's office, Julian Ashford strutted in with his parents flanking him. The moment his eyes landed on Harrison and Rosalind, freshly cleaned up, he couldn't help but feel a flicker of attraction.

Harrison's delicate features, pale and luminous, looked as if they had been sculpted from fine porcelain. There was an undeniable purity about her that drew him in. Despite everything, he still wanted her to be his girlfriend.

Arabella had only instructed him to cause trouble for Harrison, not to pursue her. Julian couldn't fathom why—with his charm, his wealth—she remained uninterested. Her humble background didn’t bother him, so what gave her the right to reject him?

When he parked his luxury car beneath the girls' dormitory, women usually fawned over him. Harrison’s resistance was baffling.

With a smug smirk, Julian sneered, "Harrison, scared yet? You’ve barely been at Willowridge University for two days, and now you’re about to get expelled. Maybe if you apologize now, we can still work something out."

Beatrice Ashford clutched Julian’s arm. "Julian, she beat you up like that! Don’t let her off easy. She should be expelled from Willowridge!"

Reginald Ashford turned to Gregory Thornton. "Mr. Thornton, how do you plan to handle this?"

Before Gregory could respond, Harrison spoke calmly. "Mr. Thornton, what should be done when a student harasses female classmates and threatens their safety?"

Julian scoffed. "Harrison, are you seriously accusing me of harassment? Where’s your proof?"

He was certain she had none.

Then Harrison slowly pulled out her phone and played a video. It captured everything—from Julian and his lackeys appearing on the scene to the moment they grabbed her and Rosalind. Every detail was crystal clear.

Julian’s face paled. "You recorded it?"

Harrison smiled faintly, confidence radiating from her. "You asked for proof, Mr. Ashford. Here it is."

Julian stood frozen. He hadn’t expected her to be so prepared.

Harrison’s sharp, piercing gaze locked onto him, her eyes gleaming with intelligence and defiance.

Gregory’s expression darkened. "Julian, so you led a group to harass female students, started the fight, and now you’re playing the victim after losing?"

Julian clenched his jaw, wishing Gregory would stop mentioning his humiliating defeat.

Rosalind, who had been silently observing, smirked. "Mr. Thornton, I think the best course of action is to call the police."

"No! Don’t call the police!" Beatrice shot up from her seat, clearly panicked about her son’s record.

Harrison arched a brow. "Weren’t you trying to get us expelled?"

Reginald waved a dismissive hand. "We were joking! Let’s just drop this. Forget it ever happened!"

He grabbed Julian’s arm and began dragging him out.

Julian seethed. "Dad, so I just took a beating for nothing?"

Reginald smacked the back of his head. "Shut up!"

With that, Reginald and Beatrice hauled Julian out of the office.

The farce was over. Rosalind gave Harrison a thumbs-up, and Harrison flashed her a radiant smile in return.

Outside, Nathaniel had been watching the entire scene unfold.

Dominic stood behind him, grinning. "Looks like Mrs. Falcon had a trick up her sleeve."

Then, with a smirk, Dominic muttered, "Julian really has some nerve. Thinking he could just make Mrs. Falcon his girlfriend? Ridiculous."

He turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, you misunderstood her."

Yes, Nathaniel had misunderstood.

She wasn’t disobedient. She wasn’t picking fights. She was defending herself. Julian was the one who had targeted her.

Nathaniel watched as Harrison beamed at Rosalind, her energy vibrant and alive.
###Chapter 128

Earlier in the girls' dorm, Harrison had attempted to explain herself to Nathaniel.

He cut her off before she could even start. His angry rant left no room for her defense. By the time he finished, the sparkle had vanished from her eyes.

Nathaniel felt a brief pang of regret.

But it disappeared as quickly as it came, replaced by a derisive snort. Harrison had brought this upon herself. She'd barely settled into Willowridge University when that notorious playboy Julian Ashford started pursuing her.

Nathaniel had seen the hunger in Julian's gaze. As a man, he recognized it instantly - this wasn't mere interest. Julian was genuinely smitten.

If Harrison had simply apologized and acted cute, Julian would have forgiven her immediately. Nathaniel's intervention wouldn't have been necessary.

The thought darkened his mood further.

This little vixen... she attracted men like moths to a flame. He hadn't sent her here to date. She was supposed to be studying.

If she dared get involved in any romantic entanglements, he'd make sure she regretted it!

His sharp gaze turned to his secretary. "Dominic, you seem quite fond of Harrison, don't you?"

Dominic had been showing her favoritism for weeks now.

Dominic immediately stiffened. "Mr. Falcon, I simply believe Mrs. Falcon... is perfectly suited for you."

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cold smirk.

More and more people around him were favoring Harrison. What spell had she cast on everyone?

After ending her call with Isabella, Arabella checked the time. Harrison should have been packing her bags by now, expelled from Willowridge University.

Just then, she spotted Julian. His parents were ushering him into their luxury car, all three looking utterly defeated.

"Mr. Ashford!" Arabella called out, shocked. She hurried forward. "Mr. Ashford, why are you leaving? Shouldn't Harrison be the one going?"

Had something gone wrong? Was there a mistake?

Ding!

Her phone buzzed with a notification from the Willowridge University forum. The new post was titled: [Campus Bully Gets Brutal Comeuppance After Sexual Harassment Attempt].

Attached was a six-second video showing Harrison yanking Julian's hair, slamming him to the ground, and delivering punch after punch.

The post went viral instantly, flooding with comments.

[OMG! Is that Julian Ashford getting his ass kicked?]

[I can't help but laugh! Usually it's Julian beating others up. First time seeing him get destroyed!]

[Wait - that's the Sleep Goddess Harrison doing the beating?]

[Damn, Harrison looks absolutely stunning! Like an actual goddess!]

[She's way more beautiful than our so-called campus belle Arabella.]

[New campus belle alert! Move over Arabella, Harrison's taking the crown!]

Arabella's eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets. The situation had completely backfired.

Not only was Harrison not expelled, but Julian had fled in disgrace.

The entire incident was trending on the school forum, with Harrison being celebrated for taking down the campus bully.

Worse yet, Harrison's beauty was now being compared to hers, threatening Arabella's status as campus belle.

This couldn't stand.

Arabella immediately logged into her alternate account "Helen's Rival" and posted:

[Harrison doesn't hold a candle to Arabella! Arabella isn't just beautiful - she's kind-hearted and an incredible dancer. Harrison's just some country bumpkin who can't compare!]
###Chapter 129
Arabella quickly logged into her second backup account, "The Dancer," and pretended to engage with her first backup account, "Helen's Rival."

She typed, "Absolutely! If someone like Harrison, who sleeps through lectures, becomes the campus belle, it would be ridiculous. Arabella is still unmatched!"

Then she switched back to her main account, "Arabella Falcon," and posted:
"Everyone, let's not argue. I think Harrison is lovely. I'd be happy to pass the title of campus belle to her!"

Arabella was expertly managing three accounts, playing three different roles to control the narrative. Losing her status as Willowridge University's most beautiful girl wasn't an option.

As expected, her loyal followers—mostly awkward, devoted boys—flooded the comments.

One wrote, "Harrison is pretty, but Arabella deserves the title. She's in a league of her own!"

Another added, "Arabella is my goddess. No one could ever replace her."

A third chimed in, "I'll always stand by Arabella, no matter what!"

To the outside world, Arabella was the epitome of charm and allure, especially when she turned on her sweet, flirtatious act for male attention. Her ample curves ensured she never lacked admirers.

The Willowridge University forum gradually quieted, and the debate over the campus belle title faded. Clearly, Harrison, the so-called "God of Sleep," wasn’t worthy.

Arabella had successfully defended her crown.

Frustrated, she clenched her phone, her nails digging into her palm. Her manipulation of Julian Ashford had backfired spectacularly. Not only had she nearly lost her status, but Harrison had almost ruined everything.

It felt like she’d tripped over her own schemes—painful and humiliating.

Just then, her phone buzzed with a call from Isabella.

"Isabella," Arabella answered, forcing lightness into her voice.

Isabella’s excited voice crackled through the line. "Arabella! Any updates? Has Harrison been expelled yet? I can’t wait to tell Sebastian and the others—we’ll finally have a good laugh!"

Arabella exhaled sharply. "No, Isabella. Harrison is still here."

"What?!" Isabella’s shriek was sharp enough to make Arabella wince.

Before she could explain, a smooth, melodic voice cut in. "Arabella, I hate to disappoint you."

Arabella looked up to see Harrison standing there, a serene smile on her lips, Rosalind Fairchild at her side.

Without hesitation, Arabella ended the call and glared at Harrison, venom dripping from her voice. "Harrison, you don’t belong here. I will make sure you’re gone."

Harrison’s smile didn’t falter. "I look forward to seeing you try."

Arabella’s retort died in her throat as a tall, commanding figure approached—Nathaniel.

She seized his arm. "Nathaniel, you never should have brought her here!"

Nathaniel’s gaze flicked to Harrison, meeting her clear, unshaken eyes.

Just then, the sharp click of heels echoed through the hall.

"Mr. Falcon, Arabella is right," a crisp voice declared. "You never should have let Harrison step foot in Willowridge."

Harrison turned to see Penelope.

Gone was the disheveled woman from the banquet. Today, Penelope was polished—a sleek black dress hugging her figure, crystal heels glinting, confidence radiating from her.

Willowridge was Penelope’s alma mater, and her return sent whispers rippling through the crowd. As Dr. Sinclair’s protégée, her presence was electric.

Students immediately pulled out their phones, snapping pictures.

"Look! Penelope is back!"

"She spent two years abroad, assisting in groundbreaking surgeries. And now—she’s working with Dr. Sinclair!"

"The legendary Dr. Sinclair?!"

"The one and only!"

"Penelope is Willowridge’s pride!"
###Chapter 130

"Absolutely! Didn't you notice Dean Whitmore himself came to welcome her?"

All eyes turned to Penelope with a mixture of awe and jealousy.

Penelope had arrived with Alistair, chin lifted at a haughty angle that gave her the appearance of a preening swan. The sheer confidence emanating from her made her seem untouchable, her presence commanding the space around her.

As Penelope and Alistair paused, her gaze first landed on Harrison. She gave her a dismissive once-over before shifting her attention to Nathaniel.

"Mr. Falcon, Harrison dropped out at sixteen. Rumor has it she sleeps through Dean Whitmore's lectures. What exactly qualifies her for Willowridge University?"

Arabella seized the moment, nodding vigorously. "Exactly!"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable as always. He glanced at Harrison before responding, "She'll apply herself here."

Arabella opened her mouth again. She'd heard Harrison only got into Willowridge because Nathaniel personally intervened with Alistair. He'd never made such a request for anyone else - Harrison was the sole exception. The thought burned in her chest.

But before she could speak, Alistair cut in, his tone firm. "That's enough. I trust Harrison will take her studies seriously from now on."

Alistair clearly had to step in for his nephew. At his words, Arabella fell silent.

Alistair's demeanor shifted as he announced excitedly, "I have important news - Dr. Sinclair is coming!"

Dr. Sinclair was coming?

A subtle change flickered across Nathaniel's face. He and the renowned doctor had missed each other twice already. Now the legendary physician was coming to Willowridge?

Arabella, who idolized Dr. Sinclair, leaned forward eagerly. "Dean Whitmore, is this true?"

Penelope smiled knowingly. "Of course. Dr. Sinclair is giving a lecture at Willowridge. We'll finally meet the doctor in person."

Dr. Sinclair had always been an enigma, disappearing for three years. Few had ever seen the medical prodigy face-to-face.

Arabella grew even more excited. "Dean Whitmore, are you Dr. Sinclair's apprentice?"

Alistair seemed lost in memory as he began recounting, "Years ago, a rare plague struck Santorina. The WHO sent me to develop a vaccine. There was one medical equation I couldn't solve no matter how I tried. One day, frustrated, I went for a walk. When I returned, the equation was solved - by Dr. Sinclair."

He paused, smiling. "I didn't even know Dr. Sinclair was there at the time. When I went looking, they'd already left. But I got their contact from the staff."

"I messaged them and was fortunate enough to become their apprentice."

The group listened, captivated.

Suddenly, Arabella turned to Penelope. "If Dean Whitmore is Dr. Sinclair's apprentice, and you're his apprentice, what's your connection to Dr. Sinclair?"

Penelope opened her mouth, but a melodic voice interrupted. "She's Dr. Sinclair's grand-apprentice."

Penelope froze. She looked up at Harrison, who had spoken unexpectedly.

Harrison stood composed, her bright eyes sparkling with amusement as she added, "When Dr. Sinclair arrives, you should greet them properly."

Penelope was speechless.

Sensing the tension, Alistair cleared his throat. He turned to Harrison. "Harrison, what happened with Julian wasn't your fault. I'll handle it."

Harrison met his gaze steadily and nodded. "I trust you, Alistair. I know you'll take care of it."
###Chapter 131

Alistair froze. Who was Harrison calling "Alistair"?

Who was this Alistair?

Wait—he was Alistair. But she shouldn't address him like that!

He opened his mouth to speak, but Harrison quickly scanned the room before turning on her heel and walking away.

Rosalind stifled a laugh, then shot Alistair a glance before hurrying after Harrison. "Harrison, wait for me!"

Arabella and Penelope gasped in unison. "Professor Whitmore, did Harrison just call you by your first name? Has she completely lost her mind?"

They were stunned.

Alistair was equally dumbfounded. This was the second time this had happened. He had no idea why Harrison addressed him so casually.

Did she have no sense of respect or boundaries? Only his mentor, Dr. Sinclair, had the privilege of calling him by his first name.

And then she had the audacity to say she trusted him to handle things—as if he needed her reassurance!

Nathaniel watched as Harrison disappeared around the corner, his brow furrowing slightly. She truly was fearless, speaking to his uncle with such familiarity.

At that moment, Dominic stepped forward, pulling Nathaniel back to the present. "Mr. Falcon, your dinner reservation with Ms. Isabella is at seven tonight. We should head back now."

Now that they had reconciled, Nathaniel had planned a romantic evening with Isabella. He turned to Alistair. "When does Dr. Sinclair's lecture begin?"

"Tomorrow morning," Alistair replied.

Nathaniel nodded. "I'll be there. I want to see for myself who this Dr. Sinclair really is."

Meanwhile, Harrison and Rosalind walked toward the girls' dormitory, the latter barely containing her laughter.

"Harrison, you actually called my—I mean, Professor Whitmore—by his first name. I'm dying!"

Harrison didn't see anything wrong with it.

Then she spotted a familiar figure ahead and froze mid-step.

"Excuse me, does Harrison live here?" the woman asked.

The dorm supervisor nodded. "Yes. Are you looking for her?"

"I am. I'm her grandmother."

"Oh my! Your granddaughter is absolutely stunning."

"Doesn't she? She looks like an angel descended from heaven."

Harrison's breath caught in her throat before she rushed forward. "Grandma!"

Eleanor had arrived.

Eleanor turned with a radiant smile. "Harrison!"

Harrison threw her arms around her. "Grandma, what are you doing here?"

She never expected Eleanor to come to campus.

Eleanor chuckled warmly. "Harrison, it's been two days since you last visited. Didn't you miss me?"

Harrison's eyes welled up. She buried her face in Eleanor's shoulder, nuzzling gently. "I did."

"I missed you too, darling. So I came to see you! No fancy car, no extravagant clothes—just me. I didn’t want to embarrass you."

Eleanor had dressed simply but elegantly, her silver hair neatly styled, trying not to draw attention.

Harrison's heart swelled. That night, she had said those things to reassure Eleanor, never imagining her grandmother would actually visit.

She hugged Eleanor tighter, overwhelmed with gratitude.

"Harrison, how are you adjusting to Willowridge University? Have you made any friends?" Eleanor asked, concerned.

Just then, Rosalind stepped forward with a bright smile. "Hello!"

Eleanor blinked in surprise. "Bebe—?"

"Who's Bebe? I'm Rosalind Fairchild! Harrison's roommate and best friend. She's wonderful—everyone adores her!" Rosalind winked subtly, hoping Eleanor wouldn’t reveal her true identity.
###Chapter 132

Eleanor caught on instantly. "Oh splendid! Now I can breathe easy."

Harrison was practically floating with joy. She linked arms with Eleanor. "Grandmother, you never leave the estate. Let me show you around town."

Eleanor's face brightened. "What a marvelous idea! I adore outings."

Harrison and Rosalind escorted Eleanor down the bustling avenue when they passed a trendy smoothie bar.

Rosalind's eyes lit up. "Harrison, we must try their new ube flavor! It's divine."

Harrison nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely."

Eleanor studied them curiously. "You girls are getting smoothies?"

Harrison knew some elders disapproved of such treats. She quickly explained, "Grandmother, an occasional smoothie isn't harmful—"

"Could you order me one? The strawberry with sprinkles looks delightful," Eleanor interrupted, pressing her nose against the glass display.

Harrison froze in shock. Eleanor was practically bouncing with excitement like a schoolgirl.

Rosalind and Harrison exchanged amused glances before bursting into laughter.

Having a youthful, adventurous elder was unexpectedly refreshing.

Harrison waved to the cashier. "One strawberry smoothie with sprinkles for my grandmother, please!"

Meanwhile at The Grand Celeste, the maître d' greeted Nathaniel and Isabella. "Mr. Falcon, Ms. Whitmore, right this way."

Nathaniel had arranged an intimate candlelit dinner.

Dressed in a tailored charcoal suit, he cut an imposing figure. Isabella shimmered in champagne-colored silk, the picture of sophistication. They made a striking pair.

Soft piano melodies filled the elegant dining room.

Seated by the panoramic windows, the maître d' pulled out Isabella's chair. She smiled warmly. "Nathaniel, I heard about Harrison's altercation at Willowridge today."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Let's not discuss her tonight."

He couldn't bear thinking about Harrison.

Though Isabella failed to get Harrison expelled, Nathaniel's reaction satisfied her.

"Of course." Isabella raised her wine glass. "To us."

Nathaniel pushed thoughts of Harrison away, his irritation rising. He lifted his glass to meet Isabella's.

Just before their glasses touched, he froze.

Through the restaurant's spotless windows, he spotted something across the street. At the smoothie bar, an elderly woman sipped a strawberry drink with childlike glee, her cheeks puffing adorably.

Nathaniel's grip tightened on his glass. Was that... his grandmother?

The woman moved out of view. Nathaniel shook his head. Impossible.

Eleanor never left Rosewood Manor. That woman's casual attire and lack of chauffeur proved it couldn't be her.

Most telling? Eleanor would never drink something as common as a smoothie.

"Nathaniel? Is everything alright?" Isabella asked.

He snapped back to reality. Must be stress making him imagine things. "Nothing."

Outside, Harrison guided Eleanor away from the smoothie bar. Their next stop?

A luxury foot spa.
###Chapter 133

Eleanor gazed up at the neon-lit "Serenity Foot Spa" sign while sipping her strawberry smoothie. "Harrison, what exactly is this establishment?"

Rosalind smirked and winked. "They say all stress melts away with a good massage. Grandma, Rosalind, my treat today!"

The trio marched in with confidence, immediately greeted by the spa's beaming manager.

Harrison flashed a charming smile. "We'll take three male therapists - your tallest and most handsome ones, please."

"Absolutely, ladies," the manager gushed. "Right this way to our VIP section."

Meanwhile at The Grand Celeste, Nathaniel and Isabella were enjoying an intimate candlelit dinner when his phone buzzed violently. The caller ID showed Falcon Estate.

Nathaniel answered to hear Reginald's panicked voice. "Sir! We have an emergency!"

His expression darkened. "Explain."

"Mrs. Eleanor is missing!"

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the phone. "Since when?"

"I stepped out briefly this afternoon. When I returned, she was gone... Lately she's been constantly asking about Mrs. Harrison - if she's safe at university, if anyone's bothering her. Could she have gone to find her?"

A realization struck Nathaniel. Through the restaurant's floor-to-ceiling windows, his gaze locked onto the smoothie shop across the street - conveniently located near Willowridge University.

That elderly woman he'd seen earlier wasn't just any senior citizen - it was his grandmother!

He ended the call and stood abruptly.

Isabella looked up in confusion. "Nathaniel? What's wrong?"

"Grandmother emergency," he clipped. "You'll need to get home alone tonight."

Without another word, he strode away, leaving Isabella fuming. Was Eleanor sabotaging her intentionally?

Just when she thought she was making progress with Nathaniel - first interrupted by that Rosalind yesterday, now this!

Nathaniel arrived at the spa within minutes, where Dominic reported quietly, "Sir, Mrs. Harrison brought Mrs. Eleanor and Miss Rosalind here."

Nathaniel's eyes traveled up to the glowing "Serenity Foot Spa" sign. "What sort of place is this?"

Dominic shifted uncomfortably. "Well..."

"Spit it out," Nathaniel commanded.

Dominic wiped his brow. "It's... a therapeutic massage parlor, sir."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched.

So Harrison had brought his grandmother and Rosalind for massages?

He stormed into the building, his imposing frame commanding immediate attention. The manager approached eagerly. "Welcome, handsome! Here for a-"

A team of black-suited bodyguards materialized, cutting her off. Nathaniel strode past as every head turned, the manager gaping at his aristocratic bearing that outshone even their premium staff.

In VIP Room 303, the door swung open to reveal the scene: Harrison, Eleanor and Rosalind lounging comfortably while three strikingly handsome male therapists kneaded their feet.

Harrison looked up, cheeks flushed with delight. "Grandma, how's the massage? Heavenly, isn't it?"
###Chapter 134

Eleanor took another sip of her strawberry milkshake, her lips curling into a contented smile.
"Absolutely divine."

Her gaze then drifted to the attractive young masseur across from her. "How old might you be, young man?"

The therapist flashed a charming grin. "Eighteen, ma'am."

Eleanor arched an eyebrow in amusement. "No wonder men never outgrow their preference for eighteen-year-olds. Apparently, neither do eighty-year-old women."

Peals of laughter filled the luxurious spa room.

Harrison and Rosalind joined in the mirth, the air buzzing with feminine camaraderie.

Dominic, who had come to warn Harrison about something urgent, paused at the doorway. Hearing their lively banter, he immediately turned on his heel. Some battles weren't worth fighting - Harrison would have to handle this herself.

Nathaniel stood frozen in the entrance, veins visibly pulsing at his temples. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined finding his dignified grandmother sipping a milkshake while receiving a foot massage from a teenage boy!

A tempest of fury darkened his expression as his glare zeroed in on the obvious instigator - Harrison!

Had she completely lost her mind?

He thought their disastrous marriage had reached its conclusion, that they'd finally go their separate ways. Yet here she was, continually disrupting his life like a hurricane tearing through his carefully constructed world.

Meanwhile, Harrison remained blissfully unaware. She reclined on the plush chaise lounge, a silk sleep mask covering her eyes as the handsome masseur worked magic on her delicate feet. Her toes curled in pleasure, like a contented kitten being pampered.

Nathaniel's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists. A humorless laugh escaped his lips. He remembered how she'd recoiled when he'd once touched those same feet in her dorm room, hastily hiding them beneath her skirt.

What a hypocrite.

Rosalind was the first to notice Nathaniel's imposing figure in the doorway. Her eyes widened in panic as she bolted upright. "M-Mr. Falcon?!"

Eleanor froze mid-sip, her milkshake cup trembling slightly. "Nathaniel?"

Harrison, still masked, waved a dismissive hand. "Don't be ridiculous. Nathaniel would never set foot in a place like this. He's probably wining and dining Isabella at some Michelin-starred restaurant right now."

Before she could continue, a large hand yanked off her sleep mask. Nathaniel's stormy expression loomed inches from her face.

Harrison gasped, her eyes widening like saucers.

Nathaniel's voice dripped with icy venom. "Shoes. Now. Out."

Harrison scrambled off the chaise so quickly she nearly tripped. Moments later, the three women stood in a neat row in the hallway like misbehaving schoolgirls awaiting punishment.

They exchanged nervous glances, shoulders hunched under Nathaniel's withering glare.

"Whose brilliant idea was this?" he demanded through gritted teeth.

Eleanor and Rosalind immediately pointed at Harrison.

Harrison sighed internally. So much for female solidarity.

Rosalind cleared her throat. "Mr. Falcon, I just remembered I have a thesis deadline. I should really get back to campus." She practically sprinted down the hall.

Eleanor gave an awkward chuckle. "Nathaniel dear, it's past my bedtime. Dominic, would you be a darling and escort me home?" She vanished before Nathaniel could respond.

Suddenly, the corridor contained only Nathaniel and a very nervous Harrison.

Harrison mustered her most innocent smile. "Well, Mr. Falcon, I should probably—"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel's iron grip closed around her wrist, yanking her back. His voice was dangerously low. "Did I say you could leave?"

###Chapter 135

Nathaniel didn't give Harrison permission to leave, but she refused to stay. She twisted her wrist, trying to break free from his iron grip.

His long fingers only tightened, dragging her forward against her will.

"Nathaniel, stop this! Let me go! Where are you taking me?"

His powerful strides forced Harrison to nearly trip as she struggled to match his pace.

He hauled her out of the spa and shoved her into his Bentley Continental. Thirty minutes later, the car screeched to a halt outside Falcon Enterprises' headquarters. He yanked her through the glass doors.

The tech department was working overtime that evening. Employees reaching for coffee froze when they saw their formidable CEO storm in with the breathtaking Harrison.

Fatigue vanished instantly as jaws dropped. "Mr. Falcon?"

Nathaniel ignored them completely, pulling Harrison into his private office.

The whispers exploded immediately. "Is that Mrs. Falcon? Good lord, she's gorgeous!"

Someone snapped a photo that spread through company chats like wildfire.

"Isn't she the one who got Mr. Falcon summoned to campus after that brawl?"

"Far more stunning than Isabella."

"Well, that's why she's Mrs. Falcon and Isabella is just...Isabella."

"Looks like trouble again. Mr. Falcon's furious. She's about to get an earful."

"Match made in heaven! I ship them so hard!"

Inside the office, Nathaniel threw Harrison against the wall. He ripped at his tie with violent frustration. "Harrison, explain yourself!"

He demanded answers.

Harrison felt trapped, confused how she'd been caught when he was supposed to be romancing Isabella tonight.

Her silence infuriated him. He loomed over her, his breathing ragged with sarcasm dripping from every word. "Did you take Beatrice out for ice cream?"

Listing her supposed crimes.

Harrison denied instantly. "We didn't have any ice cream."

Watching her lie so blatantly made his chest heave. "Did you take Beatrice for a spa treatment?"

"I..."

"Harrison, I've clearly underestimated you. What else are you hiding? First you can't behave, now you're corrupting Beatrice and Rosalind too!"

His roar made her delicate frame tremble. She lifted her chin defiantly, meeting his glare head-on.

"Why are you yelling? I haven't said a word about you and Isabella. So what if I took them to the spa?"

She actually dared to fight back!

Nathaniel slammed her against the floor-to-ceiling window, his muscular body pinning her in place. One hand closed around her throat, eyes blazing with fury. "Harrison, you're begging for punishment!"

Panic surged as Harrison gasped for air, clawing at his hand. "Release me..."

Nathaniel studied her angelic face, rage boiling hotter. How dare she disrupt his life and emotions?

And not an ounce of remorse!

His grip tightened. Harrison's vision blurred. Was he really going to choke her to death?

She knew he didn't love her, but did he hate her this much?

Harrison refused to die like this. Desperate, she rose on her toes and pressed her lips softly against his in a sudden kiss.

Nathaniel's entire body stiffened in shock.

Her warm, pliant lips lingered, then parted slightly as she kissed him again, tracing the outline of his cold mouth.
###Chapter 136

Nathaniel couldn't recall the last time his lips had touched Harrison's.

All he knew was the electric current shooting through his veins from that single kiss. She'd breached his defenses effortlessly, playful yet determined, like a kitten batting at yarn before decisively pouncing.

Heat flooded his body, rising from his spine to his skull. She might as well have stolen his soul.

His breathing grew ragged as he loomed over her, their bodies separated only by millimeters of charged air.

The realization that his body remembered her touch made him want to swear.

He hadn't been with Isabella. At his age, physical needs existed, but he'd always remained emotionally detached. Until Harrison.

That stormy night had awakened something primal in him. Now every contact with her reignited that hunger, an ache he couldn't suppress.

It was infuriating.

Nathaniel reluctantly withdrew his hand from her slender neck, allowing Harrison to gulp fresh air.

She squirmed beneath his weight. "Nathaniel, get off me!" Her palms pressed against his chest.

His bloodshot eyes narrowed as he braced himself against the window frame. "Are you certain you didn't drink a milkshake?" The lingering sweetness on her lips was undeniable.

Harrison immediately covered her mouth.

"Artificial sweeteners are unhealthy..."

"Homemade ones aren't harmful. One won't kill Grandmother."

Her lips carried both sweetness and a faint creaminess - whether from the drink or her natural essence, he couldn't tell.

Harrison possessed a youthful vibrancy that Isabella, for all her sophistication, lacked.

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to her kiss-swollen lips, then rose to meet her eyes.

What was he doing?

That kiss had been her desperate escape attempt, nothing more.

Yet here he was, wanting to taste her again.

The intensity of his stare made Harrison duck under his arm, putting two paces between them.

The charged atmosphere shattered like glass.

Nathaniel straightened his tie, composing himself.

"If there's nothing else, Mr. Falcon, I should return to campus," Harrison said, maintaining her distance.

"I didn't dismiss you."

A soft knock interrupted them. Dominic entered with a stack of papers. "The exam materials you requested, sir."

Exam papers?

Nathaniel dumped the stack in Harrison's lap. "You're completing these tonight."

Harrison gaped at the thick pile. Was he serious?

Did he even know who he was dealing with?

Tomorrow, she'd make him regret this. But tonight... she was trapped.

With a huff, she began working.

Nathaniel didn't glance her way again, burying himself in documents.

An hour slipped by unnoticed. When Nathaniel finally looked up, Harrison lay slumped over the desk, fast asleep.

Again?

Approaching silently, he froze at the sight of her completed papers...
###Chapter 137

All five exam papers lay completed on the desk.

Nathaniel snatched them up immediately, his eyes scanning each page. Harrison's elegant handwriting filled every line, each answer flawless.

This couldn't be real.

His breath caught. She'd finished five comprehensive exams in sixty minutes - all perfect scores.

How?

Nathaniel's suspicious gaze landed on the sleeping Harrison. "Dominic," he called sharply.

The office door swung open. "Mr. Falcon, how may I assist you?"

"I can't believe you'd dare pull this stunt right under my nose!"

Dominic blinked in confusion. "Sir? What have I done?"

Nathaniel slammed the papers down. "You gave Harrison the answers!"

Dominic paled. "That's impossible! I would never-"

Nathaniel cut him off. Explanations meant nothing to him now. No one could complete five perfect exams in one hour without cheating. Dominic had to be involved.

"Consider this month's salary forfeited. Don't let it happen again. Get out."

Shoulders slumped, Dominic exited, injustice burning in his chest.

Nathaniel had intended to wake Harrison and reprimand her properly. But seeing her peaceful sleeping face and noting the late hour, he changed his mind. Instead, he scooped her up gently and carried her to his private lounge.

He'd been using the lounge as his bedroom recently. Now he laid Harrison down on his own bed.

As he turned to leave, Harrison's arms suddenly snaked around his neck, pulling him down beside her.

After days apart, they shared a bed again.

Harrison's warm body curled against his chest, her small hands clinging to him. She nestled into his embrace with a contented sigh, drifting deeper into sleep.

Nathaniel froze. After their separation, her closeness felt foreign yet familiar. Still the same clingy girl.

Her grip was surprisingly strong.

He tried prying her hands loose. "Harrison, release me. We can't sleep together."

Isabella had forbidden him from sharing a bed with Harrison.

No response.

His efforts proved futile. Frustration and helplessness flickered across his handsome features.

Soon, drowsiness overtook him. One hand settled on Harrison's delicate shoulder as he pulled her closer, eyes closing.

At that moment, his silenced phone on the bedside table lit up. Isabella was calling.

The screen flashed repeatedly, the vibration silent against the wooden surface.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Nathaniel finally stirred.

Harrison still lay curled against him, breathing evenly.

He checked the time - nearly 8 AM. Unheard of for him, who normally rose at 6 sharp. Something about sleeping beside Harrison always made him oversleep.

Carefully, he tried extracting his arm.

Harrison immediately clung tighter, protesting with a soft whimper.

Nathaniel looked down at her porcelain face. "Harrison, I have work."

She buried her face deeper into his chest, wriggling slightly. "Hmm!"

That petulant sound - half protest, half plea - sent an unexpected jolt through him.

Against his better judgment, Nathaniel settled back onto the pillows.

He'd never seen this coquettish side of her before.

That playful pout made every muscle in his body tense.
###Chapter 138

Nathaniel knew he had to get up.

Gently disentangling his arm from Harrison's grasp, he slipped out of bed.

The cold shower helped clear his mind. He dressed swiftly in his signature black attire - shirt and trousers that accentuated his commanding presence.

Entering his office, he froze.

Isabella was already there, waiting.

She turned, crimson lips curling into a knowing smile. "Nathaniel, just waking up?"

It was 8 AM - unusually late for the always-punctual CEO. Nathaniel hesitated. He hadn't anticipated her early arrival.

Dominic rushed in, breathless. "Mr. Falcon, I was just at marketing. I didn't realize Ms. Isabella..."

His voice trailed off. Dominic knew Harrison was still in the lounge after spending the night there. Now with Isabella here... This was a powder keg waiting to explode.

Would there be hair-pulling? Screaming? Dominic didn't dare meet Nathaniel's gaze.

Isabella's sharp intuition caught the tension immediately. "What's happening? Am I unwelcome here?" Her eyes narrowed toward the lounge door. "Nathaniel, you're not hiding someone in there, are you?"

She moved toward the door with purpose.

Nathaniel blocked her path, his tall frame forming an immovable barrier.

"Why won't you let me in?" Isabella's voice turned sharp. "I called repeatedly last night. No answer. And now this?" Her accusatory tone hung in the air. "Were you with someone?"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly. His deep voice remained steady. "Isabella. Leave."

Leave? Never.

She shoved past him with surprising strength, throwing the lounge door open.

Dominic braced for disaster.

Isabella stormed in - then stopped dead.

Nathaniel followed her gaze. The bed stood empty. No sign of Harrison.

Gone.

Dominic blinked in confusion. Where had she disappeared to?

Seizing the moment, Dominic intervened smoothly. "Ms. Isabella, you've misunderstood. Mr. Falcon worked late and has an important meeting..."

A knock interrupted them. A manager entered with documents. "These require your signature, sir."

Isabella's suspicion evaporated. Of course Nathaniel wouldn't betray her. She'd let paranoia take over.

"Forgive me," she murmured, touching Nathaniel's arm. "I'll let you work."

She left with a final glance.

Once alone, Nathaniel scanned the empty lounge. Harrison couldn't have left - only one exit existed.

His sharp eyes landed on the wardrobe.

The door was shut... but not quite right.

###Chapter 139

Nathaniel yanked the wardrobe open.

There.

Curled in the corner, Harrison hugged her knees. Sleep-tousled dark hair framed her face. As light flooded in, her wide eyes met his - a startled doe caught in headlights.

The image struck him: a secret lover hiding from discovery.

His brow furrowed. "What are you doing?"

Harrison had woken to Isabella's voice. Last she remembered, she'd fallen asleep at the desk. Finding herself in Nathaniel's bed had been shock enough - then the approaching confrontation sent her scrambling for cover.

"Is she gone?" Harrison whispered.

Nathaniel said nothing.

Harrison tilted her head, lips quirking. "I hid when I saw her coming. Aren't I being good, Mr. Falcon?"

Good? Hardly.

She tried standing, but cramped legs betrayed her. She pitched forward - only to be caught by Nathaniel's strong grip.

Rubbing feeling back into her limbs, she murmured thanks.

His gaze lingered as she tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "Next time," his voice dropped, "don't hide unless told to. Understood?"

A shiver ran through her. As if she wanted to hide?

She was his wife. Isabella was the interloper here.

The absurdity stung.

"I feared she might hit me."

Nathaniel scoffed. "You? Afraid of her?"

This was the woman who'd bested Julian Ashford.

Harrison met his gaze squarely. "I could win. But I feared you'd help her."

The words hung between them.

"Tell me," she pressed, "if we fought, who would you choose?"

His silence spoke volumes.

Isabella. Always Isabella.

Harrison withdrew her arm from his grasp.

Nathaniel let his hand fall.

"How did I get here?" Harrison asked suddenly.

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "You fell asleep at the desk. Then you wandered in here and took my bed."

Her eyes widened. "Just me? Or... did we...?"

Innocent confusion filled her gaze. She truly didn't remember clinging to him, pressing close...

Perhaps it was better forgotten.

Nathaniel's lips curved mockingly. "Expecting something, Harrison? Believe me, I slept on the couch."
###Chapter 140

Harrison stood frozen, her lips parted in silent shock.

She'd expected nothing from him. Nathaniel would never touch her—Isabella had made sure of that.

Yet this deliberate humiliation cut deeper than she'd anticipated.

"Nathaniel, your hatred runs this deep? Fine. You'll never see me again."

She spun on her heel and stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

The air between them crackled with unresolved tension.

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he strode into his office, flipping through urgent documents.

Isabella swept in moments later. "Darling, when are we leaving for Willowridge University? Dr. Sinclair's lecture starts soon—this is our chance to finally meet him."

Her congenital heart condition made Dr. Sinclair her last hope. After two failed attempts, the renowned physician was finally making an appearance.

Nathaniel remembered the elusive doctor—a medical prodigy shrouded in mystery. He signed the last document and rose. "Let's go."

At Willowridge University, campus buzzed with excitement. Banners proclaimed [Welcome, Dr. Sinclair!] News crews jostled for position, cameras at the ready.

The lecture had become the social event of the season. Harrison checked her watch—she needed to get backstage.

Arabella and Penelope spotted her immediately.

Penelope's face twisted in contempt. "Harrison! What are you doing here? Don't you realize today's importance? We've been camped out all night waiting for Dr. Sinclair. Are you trying to sabotage this?"

Arabella smirked. "Why bother, Penelope? She'll probably doze off like always."

Harrison pressed her lips together, refusing to engage.

Isabella's melodic voice cut through the tension. "What's going on here?"

Harrison looked up to see Isabella approaching, Nathaniel's imposing frame beside her.

Arabella beamed. "Nathaniel! Isabella! You came!"

Isabella smiled warmly. "We wouldn't miss Dr. Sinclair's lecture."

Nathaniel's icy gaze locked onto Harrison, who immediately looked away.

Isabella tilted her head. "What were you discussing?"

Arabella opened her mouth, but Alistair's announcement boomed through the quad: "Dr. Sinclair's arrival imminent! Please proceed to the lecture hall."

Penelope grabbed Isabella's arm. "We shouldn't waste another second on Harrison. Dr. Sinclair awaits!"

Isabella shot Harrison a dismissive glance before threading her arm through Nathaniel's. "Shall we, darling?"

Nathaniel led the group toward the lecture hall without a backward glance.

Harrison stood alone, the dismissal stinging more than she cared to admit.

Her phone vibrated.

A message from Alistair:
[Dr. Sinclair, have you arrived?]

Harrison's lips curved.
[I'm here.]
###Chapter 141

Harrison slipped backstage. She'd requested Dominic to clear the area, leaving her completely alone in the dimly lit space.

She settled before the vanity mirror. Her raven-black hair was pulled into an elegant chignon, accentuating her graceful neckline. A swipe of lipstick was all she added to her flawless complexion.

Makeup had never been necessary for Harrison. Her porcelain skin and delicate features gave her an ethereal glow. The subtle enhancement only amplified her natural beauty.

Outside, Alistair's voice carried through the curtains. "Good afternoon, everyone."

Harrison rose and lifted the heavy drape slightly. The auditorium was packed beyond capacity, every seat filled with eager attendees. This was the most anticipated lecture of the year.

Camera flashes erupted like lightning across the room.

Alistair stood at the podium, adjusting his microphone. "We're gathered here today for..."

The crowd erupted in unison. "Dr. Sinclair!"

Alistair beamed. "Exactly. It's our immense privilege to host Dr. Sinclair here at Willowridge University today."

Harrison's gaze swept across the audience. Front and center sat Nathaniel - tall, imposing, his expression unreadable as always. To his left were Isabella and Penelope, to his right the university's senior faculty. Nathaniel always commanded the spotlight wherever he went.

Alistair practically vibrated with excitement as he announced, "Without further ado, please welcome Dr. Sinclair!"

Showtime.

Three years had passed since Harrison left as Mrs. Falcon. Now she returned as Dr. Sinclair.

She couldn't help anticipating Nathaniel's reaction when he saw her. Isabella and Arabella's expressions would be equally priceless. This moment would be unforgettable.

Harrison took a deep breath and stepped forward.

A sudden, searing pain exploded at the base of her skull. Darkness swallowed her vision as she crumpled to the floor.

Meanwhile, in the auditorium, Nathaniel sat rigidly in his front-row seat. Isabella whispered excitedly, "Nathaniel, we're finally going to meet Dr. Sinclair!"

The curtains began parting slowly. Nathaniel's sharp eyes fixed on the stage. But no one appeared.

No Dr. Sinclair.

Murmurs of confusion rippled through the crowd.

Penelope gasped. "Where is she? What's happening?"

Alistair looked equally bewildered. He'd just received confirmation that Dr. Sinclair had arrived backstage. Where had she gone?

"Please remain calm, everyone," Alistair said, struggling to regain control.

The audience buzzed with speculation. Nathaniel's phone vibrated - Rosalind calling urgently.

He stepped into the hallway to answer. Rosalind's panicked voice came through. "Nathaniel! It's Harrison!"

His jaw tightened. "What now?"

"I saw her being knocked out and dragged away! I couldn't catch the car, but it was Julian's men. Julian took Harrison!"

Julian took Harrison? Again?

First that bastard Vincent, now the notorious playboy Julian? How did she keep attracting these men?

A sharp pang of anger twisted in Nathaniel's chest. There was never a moment's peace with her.

"Nathaniel, you have to find her immediately! I think Julian has... intentions. If you don't act fast, you'll lose your wife!" Rosalind gasped between words.

She'd been searching for Harrison when she witnessed the abduction. The getaway car had vanished before she could intervene.

Nathaniel ended the call without responding.

Dominic approached. "Mr. Falcon, should we implement roadblocks like last time?"
###Chapter 142

Nathaniel's face was like stone. "Julian's car has unrestricted access throughout Willowbrook. Roadblocks won't stop him—we won't reach them in time."

"What's our move, Mr. Falcon?"

Nathaniel yanked out his phone and dialed Julian's father, Reginald.

The Falcons and Ashfords had ties spanning generations. He knew the old man well.

The call connected instantly. "Nathaniel? To what do I owe this unexpected call?"

Nathaniel's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled, his voice razor-sharp. "Your son kidnapped someone under my protection. Think carefully—does he own any secluded estates outside the city?"

Meanwhile, in a private villa on the outskirts, Harrison slowly blinked awake.

Her vision cleared to reveal an opulent bedroom—gilded mirrors, silk drapes, furniture that screamed wealth.

Where was she?

She shot upright.

"Harrison, you're finally awake?" A male voice cut through the silence.

Harrison whipped her head toward the sound. Julian stood nearby, smirking. Her dark eyes narrowed to slits. "Julian? What the hell is this?"

She'd planned to return as Dr. Sinclair today. Instead, Julian had ambushed her and dragged her here.

Julian chuckled. "What does it look like? After the beating you gave me, did you really think I'd let that slide?" Humiliation still burned in his chest. No way was he walking away from this.

Harrison's fingers twitched toward her waist—then froze.

Her outfit had changed. The backstage costume was gone, replaced by a thin white sundress. No silver needles. No medicinal pouches.

Julian suddenly dropped onto the bed beside her. "Here's the deal, Harrison. You have two choices. Either get on your knees and beg for forgiveness, or..."

His gaze raked over her face. The stage makeup made her look even more striking—porcelain skin, full lips, eyes like dark fire. His pulse kicked up.

Harrison edged back. "Or what?"

Julian's smile turned predatory. "Or you become mine. If you agree, I'll consider that little incident just a lover's quarrel."

Again with this nonsense.

Harrison didn't hesitate. "Not happening."

Julian's expression darkened. "Don't be stupid, Harrison. Women line up for a chance with me."

She was done talking. In one fluid motion, she launched off the bed and bolted for the door.

She didn't make it.

Julian caught her wrist and flung her back onto the mattress. "If I can't have your heart," he growled, pinning her down, "then I'll take your body instead."

His hands tore at her dress.

"Get off!" Harrison fought like a wildcat, nails raking down his neck, drawing blood.

Julian only grinned wider. He backhanded her—hard.

Crack!

Stars exploded behind her eyes. Copper flooded her mouth. A thin trail of blood slid from her lip.

Julian ripped off his shirt, belt clinking as he unbuckled it. The sight of her beneath him—smooth skin, delicate collarbones, legs that went on forever—made his breath hitch. Even with all his conquests, she was different.

He shoved her skirt up, forcing her thighs apart. "I'm obsessed with you, Harrison. Just. Be. Mine."

Harrison screamed.
###Chapter 143
Harrison was paralyzed with terror. No one could remain calm when facing physical violence, and she was no exception.

"Get off me! Don't touch me! Ah!"

She thrashed wildly, desperate to break free. Just as Julian Ashford's grip tightened, the door burst open with a deafening crash.

Nathaniel had arrived.

He stormed in, his expression murderous. Without hesitation, he seized Julian by the collar and yanked him off Harrison, then drove his fist into the man's face with brutal force.

Julian crumpled to the floor. Nathaniel didn't stop. A second punch. A third.

Blood splattered across the carpet.

Harrison sat up, her voice trembling. "Nathaniel... Nathaniel..."

Nathaniel abandoned Julian, now barely conscious, and rushed to her side. She was shaking violently, her eyes wide with shock.

His gaze swept over her, and his stomach twisted. A vivid red handprint marred her cheek. Her skirt was hiked up, exposing pale thighs now bruised from Julian's rough grip. The sight of her—violated, terrified—sent white-hot fury coursing through him.

He'd walked in to find Julian pinning her down, her legs forced apart. The image was seared into his mind.

"Did he hurt you?" Nathaniel's voice was dangerously low.

Harrison's lips trembled. "No..."

"Are you sure?" His hands moved to her skirt, lifting it just enough to confirm. Her underwear was untouched.

Relief warred with rage. He wanted to turn back and finish what he'd started.

But Harrison's arms locked around him, her grip desperate. "Nathaniel, please. Just take me away from here. I can't stay another second."

Julian lay motionless, blood pooling beneath him. One more hit might kill him.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, forcing himself to rein in his anger. He wrapped his coat around Harrison and lifted her into his arms, carrying her out without another glance at the wreckage behind them.

Thirty minutes later, the Rolls-Royce pulled into Rosewood Manor. Nathaniel carried Harrison straight to the master suite and lowered her gently into the marble bathtub.

Hot water cascaded over her icy skin. She was deathly pale, her body trembling until the warmth finally began to seep in.

His voice cut through the silence like a blade. "You're wearing makeup?"

Harrison looked up. Nathaniel stood over her, his sleeves rolled up to reveal powerful forearms and a gleaming wristwatch. His trousers were damp at the hem, but the soft golden light only accentuated his commanding presence.

His eyes burned with fury. "Lipstick, too? Really?"

Harrison's breath hitched. "I—"

Nathaniel planted his hands on his hips, his jaw clenched. "Dr. Sinclair's lecture was today. Every student attended. And you chose to dress like this?" His voice dropped to a growl. "Did you want Julian to take you?"

The accusation struck like a slap.

Fresh tears welled in her eyes, spilling over before she could stop them. They fell silently into the water, one after another.

Nathaniel stiffened. "Harrison, don't think crying will fix this."

But the tears kept coming.
###Chapter 144

Harrison sobbed uncontrollably, her voice cracking with raw emotion.

"You're always so furious with me... What's wrong with wearing makeup or lipstick? Isabella does it daily, yet you never raise your voice at her... If she'd been kidnapped instead, you'd be holding her close, whispering sweet nothings... You just despise me, don't you? Why do you hate me this much?"

Her delicate frame shook with each ragged breath. Puffy red eyes and a flushed nose made her look like a fragile rosebud. Crystal tears streamed down her cheeks in an endless flow.

Nathaniel's expression shifted dramatically, his face draining of color. He immediately knelt beside her, reaching out. "Harrison, please stop crying."

She rarely cried in his presence. The only other time he'd witnessed her tears was during sleep, when she'd whimpered for her deceased mother.

This marked the second occasion - and he was the cause.

Seeing her like this tore at his heart.

Nathaniel gently brushed away a tear with his thumb. "Isabella wears makeup, but you're different..."

Harrison possessed an ethereal, natural beauty - like some woodland nymph. Cosmetics only enhanced her striking features, especially that cherry-red lipstick. Her painted lips resembled ripe peaches - tempting, irresistible.

Isabella could wear whatever she pleased without consequence.

But for Harrison, it always led to trouble.

She wasn't like Isabella.

The tears kept coming. Each time Nathaniel wiped them away, fresh ones took their place. Her glossy eyes burned with accusation and pain.

"Save your excuses. You're biased. Isabella's perfect while I'm just... me."

Nathaniel wasn't accustomed to comforting women. This torrent of emotion left him floundering. Why so many tears?

His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Harrison, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so harsh. Please, stop crying."

But the floodgates remained open. Harrison couldn't comprehend why Nathaniel despised her so.

Then, in a sudden burst of frustration, she sank her teeth into his wrist.

This time, the bite lacked force. Nathaniel barely felt it.

He didn't react. If biting helped calm her, he'd endure it gladly.

Harrison released him, sniffling as she wiped her nose. "Did that hurt?"

Nathaniel wondered how other men handled such moments - when their lover bites in anger, then immediately regrets it.

He didn't know about others, but his own heart was melting.

He'd always known Harrison was trying to seduce him.

And truthfully? He loved it.

Her particular brand of temptation thrilled him. Always had.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened as he shook his head. "Not at all."

Harrison hugged herself tightly. "I need to shower. Please leave."

Nathaniel exited the bathroom.

Moments later, Dominic entered. "Mr. Falcon, Mr. Ashford has arrived. He's aware of the situation and knows you're holding Julian. He's demanding his son's release."

Nathaniel's face remained impassive, lips curling into a cold smirk. "Have him wait in the study."

Inside the study, Reginald and Beatrice Ashford stood anxiously.

Reginald met Nathaniel's gaze, voice laced with forced calm. "Nathaniel, this is entirely Julian's doing. He must have lost his mind to target your wife. We're here to apologize. But you understand - Julian's our only heir. Considering our families' longstanding friendship, I'm asking you to release our son."
###Chapter 145

Nathaniel stood motionless before the panoramic windows, his towering frame creating a dark silhouette against the afternoon light. Those obsidian eyes held depths no one dared to explore - cold, impenetrable, lethal.

"An apology won't undo what happened. You should leave now."

Tears welled in Beatrice's eyes as she clutched her husband's arm. "Nathaniel, I'm begging you! We held you as a baby. Julian is our only child - please show mercy. We'll make sure he never steps out of line again."

Not a muscle twitched in Nathaniel's face. His voice cut like ice. "Dominic, escort them out."

Dominic materialized instantly, gesturing toward the exit with practiced politeness. "Mr. and Mrs. Ashford, this way."

Reginald's face flushed crimson. "You'd throw decades of friendship away over some country girl? Harrison barely passed her classes at Westfield! Is she really worth destroying Falcon Enterprises' alliance with the Ashfords?"

Nathaniel's silence spoke volumes. A single glance sent Dominic into action.

"Shall I call security, or would you prefer to leave with dignity?" Dominic's tone remained perfectly neutral.

Reginald's fists clenched. "You insolent— Fine! We're leaving!"

The Ashfords stormed from Rosewood Manor, their fury palpable in the crisp autumn air. Once the heavy gates closed behind them, Reginald exploded.

"That arrogant bastard! Treating us like common beggars!"

Beatrice wrung her hands, panic etching lines across her face. "Reginald, Julian's still in his custody! If Nathaniel refuses to release him... Our family line ends with us! You must do something!"

Despite his rage, Reginald knew their position was precarious. Julian had brought this upon himself. Any further escalation could prove disastrous.

Yet Nathaniel's utter dismissal stung like salt in a wound.

Then, like lightning, inspiration struck.

"There's one person who might get through to him."

Beatrice's head snapped up. "Who?"

A slow smile spread across Reginald's face. "Isabella."

Hope dawned in Beatrice's eyes. "Of course! The Whitmores' golden girl! Nathaniel dotes on her - if she intervenes, he'll have to listen!"

Thirty minutes later, the Ashfords arrived at the Whitmore estate bearing designer boxes from Paris. "We brought the latest collection from Chanel and Cartier," Beatrice gushed as servants took their coats. "We weren't certain about your preferences."

The Whitmore family had assembled in full force - Theodore, Victoria, and Isabella holding court in the gilded drawing room. An impromptu visit from the Ashfords was unprecedented; their social standing far eclipsed the Whitmores'.

Isabella examined the gifts with practiced disinterest. Stanley showered her with luxury daily - these trinkets meant little. What thrilled her was the Ashfords' desperation. Their groveling validated her position as Nathaniel's favorite.

Building connections among the elite was crucial for her future as Mrs. Hawk. She'd been meticulously cultivating Nathaniel's circle for years.

A satisfied smile curved her lips. "How thoughtful of you. Really, you shouldn't have."

Reginald cut to the chase. "Isabella, we need your help."

Since the police station incident, Victoria had become noticeably subdued. She poured tea with trembling hands. "What could our Isabella possibly assist the great Ashford family with?"
###Chapter 146

Isabella spoke up quickly. "Today, my son Julian kidnapped Harrison. Nathaniel rushed over to rescue her, and now he's holding my son hostage. Mr. Falcon refuses to release him, all because of Harrison."

What?

Victoria's expression changed instantly. No wonder Nathaniel had abruptly left Dr. Sinclair's lecture today.

He had gone to save Harrison.

How many times had this happened now? Last time, Harrison had been kidnapped by Vincent, and Nathaniel had been the one to save her.

Now Nathaniel had gone as far as holding Julian captive?

The Falcon and Ashford families had connections - for Nathaniel to go this far, did Harrison mean that much to him?

Victoria clenched her fists.

Reginald studied her carefully. "Ms. Whitmore, everyone knows you're Mr. Falcon's favorite. No amount of pleading from us compares to a single word from you. If you speak to Mr. Falcon, I'm certain he'll release my son."

At this, Victoria, Theodore, and Beatrice exchanged knowing smiles.

Victoria's lips curved into a playful smirk. "So that's all you needed from me? Very well, I'll go speak to Nathaniel immediately."

"Ms. Whitmore, we can't thank you enough! We'll await your good news."

Victoria left to find Nathaniel.

Theodore chuckled. "Mr. and Mrs. Ashford, you shouldn't have troubled yourselves coming here for something so simple. Don't worry. Mr. Falcon adores Victoria - this will be effortless for her."

Beatrice added with a smile, "Young Julian is such an exceptional man - I'm sure many girls pursue him. Harrison must have seduced him and caused this mess. Now, let's enjoy some tea."

The four sipped their tea contentedly, with Reginald and Beatrice showering Theodore and Beatrice with compliments.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mrs. Whitmore, you've raised an extraordinary daughter!"

Theodore and Beatrice beamed with pride. Victoria was indeed their greatest achievement.

Inside Rosewood Manor, Harrison had just finished bathing when the maid arrived with an ice pack. "Mrs. Falcon, Mr. Falcon asked me to bring this for your face. It will help reduce the swelling."

Nathaniel had thought to send an ice pack.

Harrison felt warmth spread through her chest. It seemed whenever she was in danger, he was always there.

"Where is he?"

"Mr. Falcon is in the study."

"Then I'll go see him."

Harrison stepped out, intending to thank Nathaniel personally. But her steps faltered when she spotted Victoria.

Victoria was here.

The two women faced each other in the hallway.

Victoria's cold gaze took in the red, swollen mark on Harrison's face before arrogantly scanning her from head to toe. "I heard Julian kidnapped you. What do you plan to do about it?"

Harrison met Victoria's stare with icy detachment. "He committed a crime. Naturally, I'll ensure he faces justice."

Victoria sneered, stepping closer. With a gloating smirk, she taunted, "Well, prepare to be disappointed! The Ashfords came begging to me. All I need to do is say the word, and Nathaniel will release Julian. Don't believe me? Wait by the door and listen."

Harrison's long lashes fluttered slightly.

Victoria lifted her chin in triumph, about to walk away, then paused. A malicious smile played on her lips as she added, "By the way, you just came from the master bedroom, didn't you? That bed is so comfortable - I adore sleeping in it."

Harrison froze.

"You're always lurking in the shadows, coveting everything I possess, aren't you? Envious that I have a mother, that I have Nathaniel. Sometimes I pity you - no one truly loves you."
###Chapter 147

Isabella's stilettos clicked sharply against the marble floor as she strode into Nathaniel's study.

Harrison remained frozen in the hallway, her breath catching in her throat.

"You're pitiful because nobody loves you."

The cruel words kept replaying in Harrison's mind like a broken record. She knew exactly how Isabella saw her - a pathetic shadow, silently coveting everything that rightfully belonged to Isabella. Her mother. Nathaniel. Everything.

Isabella pitied her.

A sharp pain lanced through Harrison's chest, as if someone had driven a knife between her ribs. The irony burned. Victoria and Nathaniel - they had both been hers first!

Her gaze drifted to the closed study door. If Isabella spoke to him, would Nathaniel really release Julian?

Isabella had told her to eavesdrop, but Harrison couldn't bring herself to do it.

She couldn't bear to hear it.

Her once-warm heart now felt encased in ice. She should have known better than to hope for Nathaniel's protection.

Hope only bred disappointment. And heartbreak.

A maid approached with an ice pack. "Mrs. Falcon, your face..."

Harrison waved her away. "It's fine."

Inside the study, Nathaniel sat reviewing contracts. Isabella moved behind him, massaging his shoulders. "Nathaniel, I heard you're holding Julian Ashford."

Nathaniel's sharp gaze lifted from the documents. "Did Reginald send you?"

Nothing escaped those piercing eyes.

Isabella didn't bother denying it. "Yes. Just let Julian go. The Falcon and Ashford families have been allies for decades. You have business ties with them. Is ruining that relationship really worth it over Harrison?"

She wasn't worth it. Everyone kept saying that.

Nathaniel shoved Isabella's hands away, his expression turning glacial. "You're a woman too, Isabella. I expected better from you."

Isabella hesitated only a moment. "But Harrison wasn't actually hurt, was she?"

The temperature in the room plummeted. A dangerous energy crackled around Nathaniel. "He's not being released. Leave."

Isabella's jaw dropped. She'd come expecting automatic compliance, yet Nathaniel had refused her outright.

"Nathaniel, the Ashfords begged me to intervene! I promised them! What am I supposed to tell them now?"

Nathaniel's icy stare made her flinch. "Not my problem. You shouldn't have made promises you can't keep."

Isabella's face drained of color. She'd been so confident in her influence over Nathaniel. His rejection stung like a slap.

"Dominic," Nathaniel called.

His secretary appeared instantly. "Sir?"

Without looking up from his documents, Nathaniel ordered, "Escort Isabella out."

Dominic gestured toward the door. "Ms. Isabella?"

Isabella trembled with barely contained rage. To be dismissed like some unwanted guest!

She turned to leave, then paused dramatically. "Tell me, Nathaniel - are you keeping Julian locked up because he hurt some girl? Or is this really about Harrison?"

Nathaniel's head snapped up, irritation flashing in his eyes. "Out!"

The command cracked like a whip.

Something inside Isabella snapped. She swept an antique vase off the desk, sending it shattering across the floor.

The crash echoed through the silent study.

Their first real fight. Over Harrison.

Isabella stormed out.

Nathaniel remained unmoved, his expression colder than ever. The air around him turned glacial, oppressive - a force no one dared challenge.
###Chapter 148

Nathaniel couldn't concentrate on the financial reports spread across his desk. Pushing them aside, he strode toward the master suite.

The room stood empty - no trace of Harrison remained.

Noticing the ensuite bathroom door slightly ajar, Nathaniel paused at the threshold. His deep voice echoed in the silence. "Harrison?"

No reply came.

Not even the sound of running water.

He reached to push the door open when it swung inward on its own.

Stepping inside, his gaze swept across the marble surfaces. The freestanding tub sat dry and unused. His wife had vanished.

Where could she have gone?

As Nathaniel turned, a maid entered carrying fresh linens. "Mr. Falcon, Mrs. Falcon departed nearly an hour ago."

Gone? Without a word?

His eyes fell on the untouched ice pack resting on the dresser. "She refused treatment?"

"Yes, sir. Mrs. Falcon insisted it wasn't necessary."

A folded note caught his attention beside the bed. Nathaniel picked up the crisp stationery with long fingers. Two words stared back at him.

[Thank you.]

That was all. No explanation. No goodbye.

A humorless laugh escaped Nathaniel's lips as he ran a hand through his dark hair.

Once the maid withdrew, Nathaniel found himself alone in the cavernous bedroom. He leaned against the mahogany desk, extracting a silver cigarette case. The click of his platinum lighter punctuated the silence.

Smoke curled around his sharp features as he took a deep drag. He rarely indulged, but tonight the nicotine helped dull the growing frustration.

Dominic appeared in the doorway moments later. "Mr. Falcon, Ms. Isabella has departed. Regarding Mr. Ashford's situation..."

Nathaniel tapped ash into a crystal tray, noticing the faint teeth marks on his wrist.

Harrison's parting gift.

His voice turned glacial. "If Reginald calls again, deliver one message..."

At the Whitmore estate, Isabella entered the grand foyer. Reginald and Beatrice Ashford rushed forward expectantly.

"Ms. Whitmore! Where's our son? Mr. Falcon agreed to release Julian, didn't he?"

Theodore and Victoria Whitmore peered behind Isabella, their expressions freezing when no one followed.

"Isabella," Theodore asked hesitantly, "didn't Mr. Falcon return with you?"

Isabella's lips thinned as she regarded their hopeful faces. "Mr. Ashford, Mrs. Ashford... I'm afraid Nathaniel refused."

What?

Four pairs of eyes widened in shock.

Reginald's voice turned razor sharp. "What nonsense is this? Aren't you Mr. Falcon's favored woman?"

Beatrice's face crumpled. "We've been deceived, Reginald. She clearly holds no influence over him. This girl is nothing but a fraud!"

"You've wasted our precious time!" Reginald roared.

Without another glance, the Ashfords turned on their heels.

Theodore and Victoria rushed after them. "Mr. Ashford! Please—"

Reginald snapped his fingers at their security detail. "Remove every gift we brought."

Within moments, bodyguards began clearing the mountain of luxury items from the Whitmore's parlor.

"Mr. Ashford!" Theodore's voice cracked with panic. "Isabella, what happened?"

Victoria looked equally stunned. "You spoke to Nathaniel personally and he still wouldn't release Julian?"

Isabella's carefully constructed pride shattered like glass. Her manicured nails bit into her palms.

Harrison Falcon. This war between us has only just begun.
###Chapter 149

In the girls' dormitory...

"Ah... That stings... Rosalind, please be careful..."

Harrison had returned to the dorm after leaving Rosewood Manor, with Rosalind gently pressing an ice pack against her swollen cheek.

Hearing Harrison's whimper, Rosalind muttered through clenched teeth, "Julian is a monster! How dare he lay hands on you? Where is he now? Wait—Harrison, why are you back alone?"

When Rosalind opened the door earlier, her breath caught at the sight of Harrison limping in, her face marred by an angry red handprint. Bruises and welts covered her arms and legs—undeniable evidence of violence.

The late hour and Harrison's solitary return with such injuries made Rosalind's chest tighten with protective fury.

Where was Nathaniel now?

Earlier, Isabella had gone to see Nathaniel, so Julian should have been released by now.

Harrison trembled slightly before wordlessly burying her face in Rosalind's shoulder. "Rosalind, my face hurts too much to talk right now."

"Alright, alright," Rosalind soothed immediately. "No more questions. Let me treat your other injuries. This ointment will have you looking like your gorgeous self by morning."

The soft lamplight bathed the dorm room in a warm glow.

By dawn, thanks to Rosalind's attentive care and the healing balm, the marks on Harrison's face and body had faded significantly. Her porcelain skin regained its usual flawless appearance.

As they prepared to leave for breakfast, two figures suddenly blocked their path—Reginald and Beatrice Ashford.

Rosalind instantly stepped forward defensively. "What do you want?"

Without warning, the Ashfords dropped to their knees before Harrison.

Rosalind gaped. "Harrison, what...?"

Harrison blinked in equal shock. She hadn't anticipated this humiliating display from Julian's parents.

Frowning, she demanded, "What's the meaning of this?"

The Ashfords clearly hadn't slept, their faces drawn with exhaustion and desperation.

Tears welled in Beatrice's eyes as she clasped her hands pleadingly. "Our son is a fool who harmed you. As his parents, we beg your forgiveness. Please... ask Mr. Falcon to release him."

Harrison paused. "Nathaniel hasn't let him go?"

"No." Reginald shook his head miserably. "Last night we begged Isabella to intervene. She spoke to Mr. Falcon on our behalf, but he refused. He said... he said..."

Harrison's eyes narrowed. "What exactly did he say?"

Reginald swallowed hard. "Mr. Falcon said we were pleading with the wrong person. That we should be begging you, not Isabella."

Had Nathaniel truly said that?

Harrison had assumed Nathaniel would release Julian immediately after Isabella's request. Apparently not. And Nathaniel had made that explicitly clear to the Ashfords.

"Julian is our only child," Reginald continued hoarsely. "We spoiled him rotten, and our poor parenting led to him hurting you. We'll make any amends you require. The Falcon and Ashford families have been allies for generations. Mr. Falcon said the decision rests entirely with you. Do you truly wish to destroy this longstanding alliance?"

The Ashfords groveled pathetically before her.

Harrison exhaled sharply. "Get up. I'll call Nathaniel to release Julian."

"Really? Thank you!" Beatrice wept with relief.

"But I never want to see Julian again," Harrison stated firmly.

Reginald nodded frantically. "The moment he's released, we're taking him abroad! You'll never have to lay eyes on him again!"

Harrison gave a curt nod. "Fine."

The Ashfords showered her with gratitude before departing.

When Harrison called Nathaniel, his cold voice sent shivers down her spine. "I don't want your gratitude as repayment," he snapped before abruptly hanging up.

Heat flooded her cheeks—he'd rejected her thanks!

If he didn't want her gratitude, why maintain such icy distance? The humiliation made her wish the floor would swallow her whole.

Just then, excited chatter erupted nearby. Penelope had arrived.

A crowd of starstruck students swarmed around Penelope. "Penelope, can I have your autograph?"

"Penelope, you're our role model!"

Rosalind quickly explained. "Harrison, since Julian took you yesterday, you missed the lecture aftermath. Dr. Sinclair was absent, and in the chaos, his assistant—our very own Willowridge University star Penelope—stepped in to deliver the lecture. The standing ovation was deafening. Overnight, Penelope became famous."

"Also," Rosalind added, "Penelope's research paper was selected for display at the National Medical Gallery tomorrow. This is an incredible honor, and now everyone's talking about her."

Harrison observed Penelope's unusually smug expression. It seemed that in the king's absence, the jester had indeed claimed the throne.
###Chapter 150
Abuse.

The night was deep when Harrison returned alone, her body bearing the marks of violence. Nathaniel's absence twisted like a knife in Rosalind's chest.

Where was Julian now?

Earlier, Isabella had gone to see Nathaniel. By all logic, Julian should have been released by now.

Harrison trembled slightly, her arms wrapping around Rosalind's warmth without a word. "Rosalind, my face hurts. I can't talk right now."

"Okay, okay," Rosalind replied instantly, her voice soft. "No more questions. Let me check your other injuries. I'll apply more ointment. By tomorrow, you'll look like yourself again."

The lamplight in their dorm room painted everything in a gentle, golden hue.

By morning, under Rosalind's care and the medicine's magic, the bruises on Harrison's face and body had faded. Her skin was smooth and flawless once more.

They were heading to the cafeteria for breakfast when Reginald and Beatrice Ashford appeared, blocking their path.

Rosalind tensed immediately. "What do you want?"

Without speaking, Reginald and Beatrice dropped to their knees before Harrison.

Rosalind froze. "Harrison, what...?"

Harrison was just as stunned. She hadn't expected this.

Frowning, she asked, "What are you doing?"

Reginald and Beatrice looked exhausted, their faces lined with worry. Beatrice's eyes brimmed with tears as she pleaded, "Our son is a fool. He hurt you. As his parents, we beg for your forgiveness. Please... ask Mr. Falcon to release him."

Harrison paused. "Nathaniel hasn't let him go yet?"

"No." Reginald shook his head. "Last night, we begged Isabella. She spoke to Mr. Falcon on our behalf, but he refused. He said... he said..."

Harrison's gaze sharpened. "What did he say?"

Reginald looked defeated. "Mr. Falcon said we were asking the wrong person. We should have come to you, not Isabella."

Had he really said that?

Harrison had assumed Isabella's intervention would secure Julian's release. Apparently, Nathaniel had other ideas.

"Julian is our only child," Reginald continued. "We spoiled him, and our lack of discipline led to this. We'll make it right—whatever you ask. The Falcon and Ashford families have been friends for years. Mr. Falcon said the decision is yours. Do you truly want to sever that bond?"

Their desperation was palpable.

Harrison exhaled. "Get up. I'll call Nathaniel and ask him to release Julian."

"Really? Thank you!" Beatrice choked out, relief flooding her face.

"But I never want to see Julian again," Harrison stated coldly.

Reginald nodded eagerly. "Once he's released, we'll take him abroad. You won't have to lay eyes on him again."

Harrison gave a curt nod. "Fine."

Reginald and Beatrice showered her with gratitude before leaving.

Then, chaos erupted ahead. Penelope had arrived.

A crowd of students swarmed her, their admiration palpable. "Penelope, can I have your autograph?"

"Penelope, we all want to be like you someday!"

Rosalind quickly filled Harrison in. "You missed everything yesterday after Julian took you. Dr. Sinclair was absent, and in the chaos, Penelope—our very own star at Willowridge University—stepped up to deliver the lecture. The applause was deafening. Overnight, she became a sensation."

She lowered her voice. "Also, her research paper was selected by the National Medical Gallery. Tomorrow, it'll be displayed in their showcase. It's a huge honor. Right now, Penelope is all anyone can talk about."

Harrison watched Penelope, understanding now why the girl radiated such smug satisfaction today.

When the king was away, the jester had indeed claimed the throne.
###Chapter 151

Harrison's absence only made Penelope's triumph shine brighter.

Penelope signed autographs for the adoring students before sauntering over to Harrison with a triumphant smile. "Harrison, I heard Julian Ashford kidnapped you. Why do you constantly find trouble? You're embarrassing the Whitmore name!"

Not a single Whitmore family member had shown concern—only criticism.

Harrison remained unfazed, long accustomed to their indifference. She winked playfully, her tone light. "I don't mind tarnishing the Whitmore reputation when you're here to polish it back up."

The barb hit its mark. Penelope's lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk. "You've heard about my research paper, haven't you? The National Medical Gallery selected it for display tomorrow. The entire family's celebrating. Grandmother Margaret and my parents will be there to witness my achievement."

Even Margaret Whitmore would attend—Penelope was her golden child. The brightest star at Willowridge University and the Whitmore family's pride. Tomorrow, Margaret would bring the entire third branch to bask in Penelope's glory.

Harrison arched an eyebrow. Though she hadn't visited the Whitmore estate in ages, she could picture their excitement perfectly.

She smiled. "Then I'll join the celebration at the National Medical Gallery tomorrow."

"You?" Penelope's gaze turned disdainful. "Come if you must, but we both know you're just a small-town nobody trying to leech off my success. Just don't make a scene, or I'll have security remove you."

Harrison smirked. "Noted."

Penelope strutted away, her designer heels clicking against the pavement.

Rosalind looked troubled. "Harrison, are you serious about going tomorrow? Penelope and her family will humiliate you."

Harrison gave Rosalind's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Trust me." She pulled out her phone and texted Oliver. [Send me Penelope's research paper—the one the National Medical Gallery selected.]

Oliver replied instantly. [On it.]

At Falcon Enterprises...

Nathaniel had buried himself in work all day. His recent preoccupation with Harrison had created a mountain of paperwork.

That evening, Sebastian barged in and collapsed on the sofa. "I can't believe you're jeopardizing relations with the Ashfords over someone like Harrison. She must have you under some spell."

Nathaniel glanced up from his documents, his expression icy.

Sebastian clamped his mouth shut instantly. While he feared no one in this world, Nathaniel was the sole exception.

Yet the competitive fire burned too strong. He launched his gaming app and sent Harrison a challenge notification. After their last humiliating defeat, Sebastian had splurged on premium upgrades—this time, victory would be his.

Across campus, Harrison sat cross-legged on her dorm bed, engrossed in the research paper Oliver had forwarded.

Her screen suddenly exploded with notifications.

[Harrison! Fight me!]
[I dare you to play!]
[You're going down this time!]
[Too scared?]
[Coward!]

Harrison exhaled sharply through her nose.

Sebastian was at it again.

She bookmarked the academic document and logged into her gaming account. [One round. That's it.]

Sebastian nearly dropped his phone in triumph. She'd taken the bait! His newly acquired Zen staff glowed ominously—this time, he'd crush her within minutes.

The match began with his signature aggressive assault, enhanced by his expensive upgrades.

"Game over."

The words flashed crimson across Sebastian's screen after forty-seven seconds.
###Chapter 152
The familiar alert chimed through the room.

Sebastian bolted upright from the sofa, his face twisting in shock. "Bloody hell!"

He swung his Zen staff with practiced precision, lunging forward. But before he could complete the motion, Harrison spun mid-air, landing gracefully as her battle-axe came down in one swift arc.

Game over.

Just like that—he was dead.

Sebastian stared at the screen, stunned. The abrupt defeat caught Nathaniel's attention, his sharp gaze flicking toward his friend with mild amusement.

Never one to accept failure, Sebastian growled, [Harrison, rematch!]

Harrison agreed without hesitation. The second round began.

Two seconds later, Sebastian's furious shout echoed through the penthouse. "Damn it! No—this can't be happening!"

"Game over."

Another loss.

Sebastian's jaw clenched. [Harrison, one more round!]

Harrison's response was calm. [Mr. Willowbrook, think carefully. If you lose again, your rank drops to bronze.]

Sebastian had held the champion title for months. Two defeats against Harrison had already pushed him to the edge. One more loss, and he'd plummet.

Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the tension. "Sebastian, what's all this noise about?"

Sebastian's eyes lit up. He scrambled toward Nathaniel like a man grasping at salvation. "Nathaniel, help me! Play against her for me!"

Nathaniel barely glanced at him, disinterested. So, Sebastian had been battling Harrison?

He'd seen the humiliating defeats—how Sebastian barely lasted seconds against her. Last time, he'd been surprised by Harrison's reflexes in the game. Impressive, really.

But Nathaniel had no intention of playing.

Not after last night.

She'd left without a word, leaving only a cold "thank you" note. This morning, she'd called, repeating those same hollow words before immediately offering to "repay" him—as if their relationship was nothing more than transactions of flesh and favors.

Did she truly believe he helped her for that?

Nathaniel Falcon had no shortage of willing women. He didn't need to chase after her.

Who did she think she was?

"Come on, Nathaniel! Teach her a lesson!"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

Maybe she did need to be taught one.

He took the phone from Sebastian.

Nathaniel wasn't just a business prodigy—he'd been a gaming legend in his youth. Years ago, he'd recognized the gaming industry's potential and coded his own programs, turning them into his first fortune.

As Falcon Enterprises' heir, he'd mastered everything from racing to piloting. But now, with the empire on his shoulders, he rarely indulged in such distractions.

This time, he agreed for one reason: to humble Harrison.

Last night, she'd cried in his arms. He'd hated seeing her tears. Now, she wasn't crying—but part of him wanted to make her.

A flaw all men shared, perhaps.

Nathaniel tapped the screen. The third round began.

Harrison versus Nathaniel.

Sebastian grinned, pumping his fist. "Destroy her, Nathaniel! One-hit KO!"

Nathaniel intended to end it quickly.

But he couldn't.

He paused, waiting. Harrison struck first—her signature axe swing. He dodged effortlessly.

His counterattack came swift, but Harrison twisted away just in time.

Nathaniel hadn't taken her seriously at first. But after three exchanges, his relaxed posture shifted. He straightened, fingers flying across the screen, focus razor-sharp.

Harrison was fast.

Precise. Ruthless. Every move lethal.

Nathaniel had never seen anything like it.
###Chapter 153

Nathaniel knew Harrison was quick, but this level of speed caught him completely off guard.

Gaming had always been effortless for him - until now. Harrison was the first to truly challenge him.

The realization hit him like a thunderbolt.

Sebastian sensed the shift immediately. "What the hell, Nathaniel? Harrison's matching you move for move. Get your head in the game! If I lose this match, I'm dropping from champion to bronze!"

Just as he spoke, Dominic entered the room. "Mr. Falcon, there's an urgent call from Rosewood Manor..."

Rosewood Manor? What could be wrong?

Nathaniel's focus fractured.

That single moment of distraction cost him the game.

His fingers froze mid-command. Defeat flashed across the screen.

He'd lost...to Harrison!

Nathaniel had only meant to teach her a playful lesson, maybe make her pout a little. This outcome? Unthinkable.

Sebastian's anguished cry shattered the silence. "NO! Nathaniel, you lost? My ranking! Three years of grinding - gone in one match!"

The devastation in Sebastian's voice was palpable. His digital empire had crumbled in minutes.

Nathaniel, however, remained eerily composed. A slow, amused smile curved his lips as he pressed his tongue against his cheek.

Harrison had just delivered the shock of his gaming career.

His attention shifted to Dominic. "What's happening at Grandmother's?"

"Mr. Falcon, they're calling about the missing herbal recipe Mrs. Falcon left for Mrs. Eleanor. She's requesting another copy."

So Eleanor was fine - it was Harrison's medicinal formula causing the stir.

Nathaniel grabbed his phone, opening WhatsApp without hesitation. His thumb hovered over the video call button to Harrison.

Meanwhile, in the girls' dorm...

Harrison stared at her screen in disbelief. She'd won, but not through skill. Her opponent - Sebastian - had suddenly transformed mid-game, his abilities skyrocketing to impossible levels.

She'd only secured victory when his connection seemed to falter. That split-second lag gave her the opening she needed for the final strike.

Truthfully? She knew she couldn't have beaten him fairly.

What had caused Sebastian's sudden power surge?

Her phone vibrated violently. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen.

Why was he calling now?

She accepted the video call. Nathaniel's striking features filled her display.

He sat in a sleek black executive chair, his tailored white shirt stretching across his broad shoulders. The fabric clung to his muscular frame, enhancing his untouchable aura.

Nathaniel Falcon remained Willowbrook's most elusive bachelor - a man who existed in everyone's conversations but no one's reach.

Harrison met his gaze through the screen. "What do you need?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened as he took in her appearance. Fresh from the shower, her raven hair was piled in a loose bun, damp tendrils curling against her porcelain neck.

The thin white camisole she wore revealed smooth shoulders, the delicate straps emphasizing her slender frame. The sight was unexpectedly... disarming.

For the first time, Nathaniel found himself speechless. This version of Harrison - relaxed, natural, glowing from her shower - radiated a youthful innocence he'd never noticed before.
###Chapter 154
Nathaniel's voice came through the phone, low and urgent. "The herbal prescription you wrote for Grandmother has disappeared."

So that was why he called.

Harrison immediately reached for a pen. "Give me a moment. I'll rewrite it for you."

She bent over the desk, her fingers moving swiftly across the paper.

As she wrote, the thin strap of her camisole slipped slightly, revealing the delicate curve of her collarbone and the soft swell of her breasts.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. He had always known she was beautiful, but this—the way her waist tapered into gentle hips, the unconscious grace of her movements—was enough to unravel any man's restraint.

"Harrison." His voice was rough, strained.

She glanced up, confused. "What is it?"

Her eyes were wide, innocent, completely unaware of the effect she had on him.

That obliviousness only made it worse.

Nathaniel swallowed hard. "Once you're done, take a photo and send it to me."

Harrison nodded absently, assuming he was too busy to wait.

"Alright, I'll hang up now. Go back to your work."

When he didn’t respond, she moved to end the call—until Rosalind burst into the room, holding two ice cream cones.

"Harrison! I got you vanilla!" Rosalind grinned, handing one over as she licked her own.

The ice cream had already started melting. Harrison quickly took it, catching a drip with her tongue.

"Hurry, it's so good!" Rosalind urged.

Harrison laughed, savoring the rich sweetness. "Mmm, it’s perfect."

Rosalind noticed Nathaniel on the screen and waved. "Hi, Mr. Falcon!"

Nathaniel’s gaze didn’t leave Harrison, who was licking the ice cream with childlike delight, her pink tongue darting out to catch every drop.

He couldn’t help but think how easily she was pleased.

Something as simple as ice cream made her glow.

His throat burned. "Is it really that good?"

Harrison beamed at him. "Yes, so sweet."

She had always loved sweets—chocolates, pastries, anything sugary.

Rosalind, mischievous, teased, "Harrison, Mr. Falcon helped you with Julian. Are you thinking of how to repay him?"

At the word "repay," Harrison’s fingers stilled.

She looked up—and finally noticed the way Nathaniel was watching her.

His gaze was dark, intense, simmering with something dangerous.

She knew that look.

Beneath his usual composure was a hunger he rarely showed.

Harrison’s pulse quickened.

Hesitant, she held out the ice cream cone toward the screen.

"Would you... like a taste?"
###Chapter 155

Harrison had no clue what she'd just blurted out.

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to the ice cream cone in her hand, then traveled back up to her delicate features. His voice came out rougher than intended when he countered, "Some of what exactly?"

Her mind was a complete fog. She couldn't comprehend what he meant by that question.

Her pulse quickened - thud, thud, thud. The tension between them thickened, almost tangible enough to slice through.

Harrison decided to cut this awkward exchange short. "Mr. Falcon, I'm heading to bed now. Goodnight."

She abruptly ended the video call.

Rosalind, gathering her shower supplies, noticed Harrison's flushed cheeks. "Harrison, why are you so red?"

Harrison absently touched her warm face. "Must be the summer heat. Go take your shower, Rosalind."

"Alright," Rosalind replied, disappearing into the bathroom.

Alone, Harrison sank onto her bed, staring at the melting ice cream in her hand. Gradually, her thoughts cleared. Why had she panicked like that?

Earlier that morning, she'd asked him over the phone if he wanted repayment, and he'd simply hung up on her. So arrogant. So typical.

Then why hadn't he reacted that way just now? Why drop the cold facade?

Secretly, Harrison hoped he'd accept her repayment offer. Then they'd be square.

She finished transcribing the herbal remedy and sent it to Nathaniel.

In her contacts, she'd saved Nathaniel as "Husband".

No response came.

Same icy detachment. The message history showed only her one-sided attempts at conversation. These digital records stood as embarrassing witnesses to her pathetic marriage.

A bitter laugh escaped her. She grabbed her phone, struck a pose, and snapped a selfie before posting it as a status update.

Nathaniel sat in his corner office at Falcon Enterprises when Harrison's herbal recipe notification popped up. He ignored it, intending to focus on his paperwork.

Yet all he could visualize was Harrison licking that ice cream. The way her pink tongue had darted out playfully. Teasing. Forbidden.

And then she'd asked if he wanted some.

Wanted some what? The dessert? Or... something more intimate?

Nathaniel leaned back heavily in his leather chair, stretching his muscular frame as he loosened his tie with one hand, trying to cool down.

He grabbed his phone and opened Harrison's profile, scrolling straight to her updates.

There it was - a fresh selfie. Harrison wore that thin white camisole, holding her ice cream while staring directly into the camera as she licked it. The caption taunted: [Want a taste?]

Nathaniel froze. That image - her smooth skin exposed, her delicate features glowing with youthful mischief - assaulted his senses like a pop-up ad on an illicit website. Heat flooded his face. She'd actually posted this?

He couldn't stop himself from responding.

Ding.

Harrison's phone vibrated with his reply. Two terse, commanding words: [Take it down.]

He was ordering her to delete the post.

A smug smile curved Harrison's lips. He'd ignored her message but was stalking her updates. So much for pretending indifference.

She deleted it - after all, only he could see it. The post had been meant solely for his eyes.

Then she opened the chat with "Husband" and typed: [Do you want it?]

Nathaniel stared at the provocative question lighting up his screen. She was asking if he wanted it.

This was a bold challenge.

A deliberate provocation.

Asking him, point blank, if he wanted her.

###Chapter 156

Nathaniel had faced countless temptations from women over the years. He recognized Harrison's game immediately - she was testing him.

She wanted to see if he'd bite the bait.

A smirk played on Nathaniel's lips. The little minx knew exactly what she was doing.

His phone buzzed, shattering the moment. Isabella's name flashed across the screen.

Just seeing her name cooled Nathaniel's heated blood. The fire Harrison had ignited slowly died down.

He answered.

Isabella's honeyed voice poured through the receiver. "Nathaniel, are you still upset with me? I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have argued or thrown things. I was just... jealous. Seeing you be so kind to Harrison made me crazy. Please forgive me. I love you. More than anything!"

She'd been spoiled by him for years, yet here she was, humbling herself with apologies and sweet nothings.

Nathaniel felt his resolve soften. She was his girl, after all.

His Isabella.

"I overreacted too," he conceded.

Her mood brightened instantly. "Then let's forget this ever happened! Alexander's birthday is tomorrow. Everyone's preparing for the celebration. Let's go together."

"Alright," Nathaniel agreed.

The call ended.

Sebastian emerged from the bathroom, face dripping from splashing cold water. He couldn't accept his gaming rank plummeting from champion to bronze. "Nathaniel! I'm bronze now! I hate Harrison!"

Nathaniel shot him an unimpressed look. "Get over it. Go find a date instead."

"I want to!" Sebastian perked up. "Actually... what do you think of that genius freshman?"

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. So Sebastian had set his sights on her now?

Grinning like an idiot, Sebastian announced, "I'm heading out. See you at Alexander's party tomorrow."

Nathaniel barely registered Sebastian's departure. People could chase whoever they wanted - it didn't concern him.

His phone buzzed again with Harrison's message: [Do you want it?]

He didn't reply.

He wouldn't take her bait.

Harrison didn't expect a response anyway.

Nathaniel had Isabella. Beautiful women surrounded him constantly. His needs could be met anywhere. What was she to him?

She'd never win this untouchable man.

His indifference cut deep.

Harrison laughed bitterly at herself.

She pulled out Penelope's research paper again, circling two glaring errors in red before sending them to Oliver.

Oliver responded immediately: [Unbelievable mistakes in this paper! I'll have the National Medical Gallery remove it at once.]

The next day, Penelope arrived at the gallery with Frederick, Margaret, and Cassandra. As they passed the exhibits, they spotted Penelope's displayed research.

"Oh!" Margaret gasped, clutching Penelope's arm. "I never dreamed someone from our family would be honored here! Penelope, you've made us so proud. You're the Whitmore family's shining star!"
###Chapter 157

Penelope flashed a triumphant smile. "Grandmother, this is merely the start. My achievements will reach far greater heights."

Margaret beamed with pride, her wrinkled face glowing. She'd always known her granddaughter was extraordinary, destined to bring prestige to the Whitmore name.

Frederick and Cassandra exchanged pleased glances. Their daughter's success meant better marriage prospects among elite families.

Then Margaret spotted Harrison lingering in the background. Her expression darkened. "Harrison! Who permitted you to attend?"

The family had been so absorbed in their celebration they'd failed to notice his arrival.

Penelope gave Harrison a dismissive glance. "I invited him, Grandmother. He wanted to bask in my success. Let him stay."

Margaret's lips thinned. Both Penelope and Isabella had brought honor to the family, while Harrison only brought disgrace. In her eyes, he never truly belonged.

Reluctantly yielding to Penelope's request, Margaret snapped, "Stay out of the way, Harrison. Don't touch anything. If anything gets damaged, you'll pay for it!"

Though Margaret was his grandmother, Harrison felt an icy stab of rejection. He remained silent, offering only a faint, resigned smile.

"Penelope!" A group of Willowridge University students approached eagerly. They were ardent admirers who'd sought her autograph just yesterday.

"What brings you all here?" Penelope asked, delighted by their attention.

The students swarmed around her, inadvertently pushing Harrison into a corner.

"Your research paper's public exhibition is today! We came to celebrate your achievement."

"Penelope, you make Willowridge proud!"

"Let's get a photo!"

Everyone clustered around the display of Penelope's paper. She positioned herself center stage, with Margaret, Frederick, and Cassandra on her left, classmates on her right.

Penelope thrust a camera at Harrison. "Take our picture!" This moment of glory demanded documentation.

Harrison examined the camera, then shook his head. "I'm afraid I can't do that."

Penelope froze. "Why not?"

At that moment, a National Medical Gallery staff member approached. "Excuse me, we need to remove this display."

Penelope stiffened. "Remove my paper? Why?"

Margaret and Frederick looked stunned. "There must be some mistake!"

"No mistake," the staff member clarified. "Dr. Sinclair identified significant errors. We're withdrawing the paper immediately."

With that, they dismantled the exhibit.

Penelope stood paralyzed, her breath shallow.

Whispers erupted among her classmates. "Dr. Sinclair found flaws in Penelope's work!"

"The National Medical Gallery rejected her paper!"

"This is humiliating - everyone will know!"

The students mumbled awkward farewells before hastily departing.

Margaret gripped Penelope's arm. "Explain this!"

All traces of confidence had vanished from Penelope's face, replaced by sheer panic. Her flawed paper had been publicly denounced by the renowned Dr. Sinclair. Soon all of Willowridge would know.

What should have been her crowning achievement had become a spectacular disgrace.
###Chapter 158

Penelope had no clue how many tongues were wagging about her behind closed doors.

She despised being the subject of gossip, particularly when it involved something this humiliating.

"Grandmother, Father, Mother, I can't comprehend how this situation escalated!" Penelope cried, her voice trembling with distress.

Frederick and Cassandra exchanged panicked glances. "Penelope, tell us you didn't offend Dr. Sinclair?"

Margaret slapped her knee in frustration. "Oh dear! Dr. Sinclair is a medical prodigy - someone we mustn't antagonize! What shall we do now?"

Harrison observed quietly as the Whitmore family descended into chaos over Dr. Sinclair's disapproval.

Penelope's eyes were red-rimmed, her composure visibly shaken.

Cassandra suddenly spoke up, her tone thoughtful. "Penelope, do we know if Dr. Sinclair is male or female?"

Frederick frowned. "What difference does that make?"

"Well," Cassandra's voice lifted with hope, "if Dr. Sinclair is a man, someone as stunning and accomplished as Penelope would surely captivate him instantly."

Margaret's expression shifted from worry to excitement. "Exactly! If Penelope became Mrs. Sinclair, our family would reach unprecedented heights! With Dr. Sinclair and Nathaniel as my grandsons-in-law, I could die a happy woman!"

Truthfully, Frederick and Cassandra had been scouting elite matches for Penelope for years. They couldn't let the second branch with Isabella outshine them. Dr. Sinclair had long been their target, being the only man who could rival Nathaniel.

Penelope's pulse quickened. She'd admired Nathaniel, but his heart clearly belonged to Isabella. She vowed to find someone equally extraordinary. Dr. Sinclair fit the bill perfectly.

A determined smile curved Penelope's lips. "Grandmother, Father, Mother, I have inside information - Dr. Sinclair has already arrived in Willowbrook."

"Truly? Where is he staying?" Margaret asked eagerly.

"Don't trouble yourselves. I'll locate Dr. Sinclair. Just await my good news." Penelope flashed a confident smile.

The family buzzed with renewed excitement.

Harrison remained silent in the corner.

Well, this should be interesting.

A melodic ringtone interrupted the moment. Harrison saw Alexander's name flashing on her screen.

Stepping outside, she answered. Alexander's voice came through immediately. "Harrison, it's my birthday today. You're coming to celebrate."

It was Alexander's birthday, and he was summoning her.

Harrison began to decline. "Alexander, I-"

He cut her off, his tone playful yet firm. "Harrison, refusal isn't an option. If you don't come, I'll personally collect you from Willowridge University."

Harrison paused. That was certainly an aggressive invitation.

"Fine, Alexander. Send the address. I'll be there later."

The location arrived instantly. Realizing she couldn't arrive empty-handed, Harrison decided to shop for a gift.

It needed to be appropriately expensive yet impersonal - she couldn't risk sending the wrong signals.

After browsing several boutiques, she settled on an elegant men's leather wallet.

With the gift neatly packaged in a luxurious gift bag, she hailed a cab to Alexander's celebration.

The birthday party was being held at an exclusive vineyard's most opulent VIP suite. The guest list comprised elite young heirs, all gathered for an evening of revelry.

Nathaniel and Isabella had already arrived.

Isabella presented her gift with a radiant smile. "Happy birthday, Alexander."

The couch overflowed with extravagant presents from luxury brands.

Sebastian and Arabella approached. "Alexander, shall we begin the festivities?"

Alexander glanced toward the entrance. "Not yet. My most important guest hasn't arrived."
###Chapter 159

The group of young men erupted into playful banter, their voices overlapping in excitement.

"What kind of friend is this? Special friend?"

"Alexander, keeping secrets from us now?"

"Come on, spill it! Bringing your mystery girl today? Who's the lucky one who caught your attention?"

Alexander's lips curled into a knowing smile as he murmured, "Quiet down, or you'll scare her away."

His response sent the crowd into a frenzy.

Nathaniel lounged on the plush sofa, his posture effortlessly elegant. Isabella sat beside him, her knowing smile barely concealed. "Nathaniel, do you think Alexander's waiting for Harrison?"

Sebastian chimed in immediately, "Absolutely. He's completely smitten with her."

Arabella shot them a venomous glare. In their exclusive social circle, outsiders rarely gained entry. Yet here was Alexander, inviting Harrison - someone completely unconnected - to his birthday celebration. The implications were clear.

Nathaniel remained composed in his tailored black ensemble, his expression unreadable as always, as if observing the scene from a distance.

The suite door swung open, revealing a graceful silhouette. Harrison had arrived.

Alexander sprang to his feet, his face lighting up. "Harrison! You came!"

With a gentle smile, Harrison extended a gift bag. "Happy birthday, Alexander."

Accepting the present, Alexander guided her to a seat. "Everyone, this is Harrison."

All eyes turned to the newcomer. "Well, Alexander, you've been hiding this stunning beauty from us," one young man teased.

"So our Alexander prefers the angelic type, does he?"

"Welcome, gorgeous," another greeted warmly. Harrison acknowledged each greeting with polite nods until her gaze landed on Nathaniel and Isabella across the room. They were already there, along with Sebastian and Arabella, all watching her intently.

One of the men made introductions. "You must know Mr. Falcon and Isabella? The power couple of our circle."

Arabella's voice dripped with sarcasm as she added, "Nathaniel and my cousin Isabella have been together forever. Anyone trying to come between them is just wasting their time."

Harrison recognized the barb aimed at her but remained silent.

Last night's impulsive attempt to flirt with Nathaniel now seemed foolish. He hadn't even acknowledged her advances.

Now seeing them together at the party, they appeared every inch the perfect couple.

She felt ridiculous for her previous actions.

Isabella glanced at Harrison before turning to Nathaniel with a smile. "Nathaniel, I'd love some wine."

Nathaniel's expression turned stern. "You know the rules - only milk for you."

Given Isabella's heart condition, Nathaniel never permitted alcohol, insisting on warm milk instead.

The group burst into laughter at their familiar dynamic. "Mr. Falcon and Ms. Whitmore are relationship goals. Nothing could ever come between them."

Sebastian, lounging casually while chewing gum, shot Harrison a pointed look. "Some people just don't know when to quit though."

Harrison felt the sting but maintained her perfect posture, refusing to react.

Arabella opened her mouth to continue, but Nathaniel's icy gaze silenced her. "Enough. This isn't my birthday party. Focus on Alexander."

The room fell quiet under his unspoken command, attention shifting back to the guest of honor.

"Alexander! Open your presents! Let's see what your beautiful friend brought you!" someone called out eagerly.
###Chapter 160

Alexander ignored all the other presents on the table. But when it came to Harrison's gift, his eyes lit up with genuine curiosity.

"I'm quite intrigued," he admitted with a playful smirk.

Sebastian carelessly tossed the gift bag onto the coffee table. Alexander reached inside to retrieve its contents.

Harrison's stomach dropped as she realized her gift might not meet Alexander's expectations. "Alexander, I was in a hurry when I bought this, so I just got you-"

She was about to say "a tie" when Alexander pulled out not an accessory, but an envelope.

Harrison froze.

"Alexander, the lovely lady wrote you a letter? Read it aloud!" someone shouted from the crowd.

Alexander unfolded the letter dramatically. "Alexander, on your special day, I wanted to give you something meaningful. The truth is, from our first meeting, I've been drawn to you. I want to be your girlfriend. Let's make this official."

Harrison's blood ran cold.

This wasn't her letter. Someone had switched the gifts.

She remembered how Sebastian had handled the bag earlier.

Harrison's eyes snapped up to meet Sebastian's, catching the smug satisfaction on his face.

It was him.

And Isabella, seated across the room, watched with barely concealed amusement. The pieces clicked into place - Isabella's scheme, executed by her ever-loyal Sebastian.

The room exploded with laughter and catcalls.

"Alexander just got himself a girlfriend for his birthday!"

"Looks like the playboy's off the market! Kiss her already!"

The crowd began chanting, urging them on.

Alexander turned to Harrison, feigning surprise. "Harrison, you really want to be with me?"

Mortified, Harrison pulled him closer and whispered urgently, "Alexander, this is a misunderstanding. I didn't write that letter..."

Alexander grinned, leaning in so close that to onlookers, it appeared they were sharing an intimate moment.

"I know," he murmured back.

Harrison blinked in shock. He knew?

"Then why-"

Alexander winked conspiratorially. "Harrison, it's my birthday. You wouldn't want to humiliate me in front of all these people, would you? If you reject me now, I'll never hear the end of it."

Harrison hesitated, torn between honesty and kindness. "So you're suggesting-"

"Harrison," Alexander interrupted with a charming smile, "let's pretend for tonight."

A fake relationship with Alexander?

Harrison didn't want to lead him on. Though Alexander had pursued her, he'd always respected her boundaries, allowing their friendship to develop naturally.

But now, with dozens of eyes watching expectantly...

Harrison couldn't bring herself to embarrass someone who'd always treated her with such consideration. In her life, such kindness had been rare.

With a resigned sigh, she nodded. "Fine."

Alexander's face lit up like Christmas morning. Before she could protest, he swept her into an embrace. "Harrison, this is the best gift ever."

The room erupted in cheers. "Alexander's finally been tamed!" someone yelled.

Amid the celebration, one pair of eyes remained cold and calculating.

Nathaniel sat motionless on the sofa, his gaze locked on the embracing couple. His expression darkened with each passing second, his fingers tightening around his glass until his knuckles turned white.
###Chapter 161
"Nathaniel."

Isabella finally broke the tense silence between them.

"You never cared for Harrison, and we both know your marriage was doomed from the start. But now she's found happiness—with Alexander. She managed to capture the heart of a man even the most elite socialites couldn't. Shouldn't we be happy for her, Nathaniel?"

Nathaniel's icy gaze sharpened, his jaw tightening at her words.

Just then, the waitstaff arrived with the birthday cake, its candles flickering softly.

"Time for the birthday boy to make a wish."

Alexander blew out the candles with a grin, then picked up the cake knife. The first slice should have gone to him, but instead, he lifted a piece toward Harrison's lips.

Harrison met his playful gaze before parting her lips. Just as she leaned in, Alexander pulled the fork away with a teasing smirk.

Recognizing the game, Harrison played along perfectly. She narrowed her eyes in mock annoyance, pouting before giving his chest a light shove.

Laughter erupted around them.

Alexander wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her close as he chuckled.

"Alexander and his gorgeous girlfriend are too adorable!"

"Who needs cake when we can just watch them?"

Their playful banter kept the mood light.

This time, when Alexander offered her the cake, Harrison took a delicate bite. Without hesitation, he kissed the spot where her lips had been, finishing the rest himself.

The room erupted in cheers and teasing remarks.

Then Harrison felt it—a piercing stare burning into her. She looked up and locked eyes with Nathaniel. His expression was unreadable, but the intensity in his gaze sent a shiver down her spine.

Was he angry? She hadn't done anything wrong. Besides, this whole setup was Isabella's idea.

Harrison flashed him a radiant smile, deliberately snuggling closer to Alexander.

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

Isabella, noticing the tension, smiled sweetly. "Nathaniel, don't they make such a perfect pair?"

Nathaniel didn't respond. Instead, he tipped his head back and drained his wine glass in one swift motion.

As the party wound down, the four of them stepped outside.

Isabella was practically glowing. "Harrison, now that you're Alexander's girlfriend, we should double-date sometime."

Harrison nodded, lips curving. "I'd love that."

Alexander turned to Nathaniel. "I owe you, man. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be with Harrison right now."

Nathaniel's expression remained blank. "Owe me for what?"

"Don't you remember? When I asked if you had feelings for her, you said no—but still gave me tips on how to win her over. The whole 'buy her a designer bag' advice didn't work, but still, thanks."

Nathaniel's eyes locked onto Harrison.

Her clear, almond-shaped gaze met his. She remembered all too well how Nathaniel had coached Alexander on how to pursue her.

Isabella looped her arm through Nathaniel's, beaming. "Harrison did take care of Nathaniel for three years. He just wanted to repay her by helping her find someone worthy."

Harrison linked her arm with Alexander's, her smile dazzling as she faced Nathaniel. "Well then, congratulations, Mr. Falcon. You got exactly what you wanted."

Nathaniel said nothing, his gaze never leaving her.

"I'll take you home, Harrison."

"Alright."

Alexander opened the passenger door of his sleek sports car with a flourish. Harrison slid in, and within seconds, the car vanished into the night.

Watching them drive away, Isabella turned to Nathaniel with a satisfied smile.

"Nathaniel, shall we go?"
###Chapter 162

Nathaniel withdrew his arm from Isabella's grasp with deliberate coldness. "I've been drinking," he stated flatly. "Dominic will take me back to the office. You can find your own way home."

The Rolls Royce pulled up smoothly. Nathaniel entered without another glance as the car disappeared down the street.

Isabella remained standing alone, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. Things were progressing exactly as planned.

Arabella stormed over, her designer heels clicking angrily against the pavement. "Can you believe Harrison actually wrote Alexander a love letter? The audacity!"

The forged letter had been Sebastian's handiwork at Isabella's request - a detail she'd carefully omitted from Arabella. This was all part of her grand scheme: pushing Harrison toward Alexander while stoking Arabella's resentment.

"Darling, Harrison isn't worthy of Alexander," Isabella purred, patting Arabella's arm. "But you know how men are - they always chase what they can't have. Trust me, his interest won't last."

She was certain a man like Alexander - so similar to Nathaniel - might be momentarily dazzled by a pretty face, but such infatuations never endured. Harrison's rural background and lack of education would soon bore him.

Arabella seemed convinced, yet her expression remained stormy.

Isabella offered a conspiratorial smile. "Don't fret, darling. I consider you family. I'll make sure you and Alexander end up together."

"You're amazing, Isabella!" Arabella gushed, embracing her tightly.

Isabella's smile didn't reach her eyes as her mind raced ahead.

Sebastian approached, unusually animated. "Love is in the air, isn't it? Maybe I should try my luck."

Both women turned, intrigued. "Sebastian, who's caught your eye?" Isabella asked. Who could possibly interest Willowbrook's most notorious playboy?

His grin turned wolfish. "That genius freshman - Nathaniel's protégé."

Isabella froze, her smile turning brittle. She loathed that so-called "genius freshman." A surge of possessive jealousy twisted in her gut.

"Have you even met her?" Isabella asked sharply.

"Not yet," Sebastian admitted carelessly.

Isabella arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "So you're... online dating now?" The idea was absurd.

Sebastian pulled out his phone. When Nathaniel had added him to that group chat, he'd noticed the genius freshman - W - was also included. His fingers flew across the screen as he tagged W with a flirty message:

[Hey gorgeous, got a boyfriend?]

He chuckled. "Let's see how she responds."

Isabella seethed with envy. "Please. You're Willowbrook's most eligible bachelor. She's probably squealing with excitement right now."

Ding!

Sebastian's face lit up. "She replied! Uh... 'Get lost'?"

The two-word response - [Get lost!] - hung in the air.

Sebastian looked stunned. Isabella and Arabella exchanged shocked glances.

Meanwhile, in his corner office, Nathaniel stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, his imposing frame silhouetted against the city lights. Harrison's delicate features haunted him.

That love letter to Alexander.

The way she'd playfully punched Alexander's chest, all innocent smiles and fluttering lashes.

Last night's video call - offering him a taste of her ice cream with that coy smile. Today, feeding cake to Alexander.

Nathaniel's laugh was bitter. When she couldn't secure his attention, she'd simply moved on to Alexander? Using the same seductive tricks?

Ding!

His phone vibrated with an incoming notification.
###Chapter 163
Nathaniel unlocked his phone, the screen illuminating his sharp features. His thumb swiped open Instagram, where Alexander's latest post dominated his feed.

A candid shot from Willowridge University's football field. No faces visible, just elongated shadows stretching across the turf. One silhouette was petite and elegant, the other tall and broad-shouldered—clearly Harrison and Alexander.

The caption read: [Greatest birthday present ever.]

Likes and comments poured in instantly from their elite circle.

[Alex, birthday boy shouldn't be slumming it on campus!]
[What's with the college tour? The penthouse at The Grand Celeste is ready for you!]
[Amateurs. He's obviously crashing in the girls' dorm tonight.]
[Freshman girls hit different, don't they?]

Nathaniel's grip tightened around his phone. His mind flashed to Harrison's dorm room—that narrow bed with floral sheets where he'd slept weeks ago. Where they'd lain together, limbs tangled.

Would Alexander be lying there tonight too?

He exhaled sharply through his nose. Both he and Alexander were considered unattainable prizes in Willowbrook's high society. Yet here they were, orbiting the same woman. He couldn't decide whether to be furious or impressed.

The office door creaked open. Dominic entered, immediately sensing the glacial atmosphere. "Mr. Falcon," he ventured, "is this about Mrs. Falcon and Mr. Graves?"

Nathaniel's fingers tugged at his silk tie but remained silent.

"Sir, with all due respect, you've always preferred Ms. Isabella. Why does Mrs. Falcon's companionship bother you now? Weren't you the one who encouraged Mr. Graves to pursue her?"

A file crashed against the mahogany desk. Dominic barely dodged the flying paperwork as Nathaniel's cobalt eyes burned into him.

"I'll just... check on the Tokyo merger." Dominic scrambled backward, nearly tripping over the Persian rug in his haste to escape.

The door clicked shut. Nathaniel snatched his car keys from the obsidian desk organizer. The Phantom's engine roared to life before his assistant could blink.

At Willowridge, Alexander had just walked Harrison back from dinner. They lingered near the track field, the evening breeze carrying the scent of freshly cut grass.

"How did you know that letter wasn't from me?" Harrison tilted her head, curiosity sparkling in her hazel eyes.

Alexander's lips quirked. "Because you'd never write something so cliché." The ease between them was effortless, like slipping into a favorite sweater. Harrison found herself smiling without realizing it.

Ding.

Her phone vibrated. WhatsApp displayed a message from "Husband"—the first direct communication in their entire marriage.

[Outside now.]

Three words. A command, not a request.

[I'm still on campus,] she typed back.

[Look up.]

Her pulse stuttered.

There, beyond the wrought-iron gates, sat a matte black Rolls-Royce Phantom—Nathaniel's signature car. The streetlights glinted off its custom hood ornament, drawing whispers from passing students.

Luxury vehicles weren't uncommon near campus, but this? A Phantom with vanity plates reading "FALCON1"? That was the stuff of campus legend.

Female students slowed their steps, nudging each other as they eyed the car—and more importantly, whoever might be inside it.

###Chapter 164

The darkened windows of the Bentley Continental concealed its occupants completely. Harrison couldn't see Nathaniel's face, but she felt the intensity of his piercing stare burning into her and Alexander. Why had he appeared out of nowhere like this?

She turned to Alexander. "It's getting late. I should return to campus now."

Alexander flashed his signature charming smile. "Next time then." His Lamborghini roared to life and disappeared down the street.

Harrison waited until the taillights vanished before approaching the Bentley. She opened the rear door and slipped inside.

The luxury sedan moved silently through the neon-lit streets. Nathaniel's strong hands gripped the wheel, his chiseled profile illuminated intermittently by passing streetlights, creating an aura of dangerous allure.

Harrison broke the tense silence first. "Mr. Falcon, did you need something?"

His voice was ice. "Are you seriously involved with Alexander?"

"Yes."

"You're not his type."

"And why is that?"

"The Graves family would never accept someone like you. They want an heiress from their social circle. You'll never be more than his temporary distraction."

His words stung, but she refused to show it. "Then I'll enjoy being distracted."

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the steering wheel as his eyes met hers in the mirror.

Harrison held his gaze defiantly, a smirk playing on her lips. "What's there to lose? He's handsome, wealthy - exactly what every girl wants."

The atmosphere grew suffocating.

Harrison found it ironic. Nathaniel had been parading Isabella around publicly - who was he to judge her choices? "If that's all, please take me back now."

"Move to the front," he commanded.

Her pulse quickened. What did he want? Was this about settling their unresolved matters?

She slid into the passenger seat and buckled up.

Nathaniel studied her flawless features. "Do you know what I'm thinking?"

Harrison bit her plump lower lip, the flesh blanching then immediately returning to its rosy fullness.

"If you end things with Alexander, I might-"

His words were cut off as Harrison suddenly leaned across and pressed her lips to his cheek.

Nathaniel froze.

She pulled back, challenging him. "Go ahead then."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he scoffed. "Does Alexander know you'd betray him so easily?"

Harrison's eyes locked onto his. "This is the first and last time, Nathaniel. After this, stay out of my life."

The car stopped at a red light. Nathaniel turned his darkened gaze toward her. Harrison's delicate hand moved to his shoulder as she closed the distance between them, capturing his lips in a searing kiss.
###Chapter 165

Nathaniel's anger flared at her words—this was supposed to be their last time, and she had the audacity to tell him not to seek her out again.

Harrison's plush lips parted, ready to speak, but he shoved her away impatiently.

Yet her delicate fingers, which had been resting on his shoulder, slid up to encircle his neck, pulling herself flush against him.

"Nathaniel, don't push me away!"

Her bright, shimmering eyes locked onto his, her voice a velvet whisper laced with playful defiance.

The challenge in her tone coiled his muscles tight.

"Same rules," she murmured. "Our little secret. Isabella won't hear a word."

She kissed him again.

Nathaniel's darkened gaze burned, heat rushing to his face. A man who had tasted such pleasure once was like a beast, forever craving that intoxicating rush. Her boldness, her persistence—it ignited him effortlessly.

Resistance crumbled. As she pressed closer, he seized control, his large hand gripping her smooth, fragrant shoulder, ready to drag her onto his lap.

Honk!

A sharp blare shattered the moment—the light had turned green.

The car behind them swerved past, likely biting back frustration at the sight of the Bentley and its elite license plate, knowing better than to make a scene.

Nathaniel and Harrison jerked apart. Her cheeks burned as she sank back into her seat, suddenly aware they were still in the car.

Nathaniel hit the gas, the luxury vehicle surging forward.

Silence stretched between them. His hand remained on the wheel, the other—adorned with a platinum watch—resting at his side.

Then, a soft, tentative touch. Her pinky brushed against his fingers, feather-light. Nathaniel's pulse jumped, that whisper of contact sending a shiver through him.

A woman like her knew exactly how to unravel him, attuned to his every unspoken desire.

He captured her pinky, squeezing gently before threading their fingers together, pulling her delicate hand into his warm grasp.

His grip was firm, possessive.

The earlier tension dissolved. Harrison turned to gaze out the window. "Where are we going?"

Nathaniel hummed, lazy and noncommittal. "Hmm?"

"A hotel? Or your place?" she ventured.

He didn't answer.

Soon, Harrison realized they weren't heading to either—the car had merged onto the highway.

Her cheeks flamed. He had helped her, and this was her payment.

Her lithe body leaned in again. Soft lips traced his jaw, her hand drifting toward the hard planes of his chest.

But Nathaniel caught her wrist, his voice a rough, teasing growl. "Is that all you've got?"

His gaze was heavy, the look of a man who knew exactly what he wanted—and how to take it.

She realized it then—Nathaniel could be downright wicked when he wanted.

Harrison arched a delicate brow, her innocent features tinged with something far more enticing. "Oh, I have skills you haven't even seen yet."

A low, rasping laugh rumbled from his throat. "Prove it."

His tone was pure, sinful amusement.

Harrison claimed his lips, her kisses trailing down his throat...

Exhausted, Harrison stumbled back into the girls' dorm later, collapsing onto her bed. She slept for two days straight, as if drained of every ounce of energy.
###Chapter 166

Rosalind yanked Harrison up from the couch. "Harrison, wake up! What were you doing? You look completely exhausted."

Harrison rubbed her bleary eyes and groaned, "Just five more minutes..."

"Not a chance! We're going out." Rosalind dragged her friend toward the door.

Within the hour, they found themselves in an opulent private suite at The Velvet Lounge. Familiar faces surrounded them - Isabella, Sebastian, Arabella, and several wealthy socialites.

Sebastian stretched lazily on the plush sofa. "Isabella, Nathaniel's been overseas for two days, right? Is he returning tonight?"

Since that fateful evening, Nathaniel had departed abruptly. Harrison hadn't seen him since.

No calls. No messages. Just an unspoken understanding that whatever happened between them would remain their secret.

Isabella smirked knowingly. "He's flying back tonight."

"Did you hear?" Sebastian continued. "Mr. Falcon got caught speeding on the highway that night. Three points deducted from his license. Wild, right?"

Isabella froze, clearly unaware of the incident.

But Harrison knew exactly what had happened. That night, she and Nathaniel had been racing down the highway, doing far more than just speeding. The traffic cameras had captured everything.

A perfect example of reckless behavior.

"What got into him? Bad day?" Sebastian pressed.

Harrison tugged at Rosalind's sleeve. "Let's go."

Before they could leave, Arabella's excited voice cut through the room. "Isabella! Nathaniel bought you a gift abroad!"

Isabella's face lit up. "What is it?"

"My friend just texted me," Arabella gushed. "She saw Nathaniel at Alber's boutique ordering that ruby and diamond necklace you've been obsessing over!"

Isabella's eyes sparkled. She'd coveted that particular piece for months. The thought of Nathaniel remembering made her pulse quicken.

Sebastian and the others chuckled. "No question it's for you, Isabella."

"Mr. Falcon's so romantic. Even on business trips, he's thinking of you."

"You must show us when you get it! Nobody in our circle has that piece yet."

Isabella beamed. "You're all terrible when Nathaniel's not here to defend himself."

Harrison pulled at Rosalind again, desperate to leave. Rosalind muttered angrily, "He spoils Isabella rotten. Buying her expensive jewelry while abroad. Has he forgotten who his actual wife is?"

The words "actual wife" stabbed Harrison's heart. She forced a bitter smile.

Nathaniel had never gifted her anything. Once, she'd admired a handbag he'd bought, thinking it was for her. Her compliment had backfired spectacularly - leading to that humiliating joke about Alexander gifting her bags instead.

Ding!

Her phone vibrated. A WhatsApp notification.

Harrison unlocked her device. Her breath caught - a message from Nathaniel.

He'd sent a photo.

Her pulse raced as she recognized the ruby and diamond necklace. The accompanying message was brief, typical Nathaniel:

[You like it?]

###Chapter 167

Harrison froze, unsure what Nathaniel meant.

Wasn't the emerald necklace meant for Isabella?

Why was he asking if she liked it?

Could he have purchased two - one for Isabella and one for her?

With his wealth, it wasn't impossible.

Harrison nearly laughed at the absurdity. Whatever his intentions, she wouldn't play guessing games anymore. That highway encounter had settled everything between them - no debts remained.

She pocketed her phone without responding.

Just then, Isabella approached with a radiant smile. "Harrison! What brings you here?"

Her mood clearly soared, likely from hearing about Nathaniel's emerald gift. As someone who adored luxury, this news must have made her day.

Harrison nodded. "Just passing time."

"Nathaniel's taking Arabella and me to the Silver Pines Resort this weekend. Famous for their mineral springs. You and Alexander should join us!"

Harrison recognized Isabella's insincerity. Since Alexander's birthday, Isabella had been making her moves.

Meeting Isabella's gaze, Harrison smiled faintly. "Sounds lovely. I'm free anyway."

Returning to her dorm with Rosalind, Harrison took a steaming shower. As she finished, her phone rang.

Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen.

Her pulse quickened as she answered, his deep voice resonating through the receiver. "Come outside."

He wanted her to meet him.

After a brief hesitation, Harrison threw on a jacket and stepped out.

The Bentley Continental GT waited at the gates, just like before. Nathaniel leaned against the luxury vehicle, looking every bit the powerful CEO.

Fresh from his business trip, he wore a charcoal overcoat over a crisp white shirt and tailored vest. Passing students stole glances, some even turning for second looks.

Rumors claimed CEOs like him favored young students, but honestly - what girl wouldn't be drawn to a wealthy, handsome man like Nathaniel?

This marked his second visit to Willowridge University's gates recently. His appearances were becoming more frequent.

Harrison jogged over. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel straightened, his gaze locking onto her face. "You ignored my message."

He meant the WhatsApp question about the necklace.

Harrison lied smoothly. "Didn't see it."

Nathaniel's expression cooled. Without another word, he opened the passenger door and retrieved a branded bag, thrusting it toward her. "Here."

The Cartier logo gleamed on the bag containing the emerald and diamond necklace.

Straight from his trip, he'd come to deliver this.

Harrison didn't accept it. "Thank you, but I can't."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. Fresh from her shower, her raven hair cascaded in damp waves, her face bare and glowing - skin like freshly peeled lychee.

She looked so pure, so untouched, it was impossible not to be drawn in.

When she spoke, those liquid eyes met his directly, just like that night in the car - soft, sweet, compliant.

Nathaniel's voice dropped dangerously. "You dislike it?"

Harrison shook her head. "Mr. Falcon, gifts aren't necessary. That night, I said - please don't seek me out again."

His expression darkened instantly. With a bitter laugh, he tossed the bag into a nearby trash bin.

Nathaniel slid into the Bentley, slammed the door, and roared away with a press of the accelerator.
###Chapter 168

He was gone.

But Harrison's mind wasn't on Nathaniel's departure. What consumed her thoughts was his outrageous action - how could he casually discard that exquisite ruby necklace as if it were worthless trash?

That single gemstone was valued at more than a million dollars!

Even for someone of his wealth, such extravagance was unacceptable!

Without hesitation, Harrison dove for the trash bin, retrieving the velvet pouch. Relief washed over her when she found it pristine - what a tragedy it would've been if damaged!

Back in her dorm room, Harrison sat before her vanity and opened the ornate jewelry box. The ruby and diamond necklace sparkled brilliantly under the light, its breathtaking beauty leaving her momentarily speechless.

Nathaniel had always possessed impeccable taste. Born into aristocracy, the Falcon Enterprises heir had an eye for only the finest things. Anything he selected was guaranteed to be extraordinary.

Though financially comfortable herself, Harrison rarely indulged in such luxuries. This marked the first gift Nathaniel had ever given her.

She fastened the ruby necklace around her slender neck.

Her porcelain skin glowed against the gemstone's deep red hue, her swan-like neck and delicate collarbones providing the perfect canvas. The effect was both ethereal and dazzling.

Harrison quickly snapped a selfie and sent it to her best friend Gabrielle.

The immediate reply came with excited emojis. [OMG! That's absolutely stunning! I'm obsessed!]

Harrison typed back on WhatsApp. [From Mr. Falcon.]

Gabrielle's tone shifted instantly. [That arrogant bastard? Harrison, you must've pleased him exceptionally well to earn a ruby necklace as payment.]

A blush crept across Harrison's cheeks. She knew the truth - it was indeed compensation.

Nathaniel understood how to pamper his woman, how to show appreciation.

[Should I throw it away?] Harrison asked.

[Are you seriously considering that?]

[Not really.]

This necklace cost more than most people made in years!

[Then keep it.]

[Keep it?]

[The real question is - do you love it?]

Harrison studied her reflection. The ruby complemented her perfectly. [I do.]

Gabrielle responded decisively. [Then it's settled. You're Mrs. Falcon. Why refuse what's rightfully yours?] Harrison conceded. [Fine. He thinks it's in the trash anyway. He'll never know I'm wearing it.]

As Harrison set her phone down, it slipped from her grasp. In her frantic attempt to catch it, her fingers accidentally took a screenshot - and worse, sent it to the wrong contact.

Who received it?

"Hubby."

She'd just forwarded her entire conversation with Gabrielle to Nathaniel! Damn it!

Harrison immediately recalled the message. "He won't see it," she muttered, trying to calm herself.

Meanwhile at Falcon Enterprises, Nathaniel sat in his office, jaw clenched in frustration.

During his international business trip, he'd spotted the ruby in a luxury magazine and immediately envisioned it gracing Harrison's neck. He'd ordered Dominic to acquire it immediately.

Upon landing, he'd delivered it personally.

Only for her to reject it and tell him to leave her alone.

His dark mood deepened until his phone pinged with a notification.

A WhatsApp message. He opened it to find Harrison's screenshot: [Are you seriously considering that?] [Not really.] [The real question is - do you love it?] [I do.] [He thinks it's in the trash anyway. He'll never know I'm wearing it.]

The message disappeared as Harrison recalled it.

Too late.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a knowing smirk. He selected an emoji and sent his reply.

Back in her dorm, Harrison was still convincing herself he hadn't seen anything. The busy CEO couldn't possibly check messages immediately.

She could pretend this never happened.

Then her phone buzzed with a response from "Hubby."
###Chapter 169

Harrison stared at her phone screen where "Hubby" had sent a wink emoji.

Her fingers froze mid-air.

A second later, she buried her face in her hands and let out a muffled scream.

Across town, Nathaniel sat in his office at Falcon Enterprises, watching the chat window flicker with Harrison's typing indicator.

Minutes passed.

Then—silence.

The storm in Nathaniel's dark eyes cleared, replaced by quiet amusement.

She couldn't handle teasing.

His mind drifted to the screenshot he'd seen earlier—her delicate throat adorned with that ruby necklace.

Stunning.

And what had her best friend called him?

That jerk?

"Harrison, you must've pleased him well. A ruby necklace as a reward?"

Nathaniel's grip tightened around his phone.

Memories of the car flashed through his mind—her boldness, her defiance.

She had surprised him.

That was why, during his brief trip abroad, he'd bought the necklace the moment he saw it.

They hadn't crossed that line yet, but Harrison was the first woman who had ever taken care of him like that.

A man never forgets his first.

The office door swung open.

Isabella strode in, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "Nathaniel, you're back?"

He hummed in response.

Without hesitation, she perched herself on his lap, arms looping around his neck. "Where's my gift?"

Nathaniel stilled.

He'd bought one for Harrison.

But nothing for Isabella.

In fact, the thought hadn't even crossed his mind.

Seeing the expectation in her eyes, he exhaled. "Forgot. Tell me what you want. My secretary will handle it."

Isabella blinked. "But—the Alber ruby and diamond necklace? That wasn't for me?"

She had been certain it was hers.

Nathaniel's jaw tensed. "I ordered it. Didn't buy it for you."

Disappointment flickered across her face, but she quickly masked it.

"Anyway," she said, brightening, "I've planned something fun. A getaway. In two days, you, me, Harrison, and Alexander are all going to Silver Pines Resort."

Nathaniel's expression didn't change. "Harrison agreed?"

"Mm-hmm. She's dating Alexander now. It'll be a double date."

Harrison—Alexander's girlfriend.

So what happened in the car that day?

Just repayment?

A way to clear her debt?

She'd told him to stay away.

And now she was choosing Alexander?

Nathaniel could tolerate many things.

But not this.

Alexander was his childhood friend. His brother in all but blood.

Nathaniel would never accept this.

"Fine," he said coolly.

"Nathaniel." Isabella cupped his face, her gaze soft. "Did you miss me?"

He removed her hand and nudged her off his lap. "I just got back. Work to do. You should go."

Work. Always work.

Didn't he have needs? Desires?

Isabella clenched her fists, frustration simmering beneath her perfect smile.

Two days later, Harrison and Alexander arrived at Silver Pines Resort.

Nathaniel and Isabella were already there.

The hotel manager greeted them with a bow. "Mr. Falcon, Mr. Graves, welcome! The two best ocean-view suites are ready for you."
###Chapter 170

Isabella linked her arm through Nathaniel's. "Let's share a room."

Alexander draped an arm over Harrison's shoulders. "We'll take the other one."

Nathaniel's gaze snapped to Harrison.

She nodded. "Alright."

She agreed.

To share a room with Alexander.

Nathaniel's jaw locked.

Harrison felt his stare and met it head-on.

What was his problem?

The memory of last night's awkward WhatsApp exchange resurfaced—her frantic backpedaling, his unreadable responses.

Now, she simply looked away.

The manager beamed. "We have the Presidential Oceanic Suite and the Executive Oceanic Suite. How would you like to divide them?"

Isabella smirked. "I'll take the Presidential Suite. Harrison, you two can have the Executive."

Harrison smiled slowly. "Actually, the Executive Suite suits you better. Alexander and I will take the Presidential."

Isabella's face darkened.

Was Harrison seriously challenging her?

"Nathaniel," she whined, batting her lashes, "I want the Presidential Suite!"

Truthfully, Nathaniel and Alexander couldn't care less about the rooms.

But the women were already at war.

The manager cleared his throat. "How about a little competition? Winner takes the Presidential Suite."

Isabella arched a brow. "What kind?"

"A race. Ten minutes to the beachfront villa. Two sports cars are ready."

A race?

Isabella grinned. "Deal."

Harrison nodded. "I'm in."

Isabella scoffed. "You're going to lose. Nathaniel always wins."

She turned to Nathaniel. "Win it for me!"

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Harrison before leading Isabella to one car.

Alexander smirked. "You might be surprised."

Nathaniel frowned—just as Alexander tossed the keys to Harrison.

She slid into the driver's seat.

Alexander took the passenger side.

Isabella gaped. "You're racing?"

This wasn't Nathaniel vs. Alexander.

It was Nathaniel vs. Harrison.

Harrison adjusted her black sunglasses and met Nathaniel's eyes.

A slow, challenging smile curved her lips. "May the best man—or woman—win."

Nathaniel's pulse kicked.

He hadn't expected this.

How good was she?

"Ready, set, go!"

The cars shot forward like bullets.

Nathaniel had raced for years. He was unbeatable.

Yet when he glanced in the rearview mirror—Harrison's car matched his perfectly.

No matter how he pushed, she stayed right beside him.

Interesting.

If she wanted to play, he'd indulge her.

A smirk tugged at his lips as he gripped the wheel tighter.

This just got fun.
###Chapter 171

Nathaniel's sleek sports car veered sharply toward Harrison, attempting to push her off the racetrack.

Harrison didn't flinch. The right side of her vehicle scraped against the concrete barrier, sending a shower of sparks into the air. In one fluid motion, she executed a perfect drift and accelerated after Nathaniel.

Her handling was masterful, bordering on breathtaking.

Nathaniel watched her through narrowed eyes. The wind whipped through Harrison's dark tresses, strands clinging to her flushed cheeks and graceful neck. The sunlight caught her features just right, making her glow with an almost ethereal radiance.

Behind her sunglasses, she turned her head slightly and flipped him off.

"Damn," Nathaniel growled, a rough chuckle escaping his lips. Something primal stirred in his chest at her defiance.

She made his blood burn.

In his mind, Harrison was just a small-town girl who kept causing trouble around him. But moments like this - her sharp wit outmaneuvering opponents, her ruthless racing tactics, her fearless driving - made him question everything.

Which version was the real Harrison?

She was an enigma wrapped in mystery.

Having made the first move, Nathaniel couldn't back down now. This was war.

Harrison spotted an upcoming obstacle and swerved, trying to force Nathaniel into a bad position. But he accelerated downhill, executing a flawless drift that sent his car shooting past hers like a bullet.

Their eyes met briefly. Nathaniel merely shrugged, his lips curling into a lazy smirk.

Harrison's crimson lips parted in a challenging smile, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

This was a duel between equals.

Adrenaline pumped through their veins as speed became their shared language.

The two high-performance machines raced neck-and-neck, creating the most electrifying spectacle on the track.

In the passenger seat, Alexander whooped with excitement. "Harrison! I had no idea you could drive like this! Nathaniel must be losing his mind - no one's ever matched him before."

Harrison chuckled darkly.

"But the finish line's coming up," Alexander added. "If you don't pass him soon, you might lose that Presidential Suite after all."

Harrison's gaze flicked to the approaching finish line. "Relax. Help is on the way."

Help?

What help?

Isabella sat clutching her seat, green with envy as Harrison kept pace with Nathaniel. The sight made her physically ill.

How was this happening? Harrison was supposed to be some backwater nobody. Since when could she drive like a professional?

Why did she have to shine so damn bright?

Isabella turned to Nathaniel. His entire focus was on Harrison. Racing was his passion, and Harrison was proving to be his perfect match.

The jealousy burned like acid in Isabella's chest. Her congenital heart condition already made the high-speed ride uncomfortable. The toxic emotions only worsened the tightness in her chest.

She gasped, pressing a hand to her heart.

"Nathaniel!" she cried out.

The final stretch loomed ahead. Nathaniel was about to floor the accelerator when Isabella's pained cry reached him. He glanced over to see her face had gone deathly pale.

Immediately, he eased off the gas.

At that exact moment, Harrison's car roared past the finish line in a blur of motion. Victory was hers.

Nathaniel pulled over and rushed to Isabella's side. Though her condition had stabilized, her complexion remained ghostly white.

Harrison and Alexander emerged from their car as a Silver Pines staff member presented Harrison with the keys to the Presidential Suite.

Harrison accepted them with a triumphant smile, turning to Nathaniel and Isabella.

"Mr. Falcon, Isabella, thank you for the generous concession," she said sweetly.

Isabella's face twisted in rage. "You little-"

Harrison ignored her, flashing a dazzling smile before turning on her heel and walking away with effortless grace.

Isabella stood trembling, her fury threatening to boil over.
###Chapter 172

Alexander chuckled. "So the 'help' Harrison mentioned was Isabella."

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "Help?"

"Earlier, you and Harrison were neck and neck," Alexander explained. "Harrison said Isabella has a weak heart. Even if you're the best driver, Isabella can't handle the speed. She was bound to help Harrison win."

Did she really say that?

Nathaniel's gaze followed Harrison's retreating figure, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Alexander nudged him. "She's intriguing, isn't she?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

Meanwhile, Isabella stood ignored, feeling invisible.

Harrison and Alexander entered the Presidential Suite with its breathtaking ocean view, while Isabella and Nathaniel headed to the Executive Suite.

Gabrielle and Arabella had arrived, eager to visit the resort's famous hot springs that evening.

Gabrielle grabbed Harrison's arm. "Let's go bikini shopping!"

The swimwear section overwhelmed them with endless styles.

Gabrielle gushed, "With your figure, we must find the perfect bikini to showcase it!"

Arabella's mocking voice cut in. "An ugly duckling remains an ugly duckling. How could you compare to a swan?"

Isabella and Arabella had joined them.

Soon, Nathaniel and Alexander entered too.

Alexander moved to Harrison's side. "What are you two discussing?"

Arabella sneered, "Harrison was picking a bikini to flaunt herself before all the men."

Harrison stayed silent.

Gabrielle opened her mouth, but Harrison stopped her with a gesture.

Arabella continued, "Isabella's the prima ballerina - her body is perfection. Others might try to copy her, but it's just pathetic."

Harrison recalled Isabella's similar accusations about copying her style.

Yet Harrison felt no anger. She noticed Nathaniel watching her, his gaze sweeping her figure. She looked away, wondering if he found her inferior to Isabella.

Alexander frowned. "Arabella, must you always be so rude?"

Arabella paled. "Alexander, I-"

Harrison interrupted with a smile. "It's fine. Let's just pick a bikini, Gabrielle."

Her eyes landed on a pink bikini. "I'll take that one."

The shopkeeper smiled. "Excellent choice. This pink suits your fair complexion beautifully."

As the bikini was taken down, Isabella suddenly declared, "I want that one too!" She'd chosen the same pink bikini, sparking a competition.

Harrison met Isabella's smug gaze. For Isabella, body display was her forte. She might have lost the race, but she aimed to outshine everyone at the hot springs, capturing all male attention.

She doubted Harrison, the simple country girl, dared compete with her.

The shopkeeper hesitated. "But...we only have one pink left..."

"Simple business - highest bidder wins," Isabella said sweetly, linking arms with Nathaniel. She batted her lashes. "Nathaniel, buy me that pink bikini."
###Chapter 173

What began as a competition had now escalated into a display of wealth.

When it came to money, Nathaniel, the wealthiest man in Willowbrook, never backed down.

Isabella flashed him a coquettish smile, her delicate features glowing as she begged him to buy the bikini.

Nathaniel's gaze flickered between Isabella and Harrison.

Harrison met his eyes with a calm, steady look.

Isabella clung to his arm, pouting prettily. "Nathaniel, please? I want it so much!"

Nathaniel turned to the shopkeeper. "I'll pay double."

He offered twice the price for Isabella's bikini.

Isabella lifted her chin triumphantly, shooting Harrison a smug look that screamed, See? He chose me.

Alexander stepped forward immediately. "Nathaniel, you're ruining the fun. Sir, I'll pay triple."

He was determined to buy the bikini for Harrison.

Harrison shook her head. "Alexander, it's really not necessary—"

"Oh, but it is," Alexander countered with a grin. "I want to see you wear it."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Four times."

Alexander didn't hesitate. "Five."

The battle between the two men intensified.

"Six," Nathaniel snapped.

Before Alexander could respond, Harrison placed a gentle hand on his arm. "Alexander, I don’t want the pink one anymore."

She pointed to a striking emerald bikini. "I’d prefer that one."

The shopkeeper eagerly retrieved it. "Excellent choice, miss. It’ll look stunning on you."

Harrison gave Alexander a playful smile. "Would you buy this for me instead?"

Alexander understood immediately—she was diffusing the tension, sparing his pride while keeping things light.

She was always so considerate.

"Of course," he said warmly.

He paid for the emerald bikini without hesitation.

Harrison casually tossed the pink bikini to Isabella. "Here, you can have it. I’ve changed my mind."

Isabella froze, her expression shifting from smug to stunned.

Gabrielle laughed. "How funny—someone paid six times the price for something Harrison didn’t even want."

Isabella was speechless.

"Harrison, let’s go change," Gabrielle said, smirking at Nathaniel. "By the way, Alexander bought the emerald one. You should wear it for him."

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

Harrison smiled at Alexander. "Thank you. I’ll go get ready."

Alexander nodded. "Take your time."

Harrison and Gabrielle headed to the changing rooms.

Meanwhile, Isabella stood frozen, clutching the pink bikini, humiliation burning through her. She couldn’t throw it away, but keeping it felt like defeat.

Arabella’s face twisted with envy, resentment simmering toward Alexander for favoring Harrison.

By the time they reached the hot springs, Nathaniel and Alexander were already there. Isabella and Arabella followed shortly after.

Arabella called out eagerly, "Nathaniel, Isabella’s here!"

Nathaniel glanced up as Isabella stepped into view, the pink bikini hugging her dancer’s figure—toned from years of ballet, curves perfectly accentuated. Her long, wavy hair cascaded down her back, making her look like a vision. A rose in full bloom.

The moment she entered, every man in the hot springs turned to stare.

Isabella basked in the attention, accustomed to the admiring gazes. She had always thrived under the spotlight.
###Chapter 174

Harrison dipped her toes into the steaming hot spring water. She moved cautiously toward Nathaniel's side.

"Nathaniel, do I look attractive today?"

Before Nathaniel could respond, Gabrielle pulled Harrison into the pool with a splash.

"Come on, Harrison! The water's perfect!"

Nathaniel's gaze lifted to Harrison. She had changed into a sapphire blue bikini but seemed uncomfortable, clutching a towel around her shoulders.

Isabella smirked. "What's with the towel, Harrison? Ashamed of your body?"

Arabella watched with amusement, clearly enjoying the unfolding drama.

"Don't be shy, Harrison. Show us what you've got!" Gabrielle laughed as she yanked the towel away.

Harrison gasped as the fabric slipped from her grasp.

The sapphire bikini contrasted beautifully with her porcelain skin - not the artificial perfection of Isabella's salon-tanned complexion, but a natural glow like morning dew on rose petals. Her curves were elegant yet pronounced, her waist narrow like a Grecian urn.

Nathaniel's breath caught when he saw her.

"Join us, Harrison!" Gabrielle reached out.

Harrison's foot slipped on the wet tiles. She stumbled forward.

Nathaniel moved instinctively, but Alexander was quicker. His strong arms caught Harrison effortlessly.

"Careful there," Alexander murmured, his eyes drinking in her beauty.

Gabrielle grinned. "So Alexander, what do you think of Harrison in that bikini?"

Alexander didn't hesitate. "Breathtaking."

"Then this trip was worth every penny."

"Absolutely."

A blush crept up Harrison's neck. She shot Gabrielle a warning look.

Alexander's hands lingered. "Need help getting steady?"

Harrison straightened in the water. "I'm fine now, thank you."

They moved to a quieter corner of the pool.

Nathaniel's outstretched hand slowly lowered to his side, his expression darkening.

Isabella stood frozen. Next to Harrison, her own carefully cultivated beauty suddenly seemed artificial. All eyes that had been on her moments ago were now fixed on Harrison.

A handsome stranger approached their group. Arabella whispered excitedly, "Isabella, he's definitely coming for you!"

The man walked right past Isabella and stopped before Harrison. "Excuse me, miss. Could I have your number?"

Arabella's mouth fell open.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms.

Alexander immediately pulled Harrison close. "She's taken."

Harrison played her part perfectly. "Sorry, my boyfriend beat you to it."

The stranger walked away disappointed.

As Harrison and Alexander shared a quiet laugh, she suddenly felt an icy stare. Looking up, she met Nathaniel's glacial gaze - his eyes burning with something dangerous.
###Chapter 175

Harrison felt a strange unease. Why was Nathaniel staring at her like that?

Isabella stood right beside him, yet his intense gaze remained fixed on Harrison. Lately, his attention had become more persistent, more unsettling.

Alexander approached Harrison with a smile. "Let's try that private hot spring over there."

Gabrielle stifled a giggle behind her hand. "Alexander clearly wants you all to himself. Go on, don't keep him waiting."

As she spoke, Gabrielle shot Nathaniel a knowing glance. His stormy expression secretly pleased her. Harrison followed Alexander to a secluded spring. Their conversation flowed easily until Alexander's phone interrupted them.

"I need to take this. Wait here."

"Of course," Harrison replied.

Left alone, Harrison noticed an ice cream vendor. The temptation proved irresistible. But when she reached the spot, the vendor had disappeared.

Somehow, she wandered deeper into the springs' hidden corners.

Then she saw them - a muscular man with a serpent tattoo coiling across his chest, and a voluptuous woman straddling his lap. Their movements sent ripples through the steaming water.

The woman laughed throatily. "What if your boss finds out about us?"

The man's arrogant grin sent chills down Harrison's spine. "Anyone who sees us won't live to tell."

Harrison's breath caught. She'd stumbled upon a dangerous affair.

Dominic Graves - that serpent tattoo marked him as someone who operated outside the law.

"Wait." Dominic's head snapped up, his predatory gaze scanning the mist. "Who's there?"

Panic surged through Harrison. She turned and fled.

Dominic shoved the woman aside and barked at his guards. "Find them!"

The chase began.

Harrison's heart pounded as she ran blindly. Dead end. Trapped.

Footsteps closed in. Then - solid warmth against her back.

She looked up into Nathaniel's piercing eyes.

How?

His strong hands pulled her behind a boulder. In one fluid motion, he lifted her onto the stone.

"Wrap your legs around me," he commanded, voice low.

Harrison stiffened. "Absolutely not!"

Nathaniel's smirk darkened. "Never done this before? Stop playing innocent."

His sudden anger confused her.

Before she could react, his knee parted her thighs. His lean body pressed closer, his taut waist brushing against her.

Harrison's legs trembled, refusing to obey. This wasn't protection - this was something else entirely.

"Stop!" Her voice shook as she pushed against his chest.

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. Her resistance only fueled his fury.

"Dominic!" A voice shouted through the steam. "They went this way!"
###Chapter 176

Dominic Graves had arrived with his men.

Nathaniel recognized him instantly. The notorious gangster was second-in-command of Willowbrook's most dangerous syndicate—a man with bloodstained hands and a reputation for brutality. Dominic had brought his boss's wife to the resort, and Harrison had accidentally stumbled upon them.

There was no way Dominic would let her walk away alive.

The underworld had its own rules. Nathaniel knew better than to let their worlds collide. He couldn’t afford a scene here.

Just then, Dominic and his bodyguards closed in.

"That's them!" one of the men barked.

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate. He grabbed Harrison and crushed his lips against hers.

Harrison had heard Dominic’s voice moments before Nathaniel’s kiss claimed her. It was rough, possessive—almost punishing. He kissed her like he wanted to devour her whole.

She shoved against his chest, but his voice was a dark warning against her lips. "Do you want to die?"

She didn’t. But she didn’t want this either.

"You're hurting me," she gasped, her delicate face twisting in discomfort. She looked fragile in his arms—like a porcelain doll about to shatter.

Nathaniel eased his grip, softening the kiss. He didn’t want to scare her. This time, his lips moved gently, coaxing instead of demanding.

Harrison’s hands, which had been braced against his chest, slowly curled into his shirt, pulling him closer. Her surrender made Nathaniel tighten his hold, cradling her as he deepened the kiss.

The large rock shielded her from view. All Dominic and his men could see were Nathaniel’s broad shoulders and the sound of their heated exchange.

Dominic froze.

Wasn’t that Nathaniel Falcon, the wealthiest man in Willowbrook?

He signaled his men to stop. "It’s not them. That’s Mr. Falcon!"

A smirk twisted his lips. "Didn’t expect to find the great Nathaniel Falcon sneaking around for a little fun."

Though he couldn’t see Harrison’s face, the sight of her slender arms wrapped around Nathaniel and her bare legs hooked around his waist sent a thrill through him.

A woman who could catch Nathaniel’s eye had to be something special. Dominic leaned in, eager for a glimpse, but one of his men cut in. "Dominic, the target definitely went that way. We should move."

"Let’s go," Dominic ordered, leading them away.

The moment their footsteps faded, Harrison shoved Nathaniel back. "They’re gone."

Nathaniel reluctantly pulled away, his lips still hovering close. "The second they leave, you push me away? Harrison, you’re unbelievable."

She was still processing why Nathaniel was even here, but gratitude won out. "Mr. Falcon, thank you for that."

She turned to leave, but Nathaniel wasn’t done. He pinned her against the rock, trapping her.

His gaze raked over her bikini-clad body.

Harrison immediately crossed her arms over herself. "What are you staring at?"

Nathaniel smirked. "You wear this to get attention, don’t you? You want every man to look. So why complain when I do?"

"What?" Her temper flared. She arched a brow and shot back, "Alexander bought this for me. I’m wearing it for him!"

He hadn’t. He’d only bought one for Isabella.

Nathaniel laughed at her sharp retort, reaching out to pinch her cheek. "If it’s clothes you want, I’ll buy them for you."



Harrison shoved him again as soon as the coast was clear. "They’re gone."

Nathaniel exhaled, reluctantly breaking the kiss. "So quick to push me away. Typical."

She was still baffled by his sudden appearance but managed a stiff, "Thank you."

Before she could escape, Nathaniel caged her against the rock again.

His eyes dropped to her barely-there swimsuit.

Harrison covered herself defensively. "What’s your problem?"

Nathaniel’s smirk turned cold. "You parade around like this, then act shocked when men look? Hypocrite."

"Excuse me?" Her eyes flashed. "Alexander got me this. I’m wearing it for him!"

A lie. He’d only bought one for Isabella.

Nathaniel chuckled, amused by her defiance. He pinched her chin lightly. "Tell me what you want. I’ll get it for you."
###Chapter 177

Nathaniel's towering form caged Harrison against the stone wall. In this hidden alcove, he was offering to purchase something for her, yet an unsettling sensation crept through her - as if they were engaged in some illicit affair.

The irony wasn't lost on her. She was his lawfully wedded wife.

"Clothes don't interest me," she retorted, attempting to shove him away.

His expression softened unexpectedly as he produced an ice cream cone. "What about this then?"

Harrison blinked in astonishment. Nathaniel held a strawberry ice cream, its pink hue vibrant against his tanned fingers.

"How...when did you get this?" Her voice carried genuine surprise.

"Just moments ago," he replied casually. He'd observed her chasing the vendor earlier and acted on impulse.

She averted her gaze, unprepared for this unexpected gesture from Nathaniel.

He brought the treat closer to her lips. "Try it."

Her clear eyes met his with defiance. "I don't want it."

The lie tasted bitter. She'd practically sparkled when spotting the ice cream cart earlier.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened with unmistakable heat, his lips curling in that infuriating smirk. "Then what do you crave? Perhaps a taste of my-"

Harrison's eyes widened as her hand flew to cover his mouth. What was this man suggesting?

He chuckled against her palm, the vibration sending shivers down her spine. "My hand perhaps? I recall you having quite the penchant for biting."

Scarlet flooded her cheeks.

Nathaniel removed her hand, his cruel amusement evident. "Harrison, what exactly were you imagining? Your mind does tend to wander into dangerous territory."

The flush spread down her neck to her delicate ears. This was deliberate provocation!

She needed distance. Wasn't he supposed to be with Isabella? Why pursue her here?

"Move. I'm leaving," she snapped, pushing against him.

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "Harrison, where exactly are your hands wandering now?"

Horror dawned as she realized her palm rested against his sculpted abdomen, the hard muscles evident even through his damp shirt.

The white tank top and black shorts clung to Nathaniel's athletic frame, the fabric transparent from hot spring water. Every defined ridge of his six-pack stood in stark relief, that tantalizing V-line disappearing beneath his waistband.

His physique was nothing short of breathtaking, sending fresh heat to her face.

Harrison decided to counterattack. Meeting his gaze boldly, she purred, "Mr. Falcon, is there any inch of you I haven't explored?"

For once, Nathaniel appeared momentarily speechless, his eyes darkening.

Alexander's voice shattered the moment. "Harrison! Where are you?"

Accompanied by Isabella and Arabella, his approach sent panic through Harrison. She shoved Nathaniel away urgently. "Alexander's coming!"

Nathaniel observed her frantic reaction with amusement, pressing the ice cream into her hands just as the trio rounded the corner.

"Harrison, how'd you end up here? I've searched everywhere," Alexander said.

Isabella and Arabella immediately flanked Nathaniel, their eyes zeroing in on the ice cream. "Where did you get that?" Arabella demanded.

Isabella's face twisted with barely concealed contempt. Today was meant to be her triumph, yet Harrison kept stealing the spotlight. "How impressive," she sneered. "Abandon Alexander for five minutes and already someone's buying you treats. Who's your mysterious benefactor?"
###Chapter 178

Harrison clutched her strawberry ice cream, stealing a glance at Nathaniel.

He stood imposingly tall, those long legs planted firmly as he observed her with silent intensity. Waiting. Watching for her reaction.

"I bought this myself," she lied smoothly, lifting the cone slightly.

Isabella and Arabella exchanged knowing looks, their skepticism evident.

Nathaniel's lips quirked in amusement. Such a terrible liar.

Harrison had enough of this charade. Turning to Alexander, she said, "Let's go back to our room. I'm done with the hot springs."

Alexander nodded, taking her hand without hesitation.

Arabella's mocking voice followed them. "Pathetic liar. Obviously some man bought her that ice cream. Now she's rushing off to sleep with Alexander."

Isabella clung to Nathaniel's arm, pressing closer. "They're sharing the presidential suite tonight. Do you think they'll...?"

"Of course they will!" Arabella cut in. "Even if Nathaniel never touched her, that girl's no virgin."

Isabella studied Nathaniel's stony expression before adding, "Arabella, really now."

"Open your eyes, Isabella! Harrison plays the innocent angel, but she's clearly experienced. Who knows how many men she's been with?" Arabella smirked.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened imperceptibly. His dark gaze tracked Harrison's retreating figure, something dangerous flickering in their depths.

Arabella continued viciously, "Remember her foster father? I bet they—"

She choked on her words as Nathaniel turned that glacial stare on her. The unspoken threat in his eyes silenced her instantly.

Isabella understood perfectly. A man of Nathaniel's refinement wouldn't tolerate crude gossip about Harrison's past. The implication alone was enough.

No man, especially not one with Nathaniel's notorious fastidiousness, would accept a woman with such a tainted history.

"Let's retire, Nathaniel," Isabella suggested sweetly.

As they walked down the corridor, a staff member approached with a room service cart. "Excuse me, coming through."

Arabella's eyes zeroed in on the placard. "The presidential suite? That's going to Harrison and Alexander!" She gasped dramatically at the cart's contents. "They ordered...condoms?"

Nathaniel's attention snapped to the small green box prominently displayed.

But that wasn't all.

Arabella shrieked, "And lingerie! Black lace lingerie!"

The scandalous ensemble lay atop the cart, impossible to ignore.

Condoms and seductive underwear, en route to Harrison and Alexander's shared suite.

Arabella stamped her foot. "That little minx! No wonder Alexander's obsessed with her. She's a complete slut behind that innocent act!"

Isabella tightened her grip on Nathaniel's arm. "Now we see why Alexander can't resist her. All that purity is just an act."

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive, but the air around him turned arctic.
###Chapter 179

Nathaniel and Isabella returned to the Executive Oceanic Suite.

Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the glittering city lights below.

Suddenly, warm arms encircled him from behind. Slender fingers traced patterns across his chest through the crisp white shirt.

Isabella pressed herself against his back.

Nathaniel turned to face her, his expression unreadable. "What are you doing?"

She looked up at him through her lashes, desire evident in her gaze. The charged atmosphere between them was almost tangible.

With a coy smile, she whispered, "Nathaniel, tell me...have you ever been with a woman?"

His eyebrow arched slightly. "Why do you ask?"

Isabella knew Harrison was the only woman who had ever been close to Nathaniel. During his three-year coma, Harrison had entered his life, but she was certain nothing intimate had occurred between them.

Yet Nathaniel was a virile man in his prime. Surely he had needs?

She'd been making subtle advances for months, always met with polite refusal. While determined to wait until marriage for full intimacy, she thought she could offer him...something to whet his appetite.

Her fingers toyed with his shirt buttons. "Let me help you, Nathaniel."

Her crimson nails stood out against the pristine white fabric as her hands wandered lower. Rising on her toes, she attempted to kiss him while simultaneously reaching for his belt.

"I'm...inexperienced," she murmured, feigning innocence.

Nathaniel gently but firmly pushed her away. Isabella tumbled onto the plush bed with surprising ease.

Before she could react, he was suddenly looming over her, his powerful frame casting a shadow across her body.

Isabella's breath hitched. She adored his commanding presence, the way his sheer dominance made her pulse race.

His handsome face descended toward hers, lips hovering just inches away.

She closed her eyes in anticipation.

But the expected kiss never came. Instead, Nathaniel reached past her, grabbed his phone from the bedside table, and straightened up.

"No, thank you," he said calmly, already moving toward the door.

Isabella's eyes flew open. After all that boldness, he was rejecting her?

She scrambled upright, panic rising. "Nathaniel, wait!"

Her trembling hands fumbled with his belt buckle in desperation. The clumsy movements betrayed her claimed inexperience.

Nathaniel had known a woman far more skilled in these matters. A woman who knew exactly how to touch him, how to make his blood burn.

Isabella's awkward attempts did nothing for him.

Gently but firmly, he removed her hands. "Enough. I'm still married."

Isabella fell silent, frustration twisting her features.

Nathaniel turned to leave.

"Nathaniel!" she cried suddenly. "You won't cheat, but what about Harrison? She's right next door with Alexander! They're probably in bed together right now!"

Nathaniel's broad shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly. His mind flashed to what he'd seen earlier - the condoms, the lingerie.

What were they doing at this very moment?

Was Harrison pleasuring Alexander the way she'd once pleasured him?

His jaw clenched. Pulling out his phone, he sent a quick message.

In the Presidential Suite, Alexander had just stepped into the shower when the doorbell rang.

Harrison frowned. Who could that be?

Opening the door, she found a hotel staff member waiting. "Good evening, miss. Your delivery has arrived."
###Chapter 180

Harrison shut the door with a soft click, her eyes widening at the sight before her. The bed was strewn with intimate apparel and protection packets she definitely hadn't purchased.

Her breath caught. This couldn't be right.

Room service must have made a terrible mistake.

Alexander emerged from the bathroom, towel-drying his damp hair. He froze mid-step when he saw the display. "Harrison, what's all this?"

The confusion in his voice confirmed he wasn't responsible either. Then how...

Ding-dong!

The chime echoed through the suite again.

"I've got it," Alexander said, moving toward the entrance.

When he opened the door, Nathaniel and Isabella stood framed in the doorway.

Harrison's pulse quickened. Weren't they supposed to be in the adjacent luxury suite?

"Nathaniel, what brings you here?" Alexander's voice held genuine surprise.

Nathaniel's baritone was smooth as aged whiskey. "Our suite's security system failed. Maintenance needs to run diagnostics overnight." His gaze flickered past Alexander to Harrison. "We'll be sharing your accommodations tonight."

Harrison's fingers twitched. Share? Tonight? Here?

Four adults in one suite.

The Presidential Suite had space, but the arrangement felt... charged.

Isabella looked equally displeased. Earlier, the hotel manager had personally apologized, explaining all other rooms were booked solid due to some corporate event.

The timing was too perfect to be coincidence.

Nathaniel studied Alexander's face. "Problem?"

Alexander stepped aside with forced cheer. "Of course not. Come in."

As they entered, Harrison's mind raced. The incriminating items still lay in plain sight. With a frantic motion, she scooped them up and concealed them behind her back.

But Nathaniel's sharp eyes missed nothing. His gaze lingered on her hidden hands, one eyebrow arching slightly.

"Harrison," Isabella purred, "so sorry to intrude on your... evening." Her emphasis made Harrison's cheeks burn.

What could she say? Trapped with her arms twisted awkwardly behind her, Harrison forced a tight smile. "No trouble at all. If you'll excuse me, I'll just... freshen up."
Harrison entered the bathroom and flipped the shower switch.

Water cascaded down with a rhythmic patter.

She lingered by the vanity, her fingertips tracing the delicate lace edges of the scandalous lingerie. The daring cut made her cheeks burn - how could she possibly put this on?

The door hinges groaned without warning.

Harrison's head snapped up, meeting Nathaniel's smoldering gaze in the mirror's reflection.

He'd slipped in while she was showering.

With Isabella and Alexander just beyond the door.

Her breath hitched as she whirled around. "Have you lost your mind? Get out this instant!"

She shoved against his chest with both hands.

Nathaniel advanced instead, his towering frame eliminating the space between them.

The black silk still tangled around Harrison's fingers, the intimate garment amplifying the tension.

She hastily concealed it behind her back, lashes fluttering like trapped butterflies. "Mr. Falcon, I swear I'll scream if you don't leave right now."

A predatory grin curved his lips as he caged her against the counter. "Be my guest. Let's see how Alexander reacts when I tell him you invited me in... that you've been begging for my attention all evening."
###Chapter 181

What kind of nonsense was this? The man was utterly vile!

"Mr. Falcon, what exactly are you trying to achieve?"

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to the lingerie she was concealing behind her back. "Put it on for me."

Harrison's breath hitched. He had spotted the delicate fabric in her hands, and now he demanded she model it for him.

Fury surged through her veins as she flung the lingerie at his face. "Absolutely not!"

Nathaniel didn't even blink. The silken garment fluttered to the floor as he retrieved it, his lips twisting into a mocking smirk while gripping her delicate chin. "You wore this for Alexander but refuse to wear it for me?"

Harrison's head tilted back involuntarily, her confused eyes searching his face. His words made no sense.

She'd never worn such scandalous things for Alexander.

She'd never worn them at all!

She still couldn't comprehend why room service had delivered it to her suite.

"Mr. Falcon, if you're so desperate for a woman to parade in lingerie, why don't you go find Isabella?" she challenged, throwing his mistress's name like a weapon.

Nathaniel's lips curled in cruel amusement. "Isabella is pure and innocent. She would never degrade herself with such vulgarity. This sort of lingerie was made for women like you, wasn't it?"

Women like her? What exactly did that imply?

Nathaniel studied her flawless features, his thumb pressing against her soft lips in a slow, deliberate caress. "Why that look, Harrison? Did you sleep around before our marriage? After our vows, who else shared your bed? Alexander? Who else?"

Her heart plummeted. So this was his true opinion of her.

When he said "women like her," he meant cheap, promiscuous women.

He would never ask his precious Isabella to wear such things, so he expected her to do it instead.

He truly held her in such contempt.

A bitter laugh escaped Harrison's lips as she shoved him away, desperate to escape.

But Nathaniel seized her slender frame, crushing her against his chest as he bent to claim her mouth.

"No!"

Harrison fought like a wildcat in his iron grip.

Her petite form twisted helplessly against his unyielding strength, only fueling Nathaniel's desire as his breathing grew ragged.

He slammed her against the wall. "Why refuse me what you so freely gave Alexander?"

Harrison pushed against his chest. "Nathaniel, aren't you afraid Isabella will discover this?"

His sneer sent chills down her spine. "Isabella understands. She knows I love and respect her. With you? This is just physical. You exist solely to satisfy my needs."

He cherished Isabella's purity while reducing her to nothing more than a vessel for his lust.

Tears welled in Harrison's pale eyes, her trembling fingers clutching her blouse.

"Nathaniel, do you think I'm obligated to obey your every whim? My past is none of your concern, but know this—I will never share your bed! If you're so concerned about tainting your precious Isabella's virtue, find another woman to relieve your urges. It will never be me!"

The air grew thick with tension following her declaration.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously, his chest rising with barely contained rage.

Finally, he released her, his gaze sweeping over her with undisguised disgust. "Harrison, do you honestly believe I crave your touch? Have you been getting regular STD tests? I wouldn't touch you if you begged. You're filthy."

With that final blow, he strode out, leaving her shattered.

"Have you been getting regular STD tests?"

"You're filthy."

His cruel words echoed in her mind as she realized he always knew exactly how to destroy her. Their relationship had reached its lowest point yet.

Harrison's legs gave way as she slid down the wall, collapsing onto the cold marble floor. She couldn't comprehend why he'd barged in just to humiliate her so viciously, so unexpectedly.
###Chapter 182

Did breaking her spirit bring him this much satisfaction?

Nathaniel leaned against the balcony railing, his black silk robe fluttering slightly in the night breeze. A cigarette dangled from his elegant fingers, each drag sharp and impatient. Smoke curled around his chiseled features, but the tension in his jaw was unmistakable.

The cigarette burned angrily between his fingers. Ash fell in quick bursts, glowing embers scattering across the marble floor.

He was losing control.

The Executive Suite had been perfectly fine. He'd personally ensured that. But the thought of Harrison and Alexander alone together made his blood boil.

Those lingerie and condom purchases haunted him. Visions of what they might be doing together tormented his thoughts. The jealousy consumed him.

In the quiet darkness, Nathaniel faced a terrifying truth. The idea of Harrison with another man was unbearable.

This wasn't love. Just insatiable hunger.

It was supposed to be temporary. But he wasn't done yet. How could he let her go when he still craved more?

Suddenly, warm arms encircled him from behind.

"Nathaniel, why are you smoking?"

Isabella. She rarely saw him indulge in cigarettes.

Nathaniel turned slowly, about to respond, when the bathroom door opened. Harrison emerged, freshly showered.

Alexander approached her immediately.

"Harrison, finished with your shower?"

She nodded.

Then she saw them. Nathaniel and Isabella on the balcony, her arms wrapped around him, his cigarette glowing between his fingers. The intimate picture made her stomach twist.

After publicly humiliating her, he was now cozy with Isabella.

Harrison quickly looked away. "I need to dry my hair."

She sat at the dressing table and picked up the hairdryer, the warm air ruffling her damp locks.

Alexander moved closer. "Let me help you with that."

Nathaniel watched Harrison. The white lace nightgown clung to her damp skin, making her look impossibly delicate.

The vanity lights cast a soft glow on her porcelain skin. She smelled like jasmine and vanilla.

Alexander stood behind her, fingers combing through her hair as he worked the dryer.

Nathaniel's grip tightened on his cigarette when he saw Alexander's hands in her hair. The way she smiled up at him sent a sharp pain through his chest.

A sudden sting made him glance down. The cigarette had burned his finger. He crushed it violently in the ashtray.

"Harrison," his voice cut through the room like ice. "Are your hands broken? Do it yourself."

Harrison had been about to refuse Alexander's help, but Nathaniel's words froze her.

Nathaniel's cold gaze pinned her in place, his lips twisting into a cruel smirk. "Can't manage basic grooming without a man's help? Or do you just enjoy being touched?"

Harrison's face went pale.

Alexander stepped forward, furious. "What the hell is wrong with you? I offered to help. Why are you treating her like this?"

Nathaniel stood rigid, his voice glacial. "She has hands. She can do it herself."

Harrison reached for the dryer, but Alexander blocked her hand. He glared at Nathaniel.

"You're looking for a fight tonight, aren't you?"
###Chapter 183

"You looking for trouble?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened, a dangerous glint flashing within them. The air between him and Alexander crackled with tension, thick enough to cut with a knife.

Harrison stood frozen in shock. She hadn't expected Alexander to actually defend her against Nathaniel. The two men had been inseparable since childhood, brothers in all but blood.

Isabella whirled toward Harrison, venom dripping from her words. "Harrison, is this what you wanted? You lure men in, and now they're ready to brawl over you. You really know how to play them, don't you?"

"Enough, Isabella!" Alexander's fists clenched at his sides.

At that moment, Harrison reached out, her fingers lightly brushing his arm. Her voice was soft but firm. "Alexander, don't let this ruin everything. It's not worth it."

He turned to her, his gaze unwavering. "Yes, Harrison. You are."

Her breath caught at his words, warmth flooding her chest.

Without another word, Alexander shrugged off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders, then took her hand in his. "Come on. This place is ruined. Let's go."

He started to lead her out, but Harrison paused, lifting a hand. "Wait."

Alexander released her, and she quickly retrieved her phone. "Okay. Let's go."

A faint smile tugged at his lips as he took her hand again. "Let's."

The Presidential Suite, with its breathtaking ocean view, was left empty—save for Nathaniel and Isabella. She turned to him, her voice laced with mock surprise.

"I never thought Alexander would go this far for Harrison. He's willing to throw away years of friendship over her. She must be quite the enchantress."

Nathaniel's expression remained icy, but beneath the surface, a storm raged. He lifted his leg and kicked the nearby trash can with brutal force.

The metallic clang echoed sharply through the room.

Isabella smirked. Truthfully, she was the one who had ordered the provocative items from room service. And now, her plan had worked perfectly.

Nathaniel stood there, hands on his hips, his chest rising and falling with controlled fury. "We're leaving."

Isabella, pleased with how smoothly everything had gone, nodded. "Fine. I'll get Arabella."

She stepped into the hallway—only to collide with Dominic Graves, who was storming past with his men, clearly frustrated.

"Useless," he muttered. "The hot springs aren't that big, and yet none of you can find one damn woman!"

"We searched everywhere, Dominic. But she... vanished."

"We never even saw her face clearly. Just that she was wearing a magenta bikini."

Isabella's steps faltered. A magenta bikini?

That was Harrison.

Were they looking for Harrison?

Dominic and his men disappeared into their room, but Isabella remained rooted in place, staring at the closed door. She knew exactly who they were—dangerous men with no qualms about violence.

If Harrison had crossed paths with them...

A slow, dark smile curved her lips. This could be useful.

Pulling out her phone, she recalled the photos Arabella had taken earlier—Harrison in that very bikini.

Perfect.

Inside his room, Dominic had just settled in when the doorbell rang. He frowned and stalked toward it.

"Who is it?"

No one answered.

Instead, a photo lay on the floor. He picked it up, and his eyes lit up at the sight of Harrison in the magenta bikini.

A predatory grin spread across his face. "Found you."

Outside the villa, Alexander led Harrison away, but she stopped, regret shadowing her expression.

"Alexander, please don't let me come between you and Nathaniel," she said softly.

He shook his head, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Nathaniel and I have been through worse. But I've never seen him this worked up over a woman before."
###Chapter 184

Nathaniel's treatment of Harrison bordered on cruelty.

A sharp ache twisted in Harrison's chest.

"I know Mr. Falcon despises me," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Alexander hesitated, his mouth opening and closing before finally saying, "Harrison, wait here. I'll bring the car around."

She gave a silent nod.

As Alexander walked away, Harrison stood alone in the empty parking garage. The sound of approaching footsteps made her turn.

Nathaniel stood there, his imposing frame wrapped in a tailored black overcoat that accentuated his cold elegance.

His piercing gaze studied Harrison for a long moment as she stared at the ground. With a barely perceptible tightening of his jaw, he turned to leave.

Just then, Dominic Graves and his men arrived.

Dominic's eyes lit up when he spotted Harrison. "There she is!" he exclaimed, licking his lips. "Even more beautiful up close."

His thugs whistled appreciatively. "Boss, she puts all those club girls to shame."

"Look at that porcelain skin. I'd love to leave my mark on it."

"Let's take her with us. We could have some real fun."

Dominic's expression darkened with lust, but reason quickly prevailed. Harrison had witnessed his affair with the boss's wife - a deadly secret. Dead women tell no tales.

"Enough. She doesn't leave here alive. Handle it," he ordered coldly.

One of the black-clad men nodded, drawing a gleaming switchblade from his belt as he advanced toward Harrison.

Nathaniel had only taken a few steps when the commotion made him turn. His blood ran cold at the sight of the armed man approaching Harrison.

Before conscious thought could catch up, his body moved. Cursing violently, he sprinted back toward her.

The assassin was mere feet away from Harrison now. One quick thrust between the ribs would finish the job silently.

The knife flashed upward.

At the last possible second, Nathaniel's hand shot out, gripping the blade with bare fingers.

The attacker gaped in shock. Who was this madman stopping a knife with his bare hand?

Then he saw Nathaniel's face - a mask of cold fury even as blood welled between his fingers. The sharp steel bit deep into his palm.

Drops of crimson splattered onto the concrete floor, each impact echoing in the tense silence.

Before the stunned man could react, Nathaniel twisted the knife free and delivered a brutal kick to his chest. The thug flew backward, coughing up blood.

Dominic's eyes widened in recognition. "Kill them both!" he roared. "No witnesses!"

Knives flashed as the remaining men charged.

Harrison finally turned at the commotion, only to see a blade descending toward her. Her heart stopped.

"Harrison!"

"Harrison!"

Two voices screamed her name in unison.

Someone crashed into her, strong arms wrapping around her body protectively.

The sickening sound of steel piercing flesh filled the air. Warm droplets splashed across Harrison's face as horror dawned.

She looked up into the face of her rescuer, her breath catching in her throat as realization struck.
###Chapter 185

It was Alexander!

Alexander had returned with the car, and the moment he spotted someone aiming a knife at Harrison, he charged forward without a second thought.

The blade plunged deep into his chest.

"Harrison!" Alexander's name tore from Harrison's lips in a sharp cry.

Nathaniel, seeing the danger, sprinted toward Harrison, but the distance was too great. After witnessing Alexander take the blow for her, Nathaniel knocked down two of the black-clad men blocking his path and raced forward.

Just then, Dominic and a team of bodyguards stormed onto the scene, surrounding the area.

Outnumbered, Dominic Graves and his men were swiftly overpowered.

Isabella rushed to Nathaniel and clung to him desperately. "Nathaniel!"

Nathaniel tried to shake her off, needing to reach Harrison and Alexander, but Isabella held on tighter. "Don't leave me, Nathaniel! I'm terrified!"

On the ground, Alexander lay motionless, blood pooling around him. Harrison dropped to her knees beside him, pressing her hands over the wound, but the blood seeped relentlessly through her fingers.

Her hands shook. She couldn’t comprehend why Alexander had done this. She was accustomed to cruelty, but kindness left her disoriented.

"Alexander, stay with me. You’ll be okay."

Alexander's eyes glazed over before he lost consciousness.

Sirens wailed as an ambulance arrived. Medics loaded Alexander onto a stretcher, and Harrison climbed in beside him, heading straight to the hospital.

Nathaniel, unable to free himself from Isabella’s grip, stood helplessly as Harrison and Alexander vanished from sight.

At the hospital, Alexander was rushed into surgery, the red light above the door flickering to life. Harrison paced outside, her nerves frayed.

Nathaniel arrived shortly after, finding Harrison circling anxiously. Her face was pale, streaked with blood, her expression haunted.

He approached, his voice low. "Don’t worry. These are the best doctors in the city. Alexander will pull through."

Harrison glanced up, her gaze immediately catching on Nathaniel’s injured hand.

It was impossible to miss. His left hand was coated in blood, the wound untreated, some of it already drying. His white shirt was stained, his appearance disheveled.

What had happened to him?

Nathaniel noticed her staring and flexed his fingers slightly. He stepped closer, his tall frame casting a shadow over her. "Are you—"

"Nathaniel!"

Isabella appeared, looping her arm through his.

The question—whether she was hurt—died unspoken.

When Isabella arrived, Harrison’s attention shifted away from Nathaniel’s bloodied hand. She sat coldly on a bench, waiting in silence.

Nathaniel watched her, the chasm between them widening. The quiet drip of his blood hitting the floor was the only sound.

Dominic hurried over, speaking quietly. "Mr. Falcon, we’ve handled Dominic Graves. We also found this at the scene—a photo."

What photo?

Harrison stood, taking it from Dominic’s hands.

Her heart stopped.

The image showed her in a magenta bikini, her expression frozen in shock.

Now it made sense. This entire disaster had started when she accidentally overheard Dominic Graves’ affair with his boss’s wife at the hot springs. He’d seen her and wanted her silenced.

But one question remained—how had he recognized her?


###Chapter 186

The photograph in Harrison's hands revealed everything.

Her breath caught as she turned to face Isabella. "Isabella... Did you send this to that man?"

A flicker of rage darkened Isabella's eyes. Why had Alexander taken the hit meant for Harrison? Why wasn't she the one bleeding?

Now the evidence was exposed.

Nathaniel snatched the photo from Harrison's grip. His piercing gaze locked onto Isabella, colder than winter frost.

Isabella shivered. "What photo? I don't understand! Harrison, I know you're upset about Alexander, but don't make wild accusations!"

"Look closely, Isabella. Your stupidity is showing." Harrison's voice dripped with venom.

Isabella's eyes darted to the corner of the photo. Her stomach dropped. The telltale watermark from her phone glared back at her.

She cursed herself for forgetting to remove it. Her connection to Dominic Graves was undeniable now.

Nathaniel's glacial stare made her blood run cold. She'd never seen him look at her like that—like she was prey.

"I-It's not what you think!" she stammered, clutching Nathaniel's arm. "Please, let me explain—"

Harrison cut her off. "Explain what? That you nearly got Alexander killed?"

Her hands trembled, still stained with Alexander's blood. He was fighting for his life in surgery—all because of Isabella's scheming.

Isabella wanted Harrison dead, and Alexander had almost paid the price.

Yet here stood Nathaniel, shielding Isabella like always. His loyalty never wavered, no matter how vile her actions.

Harrison's pale eyes burned with fury. She met Nathaniel's gaze without flinching.

"I won't let you touch her," Nathaniel murmured, his voice dangerously soft. "She had nothing to do with this."

Behind him, Isabella's lips curled in triumph.

The slap echoed through the hospital corridor.

Nathaniel's head snapped to the side, a red mark blooming on his cheek. Harrison's palm stung from the impact.

Isabella gasped. "Have you lost your mind? You hit Nathaniel!"

No one dared raise a hand to Nathaniel Hawk. Until now.

Before Isabella could react, Harrison's hand flew again—this time striking Isabella square across the face.

Isabella staggered back, shock rendering her speechless.

Harrison had struck them both.

Nathaniel slowly turned back, his stormy eyes meeting Harrison's icy glare. She stood tall despite her petite frame, her gaze unyielding.

"Keep her close," Harrison warned, her voice razor-sharp. "Because if she crosses my path again, you won't be able to protect her."
###Chapter 187

The hospital corridor felt like a pressure cooker, thick with unspoken tension.

The operating room doors burst open suddenly. A white-coated doctor stepped out.

Harrison lunged forward, her voice trembling. "Doctor, how is he?"

"The procedure went well. He should regain consciousness within two days," the physician answered.

Harrison exhaled shakily. She'd seen Alexander's injury earlier - the blade had missed vital organs, but relief only came now. Had Alexander suffered because of her, she'd never forgive herself.

Moments later, Alexander was wheeled out. Harrison shadowed the gurney to the private suite without glancing back at Nathaniel or Isabella.

Isabella grabbed Nathaniel's sleeve, frustration dripping from her words. "Nathaniel! Harrison's completely unhinged! She struck you, then me! You must-"

Nathaniel jerked his arm free, voice razor-sharp. "Tell me you didn't deserve that."

Isabella froze, mouth agape.

Nathaniel's glacial stare pinned her as he slapped a photograph onto her lap. "Isabella, I never realized the depths of your malice. You've crossed every line this time."

The verbal blow drained Isabella's face of color. Panic flashed in her eyes as she scrambled to explain.

"Nathaniel, please! I dislike Harrison, yes, but I never wanted Alexander hurt! Things spiraled out of control-"

Nathaniel shoved her away, jaw clenched. "This ends now, Isabella. I won't keep salvaging your disasters. Sort yourself out."

"Nathaniel, I-"

"Leave. Alexander doesn't want you here. Neither do I."

Isabella's protest died as Dominic materialized beside them, voice firm. "Ms. Whitmore, this way."

Fury twisted Isabella's features. Her scheme had backfired spectacularly - Harrison remained unscathed while she'd alienated Nathaniel.

"Ms. Whitmore," Dominic repeated, unyielding.

With a venomous glare and her stinging cheek, Isabella stormed off. But she took cold comfort - Nathaniel still shielded her. As long as he remained her protector, she hadn't truly lost.

Nathaniel stood sentinel outside the suite, his tall frame silhouetted against the glass. Inside, Alexander lay unconscious, monitors beeping steadily.

Harrison kept vigil beside the bed, clutching Alexander's hand.

"Mr. Falcon," Dominic murmured. "Ms. Isabella meant to eliminate Mrs. Falcon using Dominic Graves, but Mr. Graves got injured instead. She overplayed her hand, yet you defended her. Mrs. Falcon is rightfully furious."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. The girl from the cave had become unrecognizable.

Yet abandoning her wasn't an option. He couldn't let her sink into criminality.

Harrison's anger burned through him. His cheek still throbbed where her palm had connected.

"Sir, your hand requires attention. The wound keeps bleeding."

Blood dripped steadily from Nathaniel's palm where he'd caught the blade bare-handed.

Through the glass, Nathaniel watched Harrison keeping her silent vigil.

As night deepened, a nurse slipped into the room to check Alexander's vitals.
###Chapter 188

Alexander was recovering well, his condition stable now.

The nurse exited, and moments later, Dominic's urgent voice carried through the door. "Mr. Falcon, that hand injury requires immediate attention. Permanent damage could occur without proper treatment."

Harrison glanced up. Nathaniel's imposing figure stood framed in the doorway, having remained there silently all this time.

Dominic shot Harrison a pleading look. "Mrs. Falcon, Mr. Falcon's hand won't stop bleeding. Please, just say something."

Harrison's gaze dropped to the crimson droplets staining the floor. That wound would require extensive stitching.

She rose and moved toward the entrance.

Nathaniel's eyes sparked with hope as she approached. His broad shoulders tensed slightly, expression flickering with cautious optimism.

Dominic exhaled in relief. "See? Mrs. Falcon still cares. Mr. Falcon, you really should—"

His words cut off abruptly as Harrison firmly slammed the door shut.

The heavy door nearly collided with both men's faces, a chilling gust slipping through the narrow gap.

Dominic stood frozen, momentarily speechless.

The light in Nathaniel's eyes died instantly. Through the door's small window, he watched Harrison return to Alexander's bedside, taking his hand before resting her head against the mattress to sleep.

A bitter, self-deprecating smile twisted Nathaniel's lips.

Seven days passed. Alexander's recovery progressed remarkably. Nathaniel knew full consciousness had returned by now.

In his Falcon Enterprises office, Nathaniel reviewed documents when his phone vibrated. Eleanor was calling.

Since their last outing for milkshakes and foot massages, Eleanor had grounded Harrison, forbidding outings.

"Grandmother," Nathaniel answered.

"Where have you and Harrison been? Why haven't I seen you? Dinner tonight—I miss you both." Eleanor's affectionate tone filled the line.

The bandage around Nathaniel's left hand remained—twenty-three stitches holding the wound together. He gripped the phone with his right hand, silent.

He knew Harrison hadn't left Alexander's hospital bedside all week.

"Did you hear me? Bring Harrison home tonight," Eleanor insisted.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Understood."

That evening, Nathaniel returned alone to the Falcon estate.

Eleanor's welcoming smile faltered. "Where's Harrison?"

He'd driven himself home.

Noticing her disappointment, Nathaniel replied, "University obligations. Call her if you wish her presence."

Without hesitation, Eleanor reached for the landline. "I'll do just that."

Nathaniel sank into an armchair, picking up a financial newspaper with feigned indifference.

The call connected instantly. Harrison's melodic voice carried through. "Grandmother?"

Eleanor beamed. "You've neglected me terribly. I've prepared a feast—join us tonight."

A maid entered, placing tea beside Nathaniel. "Your tea, sir." He gave no reaction, eyes fixed on unread text.

Harrison's regretful reply came. "I'm sorry, but a hospitalized friend requires my presence tonight."
###Chapter 189

Eleanor hesitated briefly before forcing a bright smile. "Of course, Harrison. Stay with your friend. Come have dinner with me when you're free."

"Will do, Grandma," Harrison replied.

The call ended abruptly.

Eleanor's sharp eyes turned to Nathaniel, who sat rigidly with a business newspaper hiding his expression.

"Did you two fight?" Eleanor demanded.

Nathaniel didn't lower the paper. "No."

Eleanor chuckled dryly. "Do you know Harrison's friend? Male or female?" Silence answered her.

She yanked the newspaper away. "Darling, you've been reading it upside down for twenty minutes."

Nathaniel blinked at the inverted text. His jaw tightened imperceptibly. Eleanor rose with a sigh. "I know you've been seeing that Isabella, but patience has limits, Nathaniel. Harrison won't wait forever. She's remarkable, and you're blind to it. Other men aren't. When she moves on, don't expect my sympathy."

Reginald entered just then. "Madam Eleanor, is Mrs. Harrison joining us for dinner?"

"Not tonight," Eleanor snapped. "I've lost my appetite." She swept upstairs without another word.

Reginald hesitated, sensing the tension. "Sir Nathaniel, Mrs. Harrison hasn't returned since starting university. Madam Eleanor misses her terribly. The manor feels... empty without her laughter."

With a pitying glance, Reginald withdrew.

Alone in the cavernous living room, Nathaniel loosened his tie with sharp jerks. His phone appeared in his palm, fingers flying over the screen.

[Why won't you come home?]

He stared at the unsent message, then deleted it letter by letter.

This was his doing. After that slap, she'd chosen Alexander's side. Of course she wouldn't return. He exhaled sharply, resolving to let it go.

Meanwhile, Alexander's injuries had nearly healed. On his discharge day, Harrison returned to her Willowridge University dorm.

A new roommate awaited - Daphne Sinclair.

Daphne's tragic backstory unfolded quickly: alcoholic gambler father, struggling mother, younger siblings to support.

Despite her hardships, Daphne possessed ethereal beauty with wide, innocent eyes. A drama student dreaming of stardom to rescue her family.

She offered Harrison and Rosalind a pastry box. "My mother made these. We can't afford much, but her baking is decent. Hope that's okay."

Rosalind bit into a cupcake immediately. "Fluffy perfection! Your mom's talented, Daphne."

Daphne watched Harrison with hopeful intensity, lips parted in anticipation.

Harrison sampled a pastry and nodded. "Exceptional baking, Daphne. Truly."

Daphne beamed. "I'm working at The Grand Celeste tonight. Must dash!" She grabbed her bag and vanished.

Rosalind departed for class soon after, leaving Harrison alone.

The phone rang suddenly. Penelope's excited voice burst through. "Harrison! You'll never guess - I met Dr. Sinclair!"
###Chapter 190
Harrison stood frozen, unable to form words.

The phone crackled with Penelope's giddy voice. "Harrison, you won't believe this! Dr. Sinclair—the brilliant surgeon—is actually a man! And guess what? He's completely smitten with me. We're officially together now!"

What?

Harrison's thoughts spiraled into chaos.

"I can't talk long. I'll explain everything later. But listen—you need to come home in a few days," Penelope rushed out before abruptly ending the call. Harrison's instincts screamed scam.

Taking a steadying breath, Harrison shook her head and headed for a scalding shower. The moment she stepped out, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Daphne.

Daphne's voice trembled with raw panic, her sobs audible. "Harrison, I'm in trouble. Please—I need your help."

Harrison's grip on the phone turned vice-like. "Daphne, what happened?"

"I'm working at The Grand Celeste as a server. Tonight, my manager took... an interest in me. He demanded I spend the night with him. I panicked and locked myself in the bathroom, but his guards are posted outside, watching me. Harrison, I'm terrified! I don't have anyone else to call—"

Her voice shattered into another sob.

"Stay where you are. Don't move. I'm coming now," Harrison commanded, already grabbing her keys.

"Thank you," Daphne whispered, relief threading her voice.

Harrison sprinted to The Grand Celeste.

She spotted the two hulking bodyguards flanking the women's restroom entrance. Without hesitation, she strode inside.

Daphne was curled against the sink, tear tracks streaking her makeup, her entire body shaking. "You came," she gasped.

Harrison seized her hands. "We're leaving. Now."

"But Victor's men are out there—how?" Daphne's voice wavered.

"Disguises." Harrison yanked a sleek dress, oversized sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat from her bag. "Put these on."

In minutes, Daphne transformed from a timid waitress to a glamorous socialite—unrecognizable.

"Let's go." Harrison gripped her elbow and marched them out.

The guards' eyes skimmed over Daphne. Her fingers trembled violently in Harrison's grasp.

A firm squeeze. A silent promise.

They made it ten paces before Daphne gasped. "My bag! It's still in there—all my tips—"

Harrison lunged to stop her. "Too risky. Leave it."

But Daphne twisted free and bolted back.

"No!" Harrison's shout came too late.

Victor Blackwell emerged like a predator, flanked by his men. The leering manager's gaze locked onto Daphne. "Did you really think you could run, sweetheart? Bring her to my suite. And make sure she's... prepared."

The guards seized Daphne, whose face drained of color.

Harrison moved like lightning, shielding Daphne with her body. Her glare could have frozen hell.

"Touch her again," she hissed, "and you'll regret it."
###Chapter 191

Victor's eyes lit up with predatory interest as they landed on Harrison. "Well, well, where did this exquisite creature come from? You look like you've stepped right out of a dream."

Daphne shrank behind Harrison, her voice trembling. "She's my classmate. Mr. Blackwell, we're university students. We're not... what you think. Please just let us go."

"Students?" Victor licked his lips, his gaze raking over Harrison's body. "Even better. I have a particular fondness for educated girls." He gestured to his security team. "Take them both to my suite."

Harrison positioned herself protectively in front of Daphne, her voice cutting through the air like ice. "Attempting to abduct women in public? Are you completely lawless?"

Victor threw back his head with laughter. "Law? In Willowbrook, I make the laws. I break bread with Nathaniel Falcon himself - the most powerful man in this city. Don't lecture me about legality."

The mention of Nathaniel's name sent a jolt through Harrison. It had been weeks since their last encounter, but everyone knew Nathaniel's influence reached every corner of Willowbrook.

"Stop wasting time! Seize them!" Victor barked impatiently.

Two broad-shouldered guards advanced.

Daphne's nails dug into Harrison's arm. "Harrison, what do we do?"

When one guard reached for her, Harrison's eyes flashed dangerously. "Don't you dare lay a hand on me!" She turned her glacial stare on Victor. "Touch us and you'll regret it. Do you have any idea who I am?"

Victor hesitated under her commanding presence. "Enlighten me."

Harrison enunciated each word with precision. "I am Nathaniel Falcon's wife. Mrs. Falcon."

Victor's jaw dropped. "You're lying."

"Test me and see what happens. Nathaniel will tear you apart."

Before Victor could respond, a familiar voice echoed down the corridor. "Mr. Falcon, your private dining room is prepared."

Harrison's head snapped up to see Nathaniel approaching with an entourage of businessmen.

Nathaniel was here.

Dressed in a bespoke charcoal suit that hugged his powerful frame, Nathaniel moved with effortless authority. The chandelier's glow highlighted his sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes, making him look every inch the untouchable tycoon.

Harrison's breath caught. The universe had a cruel sense of humor - invoking Nathaniel's name only to have him materialize.

The hotel manager bowed deeply. "Mr. Falcon, right this way."

Victor seized his chance, stepping forward with an obsequious smile. "Mr. Falcon! What an honor."

Nathaniel gave him a cursory nod. "Blackwell."

"Sir, I don't mean to interrupt, but this young woman claims to know you." Victor gestured toward Harrison.

Their eyes met. Nathaniel's gaze was as impenetrable as ever, sending an involuntary shiver down Harrison's spine. Every businessman in his party turned to stare.

Harrison's fingers twitched. She'd only used Nathaniel's name as a desperate bluff - never imagining he'd actually appear.

That night at the hospital when she'd slapped him... that had been their final moment. Now Victor was asking if Nathaniel recognized her. What would he say?

Humiliation burned through her veins.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable as his deep voice resonated through the hallway.

"I've never seen her before."
###Chapter 192

He claimed not to recognize her.

With those cold words, Nathaniel turned away. His long strides carried him effortlessly as he escorted the businessmen into the opulent private suite.

Harrison felt her body tense. The fragile composure she'd maintained shattered instantly.

Daphne, still cowering behind Harrison, had stopped sobbing. Color returned to her pale cheeks as she stared transfixed at Nathaniel's retreating figure - tall, commanding, impossibly handsome.

The moment Nathaniel disappeared from view, Victor pivoted toward Harrison. "Pathetic! You dare claim to be Mrs. Falcon when Mr. Falcon himself denies knowing you? What a laughable liar!"

Harrison remained silent.

Victor had no patience left. "Seize them!" he barked.

The two black-suited guards advanced again, roughly grabbing Harrison and Daphne.

Daphne thrashed against their grip. "Let me go!"

Harrison appeared calm. She had a needle and sleeping powder concealed on her person. Once inside Victor's room, she'd find an opportunity to escape with Daphne.

As Harrison calculated her next move, Victor waved impatiently. "Take them to my car."

The guards shoved them forward.

Suddenly, a voice called out. "Mr. Blackwell, a moment please."

Victor turned. Kenneth Rogers, emerging from Nathaniel's private room, approached.

"Mr. Rogers, what an honor."

"Mr. Falcon requests your presence for a drink."

Victor's face lit up with excitement. An invitation from Nathaniel was a rare privilege. "Of course! Immediately."

Victor draped an arm over Harrison's slender shoulders. "You're coming with me to toast Mr. Falcon. Behave."

Daphne remained outside with the guards. Harrison understood the unspoken threat - comply or Daphne would suffer.

With no choice, Harrison followed Victor into the lavish private room.

Inside the extravagant space, Harrison's gaze immediately found Nathaniel at the head of the table. He sat with regal ease, his striking features impassive as businessmen poured wine into his glass.

This was Harrison's first glimpse of him in this world - surrounded by power brokers, every inch the untouchable tycoon.

She hadn't imagined their reunion would unfold like this after their separation.

Victor guided her to a seat opposite Nathaniel. The men erupted in teasing. "Mr. Blackwell, is this your latest conquest?"

"Just a student from Willowridge University."

"Your tastes haven't changed. Still chasing schoolgirls, eh?"

Among only men, Victor chuckled. "This one's special. Mr. Falcon, you won't believe what she claimed earlier - that she's your wife!"

Harrison watched as Nathaniel looked up from his glass, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

He regarded her from his elevated position, the faintest smirk playing at his lips.

Was that amusement she detected?

Harrison wanted to scream at Victor to shut his mouth.

"Hilarious! The audacity to call herself Mrs. Falcon."

"Students these days are cunning. All chasing the richest, most powerful men."

"Mr. Falcon must have schoolgirls throwing themselves at him daily."

The businessmen roared with laughter, mocking Harrison mercilessly.

Harrison's delicate cheeks burned with humiliation. Her pride stung painfully.

Victor stood, raising his glass. "Mr. Falcon, allow me to propose a toast."

Nathaniel, lounging with effortless elegance, didn't take the glass. Instead, his gaze remained fixed on Harrison. "Let her come offer it to me."
###Chapter 193
Nathaniel wanted Harrison to offer him a drink.

Harrison froze, her muscles tensing instantly.

Victor, too, stiffened in confusion. What was Nathaniel playing at? Was he actually interested in Harrison? If that were the case, Victor knew better than to compete with a man like Nathaniel for a woman's attention.

"What are you waiting for? Go offer Mr. Falcon the drink," Victor urged impatiently.

The other businessmen chuckled. "I've seen plenty of women trying to get Mr. Falcon to drink with them, but this is the first time I've seen him request it himself."

"Go on. Don't keep him waiting."

All eyes were on Harrison now, leaving her no choice but to step forward with the glass in hand.

She had no idea what Nathaniel's intentions were, but she forced herself to walk toward him, her grip tight around the glass.

"Mr. Falcon, your drink."

She stood while he remained seated, yet his presence still dominated the space. His gaze swept over her—cool, detached, the look of a powerful man assessing a woman who meant nothing to him.

When she hesitated, Nathaniel's lips curled into a faint, mocking smirk. "Who are you? Do you really think I'd drink just because you offered?"

Laughter erupted around them.

"Hah! That's right—Mr. Falcon doesn't accept drinks from just anyone," one of the men joked.

Harrison's jaw clenched. He had set her up—made her come forward only to humiliate her in front of everyone.

Her eyes flashed with anger before she turned sharply to leave.

But as she spun, her heel caught on the edge of the rug.

"Ah—!"

She gasped as she lost her balance, bracing for the impact of hitting the floor—and the inevitable laughter that would follow.

Instead, a strong arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her back effortlessly. She was steadied against a firm chest, her body pressed against Nathaniel's.

Harrison looked up in shock, finding his face mere inches from hers.

She was now seated on his thigh.

The clean, masculine scent of his cologne surrounded her, starkly different from the stale alcohol and cigar smoke clinging to the other men. He exuded power and refinement.

For a moment, she was too stunned to react.

Nathaniel studied her with an unreadable expression. "Was that intentional?"

More laughter filled the room.

"Women these days will do anything to get Mr. Falcon's attention."

"Looks like this one's determined to become Mrs. Falcon."

Harrison's face burned with humiliation. He knew damn well she hadn't planned this!

This was revenge—payback for the slap she'd given him, and the one she'd delivered to Isabella.

Or maybe he just despised her and enjoyed seeing her embarrassed.

She glared at him and tried to push herself up.

Nathaniel tightened his grip, keeping her in place. "Who are you?"

He asked again, his voice firm, as if daring her to answer.

"Tell them. Loudly."

Her pulse skipped. Was he trying to force her to admit she was his wife? Just to mock her further?

She struggled against his hold, desperate to stand.

"Beg me," he murmured, his voice low and commanding.

Beg me.

The words sent a shiver down her spine.

Nathaniel studied her pale face, his gaze lingering. It had been days since he'd seen her, and she seemed colder now—her expression rigid, as if he were nothing but a stranger.
###Chapter 194

Nathaniel was clearly toying with her. That fiery glare she shot him was the first spark of defiance he'd seen all night.

His voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Say the words, and I'll get you out of here."

The seasoned businessman had already assessed her situation perfectly. He wanted to hear her beg for his help. But Harrison would rather die than ask.

She didn't need his rescue. Owing him anything was out of the question.

"Mr. Falcon, release me!" Harrison twisted violently, breaking free from his grip and scrambling off his lap.

She couldn't stay in that suffocating room another second. Without a backward glance, she flung open the private room door and stormed out.

Victor sprang to his feet. "Mr. Falcon, may I be excused?"

Even now, the coward wouldn't leave without Nathaniel's permission.

Silence.

That was answer enough. Victor scurried after her.

Nathaniel's chiseled features darkened like a gathering storm.

The remaining guests exchanged nervous glances. What had just provoked the notoriously ruthless CEO?

Outside, Harrison and Daphne were being manhandled into Victor's sleek limousine by his security team.

Daphne trembled in the corner, her face buried in her hands. Victor leered at Harrison. "So, what did Mr. Falcon whisper to you back there?"

Harrison remained stone-faced.

Victor grabbed her chin roughly. "You actually sat in Nathaniel Falcon's lap? I've never seen anyone survive that privilege."

Harrison recoiled. "Get your disgusting hands off me!"

But his grip only tightened, leaving angry red marks on her porcelain skin.

Victor's eyes darkened with lust. "I planned to take my time with you at the hotel, but now I can't wait. What a prize - a woman who's touched the untouchable."

In one brutal motion, he shoved her down onto the leather seat.

The car's confines didn't deter him. He tore at her blouse with frantic hands.

Daphne lunged forward, clinging to his arm. "Mr. Blackwell, please! We're just students! We don't want—"

"Bitch!" Victor backhanded her across the face. Daphne's head cracked against the window with a sickening thud, her complexion draining of color.

"Daphne!" Harrison tried to reach for her friend.

But Victor had already pinned her beneath him, fumbling with his belt. "Time to play, princess."

Harrison had planned to deal with Victor at the hotel, but circumstances demanded immediate action. Her fingers inched toward the concealed needle at her waist.

Suddenly, the driver's panicked voice cut through the chaos. "Sir! We're being followed!"

"What?" Victor jerked upright, peering through the rear window. A Rolls-Royce Phantom was gaining on them at alarming speed.

Victor's face went slack with recognition. That was Nathaniel's car. Why was he pursuing them?

"Mr. Falcon?" Victor's voice cracked with fear.

Before he could process the situation, the Phantom's engine roared. With a deafening crash, it rammed into their bumper.

The impact sent them lurching violently forward.

The world-class luxury car showed no mercy. Victor's limo crumpled like tissue paper under the assault.

Screeching tires filled the air as their vehicle was forced to a shuddering halt.

The Phantom's door swung open. Nathaniel emerged like an avenging angel, his towering frame radiating lethal intent.

In three strides, he reached their car and wrenched open the rear door.
###Chapter 195

Nathaniel tore open the car door and seized Victor by his collar, yanking him out onto the pavement.

Victor trembled violently. "M-Mr. Falcon, what have I done to deserve this? I beg you-"

Nathaniel didn't let him finish. His fist connected with Victor's jaw with brutal precision.

The impact sent Victor crashing against the car's side panel.

Nathaniel's tailored suit strained against his muscles as he delivered blow after devastating blow, each strike driving Victor deeper into the metal frame. Blood sprayed across Victor's face, silencing his whimpers.

Nathaniel paused, his icy stare dissecting Victor's broken form. "Which hand touched her? This one?"

A sickening snap echoed as Nathaniel broke Victor's right arm like a dry twig.

Victor collapsed, gasping shallow breaths.

Dominic arrived with security. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel's chiseled jaw remained rigid. "Handle this," he commanded in a voice like frozen steel.

Dominic nodded sharply. "Consider it done."

Nathaniel turned toward the car's backseat. His gaze locked onto Harrison. "Get out. I'm taking you back to campus."

Without waiting for acknowledgment, he slid into the driver's seat of his Rolls-Royce Phantom.

Harrison hadn't anticipated Nathaniel's sudden appearance, nor the savage beating he'd delivered. The raw violence in his movements had been terrifying.

Hadn't he been mocking her earlier?

Why intervene now?

Daphne sported a nasty bruise from hitting the window. Harrison helped her from the wrecked car.

Approaching the Phantom, Harrison saw Victor - once so arrogant - now unconscious on the pavement. The area was already being secured by Nathaniel's team.

Harrison opened the Phantom's door, guiding Daphne inside.

The luxurious interior muted the outside world. Nathaniel sat behind the wheel, methodically cleaning blood from his knuckles with a monogrammed handkerchief.

The engine purred to life as they sped toward Willowridge University, the silence between them thick enough to choke on.

Nathaniel offered no explanation.

Harrison asked no questions.

Daphne, still pale but recovering, turned to Nathaniel. A delicate blush colored her cheeks. "Mr. Falcon... thank you for today." Her voice carried the trained sweetness of a performance major.

Nathaniel didn't acknowledge her, his grip on the steering wheel unchanged. His profile might have been carved from marble for all the warmth it showed.

Harrison's eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, catching Nathaniel's reflection. His gaze met hers with electric intensity.

She looked away first.

Thirty minutes later, the Phantom glided to a stop at Willowridge's gates. Harrison helped Daphne out.

Daphne stood tall despite her injuries, the bruise on her forehead lending her a tragic beauty. She turned back to Nathaniel. "Thank you, Mr. Falcon."

Silence answered her.

Harrison took Daphne's arm gently. "Let's go."

They disappeared into campus.

Nathaniel remained, watching Harrison's retreating figure until she vanished from sight.

A dangerous smirk played at the corner of his lips.

Back in their dorm, Rosalind had just returned from lectures. Her shock was palpable when she heard what happened.

Rosalind exhaled sharply. "Thank God Mr. Falcon showed up when he did. If that creep had gotten you two to his hotel..." She shuddered. "I don't even want to think about it."
###Chapter 196

Rosalind gave Harrison a teasing wink. "Harrison, your husband did quite well this time."

Daphne stared at Harrison in shock. "Harrison, Mr. Falcon is your husband? You're really Mrs. Falcon?"

Rosalind grinned and nodded. "Exactly, Harrison is Mrs. Falcon!"

Daphne couldn't believe it. She grabbed Harrison's arm, envy flashing across her face. "Harrison, you're so fortunate. You must be overjoyed!"

Harrison forced a smile, unsure how to respond. Joy was the last thing she felt these days.

Lying on her bed, Harrison pulled out her phone and opened the chat with "Hubby".

After a long pause, she typed two simple words. [Thank you.]

Just that. Nothing more.

Ding.

Nathaniel's reply came instantly. [How do you plan to thank me?]

Harrison curled her fingers around the device, hesitating. She shoved it under her pillow and closed her eyes.

The next morning, Daphne arrived at Falcon Enterprises. The corporate headquarters dominated Willowbrook's skyline - a gleaming monument to wealth and power that made ordinary people feel insignificant.

Approaching reception, Daphne flashed her brightest smile. "I'd like to see Mr. Falcon."

"Do you have an appointment?" the receptionist asked politely.

"No, but Mr. Falcon knows me."

"I'm sorry, without an appointment-"

Disappointment flickered across Daphne's face as she turned to leave.

Just then, Nathaniel strode through the lobby flanked by executives, all wearing the company's signature blue badges. He was reviewing documents while issuing instructions.

Daphne's eyes lit up. She rushed forward. "Mr. Falcon!"

Nathaniel stopped, his expression blank. "You are?"

He didn't recognize her.

"I'm Harrison's classmate. Thank you for rescuing us last night."

A flicker of recognition crossed Nathaniel's face. Daphne had dressed carefully - a flattering dress, demure posture, the picture of innocence.

"Mr. Falcon, I made this for you." She offered a gift bag eagerly.

Nathaniel remained impassive. "Did Harrison send you?"

"No, I came alone. Harrison went to the hospital to visit Alexander this morning." Daphne's voice dripped with sweetness.

Nathaniel stiffened almost imperceptibly.

"Mr. Falcon, I handmade this-"

"Don't come here again." Nathaniel's icy tone cut her off mid-sentence.

He walked away without another glance.

Daphne stood frozen.

The receptionist appeared. "Miss, you'll need to leave."

Tears welled in Daphne's eyes as she clutched the rejected gift - an embroidered sachet she'd spent hours making.

Outside, a sleek limousine pulled up. Vivian Astor, the entertainment industry's newest sensation, swept into the building surrounded by entourage.

Two employees whispered nearby.

"Isn't that Vivian Astor? The rising star from Apex Entertainment?"

"Anyone signed with Apex is guaranteed success."

"Especially if she catches Mr. Falcon's eye. Then she'd have everything!"
###Chapter 197

Alexander had his answer. "I know Nathaniel. He'll never leave Isabella."

Harrison nodded slowly. "Yes, I understand."

Her phone buzzed again. Penelope's name flashed on the screen.

She answered, and Penelope's excited voice chirped through. "Harrison, come to the Whitmore estate! Everyone's gathering for dinner tonight. You have to be here!"

Harrison hesitated, but Penelope added, "I'm bringing Dr. Sinclair home tonight, so you must come!"

Her tone sharpened with curiosity. "Alright. I'll be there."

That evening, Harrison arrived at the Whitmore estate.

The entire property glittered with decorations, as if celebrating a grand occasion. Servants bustled about, arranging lavish platters of food and crystal glasses.

As she stepped inside, she caught whispers between two maids.

"Tonight, Ms. Penelope is introducing her boyfriend! Do you know who it is? Dr. Sinclair!"

"Dr. Sinclair? Oh my god—I can't believe we'll see him in person!"

"Ms. Penelope is incredible. She actually won him over!"
###Chapter 198

The household staff buzzed with excitement, their admiration for Penelope palpable in every whisper.

Just then, Margaret descended the grand staircase with Frederick and Cassandra from the Whitmore family. All three wore formal attire, their faces alight with anticipation.

When Margaret spotted Harrison, her expression instantly darkened.

"Harrison," she snapped sharply. "Penelope is bringing Dr. Sinclair home for dinner tonight. You will not speak a single word that might embarrass him, or you'll regret it."

Frederick and Cassandra barely glanced at Harrison before turning away. "Mother, Penelope and Dr. Sinclair should be arriving any moment. Let's greet them outside."

As if on cue, a sleek limousine pulled onto the manicured lawn.

Penelope stepped out, radiant in an elegant gown, her arm linked with Dr. Sinclair's.

"Grandmother, Father, Mother," she announced proudly, "allow me to introduce Dr. Sinclair, my partner."

The Whitmores' faces lit up with approval as they turned toward the distinguished physician. "Dr. Sinclair, what an honor," they chorused.

Harrison studied the man from her corner - tall, impeccably dressed in designer clothes, a luxury watch glinting at his wrist. His polished manners and handsome features gave no hint of his true nature. Only she knew the truth behind his charming facade.

Dr. Sinclair smiled warmly. "Mrs. Margaret, Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore, the pleasure is mine. I've brought some small tokens of appreciation."

His driver began unloading an impressive array of gift boxes.

Margaret beamed. "Dr. Sinclair, you're too generous! Please, come inside!"

As the group moved into the grand foyer, Harrison found herself pushed aside, invisible as always.

"Dinner will be served as soon as all our guests arrive," Margaret announced.

Penelope glanced around. "Who are we waiting for, Grandmother?"

"The second branch. Isabella is bringing Mr. Nathaniel tonight," Margaret replied, turning to Dr. Sinclair. "I don't know if you're acquainted with Willowbrook's most prominent businessman, but he's also my son-in-law."

Dr. Sinclair nodded politely. "Mr. Nathaniel's reputation precedes him. I look forward to meeting him."

Harrison's breath caught. She hadn't known Nathaniel would be attending. The rivalry between the family branches had clearly escalated, with both sides parading their most impressive connections.

Another luxury vehicle pulled up outside.

Isabella entered on Nathaniel's arm, followed by Theodore and Victoria.

Margaret rose immediately. "Mr. Nathaniel! Isabella! Welcome!"

Isabella looked stunning in her designer gown, every inch the perfect socialite. Nathaniel cut an imposing figure in his tailored black suit, his sharp gaze immediately finding Dr. Sinclair.

"So you're Dr. Sinclair," he stated coolly.

The physician extended his hand. "Mr. Nathaniel, we've narrowly missed meeting several times. Rest assured, Ms. Isabella is receiving excellent care. A pleasure to finally make your acquaintance."

Nathaniel shook the offered hand, his expression unreadable.

Margaret practically glowed with pride as she took both men's arms. "Isabella and Penelope bring such honor to our family! Now we have two remarkable sons-in-law - Mr. Nathaniel and Dr. Sinclair. We are truly blessed!"
###Chapter 199

Harrison felt like she was standing at the pinnacle of her life, surrounded by the dazzling achievements of her two most beloved granddaughters.

Isabella and Penelope, the twin jewels of the Whitmore family, both wore expressions of triumph that could light up the room.

The entire household buzzed with excitement, their joy palpable in every corner.

Standing silently by the grand staircase, Harrison observed the opulent Whitmore family gathering. She had always been an outsider here, never truly belonging. The only connection she had to this family was through her late father, whose memory had long faded from their collective consciousness.

A sudden prickling sensation made her look up. Nathaniel's intense gaze was fixed on her.

Why was he watching her so intently?

Tonight, he stood proudly beside Isabella, his presence a silent declaration of support.

It was as if everyone had forgotten she was still Mrs. Falcon.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

Harrison averted her eyes.

"Now that we're all assembled, Mr. Falcon, Dr. Sinclair, shall we proceed to dinner?" Margaret announced with practiced grace.

The dining table groaned under the weight of exquisite dishes and rare vintages. Guests began taking their prearranged seats.

Margaret naturally occupied the head of the table. Nathaniel, Isabella, Theodore, and Victoria sat to her left, while Dr. Sinclair, Penelope, Frederick, and Cassandra took the right. The picture-perfect family tableau was complete.

Harrison realized with quiet amusement that no place had been set for her.

Penelope had extended the dinner invitation, yet conveniently forgotten to include her in the seating plan.

"Oh dear," Penelope feigned surprise, her voice dripping with false concern. "Harrison, it seems we've overlooked your seat."

Every head turned toward Harrison, their expressions ranging from indifference to barely concealed disdain.

Margaret sighed impatiently. "The seating was arranged in advance. Harrison, you may dine with the staff in the kitchen."

Victoria, still smarting from Theodore's public rebuke weeks ago, offered a venomous smile. "Or perhaps we could squeeze in a small table for you in the corner?"

The blatant humiliation hung thick in the air, the entire room waiting for Harrison's reaction.

Dr. Sinclair studied Harrison with mild curiosity. "And who might this be?"

Penelope waved a dismissive hand. "Just household help."

The deliberate insult landed like a slap. This entire charade was Penelope's revenge for Harrison witnessing her academic disgrace at the National Medical Gallery.

Isabella shot Harrison a contemptuous glance, clearly enjoying her discomfort.

Harrison remained composed, her clear eyes calmly surveying the assembled guests. A faint, enigmatic smile played on her lips. "No matter. Since there's no place for me here, I'll decline the invitation."

She turned to Dr. Sinclair. "Actually, I only returned tonight to meet you."

Margaret scoffed. "How fortunate for you that Penelope's accomplishments allow you such privileges."

Dr. Sinclair squeezed Penelope's hand affectionately, earning a simpering smile in return.

Harrison's voice remained steady. "Just one word of caution. Since no one here has actually met Dr. Sinclair before, you might want to verify his credentials."

The room went deathly silent.

Fraud?

What was she implying?

Dr. Sinclair's eyes flickered with unease. Had this woman uncovered something?

Impossible. His plan was flawless.

Without another word, Harrison turned and walked away.

As the door closed behind her, Margaret muttered, "What nonsense is she spouting? Suggesting Dr. Sinclair is an imposter?"

Penelope immediately jumped to his defense. Every document checked out. This was undoubtedly the real Dr. Sinclair!
###Chapter 200

Frederick let out an amused chuckle. "Harrison must be seething with jealousy over Penelope. That explains this ridiculous outburst - she's deliberately trying to ruin our dinner."

Cassandra smirked, swirling her wine glass. "That provincial girl actually dared to call Dr. Sinclair a fraud? How pathetically amusing."

Penelope squeezed Dr. Sinclair's hand, her voice dripping with false concern. "Please don't mind anything Harrison says, Doctor. Her jealousy has completely poisoned her mind."

Dr. Sinclair's gaze flickered toward the doorway where Harrison had disappeared, a subtle tension leaving his shoulders. Though uncertain what suspicions Harrison might have, her presence had undeniably put him on edge.

Thankfully, the Whitmore family had handled the situation perfectly.

Surveying the Whitmores' eager faces, the imposter doctor felt confident in his deception. He offered a practiced, benevolent smile. "Think nothing of it. I wouldn't dream of holding her words against her."

Margaret beamed approvingly. "Let's not allow Harrison to spoil our celebration. Everyone, please enjoy the meal."

Penelope practically vibrated with excitement. "Grandmother, I have wonderful news! I've joined Dr. Sinclair's medical team as an investor."

Margaret and the second branch of the family gasped in unison. "You what?"

Dr. Sinclair nodded solemnly. "Indeed. Penelope has invested one hundred fifty million dollars."

Isabella's wine glass nearly slipped from her fingers. "Penelope! Where on earth did you get that kind of money?"

Frederick and Cassandra exchanged smug glances. "We leveraged the company."

The third branch had gambled their entire business empire on this single investment.

Dr. Sinclair's voice oozed confidence. "With my involvement, there's absolutely no risk. I guarantee your investment will double this year - possibly even triple. Penelope's net worth will skyrocket accordingly."

Given Dr. Sinclair's sterling reputation, no one questioned his bold claims.

Suddenly, Isabella, Theodore and Victoria couldn't remain seated. They desperately wanted a piece of this golden opportunity.

Isabella leaned forward eagerly. "Dr. Sinclair, we'd like to invest the same amount."

Theodore and Victoria nodded vigorously. "We can mortgage our company too."

The second branch was ready to stake everything they owned.

Dr. Sinclair hesitated dramatically. "Well..."

Penelope squeezed his arm. "Darling, they'll be family soon. Why not let them join us?"

After a calculated pause, Dr. Sinclair nodded. "Very well. Consider yourselves included."

The second branch nearly cheered. "Marvelous! Thank you, Doctor!"

"Wait!" Margaret's commanding voice cut through the excitement.

All eyes turned to the family matriarch. "What is it, Mother?"

Margaret's eyes gleamed with avarice. "If everyone's investing, I want in too."

"But Mother, you don't have-"

"Nonsense! I'll mortgage the Whitmore estate. Prime real estate like that is worth a fortune. Doctor, count me in."

Dr. Sinclair pretended to consider before nodding magnanimously. "Very well. Let's all prosper together. After all..." He brought Penelope's hand to his lips. "...we'll soon be one big family."

Penelope looked ready to faint from happiness.

The entire Whitmore family buzzed with excitement, having just bet their entire futures on this single opportunity.

Margaret raised her crystal glass. "Now that Harrison's gone, our family's fortunes are finally turning. To our brilliant future!"

Isabella, Theodore and Victoria clinked glasses. "Cheers!"

Penelope, Frederick and Cassandra followed suit. "Cheers!"

The imposter doctor smiled behind his wine glass, watching his marks celebrate their impending ruin.
###Chapter 201

The Whitmore family clinked their glasses together, faces glowing with satisfaction as they sipped their drinks.

Isabella noticed Nathaniel sitting silently in the corner. He hadn't participated in any family discussions, maintaining an unusually low profile.

Ever since Harrison left, Nathaniel had been staring into space, his mind clearly elsewhere.

Isabella couldn't stay quiet any longer. "Nathaniel, is something wrong? Do you object to our investment in Dr. Sinclair's medical team?"

Nathaniel slowly lifted his gaze, his piercing eyes locking onto Dr. Sinclair across the table. There was something unnervingly perceptive in his stare.

For a brief moment, Dr. Sinclair felt a chill run down his spine. Nathaniel's calm yet intense gaze seemed to see right through him. The whole situation - first Harrison, now Nathaniel - was making him increasingly uncomfortable.

But Nathaniel merely gave the doctor a dismissive glance before looking away.

"Not at all. It's your decision to make," he said casually, rising from his seat. "I should go. There's something I need to attend to."

As Nathaniel moved toward the door, Margaret quickly shot Isabella a meaningful look.

"Mr. Falcon, you're leaving already? But you haven't eaten dinner," Margaret interjected smoothly.

Isabella knew Nathaniel was still upset about the photo incident, yet when he heard about her heart condition, he'd rushed over immediately, hadn't he?

Without hesitation, Isabella pressed a delicate hand to her chest.

"Nathaniel, my heart... it hurts," she murmured, her voice laced with just the right amount of vulnerability.

Nathaniel stopped in his tracks.

With a soft sigh, Isabella leaned into him, resting her head against his broad chest. "Nathaniel, would you carry me upstairs? I need to lie down."

Margaret, eager to move things along, added, "Yes, Mr. Falcon. Please take Isabella upstairs to rest."

Nathaniel hesitated briefly, his gaze lingering on Isabella's pale face. Finally, he relented, his strong arms effortlessly scooping her up.

The two disappeared upstairs, leaving the rest of the family behind.

Margaret turned her attention to the other relatives. "Now that Penelope is dating Dr. Sinclair and they'll be married soon, I hope Isabella will be Mrs. Falcon by then."

Theodore and Victoria froze. Things between Nathaniel and Isabella had been strained lately.

Margaret continued pointedly, "I've always favored Isabella. She needs to act quickly. It's time for Mr. Falcon and Harrison to finalize their divorce."

It was true - Nathaniel and Harrison's marriage had dragged on far too long.

Victoria quickly caught the hint. "Don't worry, Mother. Tonight, Isabella will ensure Mr. Falcon stays with her."

Margaret's face lit up with satisfaction. "Excellent. Penelope and Isabella are our family's jewels. A double wedding would be perfect - the talk of Willowbrook! A spectacular event!" Margaret's eyes sparkled as she envisioned the glorious future.

Though the family branches often clashed, they'd remained united after Benjamin's death, particularly in their shared disdain for Harrison.

A joint wedding where the Whitmore daughters married Nathaniel and Dr. Sinclair would elevate their family's status beyond measure.

Margaret raised her glass again. "To our bright future and the life ahead of us. Cheers!"

"Cheers!"

Meanwhile, Harrison hadn't left the estate immediately, wandering instead to the backyard.

There used to be a swing here, one her father had built for her. As a child, she'd sit on it while he pushed her higher than she ever thought possible.

"Fly high, Harrison," Benjamin would say with that warm smile.

Those were the happiest days of her childhood.

But when she reached the backyard now, the swing was gone - completely removed. Margaret must have ordered its removal.

Harrison stared at the empty space, her heart constricting painfully, as if an invisible hand were squeezing it. The last physical traces of her memories here had been erased.

She stood frozen for a long moment before turning to leave. Just then, two maids walked by carrying incense, chatting quietly as they passed.
###Chapter 202

The two maids moved through the candlelit corridor, their whispers barely audible.

"Is this for Mr. Nathaniel and Ms. Isabella's suite?" the younger one inquired, clutching the ornate incense holder.

The older maid nodded. "Direct orders from Mrs. Margaret and Mrs. Victoria. This isn't ordinary incense - it's the strongest aphrodisiac from Santorina."

"Tonight might finally be the night then," the younger giggled.

"Mark my words, by dawn she'll be Mrs. Falcon."

"And don't forget Dr. Sinclair staying over. With Ms. Penelope here too... Mrs. Margaret won't stop boasting about her future grandsons-in-law."

"The Whitmore family's status is about to skyrocket."

Their voices faded as they turned the corner.

Harrison stood frozen in the shadows, having caught every word. So Margaret and Victoria were resorting to drugging Nathaniel now?

That incident at Whitmore Manor had been weak - barely enough to make Nathaniel blink. But this Santorinian blend? Rare. Potent. Impossible to resist.

They were getting desperate.

Should she warn him?

Her fingers curled into fists before relaxing. No. This wasn't her battle. Nathaniel had always belonged to Isabella. The incense just... accelerated the inevitable.

Harrison glanced back at the illuminated mansion, all glittering chandeliers and forced merriment. The fog swallowed her whole as she disappeared into the night.

The maids delivered their package. Isabella sat perched on the silk-covered bed while Nathaniel handed her a crystal glass.

"Feeling better?" His voice gave nothing away.

Isabella's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Much. These heart palpitations... Dr. Sinclair will know what to do."

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Penelope found this doctor?"

"You doubt his credentials?" Isabella's grip tightened on the glass.

Silence stretched between them.

"Really, Nathaniel," she laughed lightly, "Dr. Sinclair comes highly recommended."

Nathaniel stood abruptly. "If you're recovered, I should--"

"Isabella caught his wrist. "Still angry with me? I said I was sorry. Stay."

He extracted himself gently. "Rest."

As he turned to leave, Isabella's voice turned sharp. "Have you developed feelings for Harrison?"

Nathaniel went rigid.

"You wonder why I showed Lionel that photo?" she pressed. "A woman knows. I see how you look at her."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. He tugged at his collar suddenly, heat flooding his veins. The fire spread rapidly, his vision darkening at the edges.

Something was very wrong.

He lunged for the door.

Theodore and Victoria stood there, clearly waiting.

"Mr. Falcon," they greeted nervously.

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "What did you do?"

Theodore swallowed hard. "We only--"

"Mr. Falcon!" Victoria interrupted desperately. "That incense... there's only one way it wears off. If you leave now, what becomes of Isabella?"
###Chapter 203

Nathaniel froze mid-step, slowly turning to face Isabella.

She had also inhaled the potent aphrodisiac, waves of heat flooding her system. Her porcelain skin flushed crimson, teeth sinking into her already swollen lips as she gazed at him with smoldering intensity.

Victoria's voice sliced through the tension. "Mr. Falcon, Isabella requires your presence. Surely you won't abandon her now?"

Silence stretched between them, Nathaniel's expression unreadable as he studied Isabella's desperate form.

Without warning, Isabella threw off the silk sheets, crossing the room in quick strides before launching herself into his arms.

Theodore and Victoria exchanged knowing glances before discreetly exiting, the door clicking shut behind them.

One strap of Isabella's nightgown slipped down, revealing smooth shoulder. She gazed up through her lashes. "Nathaniel, I've always known I'm the one you truly love."

Her arms wound around his neck as she rose on tiptoes, seeking his mouth.

Nathaniel jerked his head aside at the last second.

Isabella blinked in shock before trying again - only to be met with the same rejection.

He pushed her away firmly, voice icy. "This ends now, Isabella. Attempt this again and you'll regret it."

That final threat drained all color from her face.

A clear warning to the entire Whitmore family.

Nathaniel turned to leave.

Panic seized Isabella. She lunged forward, arms locking around his waist. "Don't go! I need you!"

"Release me," Nathaniel ground out.

"Big Brother!" The plaintive cry made him hesitate.

That childhood nickname always weakened his resolve. Isabella's lips curved in triumph as she maneuvered around him.

With surprising strength, she shoved him backward onto the bed.

Before he could react, she straddled his hips, settling firmly against him. "Don't you want me anymore, Big Brother?"

Nathaniel's body betrayed him, muscles tensing beneath her.

Seizing the advantage, Isabella leaned down to claim his mouth.

Meanwhile, Harrison sat beside Alexander in the hospital VIP suite.

Alexander reached for his phone. "I need to discuss the merger with Nathaniel."

The call rang unanswered. Twice. Three times.

"Where the hell is he?" Alexander muttered.

Harrison wrung out a warm towel, fingers moving methodically. "Mr. Falcon is... occupied tonight. Try tomorrow."

"With what?" Alexander snapped, then realization dawned. Occupied... with Isabella.

The aphrodisiac would be taking full effect by now. No chance Nathaniel would answer any calls.

Harrison handed over the towel, changing subjects. "You should rest." Within half an hour, Alexander slept soundly.

Harrison scrolled through her phone, messaging Oliver on WhatsApp. A reply appeared instantly:

[Harrison, the Whitmores walked into a trap. That Dr. Sinclair? Part of an international scam ring. The whole family gambled everything - they're about to lose it all.]
###Chapter 204

Harrison's phone buzzed sharply against her palm just as she was about to reply to Oliver.

The caller ID made her pulse stutter.

Nathaniel.

Why would Nathaniel be calling? Hadn't he left with Isabella?

Her fingers hovered over the screen, but she let it ring through.

The device vibrated relentlessly - three, four, five missed calls before finally falling silent.

Harrison collapsed onto the bed as midnight approached. She squeezed her eyes shut, but rest wouldn't come.

Just as she flipped onto her side, three crisp knocks shattered the silence.

Someone was at her door.

At this hour?

The knocking came again - deliberate, authoritative raps that echoed through the quiet hospital wing.

She swung her legs over the edge and opened the door to find Nathaniel's imposing frame filling the dimly lit corridor. The overhead lights carved sharp angles across his broad shoulders as he stood motionless, those obsidian eyes burning into her.

His sudden appearance in the shadows made her breath catch. What was he doing here?

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to her lips. "You ignored my calls."

That voice - rough velvet with an edge that sent shivers down her spine.

Harrison gripped the doorframe. "I didn't hear them."

A knowing smirk twisted his mouth. "Too busy with Alexander all day to spare me a moment?"

Her nails bit into her palms. "Mr. Falcon, it's late. This can wait until morning."

She moved to shut the door, but Nathaniel braced his knee against it with effortless strength.

Harrison had no choice but to meet that smoldering stare. "What do you want?"

"Would you prefer this conversation in your room?" His voice dropped an octave. "Or shall we take it out here?"

The man radiated command, used to getting exactly what he wanted.

Not wanting to disturb Alexander, Harrison stepped into the hallway.

Nathaniel's fingers closed around her wrist, pulling her forward.

His palm scorched her skin - the aphrodisiac's effects clearly hadn't worn off yet. She didn't want to imagine what had transpired with Isabella.

Harrison twisted her arm. "Let me go!"

Instead of releasing her, Nathaniel guided her down the empty corridor and pressed her against the wall.

Trapped between cold plaster and his hard chest, Harrison shoved against him. "Nathaniel, what are you-"

His mouth crashed down on hers.

Her thoughts short-circuited.

The kiss consumed her, his hands caging her in place against the wall.

Harrison came back to her senses with a jolt, thrashing against him. "Stop!"

She turned her face away, but Nathaniel's ragged breath ghosted across her cheek as he murmured, "You asked what I wanted." His lips brushed her earlobe. "This. Only this."

###Chapter 205

Harrison shoved him back, her voice sharp. "Absolutely not!"

She fought against his grip, her hands pressing against his chest.

In the struggle, her elbow accidentally struck his left hand. Nathaniel flinched, a low groan escaping his lips.

Harrison froze, concern flickering in her eyes. "What's wrong?"

He met her gaze, his jaw tight. "My hand."

He lifted his left hand, revealing the deep scar running across his palm—a jagged reminder of the injury that had required twenty-three stitches. The wound had only recently healed, leaving behind a raised, angry mark.

The dim hallway light cast shadows between them, the air thick with tension. Their breaths mingled, hearts pounding loud enough to hear.

"Harrison, look at it. It hurts," Nathaniel murmured, his voice rough.

She frowned. For a man who rarely acknowledged pain, his insistence was strange.

Her lips curled slightly as she studied the scar. "It's hideous."

A scoff escaped him. Then, without warning, he crushed his mouth to hers, silencing any further words.

Harrison tried to pull back, but his fingers tangled in her hair, holding her in place as he deepened the kiss. His tongue was demanding, relentless, as if he wanted to devour her.

She gasped for air, her fists pressing weakly against his chest. Only then did he finally ease back, his lips lingering before he pulled away completely.

He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his breath hot against her skin. "Harrison," he rasped, "someone drugged me."

Their bodies were pressed so close she could feel the heat radiating from him—and the unmistakable evidence of his arousal. She tried to retreat, but the wall blocked her escape.

"So?" she challenged.

His voice dropped to a whisper. "You've been with Alexander all this time." His lips brushed her ear. "Tonight, you belong to me."

A shiver ran down her spine. She had suspected why he was here, why he had sought her out so late.

But why wasn't he with Isabella? Why had he left the Whitmore estate?

His words from that night in the presidential suite echoed in her mind—how Isabella was pure, untouched, and how Harrison was the one meant to satisfy his desires.

Had he come to her because he didn’t want to taint Isabella?

The humiliation of that memory burned fresh.

She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze squarely. "I don’t want to."

Her refusal was firm, unyielding.

Nathaniel went rigid, his expression unreadable.

Harrison pushed past him, turning to leave.

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Harrison," he demanded, voice thick with disbelief, "do you really not love me anymore?"

She turned back, her eyes steady. "No. I don’t."

His grip loosened. A cold smirk twisted his lips. "Fine."

He pulled out his phone and dialed. "Dominic," he ordered, "send a virgin to Emerald Heights. Now."

The call ended. Without another word, Nathaniel strode away, his footsteps echoing down the hall until he disappeared.

Harrison stood there for a long moment before finally returning to the VIP ward.

Alexander was still asleep, undisturbed by the storm outside.

She lay down on the small bed beside him and closed her eyes.
###Chapter 206

Sleep remained elusive.

A gentle knock interrupted the silence.

Harrison hesitated before opening the hospital door. Dominic stood there, breathless. "Mrs. Falcon."

She stepped into the hallway. "Dominic? What's wrong?"

His expression was urgent. "The Whitmores drugged Mr. Falcon. He needs you at Emerald Heights."

"But he told you to find someone else." Harrison turned back toward her room.

"Mrs. Falcon!" Dominic's voice stopped her. "Those were angry words! Surely you know that?"

Her fingers tightened on the door handle.

"At the resort, Mr. Graves took that knife for you. But you're ignoring how Mr. Falcon injured his hand protecting you too!" Dominic's tone left no room for argument.

Harrison faced him slowly. "His injury isn't my concern."

Dominic pulled out his phone. "Watch this."

The video showed her back turned when a blade flashed toward her. Nathaniel lunged, bare hands catching the steel.

Her breath caught. She'd never known.

"Twenty-three stitches, Mrs. Falcon. The doctors said any later and he might have lost function. That night after you slapped him, he stood outside your door until dawn."

"Harrison!"

"Harrison!"

On screen, Nathaniel and Alexander shouted simultaneously, both racing toward her.

The memory blurred until now. Nathaniel never mentioned it. Why would he risk himself for someone he despised?

"Harrison...my heart hurts."

His words echoed. Twice he'd said it. Now she understood - he wanted her to see the wound while she'd been with Alexander.

The irony almost made her laugh. His childish behavior seemed ridiculous.

"Mr. Falcon spoke harshly because he saw you with Mr. Graves. It upset him."

Harrison studied Dominic. "Why would that upset him?"

"You should ask him yourself. But I believe...he's developed feelings for you."

Feelings? Nathaniel?

Impossible.

She'd never dared hope. The cave promise meant nothing to him now. Only she remembered.

She'd followed him everywhere, begging scraps of affection he poured entirely on Isabella.

Could he truly care for her?

At Emerald Heights, Nathaniel sat rigid on the sofa. He tore off his tie, crumpling it before throwing it aside. His handsome face was stormy, tension thick in the air.

Then - a quiet click. The front door opened. Someone entered...
###Chapter 207
Nathaniel's eyes lifted, and there she stood—Harrison, her delicate frame appearing almost ethereal against the harshness of the world. She had arrived.

His lips pressed into a thin line. "What are you doing here? Who told you to come?"

Harrison stepped forward, closing the distance until she stood directly in front of him.

"Dominic!" Nathaniel's voice was sharp. "Dominic, where's the woman I instructed you to prepare? Why isn't she here?"

Silence.

No response came.

Harrison remained quiet as well.

Nathaniel tugged at his collar, frustration simmering beneath his composed exterior.

"Leave," he snapped at her.

Harrison lowered her long lashes, meeting his gaze with quiet defiance. "Fine. I'll go."

She turned to walk away.

In an instant, a strong hand shot out, gripping her wrist with bruising force. His voice was low, rough with barely restrained anger. "Harrison!"

Nathaniel was furious, her name escaping through clenched teeth.

She turned back, her lashes fluttering as she regarded him with a faint, teasing glint in her eyes. "What do you want?"

Nathaniel yanked her toward him, and her slender body tumbled onto his lap. His skin burned, the effects of the incense long since taking hold. Only sheer willpower had kept him in control until now.

Since returning to Emerald Heights, his vision had blurred, his thoughts clouded.

Now, with Harrison's soft warmth pressed against him, Nathaniel buried his face in her hair, his lips seeking hers. His fingers slid beneath the hem of her blouse, tracing the smooth curve of her waist.

Harrison trembled slightly, a flicker of nervousness betraying her otherwise calm demeanor.

"Why are you shaking?" His voice was rough. "Never been touched before?"

She looked up at him. The usual composed, controlled man was gone—replaced by raw hunger, his gaze dark and unapologetic.

Did he truly think she was the type to flit between men?

Was that why he treated her so carelessly?

Harrison bit her lip, frustration boiling over. She raised her hand, aiming to strike him.

This time, she didn't succeed. Nathaniel caught her wrist mid-air, his grip unyielding. In one swift motion, he pinned her beneath him on the sofa, his heated body trapping her. "You've developed a bad habit. Try that again, and see what happens."

Only she would dare raise a hand against him.

Harrison struggled. "Let go of me."

Nathaniel released her wrist, but his fingers moved to the buttons of her blouse, intent on undoing them.

"Nathaniel, wait. I can help you."

Her fingers brushed against the needle at her waist. She gripped it tightly, ready to press it into one of his pressure points.

But Nathaniel was no ordinary man. He knocked the needle from her grasp before she could act. "What do you think you're doing?"

The needle clattered onto the carpet. Harrison immediately reached for it. "My needle!"

Nathaniel watched as she stretched forward, her silky dark hair cascading over her shoulders, tangling around her slender arms. Her profile was flawless, her skin like porcelain. She was breathtaking.

His gaze lingered, studying her with the intensity of a man who had finally found what he desired. Before Harrison, he hadn't been sure what his type was.

Isabella had been his treasure, his obsession. Everyone assumed he preferred women as bold and striking as crimson roses. He had thought so too.

Until Harrison.

Somehow, she embodied everything he found irresistible.

Nathaniel's eyes remained fixed on her as his fingers moved to the belt at his waist. With a sharp tug, he undid it, the sound cutting through the tension. His heated body pressed down on hers, trapping her completely.

He leaned closer, murmuring her name against her skin. "Harrison."

Her fingers brushed the needle on the carpet. She was so close—

Then she felt the hem of her skirt being pushed up.
###Chapter 208

Harrison froze, her body rigid as she fought against his grasp.

"Don't, Nathaniel!" Her plea came out shaky, barely above a whisper.

Nathaniel pulled her back onto the couch effortlessly, his grip unyielding. Before she could react, his lips crashed against hers in a searing kiss. Harrison pushed against his chest, but her struggle only made him more relentless.

A loud crash shattered the moment as Nathaniel knocked over a vase. Glass shards scattered across the floor, mixing with the mess of papers now strewn everywhere.

Eventually, Harrison stopped resisting. Her forehead bumped against the couch's edge, tears spilling from her eyes.

Nathaniel suddenly stilled, his dark eyes widening in shock. "You're... still untouched?" His voice was thick with disbelief.

He had assumed otherwise. The possibility had never crossed his mind.

Harrison sat up abruptly, fury boiling inside her. In a flash, she sank her teeth into his shoulder, biting hard enough to draw blood. Nathaniel's jaw clenched, a low groan escaping him as he endured the pain.

With a firm grip, he forced her jaw open, making her release him. His left hand held her—the same hand bearing the long scar from when he'd saved her.

But that didn't erase the hurt he'd caused.

Tears streamed down Harrison's face as she glared at him, her eyes burning with anger and pain. Something inside Nathaniel cracked, his chest tightening with regret.

"I was wrong," he rasped, his voice rough. "I'm sorry."

He had been so, so wrong.

She had never been with anyone before. He was her first. And yet, he had treated her horribly, saying things that cut deep.

Harrison turned her face away, refusing his apology. Nathaniel grabbed her hand and forced it against his own face, making her slap him. The sharp sound echoed through the room.

"Hit me again," he urged. "If once isn't enough, do it as many times as you need. I deserve it."

He tried to make her strike him once more, but Harrison pulled her hand back.

A faint smile touched Nathaniel's lips at her hesitation. He leaned down, brushing a soft kiss against her mouth.

"Harrison," he murmured, his voice husky, "do you still love me?"

The question hung heavily between them. And what about him? What did he truly feel?

Harrison hesitated, Dominic's words flashing in her mind. "Nathaniel, have you ever—"

He kissed her again before she could finish. "Have I what?" His breath was warm against her skin.

But she couldn't bring herself to ask. Instead, she shrank back, fear gripping her. Nathaniel tangled his fingers with hers, holding tight.

"Give yourself to me, love," he whispered, his voice deep and velvety, sending shivers through her.

It was the first time he'd called her love, and the way he said it—so tender, so possessive—made her pulse race.

Harrison closed her eyes, unable to look at him. The floor-to-ceiling windows reflected their figures, and she caught a glimpse of Nathaniel's bare torso, his muscles taut as he hovered over her.

She felt like a boat lost in a storm, tossed by relentless waves. She surrendered, letting the currents carry her away.

The next morning, Harrison's lashes fluttered open. She was still in Nathaniel's arms, both of them having fallen asleep on the couch. He hadn't woken yet, his arm draped protectively over her.

She shifted slightly, wincing at the soreness in her body. Last night, they had truly become husband and wife.

As she studied his peaceful, handsome face, she finally gathered the courage to ask the question she hadn't dared to voice before.

"Nathaniel," she whispered softly, "have you ever loved me? Even just a little?"
###Chapter 209

Nathaniel lay motionless in deep slumber, unresponsive to her presence.

Harrison's phone suddenly vibrated with an incoming call.

It was Daphne.

She answered immediately. "Harrison, where are you? Come back to the dorm now - Rosalind's in serious trouble!" Rosalind? In trouble?

Harrison hung up without hesitation. Carefully extracting herself from Nathaniel's embrace, she gathered her scattered clothes from the floor and dressed hastily before rushing out.

Moments after Harrison's departure, the door to Emerald Heights clicked open silently.

Daphne had arrived.

She stepped inside, taking in the scene - Nathaniel still asleep on the couch, clothes strewn across the floor. The evidence of last night's activities was unmistakable.

Nathaniel and Harrison had been intimate.

Daphne's fingers trembled as she unbuttoned her blouse, letting it slide off her shoulders. She positioned herself beside Nathaniel, drinking in his aristocratic features. This proximity to Willowbrook's wealthiest man made her pulse race.

Nathaniel Falcon was breathtakingly handsome.

Her heartbeat pounded so loudly she feared it might wake him.

As Daphne reached to pull the blanket aside, Nathaniel stirred. His eyes fluttered open. "Mr. Falcon, you're awake?" she asked quickly.

Nathaniel's sharp gaze immediately focused on the unfamiliar woman beside him. He sat up abruptly. "Who are you? Why are you here?"

"I'm Daphne," she replied, voice wavering slightly. "We've met before. I'm Harrison's classmate." Recognition flickered in Nathaniel's eyes.

"Mr. Falcon, your secretary contacted me last night. He asked me to come to Emerald Heights to...take care of you. So we..." Daphne trailed off, pulling the blanket higher with feigned modesty.

Nathaniel massaged his temples. The previous night was hazy.

He remembered leaving the Whitmore estate, searching for Harrison at the hospital only to be rejected. The memory of returning to Emerald Heights was fragmented at best.

Yet he distinctly recalled Harrison being there.

The feel of her body beneath his, their passionate entanglement.

But now Harrison was gone, replaced by this stranger.

Had he slept with Harrison's classmate instead?

His gaze fell on the telltale bloodstain on the couch cushion - the undeniable proof of a woman's virginity lost.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Get dressed."

In the study, Dominic entered breathlessly. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel, still wearing yesterday's clothes, demanded coldly, "Did you go to the hospital for Harrison last night?"

"Yes," Dominic confirmed. "I even showed Mrs. Falcon the surveillance footage from Rosewood Manor and explained your hand injury was because of her. I tried persuading her to come here, but...she refused and returned to her patient's room."

Dominic had witnessed Harrison entering the room later.

What he didn't know was that Harrison had left afterward, heading straight to Emerald Heights.

A bitter smile twisted Nathaniel's lips. Of course she hadn't come. Just as he'd expected.

Last night's companion had been her classmate, not her.

The bloodstain confirmed it couldn't have been Harrison.

She'd lost her virginity long ago.

What had he been hoping for? The thought that she might actually come to him was pure foolishness.
###Chapter 210

"After Mrs. Falcon entered the hospital room, I followed your instructions and found you a virgin."

That virgin was Daphne.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his features carved from ice. "Understood."

He strode into the bathroom and turned on the cold shower.

Freezing water poured over his head. He closed his eyes, letting it numb him.

His skin bore angry red scratches, and a deep bite mark marred his shoulder. He had assumed they were from Harrison. Now he knew better.

It had all been an illusion.

A feverish dream where he imagined being with Harrison.

But she never came.

Instead, he had taken her classmate.

Nathaniel scrubbed his skin raw, as if he could erase the evidence.

A loud crack echoed as his fist collided with the tiled wall.

Daphne had dressed and was waiting in the study when Nathaniel entered.

Freshly showered, he wore a crisp white shirt and tailored black trousers. His usual mask of indifference was back in place—cold, detached, untouchable.

"Mr. Falcon," Dominic greeted.

Nathaniel sat behind his desk, his gaze briefly flicking to Daphne. "Take the check and leave."

Dominic handed her the check.

The amount was staggering.

But Daphne didn’t take it. "Mr. Falcon, I don’t want money."

She didn’t want money?

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "This was a transaction. You came here to sell yourself. Don’t insult me by pretending this was anything more."

Daphne paled. She had expected indifference, not cruelty.

He stripped her bare with his words, leaving no shred of dignity. Yet, despite everything, there was something about him—something impossible to resist.

"Mr. Falcon, I know you’re not interested in me. I don’t expect anything romantic. But I want to sign with Falcon Entertainment. I’m in performing arts. Give me the resources to become a star."

Nathaniel studied her for a moment. "Fine."

Making a star was nothing to him. He had the power to do it effortlessly. And he was never petty when it came to business.

"Ms. Sinclair, Falcon Entertainment will contact you shortly to discuss your contract. You’ll receive top-tier resources—reality shows, films, fashion campaigns. A dedicated team will handle your branding and publicity," Dominic explained.

Daphne’s eyes glittered with triumph. This was everything she had ever wanted.

"Thank you, Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel didn’t acknowledge her gratitude.

Dominic gestured toward the door. "Ms. Sinclair, this way."

She had gotten what she came for. There was nothing left to say. Their paths would never cross again.

Daphne cast one last lingering glance at Nathaniel before following Dominic out.

The study fell silent.

Then, the sharp ring of a phone shattered the stillness.

It was Victoria.

"Mr. Falcon, you left Isabella alone last night. Now she’s in the hospital. You need to come immediately!"
###Chapter 211

Harrison sprinted back to the girls' dormitory, her heart pounding. She found Rosalind sitting on her bed, gingerly holding an ice pack to her swollen ankle.

"Rosalind, I'm fine," her roommate insisted. "Just twisted it on the way to class. Already applied some cream. I told Daphne not to bother you about this."

So it was just a sprain.

Daphne's frantic call had made it sound like a life-or-death emergency. Harrison had nearly panicked, imagining the worst.

"Stay off your feet," Harrison ordered, examining the injury. The skin was red but intact.

"Will do."

Assured it wasn't serious, Harrison finally exhaled. She grabbed her sleepwear and headed for the shower.

Every muscle ached. And then there were the marks—Nathaniel's possessive love bites scattered across her neck and collarbones.

The scalding water did little to wash away the memories. His smoldering gaze last night had pinned her in place, dark with desire.

She'd tried covering his eyes playfully. "Stop staring."

He'd caught her wrist instead, pressing hot kisses along her palm. "Harrison," he'd murmured against her skin, "you're breathtaking."

The recollection made her shiver. Harrison shook her head sharply, dispelling the images.

He'd be awake by now. She'd slipped out at dawn without a word. Would he come after her?

Clean and exhausted, Harrison collapsed onto her bed. Sleep claimed her instantly.

When she woke, afternoon light slanted through the blinds. She checked her phone.

Nothing. No calls. No texts. Radio silence from Nathaniel.

A dull ache settled in her chest.

The knock at the door startled her. Rosalind answered to reveal three strangers in sleek black suits.

"Can I help you?" Rosalind frowned.

"We're here for Miss Sinclair's belongings," the lead woman announced.

"Daphne's moving out?" Harrison exchanged shocked glances with Rosalind. "Where to?"

"The Regal Estates."

Harrison's eyebrows shot up. That was Willowbrook's most exclusive gated community—home to A-list celebrities and billionaires.

"You must be mistaken," Rosalind sputtered.

"No error," the woman said crisply. "Miss Sinclair signed with Blackwood Talent Agency this morning. Ms. Genevieve Blackwood will be personally overseeing her career."

Genevieve Blackwood? The legendary manager who'd launched three Oscar winners?

The team worked with clinical efficiency, taking only Daphne's passport and textbooks. Everything else—clothes, toiletries, even her favorite stuffed bear—went straight into trash bags.

Rosalind looked shell-shocked. "Harrison, what just happened? Since when does Daphne have industry connections?"

Yesterday, their roommate had been juggling three part-time jobs. Today, she was moving into a penthouse with a superstar agent.

It felt like watching Cinderella's pumpkin turn into a golden carriage.

The oddest part? Daphne hadn't even come to say goodbye. Harrison watched the entourage leave, unease prickling her neck.

"Those weren't scam artists," she said slowly. "But something's off about this."

Rosalind nodded. "I hope she's safe. After everything she's been through..."

They'd both seen Daphne's struggles—the shame over her working-class roots, the constant financial stress. Whatever this was, Harrison prayed it was truly her friend's fairy tale ending.

###Chapter 212

The phone's sudden chime shattered the heavy silence in the room. Harrison glanced at the screen - Alexander was calling.

"Harrison, they're discharging me today." Alexander's playful tone carried through the receiver. "If you don't come get me, I'll be going home alone."

Harrison gasped, realization dawning. She'd completely forgotten about Alexander's discharge date. Grabbing her purse, she bolted out the door toward the hospital.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel strode through the hospital corridors, his polished shoes clicking against the sterile floors. He reached the VIP ward where Isabella lay motionless.

The oversized hospital gown swallowed her fragile frame. Her face matched the bleached sheets - ghostly pale. The steady beep of monitors confirmed she remained unconscious.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he approached the bed. "What happened to Isabella?"

Theodore stepped forward, his voice strained. "Mr. Falcon, after you left Isabella alone last night, she collapsed. Emergency surgery was required." He swallowed hard. "While the procedure was successful, she hasn't regained consciousness."

Victoria and Theodore exchanged worried glances, their anxiety palpable. Neither had anticipated Nathaniel rejecting Isabella so abruptly.

Guilt twisted in Nathaniel's gut like a knife.

Last night, when Isabella had leaned in for a kiss, only one face had flashed through his mind - Harrison's. That single thought had made him push Isabella away. He'd fled the Whitmore estate, desperate to find Harrison.

Unbeknownst to him, his departure had triggered Isabella's medical crisis.

A faint movement interrupted his thoughts. Isabella's eyelids fluttered weakly.

"Isabella! You're awake!" Theodore and Victoria rushed to help her sit up.

Tears welled in Isabella's bloodshot eyes as they locked onto Nathaniel. Her voice trembled with accusation. "Where were you last night, Nathaniel? You abandoned me. Did you go searching for Harrison?"

Victoria gasped audibly. Nathaniel seeking out Harrison? The revelation stunned her as much as it did Isabella. She'd never imagined Nathaniel would develop interest in that woman.

Nathaniel's fists clenched at his sides, his silence more telling than any words.

White-hot rage burned through Isabella's veins. How could he choose Harrison over her?

Tears streamed down her hollow cheeks. "Nathaniel, you've fallen for Harrison!" This wasn't speculation - she stated it as undeniable fact.

Victoria paled. "Mr. Falcon, how could you—" The words caught in her throat. The idea of Nathaniel loving Harrison seemed impossible. That woman wasn't worthy!

"Remember your promise to me?" Isabella's voice cracked. "You swore you wanted me! If that's changed, then I don't want to live. I'll end it all right now!"

In a dramatic frenzy, Isabella threw off the blankets, her frail body trembling violently.

Nathaniel reacted instantly, pulling her back into his embrace. His voice came out rough. "Nothing happened between Harrison and me."

Isabella stilled, searching his face through tear-blurred vision. "Truly? You're not lying to me?"

Nathaniel met her gaze, the weight of responsibility pressing down. Isabella was his. He couldn't abandon her.

Internally, he acknowledged the inconvenient truth - he'd developed genuine feelings for Harrison. Though unspoken, his heart knew the truth.

But Harrison's feelings had changed.

And Nathaniel had obligations to Isabella.

Gently, he wiped her tears away with his thumb. "Harrison and I are finished."
###Chapter 213

Nathaniel declared it was over between him and Harrison.

Isabella practically glowed with joy, throwing herself into Nathaniel's arms and clinging to him like ivy. "Nathaniel, I know Harrison has her ways with men. I don't blame you for getting caught up, but I always knew you'd come back to me. Your heart has always been mine!"

True, Nathaniel had developed some feelings for Harrison. But the woman who truly owned his soul was Isabella - his cave girl from all those years ago.

His arms wrapped around Isabella in response.

Theodore watched with paternal pride, his daughter's happiness bringing him peace. If she was content, so was he.

Victoria appeared pleased too, though bitterness flickered in her eyes when she thought of Harrison. That country bumpkin had actually managed to intrigue Nathaniel? Unbelievable!

Meanwhile, Harrison arrived at the hospital to find Alexander already packed and ready for discharge.

"Alexander, I'm so sorry I'm late. There was... something I needed to handle." Harrison's apology was genuine.

Alexander flashed his signature grin. "No worries. Let's get out of here."

"I'll take your bags."

Harrison reached for the luggage but underestimated their weight. Still sore from recent events, she stumbled, nearly toppling over.

"Harrison, watch out!"

Alexander lunged forward, his arm catching her waist. Momentum sent them both tumbling backward onto the hospital bed, with Alexander ending up on top.

At that exact moment, a towering figure appeared in the doorway - Nathaniel.

Since Alexander was being discharged from the same hospital where Isabella was recovering, Nathaniel had come to visit. Instead, he found Alexander and Harrison in what appeared to be an extremely compromising position.

Nathaniel froze, his muscular frame turning to stone.

Just last night, Harrison had rejected him so definitively. Yet here she was, tangled up with Alexander. A cold, mirthless laugh escaped his lips as he turned sharply on his heel and strode away.

"Harrison, are you okay?" Alexander asked, concern etching his handsome features.

She shook her head, still startled. "I'm fine."

Alexander immediately released her and they both sat up. "Forget the bags. I'll have my driver handle them."

Harrison nodded, but then a voice echoed from the hallway - "Mr. Falcon."

Her heart stuttered. Nathaniel? He was here?

She scrambled off the bed and rushed into the corridor. There, disappearing down the hallway, was Nathaniel's unmistakable silhouette.

"Nathaniel!" Her voice rang clear through the hospital corridor.

He didn't turn. Didn't pause.

"Nathaniel!" She broke into a run, desperate to catch him.

Just as she closed the distance, a nurse pushing a medication cart called out, "Coming through! Make way!"

Harrison couldn't react in time. The cart clipped her arm, tearing skin and drawing blood.

"Harrison!" Alexander was at her side instantly, panic in his voice. "Are you hurt?"

She barely registered the pain, her eyes searching the now-empty hallway where Nathaniel had vanished. Her heart sank like a stone.

Later, back in her dorm room, Harrison lay on her bed messaging Gabrielle on WhatsApp.

[Gabrielle, my friend lost her virginity to her husband, but afterward he's been completely distant. What does that mean?]

Romance was still new to Harrison, and Nathaniel had been her first. His sudden coldness after their night together left her confused and aching with unanswered questions.
###Chapter 214

Harrison had no choice but to turn to her closest confidante for guidance.

Ding!

Gabrielle's response flashed on the screen. [That means your friend failed to satisfy her husband in bed. He lost interest after just one night.]

What? Could that truly be the case?

Harrison pondered this. For a marriage to thrive, compatibility in all aspects was crucial - especially physical intimacy.

She knew men like Nathaniel had exacting standards when it came to pleasure. He required a woman who could match his intensity between the sheets.

Had she disappointed him last night? Had Nathaniel grown bored after their first encounter?

Ding!

Another message from Gabrielle appeared. [Harrison, don't tell me this "friend" is actually you! Have you and Nathaniel slept together?]

Harrison hesitated, then quickly deflected. [Of course not.]

Setting her phone aside, Harrison drifted into a restless sleep.

Morning came, and she mechanically went through her routine. Then came the horrifying realization - Nathaniel hadn't used protection!

They'd gone at it three times, each session more passionate than the last. He'd lost control, she'd surrendered completely. And each time, he'd finished inside her.

To make matters worse, she'd forgotten her birth control pill yesterday.

Panic set in. Given Nathaniel's current attitude toward their relationship, children were definitely not in the cards. He wouldn't want her pregnant either.

With no time for homemade remedies, Harrison dashed to the nearest pharmacy.

"May I help you, miss?" the pharmacist inquired.

Her eyes locked onto the emergency contraception display. Though allergic to one ingredient, she had no alternatives.

"That one, please."

She swallowed the pill dry and hurried back to Willowridge University.

Rosalind spotted her on campus. "Harrison! I've been looking everywhere for you!"

Harrison's face had gone ghostly pale. The morning-after pill was triggering a violent allergic reaction.

Rosalind watched in horror as sweat beaded on Harrison's forehead. Her breathing grew labored, her entire body trembling.

"Harrison! What's wrong?" Rosalind's voice shook with alarm.

Before Harrison could respond, her vision darkened and she collapsed.

"Harrison! Someone help!" Rosalind screamed.

Frantic, Rosalind half-carried Harrison to the campus clinic. "She just passed out! I don't know what's happening!"

The nurse reviewed the preliminary tests. "Severe allergic reaction to medication."

"What medication?" Rosalind demanded.

"Emergency contraceptive. She's highly allergic."

Rosalind's jaw dropped. She hadn't realized Harrison had taken such drastic measures.

Now Harrison lay curled in a fetal position, drenched in sweat, clutching her stomach in obvious agony.

Without hesitation, Rosalind dialed Nathaniel.

At the hospital, Nathaniel sat beside Isabella's bed. The clingy woman rested her head against his chest.

"Would you like some fruit?" Victoria offered a plate of sliced mango.

Isabella pouted. "Feed me, Nathaniel."

He speared a piece with a fork and brought it to her lips.

Just as she leaned forward, his phone rang. Rosalind's frantic voice came through. "Nathaniel, where are you?"

"At the hospital with Isabella," he replied absently.

"Harrison is seriously ill, and you're playing nurse? Get to Willowridge now! She took emergency contraception and had a severe allergic reaction - she collapsed!"
###Chapter 215
Nathaniel froze.

Harrison fainted from taking what?

A morning-after pill?

He wanted to demand answers, but before he could speak, the line went dead. Rosalind had hung up.

Isabella, who had overheard, stared at Nathaniel in shock. "Harrison took a morning-after pill and fainted?"

Nathaniel didn’t respond. He shoved Isabella aside without hesitation.

"I'm going to Willowridge University," he snapped, his voice sharp with urgency.

He stormed out.

Isabella turned to Victoria, bewildered. "Mother, what’s happening? Nathaniel and Harrison haven’t been together. Why would she take that pill?"

Victoria frowned, equally confused but serious. "I’ll find out."

Nathaniel arrived at Willowridge in record time, heading straight to the medical office. "Finally! Look at her!" Rosalind dragged him toward the bed.

Nathaniel’s gaze dropped to Harrison.

She lay curled on her side, pale and fragile, her usual defiance gone. She looked heartbreakingly delicate.

Just then, Harrison stirred and opened her eyes.

"Harrison, you're awake," Rosalind murmured, helping her sit up.

Harrison blinked, startled. "Why are you here?"

Nathaniel stood tall, his expression unreadable.

"Rosalind called me," he said flatly.

Harrison hadn’t expected her allergy to morning-after pills would lead to this. She shot Rosalind a glare. "You shouldn’t have—"

Rosalind cut her off. "You had an allergic reaction! Of course I called him! He needs to take responsibility!"

She whirled on Nathaniel, accusatory. "Those pills are already harmful, and her allergy made it worse. If you don’t want kids, take precautions yourself next time! Don’t make her suffer for your carelessness!"

Harrison’s cheeks burned with humiliation.

"Rosalind, stop," she whispered.

Nathaniel’s cold gaze settled on Harrison. He spoke to Rosalind, not her. "Leave."

"Fine. Talk." Rosalind marched out.

Now, they were alone. Harrison shifted uncomfortably. Did he think she’d orchestrated this? That she’d dragged Rosalind into some scheme to trap him?

"Nathaniel—" she began, but he cut her off, his voice icy.

"Have you been seeing Alexander a lot?" His eyes narrowed, studying her.

Harrison stiffened. What kind of question was that?

She had been at the hospital with Alexander.

"Yes," she admitted quietly.

Nathaniel smirked, his lips curling with disdain.

So, the pill was for Alexander. Had they been reckless?

His gaze turned colder, laced with mockery.

"Why did you take it?" he demanded, voice dripping with contempt.

Harrison looked down. "I didn’t want to get pregnant."

She didn’t want his child.

For a fleeting second, something flickered in Nathaniel’s eyes. Then it vanished. "Smart. It’s fine if we see others, but if you end up pregnant, don’t expect anything from me."

Harrison’s breath hitched.

What? What was he implying?

The warmth in her chest dissolved into icy numbness. Her hands turned cold.

Nathaniel’s smirk deepened. "After all this, you still called me? Don’t ever do that again."

###Chapter 216

Harrison's pale eyes instantly welled up with tears. She had always known Nathaniel possessed a special talent for humiliation.

When he wanted to wound someone, he did it with surgical precision - striking at their most vulnerable spot.

She hadn't asked Rosalind to contact him.

Even if she had, what difference did it make?

He was the one who hadn't bothered with protection!

"I understand," Harrison choked out, her voice trembling. "Don't worry, Mr. Falcon. I won't disturb you again. You can go now."

She forced her chin up, blinking rapidly to hold back the tears. Crying in front of him would be the ultimate defeat. Nathaniel noticed her red-rimmed eyes and felt an unexpected rush of satisfaction. It tasted like vengeance, bitter yet sweet.

He knew he despised her. Despised how she'd stood him up that night.

He'd deliberately called Dominic, certain he'd fetch her.

But she never came.

What infuriated him more was her calling him when she collapsed.

She'd taken morning-after pills because of Alexander and still reached out to him? What did she take him for?

Nathaniel's lips twisted into a cruel smirk. His words cut deeper than before. "Let's finalize this divorce. We can keep it from Grandmother, but at least get the legalities sorted—"

Before he could finish, Harrison grabbed a pillow and hurled it at his face with all her strength. "Leave!"

She needed him gone.

The pillow struck his chiseled features before tumbling to the floor. In a flash, Nathaniel pinned her back onto the mattress.

Harrison struggled, but he trapped both wrists against the bed, his voice a dangerous growl. "Harrison, who gave you permission to strike me? Have I been too soft on you?"

Harrison bit her lip, but the tears broke free like a dam bursting.

Her vision blurred as they streamed down her cheeks.

She sobbed openly.

Nathaniel's chest constricted. He'd wanted to see her break, but now that she had, it unsettled him. She always did this—left him conflicted and frustrated.

Harrison drew a shuddering breath, her voice fractured. "Nathaniel, I hate you... I truly, deeply hate you...!"

She repeated it between sobs, each word dripping with anguish.

Nathaniel knew she excelled at manipulating men, yet even now, she reeled him in. His throat tightened. "Why?"

She was the one who'd betrayed him.

She remained his wife!

Tears carved paths down Harrison's pale face, sorrow and fury overwhelming her. "Because you reject me...because you weaponize my love to hurt me..."

He'd promised to want her, yet never had.

Throughout their marriage, kindness had been absent. Only torment.

She genuinely loathed him.

Why was he doing this?

Nathaniel felt something shift inside him—an unfamiliar ache mingled with tenderness. His thoughts scattered like leaves in a storm.

He opened his mouth to speak, but his gaze caught on her collar.

The angle revealed delicate collarbones marred with love bites.

The marks trailed downward, vanishing beneath the neckline of her nightgown.

Nathaniel could easily imagine how passionate things had gotten between her and Alexander.

Dark fury clouded his narrowed eyes. That fleeting softness evaporated, replaced by icy bitterness. This was just another of her manipulations!

She didn't love him.

He released her abruptly and sat on the bed's edge.

Harrison rolled away, presenting her back. She swiped at her damp cheeks. "I'll leave whenever you're ready. Just say the word."

###Chapter 217

Harrison lay curled on her side, her back turned away from Nathaniel. He sat rigidly on the bed's edge, the tension between them thick enough to slice with a knife. They could have been mistaken for any married couple in the midst of a devastating fight.

Nathaniel's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists. After what felt like an eternity, he finally ground out a single syllable. "Fine."

He rose abruptly and strode out without another word.

Just like that, he was gone.

Tears Harrison had been desperately holding back now spilled freely down her cheeks. She yanked the blanket over her tear-streaked face, trying to smother the pain. It meant nothing. Just one terrible night. If he didn't care for her, she'd pretend it never happened.

Yet her heart shattered all the same. The ache was unbearable.

Deep down, Harrison knew the painful truth - she still loved Nathaniel.

With every fiber of her being.

From that day forward, an icy silence settled between them. Meanwhile, the media's spotlight had shifted entirely to Daphne Sinclair.

Daphne had unexpectedly joined one of the hottest reality shows, her popularity exploding overnight. With her girl-next-door charm and angelic smile, she amassed millions of adoring fans. Almost instantly, she became the entertainment industry's newest darling.

Whispers circulated that Daphne had secured the lead role in "Golden Years," a major motion picture directed by an Oscar-winning filmmaker. Simultaneously, she'd landed five high-profile magazine covers and lucrative endorsement deals. Overnight, she'd achieved what took others decades - becoming a bona fide superstar.

One evening, Harrison and Rosalind visited The Grand Celeste for dinner. As they approached the entrance, a swarm of bodyguards suddenly descended, barking orders. "Clear the way! Move aside!"

One guard roughly shoved Harrison and Rosalind against a wall before erecting a barrier.

Rosalind nearly toppled over, but Harrison caught her just in time. "What the hell?" Rosalind snapped. "Who exactly are we in the way of?"

The guard sneered. "Don't tell me you've never heard of Ms. Daphne Sinclair?"

Daphne?

Just then, a sleek black limousine pulled up. An assistant sprang to open the door as Daphne's high-powered manager, Genevieve, helped her out.

It had been months since Harrison and Rosalind had seen Daphne in person. Sure, they'd watched her meteoric rise on television, but face-to-face, she was nearly unrecognizable.

The transformation was staggering. Dressed head-to-toe in haute couture, her delicate features hidden behind oversized sunglasses, Daphne moved with the effortless grace of Hollywood royalty. A small army of assistants and stylists orbited around her.

"Ms. Sinclair, what an honor!" The hotel manager gushed, practically tripping over himself to greet her.

Not long ago, Daphne had worked here as a server. Now, she commanded the kind of reverence reserved for A-list celebrities.

Removing her sunglasses, Daphne revealed a flawlessly contoured "natural" makeup look. Her already striking features now glowed with an otherworldly radiance. "Mr. Whitmore," she purred with a playful smile, "how nostalgic. I used to wait tables here."

"An absolute privilege, Ms. Sinclair! My deepest apologies for not recognizing your star quality sooner. Your penthouse suite is prepared. Right this way."

With her entourage in tow, Daphne swept inside like visiting royalty.

Rosalind stood frozen. "Harrison...is that really Daphne? She's like a completely different person!"

Harrison studied Daphne's face, where innocence had been replaced by something harder, more calculating. She frowned slightly. "Yes...she's changed."

At that precise moment, Daphne turned - and locked eyes with Harrison and Rosalind.

###Chapter 218

Daphne froze mid-step. "Harrison, Rosalind! What a surprise seeing you both here." Rosalind and Harrison moved closer, but Daphne's security detail in dark suits immediately blocked their path.

"Halt!" a bodyguard barked.

Daphne waved them off with a graceful hand. "Relax. These are my university friends."

The guards reluctantly stepped aside, allowing Rosalind and Harrison to approach.

"Daphne, I can't believe you're famous now!" Rosalind gasped, eyes wide with amazement.

Daphne arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "Well, I found myself a man. He's the reason behind all this." She gestured at her entourage.

"A man? You're seeing someone? Since when?" Rosalind's voice rose in shock.

A smug smile played on Daphne's lips. "He's gorgeous, loaded, and spoils me rotten. Absolutely adores me."

Without warning, Daphne grabbed Harrison's hand. "Harrison, darling, everything's going perfectly for me now. You must be thrilled for me, right? Surely you wish us happiness?"

Harrison's clear gaze remained steady on Daphne's face as she quietly said, "Congratulations, Daphne."

"Thanks," Daphne purred. "Must dash now. Let's do lunch sometime."

With that, she turned on her designer heels and disappeared into the crowd with her team.

Rosalind stared after her. "Harrison, who is this mystery man? Whoever he is, he's got serious connections in Willowbrook to bankroll this lifestyle. Not many can afford this level of extravagance."

Willowbrook's elite circle was tight-knit. Few possessed the means to shower someone with such lavish attention.

Harrison watched until Daphne vanished from sight. "I've no idea."

"Honestly? I think she's found herself a sugar daddy. Who do you think it could be?" Rosalind speculated.

Harrison glanced toward where Daphne had disappeared, then gently took Rosalind's arm. "Whatever the case, she got what she wanted. Rosalind, I'm starving. Let's grab dinner."

"Absolutely."

Meanwhile, Daphne strode down the corridor flanked by her team. Her manager, Genevieve, briefed her: "Daphne, we've got a 9 AM shoot tomorrow at Vogue Paris."

Vogue Paris?

A memory surfaced. "Isn't Gabrielle Sunder the deputy editor there?"

Genevieve nodded. "Correct."

A sly grin spread across Daphne's face. Gabrielle was Harrison's closest friend.

"Perfect. We'll be there bright and early."

Tomorrow promised to be... entertaining.

The next morning...

Harrison had just left class when Rosalind came running, breathless.

"Harrison! Did you hear? Daphne was at Vogue Paris today shooting for her new film 'Prime Time.' During a wire stunt, the harness broke! She fell and got injured - they rushed her to hospital!"

Harrison stiffened, shocked. She never followed celebrity gossip, but the news was everywhere. Headlines screamed: "Daphne Sinclair Injured During Photoshoot."

"How bad is it?" Harrison asked.

"Should be fine," Rosalind panted.

A terrible thought struck Harrison. "Rosalind, where exactly was this shoot?"

"Vogue Paris studios."

Harrison's stomach dropped. She immediately dialed Gabrielle. The phone rang endlessly with no answer.

Growing increasingly concerned, Harrison called Gabrielle's assistant instead. The voice that answered trembled with panic.

"They took Gabrielle... She's being held at the police station!"
###Chapter 219

Gabrielle had been arrested?

Harrison's face drained of color as she ended the call. She turned to Rosalind. "We need to get to the police station immediately."

"I'm coming with you," Rosalind responded without hesitation, already grabbing her coat.

At the precinct, they found Gabrielle locked behind bars. Harrison reached through the bars to grasp her friend's trembling hands. "Gabrielle, what's going on? Why are you here?"

Gabrielle looked pale and bewildered. "Harrison, it's all because of that actress, Daphne Sinclair."

She quickly explained the situation.

"Daphne came to Vogue Paris for a photoshoot. They needed her to perform a wire stunt, but someone had tampered with the equipment beforehand. When she fell, she pointed directly at me, claiming she saw me sabotage the wire. The police arrested me on the spot. Please, Harrison, you have to believe me! I would never do something like this! I have no reason to hurt her!"

Gabrielle's voice cracked with desperation. Daphne had fabricated the entire accusation, making it appear as though Gabrielle had attempted murder.

Rosalind shook her head in confusion. "Who would actually cut the wire? If Gabrielle didn't do it, why is Daphne accusing her? There's no bad blood between them, is there?"

Gabrielle looked equally perplexed. "Exactly! I don't understand why she's targeting me. We've never even had an argument."

A sudden realization flashed through Harrison's sharp eyes. She squeezed Gabrielle's hand reassuringly. "Don't worry. I'll speak with Daphne personally. Once she withdraws her statement, you'll be released."

At the hospital, Rosalind voiced her suspicions. "Harrison, do you think Daphne set Gabrielle up? It makes no sense. Gabrielle is your closest friend."

Harrison had considered this possibility but chose not to comment.

In the VIP suite, Daphne lounged on the hospital bed. Thanks to Vogue Paris's strict safety protocols and the thick crash mats, she'd escaped serious injury despite the fall. She was perfectly fine.

When Harrison and Rosalind entered, Daphne showed no surprise. Her lips curled into a smug smile. "Well, well. Harrison. Rosalind."

Harrison approached the bed, eyeing Daphne's supposed injuries. "Are you alright, Daphne?"

Daphne gave a careless shrug. "Never better."

"We just came from the station," Rosalind said bluntly. "Gabrielle couldn't have sabotaged that wire. Are you certain you didn't mistake someone else?"

Harrison locked eyes with Daphne. "Gabrielle is my best friend. I expect you to withdraw your accusation immediately."

Daphne stretched lazily on the bed before suddenly declaring, "I'm thirsty."

Her assistant immediately jumped up. "I'll get you some water."

Daphne didn't even glance at her. "I didn't ask you!"

The assistant froze, awkwardly hovering.

Daphne's gaze slid to Harrison, her meaning clear. She expected Harrison to serve her. Rosalind opened her mouth to protest, but Harrison raised a hand to stop her. "I'll do it."

Harrison poured a glass of water and handed it to Daphne.

Daphne smirked. "How kind of you, Harrison."

But as their fingers brushed, Daphne's expression twisted. With a sharp motion, she knocked the cup from Harrison's hands. "This is scalding! Are you trying to burn me?"

Water splashed across Harrison's hands and clothes.

Rosalind immediately grabbed tissues, dabbing at Harrison's soaked sleeves. "What the hell, Daphne? You've been acting bizarre around Harrison lately! Are you deliberately targeting her?"
###Chapter 220

Harrison tested the water with her fingertips. The temperature was mild, not scalding as she'd expected.

Her piercing gaze locked onto Daphne's face. "You deliberately framed Gabrielle. This was never about her, was it? Your real target is me."

Daphne gave a careless shrug, lips curling into a sly smirk. "Obviously." Rosalind's face flushed with anger. "Have you gone completely mad, Daphne? Harrison always treated you like family. Or have you forgotten who rescued you when Victor Blackwell took you from The Grand Celeste? Now that you're some big-shot celebrity, you've turned your back on everyone? This is how you repay kindness? Where's your conscience?"

Not a trace of remorse showed on Daphne's face. Instead, she let out a chilling laugh. "There it is - the truth finally comes out. You're just jealous. Jealous of my wealthy boyfriend. Jealous of my fame!"

Jealous?

Rosalind gaped in disbelief. "If you're so proud of him, why not tell us his name?"

Harrison gently pulled Rosalind back, her sharp eyes studying Daphne. "Do I know this boyfriend of yours?"

Daphne had dropped enough hints - she should have figured it out by now.

Daphne remained silent.

Just then, her assistant answered a call and whispered urgently in her ear.

Daphne's face lit up with excitement as she smirked at Harrison. "Sorry, but Gabrielle's situation will have to wait. I won't retract my statement. My boyfriend heard about my injury and he's coming to pick me up from the hospital."

Rosalind clenched her fists. "You little-"

Daphne swung her legs off the bed with practiced grace. After adjusting her designer dress and checking her reflection with satisfaction, she strode toward the door, her assistant scurrying after her.

"What a snake! We completely misjudged her. Who the hell is this sugar daddy of hers? Must be someone important to give her that kind of arrogance." Rosalind fumed.

Harrison stared at the empty doorway where Daphne had disappeared. After a beat, she said, "Let's follow her. We'll find out who he is."

She needed to know the identity of the man pulling Daphne's strings.

They hurried downstairs in time to see Daphne waiting curbside, her mystery man yet to arrive.

"There!" Rosalind pointed.

Harrison looked up to see an elongated Phantom Rolls-Royce gliding toward them, its obsidian exterior gleaming with understated opulence. The vehicle commanded attention, its imposing presence drawing stares from passersby.

Daphne transformed instantly - the haughty celebrity melting into a lovesick girl. Her assistant opened the rear door and Daphne slid inside with practiced elegance.

The tinted windows revealed nothing, keeping their secrets locked away. Everything about the car whispered discretion and power.

Within moments, the luxury vehicle disappeared into the night, taking Daphne with it - just as she'd disappeared from Harrison's life.

Rosalind frowned. "That car screams money and influence. But I still can't place who it belongs to."

When she reached for Harrison's hand, she gasped at the icy chill. "Harrison! Your hands are freezing. What's wrong?"
###Chapter 221
Harrison averted her eyes and gave a slight shake of her head. "Rosalind, I'm alright."

She reached for her phone and dialed the Falcon family estate.

Eleanor's cheerful voice filled the line. "Harrison, you've finally called! I've been missing you terribly!"

Harrison watched through the window as a sleek black limousine approached. "Grandmother, I don't have classes tonight. I can come home for dinner."

"Perfect! Nathaniel will be joining us too. I'll have everything prepared."

"Alright."

Ending the call, Harrison turned to Rosalind. "I need to return to the Falcons tonight."

Rosalind nodded. "Go enjoy dinner with Mrs. Eleanor."

Harrison met her gaze steadily. "No. I'm going to uncover who's supporting Daphne."

"What?"

Rosalind blinked, clearly startled.

The long black Bentley glided smoothly down the avenue. Dominic drove up front while Daphne sat in the back, stealing glances at the man beside her.

Nathaniel wore an impeccably tailored charcoal suit, a silk handkerchief peeking from his breast pocket. Fresh from a high-stakes board meeting, his commanding presence seemed to absorb the city's neon glow, just as breathtaking as when she'd first laid eyes on him.

Nathaniel flipped through a file without acknowledging Daphne.

She gazed at him, admiration shining in her eyes. "Mr. Falcon, I took that fall during practice today, but I'm fine. You didn't need to come check on me personally."

Nathaniel didn't look up, his voice icy. "Did Harrison visit you at the hospital?"

Daphne froze.

Nathaniel snapped the file shut, his piercing dark eyes locking onto hers. "Mind your words around Harrison. Understood?"

His tone left no room for argument—a clear warning to watch what she said in Harrison's presence.

Daphne stiffened.

She'd thought he'd come specifically to see her after the accident. Instead, his concern revolved entirely around Harrison.

Worse, he'd issued a direct warning—ensuring she wouldn't reveal their night together to Harrison.

Humiliation burned through her. How could she not resent Harrison?

They'd both come from nothing. Harrison was just another country girl, no better than her.

Yet Harrison carried herself with effortless grace—calm, sharp, decisive—everything Daphne struggled to be.

And now Harrison had become Mrs. Falcon, married to the man Daphne worshipped like a god.

Why her? If Harrison could have him, why couldn't Daphne?

She'd tracked Nathaniel's movements meticulously, waiting for her chance. That night, when Dominic had been searching for a virgin, she'd thought her moment had arrived.

But when she reached Emerald Heights, Harrison had already taken her place in Nathaniel's bed.

It should've been her.

The jealousy festered. The hatred grew.

Nathaniel's cold indifference only stoked the flames.

Still, she dared not show it. She dipped her head. "Understood, Mr. Falcon."

Just then, a melodic ringtone interrupted them—a call from the Falcon estate.

Nathaniel answered. Eleanor's delighted voice chimed through. "Nathaniel, hurry home! Harrison's joining us for dinner!"

A flicker of something unreadable crossed Nathaniel's striking features. "I'm on my way."

Hanging up, he turned to Dominic. "Pull over."

The luxury vehicle came to a seamless stop.
###Chapter 222

Nathaniel's sharp gaze landed on Daphne beside him. "Get out."

His command was ice-cold, leaving no room for argument.

Without ceremony, he abandoned her on the deserted roadside.

Daphne stepped onto the pavement just as the luxury sedan roared away, enveloping her in a cloud of exhaust fumes.

Her fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms. A frustrated stomp sent gravel scattering.

Meanwhile, Harrison had already arrived at the Falcon estate, seated across from Eleanor in the grand parlor.

The heavy oak doors swung open moments later. A gust of chilly night air announced Nathaniel's return.

"Mr. Falcon," the butler greeted with a bow.

Nathaniel kicked off his shoes with practiced ease, striding into the dining room with predatory grace. His eyes locked onto Harrison immediately.

Months had passed since their last encounter in the university infirmary. Harrison looked different now - her once cherubic face had sharpened into elegant angles, though her school uniform still clung to her slender frame. The high ponytail swayed as she turned, that youthful vibrancy still evident despite her newfound poise.

Nathaniel studied her in silence.

"Harrison darling! You're just in time for dinner," Eleanor chirped, ushering them to the table.

They took their customary seats - Eleanor at the head, Nathaniel and Harrison facing each other like opponents across a chessboard.

When the butler served the soup, Nathaniel's nose wrinkled at the first sip. "Grandmother, what is this?"

Eleanor's eyes twinkled mischievously. "Falcon fertility tonic, dear. For your... stamina."

Nathaniel's spoon froze mid-air.

"Now Nathaniel," Eleanor continued, "remember our little chat? The Falcon lineage won't continue itself. Drink up - I expect great-grandchildren by next season."

Nathaniel's gaze snapped to Harrison.

She met his stare unflinchingly, her voice calm but firm. "Eleanor, I have evening lectures."

The older woman blinked in surprise. "But you just arrived! Surely you can stay the night?"

"My research can't wait," Harrison demurred, though her knuckles whitened around her napkin.

Eleanor sighed, piling Harrison's plate with roasted lamb. "You're skin and bones, child. At least let Nathaniel drive you back to campus."

Nathaniel observed Harrison's unnatural stillness. Moonlight caught the fan of her lashes as she picked at her food with delicate precision. The quiet intensity radiating from her made something twist in his chest.

After dinner, Harrison rose abruptly. Nathaniel snatched his keys, following her into the night.

As they crossed the manicured lawn, a familiar scent stopped Harrison dead. Peaches and vanilla - Daphne's signature perfume.

The same fragrance Daphne had bragged about in the hospital, giggling about how her mysterious benefactor loved it.

Harrison's blood ran cold. The final puzzle piece clicked into place.

In all of Willowbrook, only one man had the power to transform an unknown girl into an overnight sensation.

Nathaniel Falcon.

The truth she'd been avoiding now stared her in the face.

Nathaniel noticed her sudden tension. "What brought you here tonight?" he asked, unlocking the car.

Harrison turned slowly. "Mr. Falcon, are you free tomorrow?"

"Why?"

"Let's finalize our divorce at the courthouse."

Nathaniel's hand stilled on the door handle.

Harrison's voice cut through the night air like shards of ice. "I won't wait another day, Nathaniel. This marriage ends now."
###Chapter 223

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. The memory of Harrison taking the morning-after pill for Alexander still burned in his mind. Their weeks of silence had been his way of creating distance between them.

Yet tonight, she'd returned to the family estate for dinner. He'd foolishly hoped it meant she was reconsidering their marriage.

Instead, she dropped this bombshell.

She wanted a divorce. Immediately.

Did she think he had endless patience for her games?

Nathaniel's grip tightened around her slender wrist, his eyes turning glacial. "Harrison, you came back just to torment me, didn't you?"

She wrenched her arm free. "Don't touch me with those disgusting hands!"

His jaw clenched.

She lifted her chin defiantly, meeting his dangerous gaze without flinching. "Nathaniel, you make me sick."

Sick to her stomach. Sick of everything.

A vein pulsed at Nathaniel's temple as he shoved her against the Bentley Continental. His fingers closed around her delicate throat. "Do you have a death wish?"

Harrison almost laughed at her own naivety. She'd actually believed he might care for her, even a little.

But there was nothing. Only humiliation.

That night she'd given him her virginity, he'd treated her like trash. And now? He was funding her classmate Daphne as his mistress.

Of all women, why her classmate?

Bile rose in Harrison's throat.

Her usually calm eyes burned with unshed tears as she glared at him. "Strangle me if you want. You're still revolting. I want that divorce tomorrow. I'm done being Mrs. Falcon."

Nathaniel saw red. His chest heaved as his icy composure shattered.

She thought he was disgusting?

The feeling was mutual. How many men had she slept with anyway?

He fought to control the storm inside him.

"Explain," he ground out. "What exactly disgusts you?"

"Daphne Sinclair. Did you think I wouldn't find out?"

Nathaniel froze. She knew.

He'd specifically warned Daphne to keep quiet. He couldn't explain why, but the thought of Harrison knowing he'd slept with her classmate unsettled him.

He'd braced for her reaction, but not this level of contempt.

Nathaniel released her throat only to seize her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. His lips curled into a cruel smirk. "Isn't this what you wanted? You told me to find another woman."

Harrison blinked in confusion.

His smirk widened as he patted her cheek mockingly. "Stop pretending, Harrison. When I pursued you, you rejected me. Now you dare judge me for taking Daphne to bed? Let me enlighten you - she pleases me exceptionally well."

Harrison didn't understand everything, but those last words stabbed through her heart.

Daphne pleased him.

The pain in her chest was physical, like a knife twisting.

This was deliberate. Nathaniel wanted to hurt her.

He pressed her harder against the luxury car, his voice dripping with malice. "Daphne was untouched. Pure. I've given her everything - mansions, sports cars, unlimited resources. I made her a star."
###Chapter 224

"Stop! I don't want to hear another word!" Harrison's voice shook with barely contained fury.

She couldn't bear to listen any longer.

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cruel smirk, his eyes glinting with icy determination. He wanted her to hear every painful detail—to remember this moment was her own doing.

She had rejected him, so he'd given everything she refused to someone else. Someone like Daphne.

His grip on her arm tightened before he shoved her away, his tone glacial. "Fine. You want a divorce? You'll get it. We'll go tomorrow. If not for Eleanor, I would've stripped you of the Falcon name years ago. There are plenty of women who'd kill to take your place."

Harrison's chest ached, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms as she fought back tears. "Then I'll see you at nine. Outside the courthouse."

She turned on her heel and walked away without looking back.

Nathaniel watched her go, his expression unreadable.

Good. It was time to end this farce.

Their marriage had been dead for years anyway.

His phone buzzed. Dominic's voice came through the line.

"Mr. Falcon, Ms. Sinclair took a fall during her wire act today. The saboteur's in custody. She's demanding maximum charges—wants them to rot in prison."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. His patience with Daphne had reached its limit.

"Let her deal with it however she wants," he snapped.

"Understood, sir."

Back at Willowridge University, Rosalind was seething, her cheeks flushed with rage.

"Are you serious? Nathaniel's the one bankrolling Daphne? He's turning that snake into some kind of star? Has he lost his damn mind?"

She paced their dorm room like a caged tiger.

"He's married, for God's sake! First Isabella, now Daphne? And she's your roommate! The audacity! The sheer disrespect!"

Rosalind hurled insults at both Nathaniel and Daphne with impressive creativity.

Meanwhile, Harrison's focus remained on Gabrielle. She quickly texted Oliver.

[I need a lawyer immediately. Gabrielle must be released from custody.]

Oliver responded with a terse confirmation.

Harrison collapsed onto her bed, the weight of her decisions crushing her. She'd dragged Gabrielle into this mess—Daphne's vendetta was against her. She had to fix this.

As for Nathaniel... his words still echoed in her skull, sharp as shattered glass.

This time, he'd gone too far. There was nothing left to salvage.

Tomorrow, she'd finally be free.

At dawn, Harrison left Willowridge and headed straight for the courthouse.

Nine o'clock. That's when she'd meet Nathaniel to end their marriage.

She couldn't wait another second.

Oliver had already dispatched lawyer Oliver Pembroke to handle Gabrielle's release. Once the divorce was finalized, they'd head straight to the police station.

Precisely thirty minutes later, Harrison stood outside the courthouse, waiting.

Then she saw it—the sleek black Rolls-Royce speeding toward her like a predator.

Nathaniel had arrived.

Harrison never imagined her marriage would end like this.

But today, she and Nathaniel Falcon would finally be divorced.

###Chapter 225

Harrison lifted her foot, poised to move forward.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the tension. Nathaniel was calling.

"Ms. Whitmore. There's an emergency at the police station. You need to come immediately!"

Her stomach dropped. Had something happened to Gabrielle?

Without hesitation, she spun around and sprinted away.

When Harrison arrived, Oliver rushed to greet her. "Ms. Whitmore."

"What's wrong with Gabrielle?" Her voice was strained with worry.

Her question died on her lips as she spotted a familiar figure. Daphne stood there, draped in designer labels as usual, flanked by her entourage. This time, she'd brought two lawyers with her.

Daphne sauntered over with a smirk. "Harrison, I heard you came to bail Gabrielle out. Give it up! Your precious friend is going to rot in there forever. She's never getting out."

Oliver leaned in, whispering urgently. "Ms. Whitmore, Daphne brought Falcon Enterprises' top legal team. They've never lost a case. They've already blocked our bail request. With their involvement, Ms. Sunder's situation looks hopeless." Harrison's blood ran cold realizing how far Nathaniel would go to support Daphne.

Daphne's smug expression intensified as she studied Harrison. "You must know about Nathaniel and me by now, right? I'm sorry, truly. I know he's your husband, but he doesn't love you. Nathaniel and I... we just couldn't resist each other."

Harrison remained silent, her gaze steady.

Daphne lowered her voice with a soft laugh. "Harrison, I also know you and Nathaniel finally slept together recently."

Harrison's pulse stuttered. "How could you possibly know that?"

Daphne arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Nathaniel told me, of course." He'd shared that with her?

"Harrison, Nathaniel also said you're... underwhelming in bed. No passion at all. One time was enough for him. But me?" She preened. "I satisfy him completely. He calls me his little vixen. Says he's crazy about me."

The floor seemed to tilt beneath Harrison's feet.

Had Nathaniel really said those things?

"Harrison, Nathaniel is incredible. I want to be with him. You're my best friend - I know you'll understand and support me."

With that, Daphne turned sharply, her entourage trailing behind, leaving Harrison standing alone.

Oliver's voice pulled her back. "Ms. Whitmore, we can't win against Falcon Enterprises directly. The only way to free Gabrielle is through Nathaniel."

Go to Nathaniel?

Harrison nearly laughed at the absurdity.

Another ringtone interrupted her thoughts.

She glanced at her screen - Nathaniel was calling again.

After a brief hesitation, she answered.

"Harrison, I'm already at the courthouse." His voice was icy with impatience. "I've been waiting. Where are you?"

Her grip tightened on the phone. She'd forgotten about their divorce appointment. "Nathaniel, there's an emergency-"

"Harrison, what game are you playing now?" he snapped. "You wanted this divorce. Now you're making excuses? I don't have time for your childish games!" So that's how he saw her.

She couldn't confront him yet. She needed his help with Gabrielle.
###Chapter 226

"Mr. Falcon, I need to speak with you—"

"Not now." His voice was ice. "Contact my assistant if it's urgent."

The line went dead before Harrison could finish.

The dial tone echoed in her ears.

Her chest tightened, but for Gabrielle's sake, she had to try again.

"Mr. Blackwood, expect my message," she murmured.

Harrison arrived at Emerald Heights, where the maid greeted her politely. "Mrs. Falcon."

"Is Nathaniel here? Please inform him I need to see him." Her voice remained steady.

"One moment."

Harrison waited outside. The maid returned quickly. "Mr. Falcon is in his study, but he declined your request."

He refused to see her.

She didn’t move. "Then I’ll wait until he changes his mind."

A sleek black limo pulled up just then. Daphne stepped out, her designer heels clicking sharply against the pavement.

She smirked at Harrison. "Still chasing after him? How pathetic. He’s made it clear he wants nothing to do with you."

With a dismissive flick of her hair, Daphne strutted inside. Harrison’s nails dug into her palms.

Inside the study, Nathaniel sat behind his desk, scanning documents. His jaw was tight, his expression unreadable.

He’d waited outside the courthouse for hours. She’d promised to meet him—then never showed.

Was this some kind of game to her?

Had he really let himself be played like this?

Now she had the nerve to show up unannounced.

Not a chance.

The door opened. Daphne entered with a practiced smile.

"Mr. Falcon," she purred.

He barely glanced up. "Leave."

She stepped closer, undeterred. "I just wanted to thank you for everything. I was hoping you’d join me for drinks tonight. Unless you’re too busy?" Her gaze flickered toward the window. "Though I did see Harrison waiting outside..."

Nathaniel’s expression shifted. "Wait."

Daphne paused.

He stood abruptly. "We’re leaving now."

Her lips curved in triumph.

Harrison had been standing outside for what felt like hours when the gates finally opened. Nathaniel strode out, Daphne clinging to his arm.

She rushed forward. "Mr. Falcon, just five minutes. Please."

His cold gaze swept over her. "I don’t have time."

Daphne smirked. "Sorry, Harrison. He’s all mine tonight."

She slid into the Rolls-Royce. Nathaniel revved the engine and sped off, leaving Harrison staring at the vanishing taillights.

At The Velvet Lounge, Sebastian raised an eyebrow as Nathaniel walked in with Daphne. "Since when do you bring rising starlets here?"

He knew the entertainment scene well—too well.

Nathaniel didn’t answer. His dark shirt was slightly undone, revealing the sharp line of his collarbone. He dropped into the booth and drained an entire glass in one go.

He reached for another bottle, but Daphne’s manicured fingers wrapped around his wrist.

"Mr. Falcon," she chided playfully. "That’s enough."
###Chapter 227

Nathaniel's gaze slid sideways to Daphne.

Her fingers rested lightly against his, tracing the sharp contours of his wrist. The cold platinum of his Patek Philippe watch brushed her skin - as intimidating and unattainable as the man himself.

Daphne's cheeks flushed crimson. "Mr. Falcon...that night was my first time. I gave myself to you willingly. Do you remember?"

Sebastian frowned, opening his mouth to intervene. "Nathaniel-"

One of the socialites grabbed his arm. "If Mr. Falcon favors her, you'd better show respect," he hissed.

Sebastian clenched his jaw. His loyalty remained with Isabella.

Nathaniel studied Daphne's demure expression, the way her lashes fluttered shyly. Truthfully, he hadn't dwelled on that night.

Because all his memories were tangled with Harrison.

The intoxicating fantasy had been with Harrison - her scent, her warmth, the way she yielded beneath him.

Yet that pleasure hadn't come from Harrison at all. It came from Daphne.

"Mr. Falcon," Daphne murmured, fingers tracing circles on his thigh. "I don't need anything from you. Just let me stay by your side tonight..."

Her innocent blush contradicted her bold proposition.

Nathaniel remained silent, his expression unreadable.

When Harrison arrived, the scene struck her like a physical blow - Daphne whispering seductively while Nathaniel appeared dangerously close to acquiescing.

He'd actually brought Daphne here.

Harrison's lips curled. His taste never changed - from Isabella to Daphne, always the clinging, simpering types.

While she? Too dull. Too ordinary.

The manager approached with a polished smile. "How many in your party, miss?"

Harrison met his gaze squarely. "I don't drink."

"No drinks? Then why come to The Velvet Lounge?"

"I want to dance."

"Ballroom? Salsa?"

Harrison's voice dropped. "Pole."

In the VIP section, Daphne waited breathlessly for Nathaniel's response. His lips curved in that infuriating half-smile. "Addicted to selling yourself? Looking for another deal?"

The words doused Daphne like ice water.

Nathaniel didn't glance her way again, simply reaching for another bottle of Dom Pérignon.

The manager's voice boomed through the club. "Ladies and gentlemen! A special treat tonight - our very own seductress will grace the stage!"

Nathaniel paid no attention until the socialites started whooping.

"Damn! Look at that body!"

"Mr. Falcon, you've got to see this!"

Nathaniel's gaze drifted lazily toward the stage - and froze.

There she stood.

A black bandage dress clung to every curve, the thin straps emphasizing delicate shoulders. Black fishnets sheathed endless legs, the outfit a far cry from her usual modest attire.

A lace veil obscured her face, but those eyes - dark, knowing, dangerous - burned through the fabric.

Harrison's eyes.
###Chapter 228

The moment Harrison stepped onto the stage, the entire Velvet Lounge exploded with cheers.

The bass dropped hard. Her body instantly responded, moving with liquid grace to the pounding rhythm.

She launched into a gravity-defying leap, her slender frame twisting like silk around the pole. Every spin, every arch of her back synchronized perfectly with the music. The crowd went wild as she folded her body into impossible shapes, their screams nearly drowning out the track.

In the VIP section, Sebastian grabbed Nathaniel's arm excitedly. "Damn, when did this place get such a firecracker? You've been holding out on us!"

Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on the stage, equally stunned. A performer like this should've been headlining every club in Willowbrook. How had she flown under his radar?

Who was this mesmerizing woman?

At that exact moment, Nathaniel froze. His drink hovered halfway to his lips as his eyes locked onto the dancer. He couldn't look away if he tried.

Harrison felt his intense stare burning into her. Right on cue.

A wicked smile curved her lips as she executed a flawless aerial split without breaking a sweat.

Holy hell.

The crowd lost their collective minds.

One guy elbowed his friend. "Did you see that? She's like a damn contortionist!"

"Whoever gets with her is one lucky bastard."

"You think a girl like that would ever settle down?"

"Funny you mention that. Isabella's the lead ballerina at the National, but she can't move like this."

The comments kept coming. Nathaniel's usually impassive expression darkened, storm clouds gathering in his piercing gaze.

The performance ended with Harrison landing gracefully on her feet. Thunderous applause shook the entire lounge.

The energy was electric. The manager bounded onto the stage, grinning. "Ladies and gents, the night's just getting started! Our star is about to choose one lucky guest for a private dance!"

The crowd erupted again, men shouting and waving to get her attention.

"Over here, gorgeous!"

"Pick me! I'll make it worth your while!"

"Come dance with me, sweetheart!"

Every man in the place wanted to be chosen.

Harrison's smoldering gaze swept the room, pausing briefly on several faces before finally landing on Nathaniel.

She stepped off the stage and began walking directly toward him.

The manager's voice boomed through the speakers. "Looks like our lady's made her choice! Who's the lucky guy?"

A hush fell over the crowd as all eyes followed Harrison's every move.

Nathaniel watched her approach, his expression unreadable.

Harrison stopped inches from him, that same teasing smile playing on her lips. "Mr. Falcon... I choose you."

She'd picked Nathaniel.

Daphne, seated beside him, turned sheet-white. She'd planned this whole night to get closer to Nathaniel, and now some random dancer was stealing her thunder? To make matters worse, the woman had the audacity to choose Nathaniel right in front of her.

Daphne didn't recognize Harrison, but mentally cursed her to hell and back.

The manager grinned. "Our star has chosen Mr. Falcon! Seems the ladies can't resist him. Let's give them some space for their dance!"

The music kicked up again, neon lights pulsing through the haze. Nathaniel leaned back on the plush sofa, his dark gaze never leaving the woman standing before him...
###Chapter 229

Harrison's piercing eyes locked onto Daphne. "Excuse me, miss? You're in my way. I'd like to dance with Mr. Falcon."

Her words sliced through the air like a challenge, demanding Daphne step aside.

Daphne's fingers curled into tight fists, her body rigid with defiance.

But the surrounding crowd quickly took Harrison's side. "Move aside, Ms. Sinclair!"

Daphne shot Harrison a venomous glare before reluctantly stepping back.

A triumphant smirk played on Harrison's lips. She'd seen Daphne's true colors, and this was just the beginning of her payback.

The real show was about to start.

Harrison's gaze met Nathaniel's. He hadn't looked away once, and she refused to be intimidated. With a slow, deliberate smile, she spread her legs and boldly climbed onto his lap, straddling his powerful frame.

The bar erupted in chaos.

"Damn, kitten! First woman to ever mount Mr. Falcon like that!" someone shouted.

Behind her sheer veil, Harrison transformed from ethereal beauty to seductive siren, her identity safely concealed.

She arched an eyebrow teasingly. "Seems Mr. Falcon never lacks female company. First Ms. Sinclair, and before that, the famous Isabella danced for him. I wonder if I even stand a chance."

"Make him remember your dance, and you'll definitely stand out," another voice joked.

Harrison's mischievous eyes locked with Nathaniel's. "Challenge accepted."

Her body began moving with the music.

The tight black dress accentuated every curve as her waist swayed like a serpent - hypnotic, deadly, irresistible.

She rolled her hips deliberately, the sheer black stockings drawing every eye in the room while seated firmly in Nathaniel's lap.

The bar descended into madness. Men shouted, moving in sync with her rhythm. More bodies pressed closer, trying to match her movements.

Pure, unadulterated passion filled the air.

Nathaniel's dark eyes burned with dangerous intensity. While others saw only a mysterious seductress, he recognized her immediately. Harrison.

Who authorized this outfit? What game was she playing?

The hungry stares from surrounding men made his jaw tighten. Was she here to enchant the entire damn bar?

As his gaze traced her mesmerizing movements, Nathaniel's mind raced. How many facets did this woman possess?

Ice queen. Seductress. Firebrand.

Every version of her was intoxicating.

Mid-dance, Harrison suddenly felt strong arms encircle her waist, yanking her against a rock-hard chest.

She looked up into Nathaniel's smoldering gaze. Her lips curved. "Mr. Falcon, what-"

"Harrison. What the hell do you think you're doing?"

Her smile faltered. He'd recognized her? That fast?

Shoving against his chest, Harrison scrambled off his lap and disappeared into the crowd.

"Hey kitten, where you running to?" voices called after her.

The music cut abruptly. The manager took the stage. "Ladies and gentlemen, our mysterious dancer's performance has concluded. Thank you for your enthusiasm."

The crowd dispersed reluctantly, still buzzing with excitement.

One man chuckled, nudging Nathaniel. "First Isabella, now this wildcat. So, Mr. Falcon, which dance did you prefer?"
###Chapter 230

Nathaniel's shirt bore faint creases where Harrison had perched on his lap, yet the dishevelment only accentuated his dangerous allure. In the dim glow of The Velvet Lounge, it made him look even more untamed, like a predator barely restrained.

He ignored the question about his preferences. Instead, he seized a bottle of bourbon and drained it in one swift motion.

Daphne's nails dug into her palms. That little seductress—where had she come from? The moment she entered, the room had shifted, erasing Daphne's presence entirely. She was used to being the center of attention, the woman men fought over. But now? Invisible.

She despised it.

Without hesitation, Daphne slid onto the seat beside Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, I—"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel slammed the empty bottle onto the table and strode out without a backward glance.

He left her there.

Alone.

"Why'd Mr. Falcon leave? Sebastian, get me that girl's number," one of the men muttered.

"Don’t bother. She’s already caught his eye," another replied.

"What?"

"Didn’t you see? The way he reacted to her? With his influence, you really think she’d choose you?"

Nathaniel—aroused? By her?

Daphne’s blood boiled. Nathaniel had always been ice—untouchable, indifferent. He barely glanced at women, let alone showed interest. Yet that girl had managed to provoke him?

How?

She’d just dealt with Harrison, and now this new threat appeared.

Who the hell was she?

Nathaniel stepped outside, the cool air doing little to temper his irritation. He pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Harrison.

[Change. Now.]

A reply chimed instantly. [On my way.]

His lips curled. Obedient for once.

Good. He’d congratulate her on her little performance.

Just then, two drunken fools staggered past, their laughter grating.

"That girl—damn. I’d pay to have her screaming my name by dawn."

"You sure she’s in the dressing room?"

"Positive. Let’s go make it happen."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

Before they could take another step, he blocked their path, his presence like a wall of ice.

The idiots blinked up at him. "The hell? Move, asshole. We’ve got plans."

Nathaniel’s voice was lethal. "Leave."

They scoffed. "You don’t know who you’re messing with."

One signaled, and two bodyguards lunged forward.

Nathaniel was already in a foul mood.

He didn’t hesitate.

A bottle shattered against the first guard’s skull.

The sound echoed like a gunshot.
###Chapter 231

Nathaniel moved with lethal precision, his every motion calculated and terrifying. He was an unstoppable force.

The black-suited bodyguards froze in shock at his sudden attack.

The two entitled heirs blinked in disbelief before their faces twisted with rage. "What are you idiots waiting for? Take him down!"

"Right away, sir!"

The guards lunged forward.

Harrison emerged from the dressing room to find chaos erupting. Nathaniel stood alone against ten men, his powerful kick sending one guard crashing through the bar counter. Shattered glass rained down as liquor bottles exploded across the floor.

Screams pierced the air as patrons scrambled for safety. "They're fighting!"

Harrison couldn't believe his eyes. She'd only stepped away to change, and now Nathaniel was in the middle of a violent confrontation.

This man seemed to attract trouble wherever he went.

Without thinking, Harrison rushed to his side. "Mr. Falcon!"

Nathaniel dispatched another guard before glancing at her. Those stunning eyes widened in shock. "Causing trouble again?"

Nathaniel didn't respond, though internally he wondered who exactly had started this mess.

His strong fingers closed around Harrison's slender wrist, dragging her to a secluded corner. His predatory gaze pinned her in place as he growled, "Stay. Put."

Then he was gone, disappearing back into the fray.

Sebastian arrived at the commotion. Seeing Nathaniel surrounded, he swore violently. "You dare touch Nathaniel in my establishment? Lock the doors and handle this!"

Grabbing a broken bottle, Sebastian joined the fight.

Chaos reigned until security finally subdued the two heirs and their guards.

Sebastian immediately slapped both young men. "Open your damn eyes! You're messing with Nathaniel Falcon! Have you lost your minds?"

Recognition dawned on their drunken faces.

They dropped to their knees, trembling. "M-Mr. Falcon, please forgive us..."

Nathaniel gave them one contemptuous glance before turning away. He seized Harrison's wrist again, dragging her toward the VIP section.

The luxurious private room swallowed them whole as Nathaniel tossed Harrison onto the plush bed.

She barely had time to sit up before he caged her beneath him, one knee on the mattress, his powerful arms boxing her in. His dominance was absolute.

"Harrison, what the hell do you want?"

The fight's adrenaline still coursed through him as he glared down.

Harrison tilted her delicate chin up, meeting his gaze. "Mr. Falcon, we need to talk."

"So you thought dressing like some seductress would get my attention?" His voice cut like a blade.

Why was he being like this?

If he'd just listened before, she wouldn't have resorted to this.

Harrison's lips curved into a teasing smile. "Don't you enjoy seeing me play the temptress?"

Nathaniel stilled, caught off guard.

She leaned closer, her voice dripping with clever charm. "You've been so wrapped up in Daphne's arms lately, I could barely get a word in. If you're such a degenerate, I figured I'd give you something worth looking at."

Did she just call him a degenerate?

Only she would dare.

Nathaniel pinched her soft cheek, his lips twisting in mockery. "You think you're some prize? If I were that kind of man, do you honestly think I'd settle for you?"

Releasing her, he stood to leave.

Harrison bit her lip, mind racing.

He was right. What beautiful woman hadn't thrown herself at Nathaniel Falcon? Isabella and Daphne each possessed their own allure. If he truly was the man she implied, he'd be drowning in beauties.
###Chapter 232

Harrison spotted Daphne standing frozen at the doorway.

Daphne had arrived.

The commotion outside had drawn her from bed, leading her straight to Nathaniel's location. That's how she'd found this private room.

When her gaze landed on Harrison straddling Nathaniel, her innocent eyes darkened with venom. The hatred radiating from her could have poisoned the air between them.

A cold smirk curled Harrison's lips. As Nathaniel tried to pull away, she suddenly wrapped her arms around his neck and flipped their positions, pinning him beneath her.

Now she dominated.

Daphne's jaw dropped. She'd never imagined Harrison would dare take such bold control.

The audacity!

Nathaniel stiffened as Harrison's fragrant body settled against him again. His jaw clenched in displeasure. "What game are you playing now? Get off."

Harrison didn't budge. "Mr. Falcon, whose performance did you prefer - mine or Isabella's?"

The same question from earlier.

Nathaniel remained silent.

Harrison's delicate finger traced circles on his sculpted chest, deliberately teasing. "Then let me ask something else. That night...what exactly happened between you and Daphne?"

Nathaniel's muscles tensed as he grabbed her wandering hand.

Truthfully, he couldn't remember. Only the vivid dream about Harrison remained.

But pride would never let him admit that.

Knowing Daphne lurked outside, Harrison locked eyes with Nathaniel, her gaze smoldering. "So where did it happen? The bed? The couch? Or maybe in your car—"

Nathaniel's grip tightened around her porcelain waist. His eyes darkened dangerously. "Harrison, must you seduce me every damn day?"

He'd brought Daphne here, yet Harrison had effortlessly stolen his attention.

Isabella had danced close before, but Harrison's current position and provocative questions about preference drove him wild.

She was relentless.

Nathaniel glared. His earlier words had been spoken in anger, but he couldn't deny - her face belonged on magazine covers.

When she played the temptress, she became irresistible.

She possessed skills no rival could match, always seizing what she wanted. No man stood a chance against her.

Nathaniel surged upward, capturing her soft lips in a punishing kiss.

Harrison froze mid-taunt. She'd been provoking him, but hadn't expected this response.

She didn't pull away. Instead, her sharp gaze flicked to the doorway where Daphne stood.

Daphne's face had drained of color. Nathaniel had been cold to her, yet kissed Harrison with such passion.

The truth struck Daphne like lightning - Nathaniel loved Harrison.

When a man truly loved, it showed. Isabella, Daphne...everyone around Nathaniel sensed it. He was utterly captivated.

Harrison's icy stare met Daphne's. The younger girl clenched her fists and stormed away.

The moment Daphne disappeared, Harrison pushed against Nathaniel's chest.

His grip on her waist tightened. "Problem?" His voice had gone rough.

Harrison met his gaze unflinchingly. "Mr. Falcon, I just made Daphne run away."
###Chapter 233

Nathaniel's arousal was unmistakable. His usually sharp eyes darkened with desire, the edges flushed red. When Harrison spoke, he froze mid-motion, his gaze locking onto hers.

Harrison gestured casually toward the door. "Mr. Falcon, now would be the perfect time to work your charm and bring Daphne back."

Nathaniel's sharp mind processed her words instantly. This wasn't genuine seduction—Harrison was putting on a performance for Daphne's benefit.

The heat in his eyes vanished, replaced by icy clarity. His voice turned frosty. "Get off. Now."

Harrison didn't hesitate, immediately complying.

Nathaniel stood, his tall frame casting a long shadow against the floor-to-ceiling windows. This infuriating woman! "Speak. What do you want?"

Harrison steadied herself. "Mr. Falcon, Gabrielle didn't cut Daphne's wires. She's been framed. I'm asking you to show mercy and release her."

Gabrielle? Her best friend?

Nathaniel hadn't paid attention to Daphne's accident or the surrounding drama, unaware of Gabrielle's involvement.

Dominic had briefed him, but he'd left the matter to Daphne.

So Harrison had come here for her friend.

Nathaniel turned, a cold smirk playing on his lips. "Are you asking me for a favor?"

Harrison flinched, her heart heavy. For Gabrielle, she'd swallow her pride. "Yes."

"Then show some sincerity. Have you considered what you're willing to offer in exchange?"

His blunt words made her stiffen.

Nathaniel's gaze traveled over her slender frame, lingering deliberately. His tone shifted to mocking amusement. "You haven't thought this through, have you? Come back when you've decided what you're willing to give."

He turned to leave without waiting for a response.

But Harrison grabbed his sleeve. "Wait."

Nathaniel paused, looking back at her. "Harrison, I'm not running a charity. Why should I help your friend? Frankly, there's nothing about you I want—except..."

His eyes darkened as they raked over her body. "This."

That night at the hospital, she'd refused him.

Now he wanted to see if she'd break.

Harrison clenched her fists. She didn't understand him. They'd been together once, but he'd found her boring, unremarkable. After that, he'd shown no interest.

So why these demands now?

Did he want her again?

"Mr. Falcon, aren't you worried about Isabella and Daphne finding out?" Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "This stays between us. Wasn't that your rule? I help you, you repay me. You set the terms of this game."

Harrison had no rebuttal. Slowly, she released his sleeve. "Think about it. When you've decided, come find me."

With that, Nathaniel walked out.

After failing to make progress with Nathaniel, Harrison went straight to the police station to see Gabrielle.

But Oliver stopped her at the entrance. "Ms. Whitmore, we can't see Ms. Sunder right now."

Harrison froze. "Why not?"

Oliver's expression was grim. "Mr. Falcon has ordered no visitors."

What?

Nathaniel was playing hardball, backing her into a corner.

Gabrielle was locked away, and Harrison had no way of knowing her condition.

Tears welled in Harrison's pale eyes. She didn't want to make that kind of deal with Nathaniel, but his ruthless tactics left her no choice.

"Ms. Whitmore, what now?" Oliver asked.

At that moment, Harrison thought of someone—Alexander.
###Chapter 234

Harrison could turn to Alexander for help.

Harrison arrived at Alexander's mansion and froze at the sight of his assistant packing luggage.

"Alexander, what's happening?" Harrison asked, bewildered.

Alexander gave her a charming smile. "Father just called. There's trouble with one of our overseas branches. I need to return immediately."

The Graves family had moved their operations abroad years ago, with assets spanning multiple countries. Alexander's current visit had been merely a short vacation.

But his abrupt departure, especially now, made Harrison suspect Nathaniel's involvement.

Had Nathaniel secretly arranged this to get Alexander out of the way?

"Did you need something?" Alexander's voice was gentle.

Harrison shook her head. "No, nothing important."

"Harrison," he said, his gaze softening with unspoken affection, "do you want me to stay?"

She knew this was his final test of her feelings. A single word from her would make him cancel his flight.

"I'm not worth it. You'll find someone far better than me."

Harrison offered no false hope, no empty promises.

Alexander wasn't surprised. He'd harbored feelings for Harrison from the beginning, but she'd always kept him at arm's length. Now, he was ready to move on.

"Very well. I should leave now."

"Let me drive you to the airport."

"No. If you see me off, I might change my mind."

Harrison stopped mid-step. "Goodbye, Alexander."

Alexander smiled and opened his arms, pulling her into a brief embrace. "We'll always be friends. Call me anytime."

"Okay."

He released her and left with his assistant.

Once Alexander was gone, Harrison finally looked away. She needed a new plan to save Gabrielle.

Then inspiration struck.

Harrison quickly typed a message on her phone.

Arriving at Falcon Enterprises, Harrison approached the reception desk. "Hello, I'd like to see—"

Before she could finish, the receptionist gasped in recognition. "Mrs. Falcon! What brings you here?"

Harrison stiffened. Their marriage was supposed to be secret. Since she rarely visited Falcon Enterprises, how did staff recognize her?

"Mrs. Falcon, you're here to see Mr. Falcon, right? Please follow me."

The receptionist ushered Harrison directly to the elevator heading for the CEO's office.

As they passed through the open workspace, employees' eyes lit up. Each one nodded respectfully. "Mrs. Falcon."

Harrison blinked. "You all know me?"

"Of course! You're still at Willowridge University, right? We saw Mr. Falcon get summoned as your representative during that faculty meeting." Harrison fell silent.

She hadn't realized her "academic exploits" had become office gossip. Everyone seemed fascinated by her relationship with Nathaniel.

"Don't mind us. Most of us weren't top students either. But no worries! Mr. Falcon graduated from Westfield - a certified genius. He'd be happy to help with your coursework, I'm sure!"

Harrison remained silent, unsure how to respond.

The receptionist led her to a conference room outside the CEO's office. "Mrs. Falcon, please wait here. Mr. Falcon is currently meeting with important international clients."

Through the floor-to-ceiling glass, Harrison could just make out Nathaniel inside.
###Chapter 235

The understated elegance of the conference room at Falcon Enterprises shimmered under the soft lighting. Nathaniel stood tall in his tailored black suit, every inch the powerful CEO. He led his executive team in negotiations with Lucien Dubois, the head of LVMA.

"Mrs. Falcon, your husband's Francais is remarkable! He's fluent in over twenty languages without needing interpreters," the receptionist whispered to Harrison as she served coffee.

Harrison offered a polite smile. "Thank you."

"You're most welcome. I'll leave you to your thoughts," the receptionist bowed before exiting.

Alone now, Harrison's sharp gaze drifted through the floor-to-ceiling windows, locking onto Nathaniel inside.

Nathaniel conversed effortlessly with Lucien in perfect Francais. This was his world - high-stakes deals, power plays, and prestige. Even through the glass, Harrison could feel the electric energy of the business summit. Nathaniel thrived in this environment, the epitome of success and sophistication.

No wonder women like Isabella and now Daphne couldn't resist him.

In business mode, Nathaniel appeared untouchable - cold, distinguished, and utterly composed.

Yet Harrison knew better. She remembered how he'd cornered her, how his polished exterior hid raw desire. A well-dressed predator, that's what he truly was.

A mischievous idea sparked. She pulled out her phone and texted "Hubby."

Inside the conference room, Nathaniel's phone vibrated.

Mid-sentence with Lucien, he excused himself to check the message.

[Mr. Falcon, I'm here to beg.]

Nathaniel's gaze snapped up, meeting Harrison's through the glass.

Dressed in her university uniform - white blouse, pleated skirt, and camel-colored varsity jacket - she looked every inch the innocent student. Her dark hair in a high ponytail accentuated her youthful features.

Their eyes locked, tension crackling between them.

Lucien noticed the exchange. "Mr. Falcon, who is that lovely young woman?" he asked in Francais.

"My wife," Nathaniel answered coolly.

"Your wife is still in school?"

Nathaniel merely nodded before refocusing on business. His brief glance at Harrison was clear dismissal - she would wait.

This only fueled Harrison's mischief. Watching Nathaniel - all sharp angles and controlled power - she sent another message.

Ding!

Nathaniel excused himself again. This time, Harrison had sent a playful GIF - someone suggestively licking a lollipop.

The colorful animation flashed on his screen like an inappropriate pop-up ad. Nathaniel's eyes darkened as they found Harrison's.

His gaze burned with unspoken warning - intense, hungry, promising retribution. That look would have melted lesser women.

But Harrison merely smirked. He wanted to play the untouchable businessman? She'd happily peel away that polished facade, revealing the predator beneath.

Lucien observed their silent exchange. "Your wife has remarkable presence," he remarked. "Like an angel gracing us mortals."
###Chapter 236

Nathaniel's throat moved as his gaze locked onto Harrison. She had an ethereal beauty that seemed too perfect for this world. Then she sent him that provocative GIF right in the middle of his important meeting.

Damn. His angel had a devilish side.

She appeared to excel at everything, always one step ahead.

Lucien chuckled. "Mrs. Falcon looks so youthful. She must be quite demanding. Mr. Falcon, can you handle such a wife?"

Having a beautiful young wife was one thing. Keeping up with her was another matter entirely.

Nathaniel watched Harrison through the glass partition. Truthfully, he wasn't sure. Their relationship hadn't progressed that far yet, and he genuinely wondered if he could match her energy.

Ding!

Another message from Harrison appeared.

Nathaniel opened it. [Mr. Falcon, are you man enough? If not, I'm leaving.]

Bloody hell!

Nathaniel cursed under his breath. How was he supposed to concentrate with her behaving like this?

Outside, Harrison sipped her latte, secretly pleased by his visible frustration. She knew Nathaniel wouldn't abandon his meeting for her. With a satisfied smile, she gathered her things to leave.

Just as she turned, a deep voice rumbled behind her. "Going somewhere?"

That voice...

Harrison spun around. The conference room door stood open, revealing Nathaniel's imposing figure.

He actually left his meeting?

Nathaniel closed the distance between them in three long strides. Before she could react, he was right in front of her. "Let's go."

Harrison blinked. "Go...where?"

Nathaniel captured her delicate hand, his fingers tracing circles on her pale skin. "Anywhere you want. Your choice."

Harrison's breath caught.

Her mind reeled. This was just supposed to be playful teasing. Had she crossed a line? Was he serious?

Holy hell!

Lucien emerged, asking in perfect Francais, "Mr. Falcon, aren't you going to introduce us?"

Harrison glanced at Nathaniel.

Nathaniel smirked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "What? Thought you were good at everything. Can't understand Francais?"

His teasing carried a sharp edge.

Harrison arched an eyebrow, her piercing gaze shifting to Lucien. She responded in flawless Francais, "Enchanté. Je m'appelle Harrison."

Nathaniel froze. Since when did she speak Francais?

This was unexpected - especially her impeccable pronunciation.

Lucien's eyes widened. "Mrs. Falcon, you speak Francais? No wonder you captivated Mr. Falcon."

Harrison's playful eyes met Nathaniel's aristocratic features. "Him? So full of himself. Thought I couldn't understand a word."

Lucien grinned at Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, it seems your wife has many surprises in store - things you'll need to discover personally."

She was indeed full of surprises.

Clearly, Harrison had layers Nathaniel had yet to uncover.

Nathaniel gave her a long, intense look before bidding Lucien farewell. Without explanation, he seized Harrison's hand and marched toward the elevators.

Nathaniel practically dragged Harrison downstairs. She tugged at her trapped hand. "Mr. Falcon, shouldn't you return to your meeting? I was just joking earlier."

Silently, Nathaniel yanked open the door of his Rolls-Royce Phantom and unceremoniously shoved her inside.

Leaning against the doorframe, he flashed a dangerous smile. "Done playing games? Now it's my turn."
###Chapter 237

What did he just say?

Harrison could sense it—the icy facade had shattered. The real Nathaniel had emerged, all dark desire and wicked intentions.

She'd wanted to peel away his mask before. But now that it was gone, she realized she wasn’t as ready as she thought.

The sleek Bentley glided effortlessly down the road. Harrison stole a glance at the man beside her. "Did you stop me from seeing Gabrielle?"

Nathaniel's strong hands, veins prominent beneath his skin, rested lazily on the wheel. He gave a dismissive hum, barely acknowledging her question.

He didn’t deny it.

"Did Alexander leave because of you too?"

Nathaniel signaled, turning the wheel with effortless precision, the platinum of his watch glinting under the streetlights.

His voice was low, almost amused. "Alexander should have landed by now. What do you think he’s doing?"

Harrison stayed silent, waiting.

Nathaniel handed her a photograph.

She took it, her breath catching. There, in crisp detail, was Alexander with another woman.

"That’s the Graves family’s choice for him," Nathaniel explained. "Serena Whitmore, daughter of the Whitmores. He barely stepped off the plane before they arranged the meeting. The merger of the Graves and Whitmore families is inevitable."

The photo was taken in a penthouse suite of a seven-star hotel. Both families were present, Alexander and Serena seated across from each other.

Serena was breathtaking, dressed in an ivory gown that screamed old money and sophistication. The pairing was undeniable—two heirs of powerful dynasties, poised to unite.

"You can blame me for making him leave, or you can blame the Graves family for recalling him. Either way, you’re not stepping into their world. There’s no future for you and Alexander."

Harrison studied the photo. They looked perfect together. And strangely, she felt… happy for him.

Alexander was one of the few people who had been kind to her. She wanted him to find someone worthy.

She tucked the photo away. "I know I’m not good enough for him. I’m aware of my place."

Nathaniel didn’t react, just let out a cold scoff. "Where do you want to go? A hotel?"

Her stomach twisted. Was he already moving to the main event?

"I don’t want a hotel."

"Then we’re going back to Emerald Heights."

Tonight, he was taking her back to the place where it all began—where he had first claimed her, then destroyed her.

She still didn’t understand. If he was done with her, why did he want her again?

"Mr. Falcon, do you have protection at your place?"

Nathaniel’s gaze flicked to her.

Harrison straightened, her voice steady. "I’m allergic to emergency contraception. So you’ll need to wear something. Unless you want a child with me?"

Of course he didn’t. Nathaniel had never even considered it.

His silence confirmed it. That night had been about control, not consequence.

She swallowed the bitterness rising in her throat. "Here’s a deal—you get the condoms, and you let Gabrielle go. I’m not running anywhere."

Before she could finish, the Bentley jerked to a stop. Nathaniel stepped out, yanking open her door. "Out."

Harrison blinked. "Why are we stopping here?"

Nathaniel nodded toward the 24-hour pharmacy ahead. "You wanted condoms. Let’s go buy them."

Harrison froze.

He was serious.

Nathaniel pulled her inside, and Harrison couldn’t believe this was happening. He was actually taking her to buy protection.

She had never done anything like this in her life.
###Chapter 238

Nathaniel pulled the car to a stop. "The contraception aisle is right there. Go get it."

He was making Harrison buy condoms for him.

If Gabrielle wasn't still under his control, Harrison would have told him to screw off. This was beyond humiliating.

Harrison refused to move. Nathaniel studied her delicate, flawless face—the way a soft blush spread across her cheeks, even tinting the pale curve of her earlobes. It was unbearably cute, enough to make him want to push her further.

"What’s the hold-up? Don’t you want your friend released?"

A clear threat.

Fine.

Harrison gave in. She spun on her heel and marched toward the contraception section.

The moment she stepped in, two couples turned to stare, their gazes sharp with curiosity.

Harrison wished the floor would swallow her whole.

She glanced back to find Nathaniel leaning against the hallway, his long legs casually crossed, watching her with an amused smirk. He was clearly enjoying her discomfort.

Harrison bit her lower lip, fighting back embarrassment, then grabbed a box of condoms and held it up. "This size?"

Nathaniel squinted—Size S.

"Not right? How about this one?"

She swapped it for another box, blinking up at him with innocent eyes.

Now it was XS.

The couples' expressions shifted to sympathy—directed at Nathaniel.

His face darkened, jaw tightening. Without a word, he strode forward and glared down at her.

Seeing him flustered, Harrison’s eyes sparkled with mischief. She pressed further. "Mr. Falcon, maybe we shouldn’t. What if Mrs. Falcon finds out...?"

The couples' sympathy turned to disgust. "What a scumbag."

A vein pulsed in Nathaniel’s temple. He reached for her, ready to drag her out.

Harrison flashed him a sly, fox-like grin and darted away.

She didn’t get far. Nathaniel’s hand closed around her high ponytail, yanking her back with just enough force.

Here he was—a polished billionaire in a tailored suit—tugging her hair like a schoolyard bully.

"Let go of my hair, you creep!"

The last time he’d seen her in this student outfit with her ponytail, he’d wanted to do exactly this.

Nathaniel shoved her against the wall, his tall frame caging her in as his dark eyes bored into hers. "Impatient? Starting the roleplay early?"

Harrison’s face burned. She had wanted to embarrass him, but by flipping it into roleplay, he’d turned the tables.

She met his gaze, eyes glistening. "Mr. Falcon, this isn’t roleplay. You’re using Gabrielle to force me. You’re exploiting the unspoken rule, aren’t you?"

As he loosened his grip, a few strands of hair curled against her neck—making her look even more like a helpless student cornered by a powerful man.

Nathaniel cleared his throat, voice low and rough. "Do you even know what the 'unspoken rule' is? Protection or no protection—that’s two completely different games. When you told me to wear one, I didn’t argue."

Harrison’s eyes widened. Just because this man didn’t sleep around didn’t mean he was clueless.

She pressed a small hand against his chest. "I don’t want to take the morning-after pill again. You didn’t use one that night..."
###Chapter 239


Harrison's last whisper, "You didn't wear one that night," dissolved into the air before Nathaniel could fully grasp it.

All he caught was her refusal to take the morning-after pill again.

His mind instantly flashed to that incident when she'd collapsed from an allergic reaction to the pill because of Alexander. A cold, mocking smirk curled his lips. "If you could take it for another man, why not for me?"

What was he talking about?

When had she ever taken the pill for someone else?

In the past, he'd assumed she'd been with countless men, and she'd endured his accusations. But that night, he knew it had been her first time. Yet here he was, throwing those words at her again.

Harrison clenched her fist and swung at him.

The anger still burned. The hatred still simmered.

Nathaniel didn’t dodge. After the impact, he caught her small hand, his grip softening as he pulled her along.

"Wait," she murmured, voice barely audible. "I haven’t picked the condoms yet."

He paused, glancing at the shelf lined with small boxes. "One last chance. Choose again."

Under his intense gaze, she reached out and grabbed the largest size available.

She’d surrendered.

A low chuckle escaped him before he dragged her to the cashier. Payment made, he hauled her back into the car.

Inside the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Harrison checked the time. Emerald Heights was thirty minutes away. Thirty minutes would be enough.

She turned to the man beside her. "Let’s just go to Emerald Heights."

Nathaniel’s gaze lingered on her delicate features, his expression shifting. "Sit on my lap."

Harrison froze.

His hands moved fast. He gripped her waist and lifted her from the passenger seat, settling her onto his muscular thigh.

His leg was solid, radiating raw power. As her slender frame pressed against him, heat flooded her cheeks.

"Mr. Falcon, we’re in a car," she protested, attempting to shift away.

His hold tightened, keeping her in place. "We’ve done worse in a car. Why the hesitation now?"

She had no retort.

She squirmed in his grasp. "Mr. Falcon, let’s just go to Emerald Heights."

The driver’s seat was cramped, forcing their bodies flush together. Her movements only made things worse, her delicate form brushing against him in ways that darkened his gaze.

One hand stayed locked around her waist while the other slipped beneath her clothes, his breath scorching her skin. "Stop moving," he warned.

She’d been teasing him all day at the office, denying him any peace. Now, he intended to teach her a lesson.

Harrison frowned, her small hands clutching his wrist. Her fingers brushed against his expensive watch, cold and unyielding. She pushed against him, wincing. "Mr. Falcon, it hurts... You're hurting me..."

Her voice, fragile and sweet, carried a hint of something dangerously seductive. And suddenly, Nathaniel remembered.

He’d seen this side of her before.

In that dream.

The dream that now felt like a memory—vivid, real, as if it had truly happened.

Now, it was happening again. The same intensity, the same fire. His dark eyes locked onto hers, unreadable. "Even if it hurts, you’ll endure it."

Before she could protest, he crushed his lips against hers. The kiss was fierce, consuming, drowning her in his dominance until she could barely breathe.
###Chapter 240

Harrison's cheeks burned scarlet as she bit down hard.

Nathaniel jerked back with a sharp hiss. She gasped for air, her delicate lashes fluttering like trapped butterflies. The vulnerability in her expression was almost painful to witness.

His hand shot out, gripping her chin with bruising force. "Harrison," his voice dropped to a dangerous growl, "you're testing my patience. Bite me again and Gabrielle stays in jail. Understood?"

The unspoken threat hung heavy between them.

She met his steel-gray eyes, hesitation flickering before she whispered, "Understood."

Nathaniel reached for the condom on the seat.

Suddenly, Harrison shoved him back with surprising strength. "Why should you be the only one undressing me?" Her fingers flew to his suit buttons. "I want to undress you too."

The buttons resisted her frantic attempts. With a frustrated noise, she yanked at the fabric.

Nathaniel's head thumped against the headrest. "Easy," he groaned, catching her wrists. "These are custom-made. I don't keep spare suits in the car."

Defeated by the stubborn buttons, Harrison slid her hands beneath his jacket instead. Her fingers traced the hard planes of his abdomen through the thin dress shirt.

Nathaniel's breath hitched. Heat pooled low in his gut as her touch burned through him.

He hauled her against his chest. "Someone's impatient tonight." Harrison's blush deepened, but she remained silent.

His mouth crashed down on hers with possessive hunger.

This time, Harrison didn't resist. Instead, her fingers inched toward the hidden needle at her waist - aiming for his pressure point.

She never stood a chance.

Nathaniel's hand clamped around her wrist like a steel trap. "What's this?" His voice turned deadly quiet.

Damn. Caught again.

Every attempt to catch him off guard ended the same way.

The man had military reflexes honed by years of combat. Surprising him was impossible.

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to the needle. His face darkened as he wrenched it from her grasp.

"Give that back!" Harrison lunged for it.

His blood ran cold. He'd seen this needle before.

In that dream.

That impossibly vivid dream where Harrison had lain beneath him, this same needle in her hand. The memory slammed into him with startling clarity.

Nathaniel tossed the needle onto the floor mat, realization dawning.

He'd always dismissed it as just a dream. But now the evidence sat before him - tangible and real.

A terrifying possibility took root in his mind.

What if that night had been real? What if the woman in his arms had truly been Harrison?

Before he could pursue the thought, a phone shattered the tense silence.

Rosalind's name flashed on the screen.

"Harrison! It worked!" Rosalind's excited voice filled the car. "Just like you predicted - Daphne recanted her statement! Gabrielle's been released!"

Relief washed over Harrison. She'd done it. Gabrielle was free.

Turning to Nathaniel, she squared her shoulders. "Mr. Falcon, Gabrielle's been cleared. Our deal is void."

Her eyes sparkled with quiet triumph, that familiar fire catching Nathaniel's attention. "How did you manage this?" he demanded.
###Chapter 241

The situation had clearly shifted in Gabrielle's favor, and Nathaniel's intervention was evident.

Rosalind's phone call hadn't even ended when Nathaniel's deep voice echoed through the car's speakers. "Harrison, where exactly are you with Mr. Falcon right now?"

"We're—"

"I can see Mr. Falcon's car!"

A sharp rap on the tinted window startled them both. Rosalind stood outside, knocking impatiently.

Harrison hadn't anticipated her friend's sudden appearance. Though the luxury sedan's darkened windows provided privacy, Rosalind's proximity made Harrison acutely aware of her compromising position—perched on Nathaniel's lap in a scandalous embrace.

"Harrison." Nathaniel's voice dropped to that dangerously smooth register that always made her pulse quicken.

She met his gaze. "Yes?"

"Release me."

"What?"

His heated stare traveled downward, where her legs were locked around his waist in a vice-like grip. The sudden interruption had made her cling to him instinctively.

Nathaniel swallowed hard, his jaw tightening. "Your legs... loosen your hold. You're squeezing too tight."

Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks. Mortified, she scrambled off him and practically dove into the passenger seat before opening the door. "Rosalind!"

"Harrison!" Rosalind grabbed her hand excitedly. "Gabrielle's free! We need to get to the police station immediately."

"Let's hail a cab," Harrison suggested quickly.

"A cab? Why would we do that when Mr. Falcon's right here?" Before Harrison could protest, Rosalind had already shoved her into the backseat.

Turning to Nathaniel, who now sat composed behind the wheel, Rosalind asked politely, "Mr. Falcon, would you mind driving us to the station?"

The earlier tension had dissipated from Nathaniel's posture, replaced by his usual cool detachment. He cracked the window slightly, allowing the evening breeze to filter in, then smoothly pulled away from the curb.

"Mr. Falcon, can you believe Daphne actually dropped the charges? She had Gabrielle released. Aren't you shocked?"

Rosalind's tone carried an unmistakable edge of resentment toward Nathaniel.

His expression remained unreadable, though a flicker of surprise crossed his features.

Daphne had changed her mind?

Rosalind smirked triumphantly. "It was all Harrison's doing. Before coming to Falcon Enterprises to see you, she sent Daphne one text. That single message terrified Daphne so much she immediately withdrew her complaint."

"A text?" Nathaniel's gaze found Harrison's reflection in the rearview mirror. "What did it say?"

Harrison held his stare. "'Mr. Falcon ordered me to beg him personally.'"

[Mr. Falcon ordered me to beg him personally.]

Those eight words conveyed everything. Daphne would have understood their full implications instantly.

Nathaniel's lips curved in reluctant amusement. So Harrison's entire visit had been theater for Daphne's benefit. No wonder she'd dragged her feet at every turn—she'd been buying time.

This woman!

"Mr. Falcon, isn't Harrison brilliant?" Rosalind beamed with pride.

A low chuckle rumbled from Nathaniel's chest. He'd become an unwitting pawn in her game.

She'd turned the tables masterfully, using him to go from defense to offense. His gaze flicked to Harrison again, casual yet intense. "Quite."

The single word carried neither praise nor censure, landing somewhere between acknowledgment and teasing.

Harrison met his gaze unflinchingly, her lips curving in a playful smile. "I'll take that as a compliment, Mr. Falcon."

Thirty minutes later, the Rolls-Royce glided to a stop outside the police station. Harrison and Rosalind hurried inside to collect Gabrielle.
###Chapter 242

Harrison pulled Gabrielle into a tight embrace. "Gabrielle, I'm so sorry you had to endure all this."

Gabrielle looked completely unfazed, her energy high. "It was practically a vacation—gourmet meals, plush bedding. Couldn't have been better."

The trio burst into laughter.

Just then, Daphne approached, shooting Harrison a poisonous glare. Her plan to use Gabrielle against Harrison had spectacularly backfired. The humiliation burned.

Daphne knew Nathaniel's feelings for Harrison, especially after that fateful night. The woman in Nathaniel's bed had been Harrison. That's why Daphne had panicked upon seeing Harrison's text.

She'd sent investigators to tail Harrison, confirming she'd visited Falcon Enterprises. Shortly after, Nathaniel whisked her away in his Bentley.

Terrified, Daphne's only recourse was withdrawing her police statement to secure Gabrielle's release.

Her angelic features twisted with malice as she hissed, "Harrison, you knew Nathaniel was mine, yet you still pursued him. Have you no—"

"Daphne." Harrison cut her off sharply, nodding toward the exit. "Nathaniel's waiting outside. Better keep up your sweet little act."

Daphne whirled around, spotting the Bentley Continental parked under the streetlights.

The luxury sedan sat like a panther in the shadows—understated yet radiating power. Though the tinted windows revealed nothing, Daphne shuddered under the weight of an unseen gaze.

Her expression transformed instantly—venom replaced by trembling vulnerability.

A soft scoff made her turn. Harrison's piercing gaze stripped away every pretense, seeing straight through her.

Daphne's face paled.

Rosalind smirked. "Quite the performance."

Gabrielle stepped forward, bumping Daphne's shoulder. "We both know who the real homewrecker is here. Wouldn't want your precious image shattered, would we?"

Daphne's fists clenched.

"Gabrielle, Rosalind—let's go," Harrison called.

"Right behind you."

As the three walked away, Daphne trembled with suppressed rage, too afraid to retaliate with Nathaniel watching.

She approached the Bentley just as the window descended, revealing Nathaniel's sculpted profile.

"Mr. Falcon, Harrison and I...we're friends. Even though Gabrielle tried to hurt me, I still..." Daphne's voice dripped with manufactured sweetness.

Nathaniel lounged against the leather seats, long fingers drumming the steering wheel. His icy gaze sliced through her. "Was it really you that night?"

Daphne froze. "Pardon?"

His voice dropped to subzero. "Emerald Heights. The woman in my bed—was it truly you?"

Daphne's pulse stuttered. Why this question now? Did he know?

Had he discovered her deception—that Harrison had been his mystery lover? That she'd been impersonating Harrison all along?

She forced steadiness into her voice. "Mr. Falcon...of course it was me."

Nathaniel's razor-sharp stare caught the flicker of guilt in her eyes. His expression turned glacial.
###Chapter 243

Nathaniel remained silent. Daphne couldn't decipher the thoughts behind his unreadable expression.

"Mr. Falcon, it was me that night. I was the one who gave you my—"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel slammed the accelerator. The sleek sports car roared away.

"Mr. Falcon!" Daphne stood rooted to the spot, panic rising. Had he discovered the truth?

Two black-suited bodyguards materialized from nowhere. They seized her arms with bruising force.

Daphne shrieked. "Let go of me! Who are you?"

"Get in. Ms. Whitmore demands your presence."

They shoved her into a tinted-windowed limousine. Inside sat Isabella, her porcelain features twisted in icy disdain.

Daphne's stomach dropped. Everyone in Willowbrook knew Isabella was Nathaniel's true love. Harrison was just the insignificant wife—Daphne hadn't feared her.

But Isabella? That was another matter entirely.

"M-Ms. Whitmore..." Daphne stammered.

Isabella's gaze raked over her. "So you're the whore who slept with Nathaniel? I hear he's been showering you with resources, making you famous."

"I..." Daphne's throat closed.

Isabella's laugh was razor-sharp. "Men must be lining up for you now. Since you enjoy spreading your legs so much, how about I send you to work in a brothel? Sound appealing?"

Daphne trembled. "Please, Ms. Whitmore—"

Isabella regarded her like a bug under glass. This cheap slut had benefited from the aphrodisiac she'd used on Nathaniel. The thought of this trash in his bed made her blood boil.

She nodded at the guards. "Take her."

"Understood, Ms. Whitmore."

They reached for Daphne again.

Realizing she'd tangled with a predator, Daphne turned ghost-white. She threw herself at Isabella's feet. "You've got it wrong! That night—it wasn't me! It was Harrison!"

Isabella froze. "What?"

"I pretended to be her! Harrison slept with Nathaniel—she gave him her virginity!"

Isabella's breath hitched. Harrison? That plain nobody had been in Nathaniel's bed? No wonder she'd collapsed from morning-after pill allergies—she'd taken them for Nathaniel, not Alexander.

Rage ignited in Isabella's chest. She clutched her sternum as jealousy burned through her.

Victoria swept in. "Isabella, what's wrong?"

"Mother, did you hear? It was Harrison!"

Victoria's face darkened. Despite all her efforts, Harrison had still gotten to Nathaniel first.

"Compose yourself, darling."

"Compose myself? Harrison slept with Nathaniel! She'd never been with a man before—it was her first time! Daphne's been impersonating her, and Nathaniel's been pouring resources into her career—all meant for Harrison! Can you imagine his reaction when he learns the truth?" Nathaniel already favored Harrison. Discovering she'd given him her virginity? The consequences were unthinkable.
###Chapter 244

Isabella's rage burned so intensely that her nails carved crescent moons into her palms, yet the physical pain was nothing compared to the inferno inside her.

Victoria's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds. Her sharp gaze fell upon Daphne, still kneeling before her. "Is this truly your best effort? If you can't even handle Harrison, then you're utterly worthless to me."

Daphne's hands trembled. "I—I can fix this! I have a new strategy to deal with her!"

A cold laugh escaped Victoria's lips. "Prove it. Now get out of my sight."

Scrambling to her feet, Daphne fled like a frightened rabbit.

"Mother, why let her go?" Isabella demanded, frustration lacing every word.

Victoria's lips curled into a calculating smile. "Nathaniel still doesn't know Harrison was the woman from that night. We'll use Daphne as our puppet to dismantle her. Let them tear each other apart while we watch from the shadows."

Isabella inhaled deeply, the logic settling her fury. Nathaniel remained oblivious—Harrison's secret was still safe.

There was still time.

"You're brilliant, Mother."

Victoria pulled Isabella into a tender embrace. "My darling, I would move heaven and earth for your happiness. If Harrison dares stand in your way, I'll ensure she vanishes without a trace."

To Isabella, Victoria wasn't just a stepmother—she had become the mother she'd always longed for. Their bond, forged through shared ambition, ran deeper than blood.

"Why are you so good to me?" Isabella whispered, emotion thickening her voice.

Victoria stroked her hair lovingly. "Because you're my daughter."

The hunger for revenge flared in Isabella's chest. Harrison's own mother couldn't care less about her! Victoria's devotion belonged to Isabella alone—she was the daughter Victoria truly cherished.

Isabella beamed, sweetness dripping from her voice. "You're the best, Mother!"

Nathaniel returned to Emerald Heights. The moment he stepped inside, a maid rushed forward. "Mr. Falcon."

His gaze drifted to the living room sofa—the very spot where, weeks ago, two bodies had tangled in desperate passion. One hard and unyielding, the other soft and pliant, fitting together like pieces of a puzzle.

Who had that woman been?

Was it Harrison?

The thought made his stomach twist. That night, the woman had given him her innocence.

Did Harrison even still possess hers?

Then—something glinted beneath the sofa. He crouched, retrieving a slender silver needle.

Harrison's needle. The one she always carried.

How had it ended up here?

The answer crashed over him like a tidal wave. That night hadn't been a dream.

Harrison had been there.

This needle was irrefutable proof.

The woman from that night—the one who'd haunted his thoughts—was Harrison.

Nathaniel yanked out his phone, dialing with trembling fingers.

Alexander answered on the second ring. "Nathaniel?"

His grip tightened around the device. "Alexander. I need to ask you something."

"Go ahead."

"Have you ever slept with Harrison?"

Silence. Then Alexander's voice turned icy. "Nathaniel, I've never even held her hand. How could you ask me that?"

A pause. Then, softer: "Harrison is a good woman. She deserves respect. I hope you'll treat her well."

So they'd never been intimate.

Which meant—

The morning-after pill. The allergic reaction. Collapsing in the nurse's office. The marks on her skin. None of it had been Alexander's doing.

It had all been him.

Nathaniel's breath hitched as the truth slammed into him.

There had never been anyone else.

It had always been him.

That night was real. Their first time—raw, passionate, unforgettable—had been real.

Nathaniel stood frozen, one hand braced against his hip. His chest rose and fell unevenly as the magnitude of his mistakes settled over him.
###Chapter 245

It was her!
Harrison stood before him.

Yet Nathaniel had mistaken her for someone else entirely.

As memories flooded back - his cold dismissal, those cutting words - Nathaniel wanted to punch himself.

That day in the clinic, he'd pinned her down as she wept, confessing her hatred through tears. So fragile. So pure.

He cursed under his breath.

Muscles coiled tight with self-loathing, his handsome features twisted before settling into a grim smile.

Meanwhile, Gabrielle slept soundly after returning to the apartment. The next morning, Harrison and Rosalind took her shopping.

They wandered through the mall's glittering corridors until a boutique caught Harrison's eye.

Inside, candy-colored hairpins sparkled under the lights - strawberry pinks, watermelon greens, lemon yellows. Playful. Vibrant.

"Harrison, the yellow one suits you!" Rosalind exclaimed.

"I prefer the pink," Gabrielle mused.

Before Harrison could decide, a honeyed voice interrupted.

"What a surprise seeing you here, Harrison."

Daphne stood framed in the doorway, designer bags dangling from her assistant's arms. She removed her sunglasses with deliberate slowness.

"I have wonderful news to share."

Gabrielle arched a brow. "Did you finally win that Oscar?"

Daphne's smile faltered.

"You little-" She caught herself, pressing a dramatic hand to her chest. Suddenly she doubled over, gagging theatrically.

Rosalind crossed her arms. "What's your game now, Daphne?"

Pale-faced, Daphne turned pleading eyes to Harrison. "I've been so ill lately. Nauseous. Exhausted. You're a doctor, aren't you? Check my pulse."

Gabrielle opened her mouth, but Harrison raised a hand. "Fine."

Her delicate fingers found Daphne's wrist.

The pulse beneath her fingertips told the story.

Harrison's gaze lifted.

Daphne's eyes glittered with anticipation. "Well?"

"You're pregnant."

Silence.

Rosalind and Gabrielle gasped in unison. "Who's the father?"

Daphne's smirk returned as she locked eyes with Harrison. "When Nathaniel and I were together, he didn't use protection. I'm carrying his heir."

The words hit like a physical blow. Harrison's fists clenched.

Just then, a familiar baritone cut through the tension.

"What's going on here?"

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, imposing as ever.

Daphne practically tripped over herself to reach him. "Nathaniel! I have amazing news!"

He barely glanced at her. "What?"

"I'm pregnant!"

The triumphant announcement hung in the air.

Nathaniel's lips curled. "Is it mine?"

"Of course!" Daphne gushed. "That night... you're going to be a father."

His expression remained unreadable. "What do you want?"
###Chapter 246

Daphne's cheeks flushed with coy anticipation. "Mr. Falcon, tomorrow's my birthday celebration. Would you honor me with your presence?"

As Willowbrook's rising star, Daphne lived under constant media scrutiny. Having Nathaniel Falcon - billionaire mogul and Willowbrook's most powerful man - at her party would cement her status indefinitely.

Harrison's sharp gaze flickered to Nathaniel, who merely inclined his head. "Fine."

He'd accepted Daphne's invitation.

Her heart leapt. "Thank you, Mr. Falcon!"

"Given your condition, you should rest." Nathaniel's apparent concern made Daphne practically glow. She cradled her abdomen protectively.

"I'll go home now. Don't worry - our baby's perfectly safe. See you tomorrow."

Daphne shot Harrison a triumphant smirk before strutting away, her manager trailing behind with matching smugness.

Nathaniel closed the distance to Harrison in three long strides.

His smoldering gaze traced every delicate curve of her face, lingering hungrily.

"Mr. Falcon, eyes to yourself!" Rosalind snapped.

"Shouldn't you be doting on your pregnant girlfriend?" Gabrielle added acidly.

Ignoring them, Nathaniel seized Harrison's wrist. "You're coming with me."

He dragged her forward without waiting for consent.

Harrison dug in her heels. "Release me!"

"Let her go!" Both friends lunged forward.

Nathaniel simply scooped Harrison over his shoulder like a sack of flour and turned on his heel.

"Hey! You can't just abduct people!" Their protests died as Nathaniel's security detail blocked pursuit.

Helpless, they watched Nathaniel carry Harrison away.

"What's his problem? Where's he taking her?"

Nathaniel dumped Harrison into his Bentley's backseat, speeding toward Emerald Heights.

Harrison stiffened upon recognizing their destination. She refused to exit.

Nathaniel solved that by hauling her over his shoulder again.

"Put me down!" Harrison pummeled his back with furious fists.

The head housekeeper rushed over at the commotion. "Mr. and Mrs. Falcon!"

Nathaniel strode into the parlor, unceremoniously depositing Harrison onto the plush sofa.

The moment her body hit the cushions, memories of that night flooded back. She scrambled upright, only for Nathaniel to cage her in, one knee beside her hip as he pinned her wrists.

"Nathaniel, don't you dare!" Harrison thrashed wildly, her lithe form twisting beneath him like a trapped butterfly. When her hands proved useless, she lashed out with her legs.

Damn her stubbornness!

Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously, his breathing ragged. "Keep fighting me, Harrison, and we'll recreate that night in vivid detail."
###Chapter 247
What Did He Just Say?

Harrison's eyes widened in shock. Nathaniel had gotten Daphne pregnant, and was still saying things like that to her?

Shame and fury surged through her veins. "You're disgusting!" she spat, her voice trembling with anger.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto hers. Harrison's raven-black hair fanned out across the couch, her delicate features flushed with emotion. The sight mirrored the one that haunted his dreams.

In that moment, everything came rushing back.

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Why call me that? What exactly makes me disgusting?" His voice was low, challenging. Harrison had a sharp tongue, but when it came to insults, she faltered—her words soft, almost childlike.

She glared at him. "What do you want from me? If you ever come near me again, I'll tell Daphne. She's carrying your child—she doesn’t need this stress."

The mention of Daphne darkened Nathaniel's expression. If she thought she could deceive him, she would regret it soon enough.

"Harrison, are you angry? Because of Daphne? Because she's pregnant?" His tone was probing, testing her reaction.

Her face paled, then flushed. Anger, humiliation, and hurt warred inside her. Without thinking, she lunged forward and bit down hard on his throat.

Nathaniel hissed in pain, his eyes flashing crimson. He sat up abruptly, pulling her into his lap with effortless strength.

Dressed in his crisp white shirt and tailored black trousers, he was the epitome of power and refinement.

Harrison, in her oversized white sweater and pleated skirt, looked every bit the innocent college student.

The contrast between them was stark—a ruthless businessman cradling a furious girl in his arms.

"Mr. Nathaniel—"

The housekeeper froze in the doorway, tea tray in hand, her cheeks flaming at the sight. The staff at Emerald Heights knew better than to linger. She turned on her heel and vanished back into the kitchen.

Nathaniel's fingers tangled in Harrison's hair, his palm cradling the back of her head.

She still hadn’t released his throat.

"Harrison," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "I'm sorry."

She stiffened. Slowly, she let go.

A small, perfect bite mark marred his skin—proof of her temper.

She really did love leaving marks on him.

"I don’t accept your apology!" She shoved against his chest, trying to break free.

But Nathaniel’s arms tightened around her, pulling her back against him. He buried his face in her hair, his voice rough. "Harrison, I'm sorry."

She didn’t understand. Was this some kind of twisted game?

"Let me go! Don’t touch me! Go find Daphne!" She clawed at his hands, desperate to escape.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Daphne and I didn’t—"

A sharp knock cut him off.

Rosalind and Gabrielle were at the door, their voices sharp. "Let Harrison go, now!"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened with irritation.

Seizing the moment, Harrison shoved him away and scrambled to her feet. Without a backward glance, she bolted for the door.
###Chapter 248

"Harrison, are you alright? What did Mr. Falcon bring you here for?"

Rosalind and Gabrielle quickly steadied Harrison as she stood frozen, struggling to process everything.

Harrison frowned, still baffled by Nathaniel's actions. He had brought her to Emerald Heights, then apologized twice—completely unlike him.

But then she remembered Daphne's pregnancy, and her anger toward Nathaniel faded. She refused to waste another second on him.

"Let's go," she said flatly.

"Alright," Rosalind and Gabrielle agreed.

The three walked away, while Nathaniel remained on the couch, his expression darkening as he masked the hunger in his gaze.

Just then, Dominic entered and murmured, "Mr. Falcon, I've uncovered something."

Nathaniel looked up. "Speak."

"Daphne has a boyfriend back in the countryside. He adores her—works grueling construction jobs to pay for her education. They've been intimate, and the child she's carrying is his."

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Tomorrow's her birthday, isn't it? Prepare a special gift for her."

Dominic nodded. "Understood."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "That night at the hospital—it wasn't Daphne. It was Harrison. I'm disappointed you didn't know. Don't let it happen again."

Dominic flushed. "My apologies, sir. I never expected Mrs. Falcon to seek you out. Seems she still cares for you."

Did she?

That night, drugged by the aphrodisiac, he'd driven to the hospital expecting rejection.

But she hadn't refused.

She came.

She wanted him.

The next day

Harrison, Rosalind, and Gabrielle arrived at The Grand Celeste—only to find Daphne's birthday extravaganza in full swing.

The event was packed with fans and journalists.

Harrison spotted Daphne, radiant in a custom pink gown, her hair in an elaborate braid. She posed for photos, her youthful beauty glowing under the lights.

Fans gushed:

"Daphne, you're stunning!"

"You're perfect—absolutely breathtaking!"

"Can I get your autograph?"

Her manager, Genevieve, stepped forward. "Daphne, it's time to begin."

Daphne giggled. "Let's wait a little longer. Our special guest hasn't arrived yet."

The crowd buzzed. "Who is it, Ms. Sinclair?"

Daphne winked. "That's a secret!"

Rosalind and Gabrielle exchanged disgusted glances. "Some people are shameless."

Harrison, who'd planned to stay for dinner, suddenly lost her appetite. "Let's eat elsewhere."

"Agreed. I can't stand this."

They turned to leave—but Daphne spotted Harrison. Smirking, she sauntered over.

"Harrison! Here for my party?"

Harrison met her smug gaze. "No."

Daphne's smile widened. "Why leave? Mr. Falcon will be here soon. As my dear friend, shouldn't you stay to witness the happiest moment of my life?"
###Chapter 249
Daphne's eyes sparkled with triumph—she couldn't wait to rub her happiness in Harrison's face.

Harrison's gaze remained icy, offering no reaction.

Daphne rested a hand on her barely-there bump, lips curling into a smirk. "Harrison, you're not jealous, are you? Some women take morning-after pills and collapse from allergies, while I get pregnant and bathed in affection. Life's unfair like that."

"Hey!" Rosalind and Gabrielle both tensed, ready to retaliate, but Harrison lifted a hand to silence them.

"Let's go," she said flatly.

With that, Harrison turned and walked away.

Rosalind and Gabrielle hurried after her. "Harrison, why stop us? She deserved to be put in her place!"

Harrison gave a bitter, self-mocking smile. "Why bother? She's just stating facts."

She had taken the pill and fainted from an allergic reaction. Daphne got pregnant and became a celebrity.

The difference in Nathaniel's feelings was painfully clear.

Daphne knew exactly how to wound her. Each word was a needle, sharp and deliberate, piercing Harrison's heart with lingering pain.

The trio waited for the elevator when a group approached. Leading them was that tall, commanding figure—Nathaniel had arrived.

Nathaniel was flanked by Dominic and others. The hotel manager greeted them personally. "Mr. Falcon, please, the VIP elevator is ready."

The manager summoned the private lift.

Nathaniel had really come. For Daphne's birthday party.

Of course. Daphne carried his child. He wouldn't miss it.

Just then, Nathaniel's gaze swept past Harrison. Their eyes locked for a fleeting second.

"Come in," he said, tone even.

He was inviting them into the VIP elevator.

The manager immediately stepped aside. "Ladies, please."

Harrison hesitated. She didn’t want to share that confined space with him. His apology last night still confused her, but forgiveness wasn’t on the table. Running into him today was unexpected.

Rosalind and Gabrielle, however, tugged her inside without hesitation. They had no reason to fear him.

Harrison exhaled silently.

She glanced at Nathaniel again. Today, he wore a tailored black suit, every inch the aloof tycoon. Surrounded by his entourage, his demeanor was detached, unreadable.

Nathaniel had looked at her briefly before turning away, as if she were a stranger.

Harrison retreated to the corner, putting distance between them.

Both pretended the other didn’t exist.

Then the manager spoke up. "Mr. Falcon, what happened to your neck? A bite?"

The man had sharp eyes, spotting the faint marks on Nathaniel's throat.

The elevator fell silent, all eyes zeroing in on the marks.

"Mr. Falcon, it really does look like you were bitten."

Harrison stiffened, spine straightening. She kept her gaze averted, praying no one would notice her.

Nathaniel's voice, smooth and unbothered, cut through the tension. "Yes. A little puppy bit me."

"A puppy?"

Nathaniel chuckled faintly. "I have one. Misbehaved. Likes to bite."

"You own a puppy? How lucky it is to have you as its master!"

The crowd murmured in admiration, clearly envious.

Harrison bit her tongue, staying silent.

The elevator dinged softly. She bolted out the moment the doors opened.

Rosalind and Gabrielle chased after her. "Harrison, slow down! Wait for us!"

Nathaniel watched her retreat, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips.

Then his phone buzzed. A message from Daphne.
###Chapter 250

Daphne's patience had worn thin. She tapped out a message to Nathaniel: [Mr. Falcon, are you here yet?]

Nathaniel's expression darkened, his eyes turning icy. His reply was curt. [Yes.]

At the lavish birthday celebration, Daphne's heart leaped when she saw his response. Nathaniel had come!

How unfortunate Harrison wasn't present to witness this moment. Daphne burned with the desire to rub this triumph in her rival's face.

A triumphant smile spread across Daphne's lips as she addressed the glittering crowd. "Ladies and gentlemen, the main event can begin now. Our distinguished guest of honor has arrived."

"Daphne, who is this mystery VIP?"

"Ms. Sinclair, don't keep us in suspense! Introduce this special guest already!" The crowd buzzed with anticipation.

Daphne's smile turned coy. "Very well, let's welcome him now!"

The grand double doors swung open, every head turning in unison. Then, a figure entered.

Daphne rushed forward eagerly, ready to greet her guest. "Mr..."

But the name "Mr. Falcon" died on her lips as she froze mid-step.

The man who entered wasn't Nathaniel. It was Daniel Mercer, her secret boyfriend.

Daniel, still wearing his construction site uniform, had rushed straight from work. He beamed at Daphne. "Happy birthday, darling!"

Daphne stood rooted to the spot in shock. What was Daniel doing here? Where was Nathaniel?

For years, Daniel had toiled on construction sites to fund her education. In reality, Daphne had been using him.

With her stunning looks and perfect figure, Daphne considered Daniel merely a stepping stone - far beneath her league.

She wanted a powerful, wealthy man like Nathaniel. She dreamed of stardom, marrying into riches, escaping her humble beginnings to climb society's ladder.

Their relationship had been her best-kept secret. Until now, when Daniel crashed her carefully orchestrated event.

All eyes were on Daniel. "Daphne, who is this man?"

"Ms. Sinclair, is this your mystery guest?"

Daniel's work clothes immediately sparked whispers among the assembled celebrities and journalists.

Daphne's face drained of color. She couldn't let this secret come out. Her voice trembled with panic. "I don't know you! You've mistaken me for someone else. This is my birthday party. You need to leave immediately!"

She began physically pushing him toward the exit.

Daniel grabbed her wrist desperately. "Daphne, what's wrong? I'm your boyfriend!"

Boyfriend?

The crowd erupted in shocked murmurs. "Ms. Sinclair is dating a construction worker?"

Panic flashed in Daphne's eyes. She had no idea how Daniel found her, but his timing couldn't be worse. He was ruining everything!

"I don't know this man! Security, remove him at once!" Daphne shouted for the venue staff.

Growing frantic, Daniel pulled her into a tight embrace. "Daphne, why won't you acknowledge me? Now that you're famous, are you ashamed of me? Am I not good enough anymore?"

Before she could respond, Daniel whipped out his phone and flashed photos at the cameras. "Look! These are pictures of us together! I'm her boyfriend. I've worked construction for years to pay her tuition - spent hundreds of thousands on her! Daphne promised we'd marry after graduation!"

He scrolled through more images showing intimate moments - undeniable proof of their relationship.

The room exploded into chaos.
###Chapter 251

Daphne had invited the city's top media outlets to her extravagant birthday celebration. At the peak of her fame, every journalist had arrived, eager to capture the socialite's latest triumph.

She'd planned this moment meticulously - a perfect opportunity to cement her status. Then Daniel Mercer walked in, dropping a bombshell that shattered everything.

The room exploded with flashing cameras, reporters scrambling for the scoop.

"Ms. Sinclair, is this your secret lover?"

"So your university admission was funded by your construction worker boyfriend?"

"Was your wholesome public persona just an elaborate act?"

Daphne hadn't anticipated this disaster. Her carefully constructed world was crumbling. "No more photos!" she screamed, panic rising.

Her gaze accidentally lifted to the mezzanine level. There, leaning against the gilded railing, stood Nathaniel Falcon - tall, imposing, observing the chaos with icy detachment.

Her blood ran cold.

This couldn't be happening. Nathaniel couldn't discover her secrets. Not like this.

"Party's over!" she announced, turning to flee.

Daniel grabbed her wrist. "Running away, Daphne?"

"Let go!"

"How long did you plan to hide your pregnancy from me?"

Daphne froze. How could he possibly know? "That's insane!"

Daniel produced a medical document. "Your OB-GYN report. Still denying it?"

She'd visited the private clinic last week. But how had he obtained her records? Snatching the papers, she hissed, "Where did you get this?"

"My source isn't important. What matters is you're carrying my child."

"Shut up!" Her voice cracked. "This baby isn't yours!"

It had to be Nathaniel's.

And Nathaniel was watching from above. She couldn't let the truth surface now.

"Daphne, the dates match perfectly. That night I brought your tuition money. You were so... appreciative. We didn't use protection."

"Stop talking!" She was hyperventilating now.

"We've been intimate for years. You gave me your virginity before freshman year. Or have you forgotten?"

Game over.

Daphne didn't need to look up to feel Nathaniel's piercing stare. She could practically hear the shattering of her carefully crafted image.

Her nails dug into her palms. "Daniel, I'm begging you - stop!"

The cameras kept flashing. Reporters swarmed like vultures.

"Daphne, when's the due date?"

"A construction worker's baby? What will your high-society fans think?"

"Planning to dump him now that you're famous?"
###Chapter 252

"Who's funding your sudden rise to fame? Must be some wealthy benefactor."

The journalists' questions grew increasingly hostile, their words sharp as knives. Daphne's face drained of color as she looked at the crowd of former supporters surrounding her.

The admiration in their eyes vanished instantly. Voices rose in angry condemnation.

"We were fools to believe in you!"

"Thought we were backing a pure-hearted girl, not some gold-digging opportunist!"

"We're done here!"

Without hesitation, the crowd turned their backs, abandoning her completely.

Daphne knew her career was finished. This birthday celebration was supposed to be her triumphant moment, but instead became her spectacular downfall.

One minute she stood at the pinnacle of success, the next she was plunging into utter ruin.

What options remained?

Her gaze lifted to the imposing figure on the balcony above. Nathaniel stood motionless, his glacial stare cutting through her like winter wind. Those piercing eyes held the finality of a judge passing sentence.

He knew. Everything.

Two black-suited security guards shoved her toward the staircase. "Move!"

Her heel caught on the carpet, sending her crashing painfully to her knees before Nathaniel's polished dress shoes.

The billionaire barely turned his head, his contemptuous gaze sweeping over her trembling form.

"P-Please, Mr. Falcon... let me explain..." Daphne stammered.

Nathaniel's voice could have frozen hell itself. "By all means. Explain why you've been impersonating Harrison."

Her heart stopped. She'd prayed he hadn't discovered the truth about Harrison, but her worst nightmare had materialized.

"You... you knew?" Her voice barely registered as a whisper.

The cruel twist of Nathaniel's lips confirmed everything.

The door opened abruptly. Daniel entered. "Mr. Falcon."

Daphne's shock deepened. "You know Mr. Falcon?"

Daniel looked at her with undisguised disgust. "Mr. Falcon provided the pregnancy report. He arranged my invitation tonight. Without him, I'd never have seen your true nature."

The realization struck like a physical blow. Nathaniel had orchestrated everything - letting her climb to dizzying heights only to engineer her spectacular fall.

Ice flooded Daphne's veins as the full magnitude of her situation became clear. She'd unwittingly challenged someone far more dangerous than she'd ever imagined.

"Mr. Falcon, please! I was wrong! That night you were with Harrison, and I pretended to be her... I just couldn't stand her having what I wanted! Please, have mercy! I'll never-"

Her groveling pleas filled the silent room.

Nathaniel's expression could have turned wine to vinegar. Were it not for Harrison, this woman wouldn't even register in his memory.

"Every resource you've received is being withdrawn. You're blacklisted industry-wide. Your acting career is finished. Expect expulsion from Willowridge University. Pack your belongings and leave Willowbrook. If I ever see you again..."

Tears streamed down Daphne's face. Years of struggle to enter Willowridge, gone. The adoration of fans, vanished. The wealth and status she craved - all dissolving like morning mist.

Nathaniel turned sharply to leave.

"Mr. Falcon! Please!" Her desperate sobs echoed through the hall.

He paused just long enough to deliver his final verdict. "A smart woman knows her place. Did you truly believe you could compare to Harrison? Impersonating her will be the greatest mistake of your pathetic life."
###Chapter 253

Nathaniel turned on his heel and disappeared into the night.

Daphne's entire body trembled with terror. Her greedy deception of pretending to be Harrison had backfired spectacularly. Nathaniel's parting words echoed in her mind - this would be the mistake that haunted her forever.

She was utterly ruined.

Her desperate gaze landed on Daniel, the only person she believed could salvage this disaster.

Though Daniel came from modest means, his relentless ambition had propelled him forward. He'd invested hundreds of thousands in her over the years, always the first to solve her family's problems. Losing him now would be catastrophic.

"Daniel, please...it was all my fault." Her voice cracked as she clutched his sleeve. "Take me home. I'll fix everything. We can start fresh-"

He yanked his arm away, his expression glacial. "You're done in Willowbrook, Daphne. Only when you've hit rock bottom do you remember me? I see you clearly now. Your greed makes you unworthy of compassion."

Without hesitation, Daniel strode away.

"Daniel! Wait!" She screamed after him, clutching her stomach. "I'm carrying your child! You can't abandon us!"

He barely glanced at her swollen belly. "That baby was always just another pawn to you. You'll never be fit to be a mother. Do it a favor - terminate the pregnancy."

His retreating footsteps echoed like a death knell.

Daphne collapsed onto the pavement, her dreams reduced to ashes around her.

"No! This can't be happening!" Her wails pierced the night air.

Meanwhile, Harrison, Rosalind, and Gabrielle emerged from an upscale restaurant, laughing over dessert.

"Harrison, how do you think Daphne's birthday gala went?"

"With Nathaniel attending and her pregnancy announcement? She probably thinks she's won the lottery."

"What a disgusting pair!"

Rosalind and Gabrielle exchanged looks of disgust at both Nathaniel and Daphne.

Harrison merely smiled when suddenly - "Stop right there!"

A disheveled figure barreled toward them, tripping at Harrison's feet.

Harrison gasped. The filthy, trembling woman was Daphne.

Rotten food stained Daphne's designer dress. Her hair was matted with eggshells. An angry mob chased her, screaming, "Liar! Fraud!"

"Daphne?!"

Rosalind and Gabrielle gaped in shock.

The once-glamorous socialite had become public enemy number one. Of all people to collapse before, it had to be Harrison. Every shred of dignity had been stripped away, leaving only raw humiliation.

Suddenly, Daphne remembered Harrison rushing to her defense at The Grand Celeste incident. Back then, Harrison had genuinely considered her a friend.

Tears blurred Daphne's vision as she scrambled up and fled. "Leave me alone!"

Rosalind turned to Harrison, stunned. "Was that really Daphne? What happened?"

Harrison watched the retreating figure, equally perplexed.

Back at their dorm, the trio turned on the entertainment news. A breathless announcer declared:

"Shocking developments! Rising star Daphne Sinclair's wholesome image lies in tatters after tonight's explosive revelations! The beloved actress has been exposed dating a construction worker while pregnant out of wedlock!"

The screen cut to footage from the gala, showing Daniel's dramatic entrance and subsequent confrontation.

Rosalind nearly choked. "What?! Daphne had a boyfriend this whole time?"
###Chapter 254

Gabrielle gasped. "Wait...what? She's pregnant before marriage? So the baby in Daphne's belly isn't Nathaniel's—it's her boyfriend's?"

Harrison felt something must have happened at the birthday party, but never imagined this scenario.

Daphne had a boyfriend. The child she carried was his.

What did that mean about her relationship with Nathaniel?

A sharp knock echoed at the door.

"Who is it?"

Harrison moved to open it, only to find Nathaniel's imposing figure filling the doorway.

She froze. What was he doing here? This was the girls' dormitory!

Harrison tried to slam the door shut.

Nathaniel's strong arm blocked it effortlessly. His dark eyes burned into hers. "Harrison. We need to talk."

"I have nothing to say to you."

"You don't get a choice."

With one powerful motion, he forced his way inside.

Rosalind immediately stood. "We'll give you privacy."

She wanted to give them space.

But Gabrielle resisted. "I'm not leaving—mmph!"

Rosalind clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her out. "We won't return tonight," she added before closing the door.

Now they were alone.

Nathaniel loomed over Harrison, his shadow engulfing her. "I never touched Daphne. Not once."

Harrison trembled slightly, meeting his gaze with clear eyes. "You expect me to believe that?"

Daphne having a boyfriend didn't prove she hadn't been with Nathaniel. If he hadn't been involved with her, why invest so much in her career?

Backlit by the window, Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "If I'd slept with her, I'd admit it. I'm not the kind of man who lies about such things."

Harrison fell silent.

His arrogance was infuriating. Yet Nathaniel had never been one to shy from truth.

"Then why—"

"She pretended to be you."

What?

Harrison blinked in shock.

Nathaniel's gaze traced her delicate features, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "Harrison, after you left that night, Daphne took your place. When I woke, she was beside me. Claimed we'd been together."

The pieces clicked into place.

That morning, Daphne had deliberately sent Harrison away. The moment she left, Daphne slipped into her place.

An elaborate scheme.

Daphne had played them both. She'd targeted Nathaniel from the start.

"Harrison." Nathaniel stepped closer, his breath warm against her cheek. "Every resource I gave Daphne, every opportunity—it was because I thought she was you."

The air between them crackled with tension.

He'd mistaken Daphne for her.

Harrison turned away, voice icy. "Message received. Now leave."

She was dismissing him.

Nathaniel's lips curved in a dangerous smile. "Just like that? You'd really let me walk away?"
###Chapter 255

"What more could you possibly want?" Harrison snapped back.

The dormitory lights cast a delicate halo around her porcelain features. Her flawless skin looked fragile enough to shatter at the slightest touch. Even the faint peach fuzz along her cheekbones shimmered under the soft glow.

Nathaniel's sharp jawline softened as his lips curved into a knowing smile. "Don't you have anything to say about that evening?"

That evening...

Harrison hadn't allowed herself to dwell on those memories for months. But now, with him bringing it up, the images flooded back with startling clarity.

Two bodies - one hard with muscle, one soft with curves - tangled together on the leather sofa.

Sweat-slicked skin. Panting breaths. The explosive climax that left them both trembling.

His deep voice growling her name against her throat. "Harrison."

Their eyes locked now, Nathaniel's intense gaze holding hers captive. She could see her own reflection in those dark pupils - the realization dawning that he remembered everything.

Just as she did.

"Nothing to say," she muttered, turning to leave.

But Nathaniel moved with panther-like grace, blocking her path.

She sidestepped left.

He mirrored her movement.

She tried right.

Again, he matched her.

A playful yet undeniable trap of his making.

Harrison glared up at him. "What's your game?"

Nathaniel's smirk deepened, his voice dropping to that dangerous purr. "What do you think I want?"

Her mind raced. Was this about making amends? After pouring resources into Daphne, transforming her into an overnight sensation with legions of adoring fans?

"I want nothing from you," Harrison said, attempting to push past. Strong arms encircled her from behind, pulling her flush against his hard chest.

His lips brushed the shell of her ear as he whispered, "Harrison, I truly believed you never came that night. I didn't know it was you."

His large hand splayed across her flat abdomen, fingers tracing slow circles. The tenderness in his voice surprised her. "You passed out after taking that pill. The pain must have been unbearable."

Soft kisses trailed along her neck as he buried his face in her hair. "I'm sorry you had to face the aftermath alone."

Harrison's breath hitched.

An apology for leaving her to deal with the consequences.

Concern about her suffering.

Admission of his mistaken assumption.

Nathaniel knew exactly how to dismantle a woman's defenses. Harrison felt the telltale sting of tears threatening to spill.

All the suppressed anguish from these past months surged forward, magnified by his unexpected tenderness.

Nathaniel turned her in his arms, one strong hand guiding her waist until they stood face-to-face.

Tears glistened in her wide eyes. He cradled her face, leaning down to claim her lips-

The sharp trill of his phone shattered the moment.

Harrison shoved him away. "You're being summoned."

Nathaniel fished the device from his pocket. Isabella's name flashed across the screen.

Harrison saw it too, her expression shuttering as she retreated.

With a frustrated sigh, he answered. Isabella's shrill voice pierced the air.

"Nathaniel! Where are you? With her again? Have you forgotten your promises? You swore you were done with Harrison! You said the divorce was imminent! You vowed never to share her bed again! Or have you conveniently erased all that from memory?"
###Chapter 256

The dormitory was unnervingly silent when Isabella's shrill voice pierced through the quiet, sharp enough for Harrison to catch every syllable.

Harrison filled a glass with water and took a small sip. The liquid tasted strangely bitter on his tongue.

Nathaniel remained silent, though his striking features darkened with tension.

"Nathaniel, I can't stand being apart from you. Come to me immediately!" Isabella's demanding tone echoed from the phone.

Nathaniel's grip tightened around his device. With deliberate strides, he moved toward the door.

Harrison watched his retreating figure. He was leaving to be with Isabella, wasn't he?

He'd nearly forgotten - Daphne had been merely a temporary distraction. Isabella held Nathaniel's heart.

One call. A few words. That's all it took to make him leave.

Their night together meant nothing in the grand scheme of things.

A bitter smile curved Harrison's lips.

Nathaniel paused in the hallway, his expression hardening. "Isabella, I can't come now."

"What? Are you with Harrison? Listen carefully - choose between me or him. If you don't come tonight, you'll regret this!" The line went dead with a sharp click.

Nathaniel's mouth pressed into a thin line.

He stood motionless, phone in hand, then turned to glance back at Harrison's dorm.

Before, he would have rushed to Isabella without hesitation. Now, uncertainty rooted him in place.

His phone chimed suddenly.

Gabrielle had sent a friend request.

Nathaniel accepted.

Immediately, a screenshot appeared - a conversation between Gabrielle and Harrison.

[Gabrielle, my friend lost her virginity to her husband, but he's been ignoring her since. What does that mean?]

This was Harrison's message after Nathaniel had distanced himself.

Gabrielle's reply followed: [It means she failed to satisfy him. He's already bored with her.]

Now understanding the context, Gabrielle forwarded it to Nathaniel.

She'd typed several responses but ultimately sent only one sentence: [Harrison has endured so much pain loving you.]

Harrison had suffered for loving him.

Nathaniel's stone-cold heart began to crack, then crumble completely.

During his mistaken pursuit of Daphne, he couldn't fathom Harrison's silent agony. Yet Harrison had borne it without complaint.

Unlike Isabella who screamed her grievances, Harrison swallowed every hurt.

He recalled Harrison's eyes earlier - glistening yet cold, fragile yet standing alone.

Loving him had brought Harrison nothing but pain.

Back in the dorm, Harrison stood motionless. His twin braids framed his face softly, the dim lighting accentuating his isolation.

Ding!

His phone's alert shattered the silence.

Harrison turned, still clutching his water glass.

Then collided with a solid chest. Nathaniel had returned, standing directly behind him.

Harrison's mind blanked at the sight. "Why did you come back?" he breathed, stunned.

Why had Nathaniel returned?

Hadn't he gone to Isabella?
###Chapter 257

Harrison never anticipated Nathaniel's return. After overhearing Isabella's demanding tone on the phone, practically commanding him to come immediately, she was certain he would obey.

Isabella was his beloved, the one he always rushed to. Even when drugged, a single call from her could pull him away.

This was the first time he refused.

Harrison couldn't help but wonder how furious Isabella would be tonight.

Nathaniel studied her. "What were you thinking just now?"

He had stood behind her, observing her quiet, lowered head. Her thoughts were unreadable.

Suddenly, he recalled the girl he'd met in the cave years ago. She had been just as silent, just as withdrawn. It stirred something protective in him. Nathaniel didn't know why, but something about Harrison reminded him of that girl.

Harrison avoided answering. "Nothing important."

Nathaniel didn't push. His gaze dropped to his soaked shirt and trousers—her spilled water had drenched him. "I'm drenched."

Harrison snatched a tissue and began dabbing at his clothes. "Sorry. It was an accident."

The white fabric clung to his torso, revealing the contours of his muscles. Her movements trailed lower, past his waist, over the black belt, reaching his damp pants...

"Harrison."

His voice, rough and low, came from above her.

She kept wiping, focused. "Hmm?"

"Was that intentional?"

What?

Harrison froze. When her eyes caught the unmistakable outline beneath his trousers, her face burned crimson.

She stumbled back several steps. "Absolutely not—"

Nathaniel gave her a fleeting glance. "I need a shower. Dominic will bring fresh clothes soon. Take them from him."

With that, he turned and disappeared into the bathroom.

The sound of running water soon filled the space. He was showering.

Harrison's cheeks still burned. She hadn't meant to—why would he even—

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Dominic had arrived.

"Mrs. Falcon, Mr. Falcon's clothes."

"Thanks."

She accepted the bag and pulled out the crisp shirt and trousers. His garments were always meticulously cared for—hand-washed, softened, and pressed to perfection.

Harrison approached the bathroom door and knocked. "Your clothes are here."

The water continued running, but Nathaniel's deep voice cut through. "Bring them in. Leave them on the counter."

She pushed the door open and stepped inside.

He was behind the frosted glass, his silhouette blurred. Harrison kept her gaze averted as she set the clothes down. "Done."

She turned to leave.

His voice stopped her. "Where's the body wash?"

She had placed hers by the sink earlier. Harrison picked it up and walked toward him. "Here."

The shower door slid open. Harrison kept her eyes down, arm extended.

But Nathaniel didn't take it.

Her arm grew tired.

What was he doing?

Finally, she looked up, confused.

Their eyes met. Nathaniel's lips curved into a teasing smirk. "Scared to look at me?"

He was doing this on purpose!

Harrison's face flamed hotter. "Forget it!"

She spun to leave.

But before she could, Nathaniel seized her wrist and yanked her into the shower.
###Chapter 258

Harrison's slender frame pressed against the chilled marble tiles of the shower wall. Scalding water cascaded over her, drenching her instantly. She lifted trembling hands to Nathaniel's broad chest.

"Stop this."

The water streamed down Nathaniel's chiseled jawline, tracing the contours of his sculpted physique. Droplets clung to his defined collarbones before disappearing down his toned abdomen.

It was like watching a Renaissance masterpiece come to life - raw masculine perfection.

Harrison's pulse quickened, heat pooling in her core. She felt like cornered prey, eyes darting anywhere but at him, overwhelmed by his proximity.

Nathaniel caged her against the wall, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips. "Still playing innocent? You've seen everything already."

She hadn't anticipated this boldness. That first night, he'd been under medication's haze. Now his piercing gaze held terrifying clarity.

Never had they been this close while sober. Never like this.

"Nathaniel, release me!" Harrison twisted in his grasp.

His grip only tightened. Reaching up, he threaded something through her damp strands.

The mirror reflected his actions - a golden hairpin nestled in her ebony locks. Then came a rose-colored one. An emerald followed.

Harrison froze. These were the pins she'd admired while shopping with Rosalind and Gabrielle. Luna's interruption had prevented her purchase.

He'd gone back. Bought them all.

Nathaniel's gaze softened as he studied her. Water darkened her hair to midnight, accentuating her delicate features. The candy-colored accessories brought unexpected playfulness to her usual cool elegance.

"Exquisite."

His lips brushed the pins before claiming her mouth. Strong arms encircled her, pulling her flush against him. Another kiss pressed to her crown.

"Absolutely breathtaking."

Harrison's knees buckled. Only his embrace kept her upright.

Nathaniel always rewarded those who pleased him. Extravagantly.

She pushed weakly against his chest. "Nathaniel, no!"

He tightened his hold, voice roughened. "Still planning to find me a doctor, little wife?"

Harrison stilled. So he hadn't forgotten her thoughtless comment.

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, forcing eye contact. "Was I inadequate? That night, you didn't seem disappointed." His thumb traced her lower lip. "I remember every sound you made. Every gasp. Every whimper."

The memory burned.

Scarlet flooded Harrison's cheeks, staining her neck. She slapped a hand over his mouth. "Enough!"

Nathaniel pinned her wrist above her head. His body aligned perfectly with hers as he leaned in. "Tell me you didn't enjoy it."

She squirmed, refusing to answer.

Desire darkened his gaze. He captured her lips again. "I did. Immensely."

The admission shocked her.

Harrison's wide eyes reflected conflicting emotions - surprise warring with reluctant anticipation.

Nathaniel claimed her mouth once more, leaving no room for doubt about his intentions.
###Chapter 259

Harrison's delicate frame began to slide downward, but Nathaniel's powerful arms caught her just in time, his grip firm around her slender waist.

His scorching kiss made her feel like she might dissolve into nothingness.

Nathaniel's fingers moved to unfasten her buttons, his voice rough with desire. "Do you have protection?"

She shook her head weakly.

"I'll have Dominic bring some," he murmured, reaching for his phone.

Harrison stopped him immediately. The thought of his secretary delivering condoms made her cheeks burn with embarrassment. She'd never be able to look Dominic in the eye again.

"Don't..."

His lips trailed down her neck, sending shivers down her spine. "Don't what?"

His short hair tickled her sensitive skin as she tangled her fingers in it, trying halfheartedly to push him away. "Nathaniel, please stop."

Her thoughts were scrambled. This wasn't supposed to happen again. Today had spiraled out of control completely.

Nathaniel captured her lips once more. "I need you, Harrison."

Harrison.

He'd said her name exactly like that night. The memory made her flush crimson. Her hands, which had been pulling at his hair, went slack before wrapping weakly around his neck.

Nathaniel reached for his phone again.

"No... It's safe... I can't get pregnant right now..." Her voice trembled with emotion.

A faint smile curved his lips as he pulled her into another searing kiss.

Late night footsteps echoed through the dormitory hallway as girls returned from dates.

"Did you hear that?"

"What?"

"Sounded like bedsprings."

"You're imagining things. Let's go inside."

Their laughter faded as doors closed.

On the heart-patterned sheets, Nathaniel wore only a partially buttoned white shirt that revealed his toned abdomen. His dark eyes burned with hunger as he looked at the girl straddling him.

His calloused hands gripped her waist gently. "Relax," he murmured. "They're gone now."

Her long black hair tumbled wildly around her flushed skin. She buried her face in his shoulder, near tears. "Nathaniel, someone might hear..."

He kissed her tenderly. "I've got you."

His words echoed in her mind.

Harrison's lips felt swollen from his kisses. From the start, Nathaniel had taken complete control, leaving her no choice but surrender.

"Harrison," he breathed, voice strained. "That night... was it your first? Had there been anyone before me?"

Her damp eyes met his. "You already know the answer."

"I want to hear you say it."

She nodded slowly. "There's only ever been you."

His satisfied smirk sent heat through her body.

Harrison felt like a tiny boat tossed by violent waves - lifted high only to crash down again.

As she lost herself in sensation, his hoarse whisper cut through the haze. "Me too."

Me too? What did that mean?

Before she could process it, he gave her no chance to think.

At the Whitmore estate, Isabella sat rigid on the sofa, fingers clenched around her phone as she redialed Nathaniel's number repeatedly.

It was late. She'd summoned him, confident he would come running as always.

Harrison was no threat to her. Never had been.
###Chapter 260

The morning felt different. No matter how long she waited, Nathaniel never showed up.

Isabella's fingers trembled as she dialed his number repeatedly. Each time, the same robotic voice answered. "The subscriber you are trying to reach is currently unavailable."

Her phone shattered against the wall with a loud crash. "How dare he ignore me!"

Victoria rushed to her daughter's side. "Darling, calm down. You know your heart condition..."

Isabella shoved her mother away violently. "Calm down? After that idiot Daphne ruined everything!" Her manicured nails dug into her palms. "We planned everything perfectly - the fake pregnancy, framing Harrison for the miscarriage. But that stupid girl couldn't even play her part right!"

The realization hit her like a truck. Nathaniel knew the truth now. He knew Harrison was the woman from that night.

Years together, yet he'd never touched her. Harrison had been his first. Every woman knew what that meant for a man.

Victoria's face darkened. This was worse than they'd imagined. Nathaniel had chosen Harrison over Isabella for the first time.

The unthinkable was happening.

"Mother..." Isabella's voice trembled. "What if he finds out about the cave? What if he realizes I'm not the girl he's been searching for all these years?"

Victoria slapped a hand over her daughter's mouth. "Silence!" Her eyes darted around their empty mansion. "Never speak of that again. If Nathaniel discovers the truth, we're all finished!"

The Hawk family heir wasn't someone to cross. Their deception would cost them everything.

Isabella collapsed onto the velvet couch. "We never should have let that country bumpkin take my place. How could Nathaniel fall for someone like her?"

"She was supposed to be temporary!" Victoria spat. "An uneducated peasant with no connections. Who knew he'd develop feelings?"

Their arrogance had blinded them. Fate had other plans when Harrison entered Nathaniel's life.

Isabella clutched her mother's arm. "We can't let this continue. We need a new plan."

Victoria's lips curled into a calculating smile. "This time, we pull out all the stops. We'll make sure Nathaniel divorces that girl and comes back to you."

Morning light filtered through the dorm room curtains as Harrison stirred awake. Every muscle protested as she moved, evidence of last night's passion.

Nathaniel's strong arms held her close, his breathing even in sleep. Even now, he looked every inch the powerful CEO - the most sought-after bachelor in Willowbrook currently tangled in her pink floral sheets.
###Chapter 261

Her fingers hovered near his chiseled features.

Before she could touch him, his hand captured hers. Sleepy dark eyes met hers as he pressed a kiss to her fingertips. "Morning, sweetheart."

That deep morning voice sent shivers down her spine. Harrison pulled away, cheeks flushing. "We should get up. The others will be waking soon."

Nathaniel tugged her back against his chest. "Five more minutes." His nose nuzzled her hair.

"This is a girls' dorm!" She struggled free, only to stumble when her feet hit the floor.

Strong arms caught her mid-fall. "Careful." Amusement laced his voice.

Harrison punched his chest weakly. "This is your fault!"

The crooked yellow hairclip clinging to her messy hair only made her more endearing. Nathaniel's chest vibrated with silent laughter.

He deposited her back on the bed, hovering over her. "Still have energy? How about a morning workout?" His lips descended toward hers.

Harrison dodged with a squeal. "Nathaniel, stop!"

Their playful tussle filled the small room with warmth and laughter. Then his fingers brushed something hard beneath the pillow.

"What's this?" He pulled out the crystal pendant - the very one he'd given her in the cave years ago.

Harrison's breath caught. "You gave this to me."

"Did I?" His brow furrowed.

She cradled the pendant gently. "That night in Wintervale..." Her voice trailed off, searching his face for recognition.

The ringing phone shattered the moment.

Nathaniel answered immediately. Victoria's panicked voice carried through. "Mr. Hawk! Isabella slit her wrists! She's at Willowbrook General!"

Harrison watched the warmth drain from Nathaniel's face. He dressed in record time. "I'm on my way."

The pendant slipped from Harrison's fingers as Nathaniel rushed out. She quietly returned it beneath the pillow.

Last night's magic evaporated. Reality came crashing back - Isabella would always stand between them.

Harrison stood on shaky legs. "I'm coming with you."
###Chapter 262

Nathaniel's gaze flickered to Harrison before giving a curt nod.

"Fine."

They reached the hospital and entered the private ward where Isabella lay.

The pale figure on the bed barely stirred, her breathing regulated by machines. Blood seeped through the thick gauze wrapped around her left wrist.

Victoria rushed forward the moment she spotted Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, thank God you're here!"

Her steps faltered when she noticed Harrison trailing behind him. Her expression darkened instantly. "Why did you bring her?"

Harrison stared at the woman who gave birth to her with icy detachment.

Victoria's voice turned shrill. "How dare you show your face here, Harrison! Isabella needed Nathaniel last night during her cardiac episode, but you selfishly kept him away! Look what you've done - she slit her wrist! Is this what you wanted? You drove her to this! Get out!"

Blind with rage, Victoria snatched a glass from the bedside table and hurled it at Harrison.

Crack!

The glass shattered against Nathaniel's temple.

Harrison didn't feel the impact. Her vision blurred as a solid wall of muscle stepped between them.

She looked up to see Nathaniel shielding her. Blood trickled from a gash above his eyebrow.

Her breath hitched. Those dark eyes widened in disbelief. She never expected him to take a blow for her.

Victoria froze, her face draining of color. "M-Mr. Falcon, why would you-"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable as he stood guard over the petite woman behind him. His voice cut through the tension. "I chose not to come last night. The fault is mine, not hers. Leave her out of this."

His tone brooked no argument.

Victoria looked like she'd been slapped.

Harrison moved quickly, grabbing a clean towel to press against Nathaniel's wound. "Does it hurt?"

Meeting her worried gaze, he shook his head. "It's nothing."

Her chest tightened. After years of Victoria's cruelty, Nathaniel's protection felt foreign.

A weak moan came from the bed.

Victoria brightened. "Isabella's waking up!"

Nathaniel immediately pulled away from Harrison's touch and approached the bed.

Isabella looked fragile as she weakly lifted her hand. "Nathaniel..."

He took it in his.

Victoria launched into hysterics. "Mr. Falcon, where were you last night? Isabella waited up all night for you! She didn't sleep a wink!"

"I was beside myself with worry. You know her heart condition. When I brought her breakfast this morning, I found her unconscious in blood... so much blood..."

"The doctors barely saved her. They had to give her three transfusions."

Isabella's red-rimmed eyes brimmed with accusation. Her whisper trembled. "Why didn't you come, Nathaniel?"

Guilt twisted his features.

He'd spent the night with Harrison while Isabella, waiting in vain, had taken a razor to her wrists.

Isabella's gaze shifted to Harrison. "Why is she here? Make her leave! Nathaniel, I can't bear to look at her. Please, get her out of here."
###Chapter 263

Isabella didn't want Harrison here.

Harrison turned to look at Nathaniel.

Still holding Isabella's hand, he slowly lifted his gaze to meet hers.

Their eyes locked.

Before Nathaniel could speak, Harrison shifted her gaze and briefly glanced at Isabella before offering a small, polite smile. "I'm glad you're okay. I'll leave now."

She turned and walked away.

But she didn't leave immediately. She stood outside the door, listening to the conversation inside.

Isabella's voice was filled with sorrow as she accused Nathaniel, "Nathaniel, tell me. Did you sleep with Harrison?"

Nathaniel looked at the door for a moment before his eyes settled back on Isabella's pale face. "Isabella, I'm sorry."

He admitted it.

Isabella bit her lip. "Nathaniel, why? You told me you and Harrison were over!"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. Yes, he had told Isabella that he and Harrison were finished, but he couldn't stop himself from seeking out Harrison.

"Nathaniel, you've forgotten my warning. I told you not to touch Harrison, not to sleep with her! Now that it's happened, I'm giving you a chance to make things right. I forgive you, but you have to choose between me and Harrison. I want you to divorce her immediately!"

Harrison, standing just outside the door, heard those words. Once again, Isabella was forcing Nathaniel to make a choice.

Would he choose Harrison or Isabella?

Isabella was demanding that he divorce Harrison now.

Harrison lowered her head, her whole body trembling slightly. After a long pause, she turned and walked away, the light from the hallway stretching her slender silhouette long and thin.

Inside the VIP room, Nathaniel furrowed his brow. "Isabella..."

"Nathaniel, is this choice so hard for you? I know Harrison is good at seducing men. She must have tricked you into bed. But sex and love are separate for men, right? You just used her to satisfy your physical needs, but you love me, right? Nathaniel, if I'm not the one you want to be with anymore, there's no reason for me to live. I'll kill myself right now!"

With those words, Isabella became hysterical, sitting up and attempting to tear the bandages from her wrist. The wound began to bleed again, and the fresh blood soaked through the cloth, turning it crimson.

Nathaniel's face went pale as he rushed to stop her. "Isabella, what are you doing? Stop!"

"Don't stop me!" Isabella screamed, her eyes filled with fury and pain. "You want me dead, don't you? I'll make sure you'll never have me again!"

She pushed at Nathaniel, struggling so fiercely that she lost her balance and fell off the bed, crashing to the floor.

"Ah, Isabella!" Victoria screamed in panic.

Nathaniel immediately reached out, pulling her into his arms. "Isabella, are you crazy?"

Tears streamed down Isabella's face. "Do you not want me anymore? Big Brother, you promised you'd be there for me! You're my Big Brother, aren't you?"

Her calling him "Big Brother" made Nathaniel's muscles tighten as veins bulged on his forehead. He held her tighter, his voice rough and reassuring. "I won't leave you, promise."

"Then divorce Harrison. I want you to divorce her!"

The pain in Nathaniel's eyes was palpable.

Victoria spoke up, her voice desperate. "Mr. Falcon, you lost your way for a moment with Harrison. Isabella is the one you truly love. Ask yourself, who do you love- Harrison or Isabella?"

In his mind, Nathaniel saw Harrison's delicate face, the image of her sweet, innocent features. He closed his eyes, forcing the image of her away. The person he loved was always Isabella.

Isabella was his little girl. He couldn't let anything happen to her.

When it came to choosing between Harrison and Isabella, there was no question.

He would choose Isabella. After a long silence, Nathaniel's hoarse voice finally broke through.

"Alright, I'll divorce Harrison."
###Chapter 264

Harrison stepped back into the girls' dormitory, her phone buzzing immediately with a video call from Rosalind.

Rosalind's radiant face filled the screen, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "So? How was last night? Did you and Mr. Falcon finally...?" She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.

Harrison let out a soft laugh, keeping her tone light. "Why aren't you back yet?"

"Didn't want to interrupt your private time. Nobody likes being the third wheel." Rosalind grinned before continuing, "Mr. Falcon handled Daphne perfectly this time. I'm convinced he has feelings for you. You've consummated your marriage now - you're officially husband and wife. I hope everything works out between you two."

Harrison didn't respond immediately. She popped a mint into her mouth, letting the cool flavor spread across her tongue.

After a beat, she smiled. "Thanks, Rosalind. Come back soon, okay?"

"I'll be there tonight."

"Good."

The call ended, leaving a heavy silence in its wake. Harrison sat on her bed and pulled out the crystal pendant hidden beneath her pillow. Her fingers traced the delicate engravings with practiced familiarity.

Her phone chimed suddenly - Nathaniel was calling.

Harrison glanced at the screen before answering quietly. "Yes?"

His deep voice resonated through the speaker. "Are you free now?"

"I am."

"I'm waiting outside the school gates." His car was already there, engine idling. Waiting for her. "Alright."

She hung up and opened her closet. Selecting a few items, she tucked them into her bag before heading out.

The sleek black Bentley sat in its usual spot. Harrison slid into the passenger seat. "How's Isabella?"

Nathaniel's hands tightened on the steering wheel, his handsome features as striking as ever but edged with frost. "Still emotionally unstable. Her heart condition is deteriorating. The prognosis isn't good."

Harrison remained silent.

Suddenly, Nathaniel turned, his gaze settling on her delicate profile. "Harrison, let's get divorced."

He was asking for a divorce.

A bitter smile touched Harrison's lips. She'd expected this. Against Isabella's tears, she never stood a chance. Between them, the choice had always been obvious.

She'd known this was coming since the hospital. Everything had unfolded exactly as predicted.

Their marriage had been heading toward this conclusion for months. Today simply made it official.

Harrison nodded, her voice barely audible. "Okay."

Nathaniel's grip on the wheel tightened. "Name your terms for the settlement."

"I don't want anything," Harrison replied. "What you've already given me is enough."

Nathaniel produced a black card with gold embossing, holding it out to her. "Take this."

"I don't need it."

"This is for that night. And last night. You've earned it."

Harrison felt her heart constrict painfully, each breath suddenly labored.

She'd given herself to him, and now he was paying her for it.

No matter how intense their connection had seemed, to him it had always been transactional. Everything had its price.

Harrison's dark eyes locked onto his striking features as the question that had burned inside her for so long finally escaped. "Nathaniel... Did you ever have feelings for me?"
###Chapter 265

Harrison looked directly into Nathaniel's eyes. "Did you ever... feel anything for me?"

The question caught him off guard.

Yes, he had.

There had been moments when he'd imagined them together romantically.

He'd felt possessive of her - an undeniable pull that made him want to keep her close.

His feelings for Harrison were real, but they paled in comparison to his devotion to Isabella.

Now, with divorce inevitable, he was determined to make a clean break. No hesitation, no looking back.

His words hung heavy between them:

"Harrison, I'm in love with Isabella."

He said it clearly, without wavering.

The light in Harrison's eyes faded instantly. She regretted asking - the humiliation burned through her like fire.

Still, she wouldn't beg.

"Then let's end this."

Nathaniel nodded. "Bring your marriage certificate."

Her lips formed a tight smile as she reached into her bag. "I already have it."

She'd known exactly why he called. Before leaving, she'd taken the document from her dresser drawer.

Nathaniel gave her an appraising look before starting the car toward city hall. Thirty minutes later, they sat across from a clerk.

"Are you certain about this?" The clerk looked between them. "Finding someone to share your life with is rare. Maybe take more time to think?"

"No need," Nathaniel said flatly.

The clerk sighed. "Very well. Please sign here."

Harrison watched as Nathaniel picked up the pen. His signature was bold, decisive.

No hesitation. No regret.

He set the pen down.

Tears welled in Harrison's pale eyes. Her hands shook as she signed her name.

The clerk examined her paperwork. "Sweetheart, you don't have any family listed?"

The documents showed only her name. No parents. No relatives. Harrison had always been alone.

She nodded. "That's right."

With a final stamp, the clerk handed them each a certificate. "It's official. You're divorced."

Harrison took the paper silently. "Thank you."

Outside, Nathaniel asked, "Need a ride back to campus?"

She shook her head. "No. Go to the hospital. Isabella needs you."

Without another word, she turned away.

Harrison walked blindly through the streets. She didn't know how long she wandered. Hot tears blurred her vision, streaming down her face unchecked.

She'd started crying the moment her back was to him.

Always alone. Never belonging anywhere - until him.

In that cave years ago, he'd promised to take her with him. Said he wanted her by his side. She'd believed him.

While he'd doted on Isabella all these years, Harrison had grown up solitary. Walked her own path. Only to circle back to him.

She'd dreamed of taking his name. Building a home together.

For three years while he lay unconscious, she'd clung to that innocent hope. Determined to be his wife. Believing if she loved enough, it would work.

But the home she'd imagined was gone. No matter how hard she tried, they were never meant to be.

Exhaustion overwhelmed her. A sharp pain pierced her chest as her knees gave way.

She collapsed onto the sidewalk, wrapping her slender arms around her legs. Burying her tear-streaked face against her knees.

Her fragile shoulders shook with silent sobs. In that moment, Harrison let her heart break completely.
###Chapter 266

Losing Nathaniel shattered Harrison in ways she never anticipated.

She couldn't pinpoint exactly why his absence hurt so deeply. He'd never shown her kindness. Yet everyone has that one person who carves a permanent space in their heart, deserved or not.

She loved Nathaniel.

Her fingers clutched the diamond pendant he'd given her - a treasure she'd never relinquish. But her heart knew the truth.

She'd lost him.

She'd lost her protector.

At that exact moment, Nathaniel sat in his Bentley Continental, idling by the curb. Through spotless glass, he watched Harrison curled on the pavement, her shoulders shaking with violent sobs.

A crimson tint seeped into his dark irises. His knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. A dull ache spread through his chest, thick and suffocating.

His phone buzzed. Isabella.

"Nathaniel, did you finalize the divorce?" Her cheerful voice pierced the silence.

His throat tightened as his gaze remained fixed on Harrison. "Yes."

"Perfect! Come back to the hospital immediately. I want to see those papers myself."

The call ended with Isabella's satisfied hum.

Nathaniel blinked. The red haze cleared, leaving icy detachment. It was over between them.

Strangers now.

The woman he loved - the one he'd devote himself to - was Isabella.

The Bentley's engine roared as he sped toward the hospital.

Harrison dragged herself back to the dorm. Confetti rained down as she opened the door to Rosalind and Gabrielle's grinning faces.

"Congratulations! Another date with Mr. Falcon?"

Their smiles died when they saw her. Harrison's face was ghostly pale, eyes swollen and bloodshot.

"Harrison, what's wrong?"

"Your hands are freezing! Talk to us!"

She silently produced the divorce papers. "It's fine. Nathaniel and I are divorced now."

"What?"

Both girls gasped.

"Harrison, explain this! Why would you— Harrison!"

Her vision darkened. She collapsed, burning with 107°F fever. Chills and heat waves alternated as her body rebelled against the heartbreak.

The divorce had broken her completely.

Isabella's week-long hospital stay was ending, her wrist nearly healed. With Nathaniel and Victoria's constant care, her recovery progressed swiftly.

Penelope arrived bearing orchids. "Discharge date?"

Isabella's rosy cheeks dimpled. "Tomorrow." Nathaniel handed her a sliced pear. He'd transformed her room into his office, with Dominic delivering documents daily.

Isabella savored the sweet fruit and sweeter victory.

Penelope turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, I heard about the divorce." Isabella beamed. "Yes! Harrison's no longer Mrs. Falcon!"

Their families' fates were intertwined - one's gain was the other's. Plus, Penelope had always despised Harrison.

Penelope smirked. "Rumor has it Harrison fell gravely ill afterward. Missed a week of classes!"
###Chapter 267

The divorce had severed all ties between Nathaniel and Harrison. This was the first time he'd heard anything about her since.

She was gravely ill.

Isabella's lips curled into a smirk, her crimson mouth twisting with a mix of triumph, pity, and scorn. "Who would've thought Harrison loved Nathaniel so desperately?"

Penelope joined in, her voice dripping with mockery. "With her background, she'll never land another man like Mr. Falcon. Pathetic, really."

Isabella tilted her head, pouting playfully at Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, now that your ex-wife is sick, shouldn't you call her? Offer some comfort?"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his striking features as composed as ever. He met her gaze. "Sure. I'll call her right now."

His hand moved toward his phone.

Isabella's face darkened instantly. "You wouldn't dare!"

Nathaniel smirked. "Then why suggest it?"

He was only teasing—he had no intention of dialing Harrison's number.

A warm, smug satisfaction bloomed in Isabella's chest. She huffed, shooting him a playful glare.

Penelope rolled her eyes. "You two are unbearable. Should I leave so you can have your moment alone?"

Nathaniel stood. "Keep talking. I'll be back." He strode out without another word.

"Honestly, Isabella, you and Mr. Falcon are inseparable now, while Harrison's all alone."

Isabella leaned back against the headboard, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. Every sacrifice had been worth it—especially her little "accident." "Harrison never knew her place. A nobody with no education, no career... How could she ever compete with me for Nathaniel? I just put her back where she belongs."

"Keep pushing, Isabella. Get him to marry you next. Grandmother even suggested a double wedding."

Forcing Nathaniel and Harrison apart was just the beginning. Now, Isabella would make sure he put a ring on her finger.

She didn’t need Penelope’s reminder—she already had a plan.

"Why didn’t Dr. Sinclair come today?" Isabella asked.

At the mention of the doctor, Penelope flushed. "He had a major surgery. But I have good news—remember when our families each invested 150 million? Grandmother even mortgaged the estate? That money has doubled. Our family’s wealth just skyrocketed."

Isabella’s eyes gleamed. "Seriously?"

"Of course! Don’t you trust Dr. Sinclair?"

"Absolutely! He’d never lie to us."

Isabella was thrilled. The Whitmore fortune had doubled overnight. Without Harrison dragging them down, their luck had finally turned.

"How are things with you and Dr. Sinclair?" Isabella pressed.

Penelope held out her hand, flashing a dazzling diamond on her ring finger. The stone sparkled brilliantly under the light.

She grinned. "He proposed. I said yes."

Isabella’s breath caught at the sight of the massive diamond, but she wasn’t jealous. She knew Nathaniel would give her something even grander.

When Nathaniel made a move, it would leave everyone in Willowbrook green with envy.

"Isabella, we’re all just waiting for your news with Mr. Falcon. A double wedding would be the event of the year!"

Isabella nodded confidently. "Don’t worry. It’s happening soon."

Nathaniel stood in the hallway, his tall frame casting a commanding presence.

Dominic approached, clutching a stack of documents. "Mr. Falcon, these require your signature today."

Nathaniel didn’t turn, his gaze fixed on the window. "Leave them in the room."

Dominic hesitated. "Mr. Falcon, Mrs. Falcon—I mean, Ms. Harrison—"
###Chapter 268

Dominic hesitated before continuing, but Nathaniel cut him off sharply. "We're divorced. Her life is no longer my concern."

Dominic nodded. "Of course, sir." He turned and exited the room.

Isabella stepped out just then, having overheard everything. A satisfied smile curved her lips as she approached Nathaniel.

She knew how decisive he was. Once he ended things with Harrison, he would never look back.

Now, his heart belonged entirely to her. She was his future.

Isabella wrapped her arms around Nathaniel's waist from behind, pressing herself against him.

He didn't need to turn to know it was her. His gaze dropped to her slender hands clasped around him.

Her right wrist had mostly healed, but a faint scar remained—a blemish on her otherwise flawless skin. As a dancer, perfection mattered.

Nathaniel gently traced the scar. "I've arranged consultations with the best specialists abroad. They can remove it."

Isabella smirked. "No, I want to keep it."

Nathaniel turned to face her. "Why?"

"Because it's proof of my love for you," she murmured, her voice dripping with sweetness. "A reminder for you to never forget how much I've sacrificed."

She was clever. That scar would forever haunt him, a constant guilt trip for choosing Harrison over her.

Nathaniel pulled her into his arms, his grip firm. "It won't happen again."

Isabella beamed, her excitement barely contained. "So, when are we getting married?"

She was ready. She wanted the world to know she had won.

Nathaniel's expression darkened slightly. "Eleanor doesn't know about the divorce yet. Given her health, we can't rush this."

Isabella suppressed a flare of irritation. That old woman was the only thing standing between her and the title of Mrs. Falcon.

She masked her frustration, leaning against him sweetly. "Fine. But I need something else—introduce me to your mother's family. I want their approval."

The Lincolns were one of the most influential families in the capital. With their backing, even Eleanor wouldn't dare oppose her.

"Your cousin, Bebe, is the favorite, right? Introduce us. We'll be best friends," Isabella purred, fluttering her lashes.

Best friends with Bebe?

Nathaniel studied her. That would be... challenging.

Still, he didn't refuse. "I'll see what I can do."

"Thank you!" Isabella melted into his embrace, triumphant.

What did Harrison have left to compete with?

Just then, Nathaniel's phone rang—an elegant chime cutting through the silence.

It was Julian, chancellor of Westfield University.

Nathaniel answered.

"Mr. Falcon," Julian's voice came through clearly. "The Global Scholars Forum is happening soon at Willowbrook Arena. We'd like you and the freshman prodigy to deliver the closing speech."

Nathaniel paused, processing the request.

Him. And the prodigy. Together.
###Chapter 269

Nathaniel's deep voice resonated through the room. "Mr. Ashford, are you telling me the prodigy freshman will be attending the Global Scholars Forum?"

What?

The words "prodigy freshman" hit Isabella like a thunderclap, instantly seizing her focus. Was the elusive genius finally making an appearance?

"She's been right here in Willowbrook all along," Julian responded. "Though you've never crossed paths. She'll be at the Global Scholars Forum, so you'll finally meet. Make sure to clear your schedule."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Understood."

As the call ended, Isabella stood frozen. "Nathaniel, this prodigy has been in Willowbrook this whole time? Who is she?"

Willowbrook's elite circles weren't vast, yet she'd never heard whispers of such a brilliant young woman.

The existence of this mysterious freshman unsettled Isabella deeply.

Nathaniel, equally in the dark, had no answers.

The thought of this enigmatic genius intrigued him. He arched an eyebrow, curiosity piqued.

"We'll discover soon enough," he replied.

Harrison had spent seven feverish days confined to bed, lost in delirium.

On the eighth morning, clarity returned. The illness had lifted completely.

Rosalind and Gabrielle rushed to her side. "Harrison, you gave us such a scare."

Harrison pushed open the window. Golden sunlight bathed her slender frame as she inhaled deeply, then flashed a playful grin.

"Relax, girls. I'm perfectly fine now."

She'd healed herself.

Life had returned to her eyes. Though the process of breaking and rebuilding had been agonizing, she'd emerged whole.

She'd accepted Nathaniel's rejection, carving him from her heart with excruciating precision.

No regrets remained.

She'd loved fiercely, throwing herself into flames that nearly consumed her.

And so, she walked away unburdened.

Rosalind and Gabrielle cheered.

"We knew you wouldn't let any man destroy you!"

"Single and ready to conquer the world! Forget Nathaniel!"

Harrison slung an arm around each friend. "Exactly. That chapter's closed. Nathaniel who?"

Their laughter filled the room.

Soon after, Harrison returned to classes. Alistair Whitmore's lecture was in session.

While Alistair taught, Harrison drowsed at her desk, head pillowed on folded arms. Noticing her apparent disinterest, Alistair shook his head. She clearly didn't deserve someone of Nathaniel's caliber. Little did he know his perception would soon undergo a seismic shift.

Alistair continued expounding on ancient medical texts when Harrison suddenly stirred. Her sharp gaze locked onto him as she raised a hand, summoning him over.

Alistair hesitated. Now what?

He approached warily.

Harrison met his eyes squarely. "You made an error earlier."

What?

Alistair stiffened. As a titan in medical academia, no student had ever dared correct him.

"Impossible," he scoffed.

Harrison sat upright, posture perfect. "Check 'Classic of Herbal Medicine,' Volume 10, page 4008. The mistake is undeniable."
###Chapter 270

Harrison's expression turned grave. "As doctors, precision is everything. The smallest oversight could cost lives."

Alistair stood towering over her seated form. Yet despite the height difference, her posture remained impeccable - spine straight as an arrow. Those sharp, intelligent eyes bored into his with unwavering intensity as she lectured him, their dynamic oddly reversed.

Alistair was rendered speechless.

Was this student actually trying to teach him? He had only ever acknowledged one mentor - the legendary Dr. Sinclair!

Just as he opened his mouth to reprimand her, Harrison cut him off. "That will be all, Alistair."

His jaw clenched at her casual use of his first name. Without another word, he turned on his heel and stormed out.

Back in his office, Alistair fumed. There was no possible way he could have made a mistake!

He yanked the "Compendium of Medicinal Herbs" from his shelf, flipping furiously to the referenced page. His fingers froze mid-turn.

She was right. The error glared up at him in printed ink.

"How...?" he whispered, stunned.

The department chair chose that moment to enter. "Professor Whitmore? Is everything alright?"

Alistair ran a hand through his hair. "There's a student... sleeps through entire lectures, then wakes up just to correct me. What would you make of that?"

The older man chuckled. "Sounds like you've encountered a prodigy."

A prodigy? Harrison?

Alistair's mind reeled.

As class dismissed, Harrison's phone buzzed. Julian from Westfield University.

She answered to immediate excitement. "The Global Scholars Forum is coming up! You and Nathaniel need to make a joint appearance."

"Harrison, you've been at Willowridge all this time. I'm shocked Mr. Falcon doesn't even recognize you," Julian mused.

A smirk played on her lips. "Oh, I know him. He just doesn't know me."

"Well, this forum will change that. Time he learns exactly who you are."

She had signed those divorce papers months ago. Their connection was severed. Strangers now.

Still... perhaps it was time for Nathaniel to meet the real Harrison. "Agreed," she said simply.

That evening at The Velvet Lounge's VIP section, Sebastian practically vibrated with excitement. "Nathaniel, is it true? The prodigy freshman is actually coming?"

Nathaniel lounged at the center booth, his black ensemble blending with the shadows. Isabella perched beside him, Arabella nearby.

Watching Sebastian's enthusiasm, Isabella's smile tightened. She knew exactly which "prodigy" had captured his attention.

The other heirs laughed. "Sebastian's finally found his match!"

"Never seen him this worked up over a woman before."

As chatter about the mysterious freshman dominated the room, Isabella forced a light laugh. "Online infatuations are so fickle. For all we know, this academic superstar could be... underwhelming in person. Some women overcompensate with intellect when they lack other... assets."
###Chapter 271

Arabella instantly jumped in. "Isabella's right! That prodigy freshman might be hideous and obese. Your fantasy will collapse the moment you lay eyes on her."

Isabella and Arabella both began mocking the genius freshman, clearly trying to provoke a reaction.

Sebastian, however, remained unbothered. "I've encountered plenty of beautiful women, and none of them intrigue me. Even if this freshman isn't remarkable, my feelings won't change. Marrying her would elevate my family's lineage."

Isabella and Arabella gaped at his response.

It was clear Sebastian had fixated on this prodigy, and nothing would deter him now.

The other wealthy heirs around them snickered. "Sebastian, are you even sure she's available?"

Sebastian had no clue who the genius freshman was. Earlier, he'd tagged her in a group chat, asking if she was single. Her reply had been blunt: [Get lost.]

He immediately grabbed his phone. "I'll message her right now."

The others leaned in eagerly. "Hurry up, hurry up!"

Sebastian opened the group chat and tagged H. [How about I introduce you to a boyfriend? Tall, handsome, and completely obsessed with you.]

He hit send. But after several minutes, there was no response.

The heirs burst into laughter. "Unbelievable! She actually ignored you! Other girls used to reply within seconds."

Sebastian scowled. "Shut up! She probably hasn't seen it yet."

Just then, Julian shared some documents and tagged Nathaniel and H in the chat. [Here are the files for the Global Scholars Forum. Review them when you can.]

Nathaniel lounged lazily on the couch, silent. The commotion from Sebastian's group didn't concern him.

He glanced at Julian's message and replied with a single word: [Got it.]

Almost instantly, H also responded: [Got it.]

Sebastian's jaw dropped.

It felt like a direct slap to his pride.

"Ha! Sebastian, you said she didn't see your message. Turns out she's just ignoring you!"

Sebastian clenched his phone and tagged H again. [Why didn’t you reply to me?]

At that moment, Harrison and Rosalind had just arrived at The Velvet Lounge. Harrison noticed Sebastian had tagged her again.

What nonsense was he spouting now?

She typed a two-word response.

Sebastian read it: [I did.]

She claimed she'd replied.

The entire VIP section erupted in laughter. The heirs were doubled over, clutching their stomachs.

"The freshman said she replied—apparently, silence counts as a response!"

"Read but no reply? That's rejection, Sebastian."

Sebastian laughed bitterly. He'd dated countless women, but this genius freshman was the most challenging yet. It only fueled his determination.

He kicked the guy beside him. "Stop laughing! I'll win her over eventually."

"Who even is this prodigy? We've never heard of anyone like her in Willowbrook."

"The Global Scholars Forum is where Nathaniel and this freshman will finally collaborate. We can't wait to see it."

Isabella, seated on the couch, listened with growing irritation. Normally, she and Nathaniel were the power couple of their circle. Now, all the attention was on Nathaniel and this freshman—especially with their first public appearance together.
###Chapter 272

All eyes were drawn to the power couple, their presence eclipsing everything else in the room.

Isabella's chest burned with envy, her resentment toward the brilliant freshman growing deeper by the second.

"Look!" Arabella suddenly gasped. "Harrison's here!"

Nathaniel had been nursing his drink all evening, indifferent to the festivities. But at Arabella's words, his sharp gaze lifted, gleaming with sudden interest.

There she was.

Harrison wore a sleek black sleeveless dress that hugged her slender frame perfectly. The flared skirt accentuated her long, porcelain legs as she entered, immediately commanding attention.

Her raven hair cascaded down her back like silk, a sweater draped carelessly over her arms. From his vantage point, Nathaniel could only see her profile - delicate features appearing even more petite, her luminous skin giving her an almost ethereal glow.

That aura was uniquely hers. No one in Willowbrook could compare.

Isabella spotted Harrison too, her eyes lighting up with malicious delight.

She'd always viewed the prodigious freshman as competition, seething with jealousy. But seeing this country girl now filled her with overwhelming superiority.

"I heard Harrison was terribly ill recently," she said sweetly. "Seems she's recovered."

Arabella scoffed. "Nathaniel's wanted a divorce for ages. Honestly, he's done her a favor by waiting this long. Pathetic that she got sick over it."

Sebastian, who'd never liked Harrison, watched her closely. "Well, it's official now. They're divorced. Nathaniel, when do we get to celebrate your wedding with Isabella?"

The wealthy socialites around them began teasing. "Guess we should start calling her Mrs. Falcon now."

Isabella beamed with pride.

Nathaniel's gaze flickered to Harrison, his expression unreadable. He turned away abruptly, draining his glass in one swift motion.

Harrison had come to The Velvet Lounge with Rosalind to unwind. After a couple drinks, she excused herself to the restroom.

In the hallway, a figure suddenly blocked her path.

Harrison looked up to see Isabella standing before her.

Isabella's lips curled into a saccharine smile. "Harrison, I heard you took the divorce quite hard. Feeling better now?"

Harrison's gaze turned glacial. "We're not friends, Isabella. Say what you want and leave."

Isabella held up an expensive handbag, smirking. "Limited edition. Nathaniel took me shopping for it."

Harrison arched a brow. "And?"

"This isn't for me," Isabella purred, her smile widening. "It's a gift for Bebe Whitmore."

Harrison remained silent. She knew the Whitmores were Nathaniel's maternal relatives, though he'd never introduced her to them.

She waited, expressionless, for Isabella to continue.

Isabella studied Harrison's face hungrily. "Eleanor may like you, I'll admit that. But Nathaniel plans to introduce me to Bebe, to the entire Whitmore family. We're getting married, Harrison. It's happening."

Just then, a tall, commanding figure appeared. Nathaniel had arrived.

Isabella immediately latched onto his arm. "Nathaniel, darling, I was just telling Harrison about our wedding plans."
###Chapter 273

Harrison stood motionless, her piercing gaze fixed on Nathaniel.

Nathaniel shot her an icy look before turning to Isabella, his voice softening. "Let's go home."

He had just confirmed it—right in front of Harrison.

Isabella smiled sweetly, knowing Harrison's heart must be seething with envy and resentment. The country girl was surely suffering now.

"Alright."

Isabella looped her arm through Nathaniel's, preparing to leave with him.

Just as they turned, Harrison's clear voice stopped them. "Nathaniel."

She called his name.

Nathaniel halted and turned back.

Isabella smirked. "Harrison, you're divorced now. Still clinging to Nathaniel? Trying to win him back?"

Harrison stood tall in the hallway, spine straight as an arrow. She ignored Isabella, her crystal-clear eyes locked on Nathaniel's aristocratic features.

Her voice was soft but unshakable. "Nathaniel, I loved you!"

Their gazes met.

Harrison's melodic voice carried conviction. "Loving someone with all your heart isn't shameful. But it shouldn't excuse how you treated me. I once loved you truly. Not anymore."

She didn't love Nathaniel now.

Nathaniel's imposing frame stiffened slightly.

Harrison stepped forward, long legs closing the distance between them.

Her tone remained steady. "We're divorced. Just exes now. Decent exes pretend not to recognize each other in public. Better yet, act like we're dead to each other. So control your current girlfriend. Don't parade her in front of me. I'm your ex-wife, not your mother. Marry, have kids—none of my business. I don't care."

Isabella's face flushed crimson. She'd come to gloat, to see Harrison suffer. Instead, Harrison approached with calm dignity, turning the tables.

Isabella snapped, "Harrison, how dare you—"

Harrison stopped before them, lips curling in a cold smile. Her sharp eyes pinned Isabella. "What exactly are you boasting about? Mrs. Falcon was a title I discarded. Nathaniel's a man I've already had. You're proud of taking leftovers? Never seen such a shameless rebound."

Isabella was speechless.

Fury tightened her chest. Since when did Harrison become so razor-tongued?

Without another word, Harrison turned to leave.

Then Sebastian appeared.

He stepped forward. "Harrison, Nathaniel divorced you! Why keep showing up? How shameless can—"

"And you, Sebastian!" Harrison cut him off sharply. "Lower your voice when speaking to me. Or I'll tell everyone how you dropped from champion to bronze after I beat you in that mobile game. They'll all laugh at you!"

Sebastian froze, then snapped, "Harrison, you viper!"

Harrison gave him a once-over. "This isn't even my worst. Keep bothering me, and next time I'll demote you from bronze to complete trash."

What?

Sebastian nearly choked.

Harrison didn't spare them another glance. She walked away with effortless grace.

Sebastian fumed. "Nathaniel, look at her!"

Isabella was equally livid. "Nathaniel, did you hear her?"
###Chapter 274

The crowd had hoped to witness Harrison's humiliation. Instead, she'd turned the tables spectacularly. Their stunned silence spoke volumes.

Nathaniel's gaze followed Harrison's retreating figure, his expression inscrutable. His jaw tightened imperceptibly before he spoke in a controlled tone. "That's enough."

Isabella's anger simmered beneath a carefully constructed calm. She forced herself to focus on her objective.

"Nathaniel, you promised to introduce me to Rosalind tonight. Where is she?"

Marrying Nathaniel remained her top priority.

Spotting Rosalind nearby, Nathaniel murmured, "I'll handle it."

Isabella immediately thrust forward an exclusive designer purse. "Give her this. It's the limited edition she wanted."

Meanwhile, Rosalind grew concerned about Harrison's prolonged absence. She rose to search for her friend.

"Nathaniel intercepted her. "Rosalind."

She deliberately turned away.

He blocked her path. "Since when do you ignore family?"

As Alistair Whitmore's daughter using her mother's surname, Rosalind's true identity remained unknown to Isabella and Arabella.

Born late in Alistair's life with a distinctive facial birthmark, Rosalind had been doted on by both the Whitmore family and Nathaniel.

Her glare could have melted steel. "How could you treat Harrison like that? After your divorce, she ran a 107-degree fever for a week! She cried in her sleep-"

Nathaniel's sharp interruption cut through her words. "Enough! I won't discuss her."

Rosalind fell silent.

His voice turned glacial. "We're divorced. Her name doesn't belong in our conversations."

Rosalind recoiled at his callousness.

Nathaniel extended the designer bag.

She eyed it suspiciously. "What's this?"

"Isabella's gift."

Rosalind shoved it back violently. "Keep your mistress's bribes! I want nothing from that homewrecker!"

Nathaniel's frown deepened. "Rosalind, behave. Isabella's making efforts to befriend you. Meet her halfway."

"Befriend Isabella?" Rosalind scoffed. "Her pathetic attempts mean nothing to me. I'll never accept someone like her."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "We're getting married. She'll be family."

Rosalind's eyes widened. "You're marrying her right after divorcing Harrison?"

Isabella had always been the intended bride. Harrison was merely an interlude during Nathaniel's coma.

"Yes." His confirmation held finality.

After a tense silence, Rosalind extended her hand. "Fine. Give it here."

As Nathaniel complied, she added coldly, "If she's becoming family, I'll tolerate her presence. Nothing more."
###Chapter 275

Nathaniel's stern expression softened slightly.

Rosalind held up the designer bag with a satisfied smile. "I adore this gift. To show my appreciation, I'd like to invite Isabella to the Whitmore estate tomorrow."

Hearing the invitation, Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Fine."

Once he left, Harrison returned, slightly breathless. "Sorry I took so long."

Rosalind linked arms with her. "I was just about to go looking for you."

Harrison grinned. "Let's grab some food. I'm starving."

"Perfect. My treat," Rosalind offered.

Harrison immediately stopped her, pulling out a sleek black card with gold embossing. "Not a chance. Tonight, I'm paying." She waved the card triumphantly. "This is from Nathaniel—part of the divorce settlement. From now on, his money funds my fun."

Rosalind's eyes sparkled with approval. "That's the spirit! If you don't spend it, Isabella will."

Harrison studied the card thoughtfully. "How much do you think is on here?"

Rosalind smirked. "No idea. But I say we test it—tomorrow, let's buy a penthouse."

Harrison winked. "Think bigger. Let's get a private jet instead."

Nathaniel relayed Rosalind's invitation to Isabella, whose face lit up with excitement.

Arabella clapped her hands. "This is incredible! The Whitmore heiress loved your gift and invited you to their estate!"

Isabella hadn't expected such quick success. Winning over the Whitmore family's darling was a major victory. With their support, her future as Nathaniel's wife was practically secured.

Sebastian soon called Nathaniel away, leaving Isabella and Arabella alone.

"You should come with me tomorrow," Isabella said.

Arabella hesitated. "Are you sure? I'm not exactly family."

"Of course! Once we're all friends, we'll be inseparable."

Arabella beamed. "Sounds perfect!"

As they chatted, they spotted Harrison and Rosalind leaving the restaurant.

"Isn't that Rosalind? Since when does Harrison hang out with her?" Isabella sneered.

Arabella scoffed. "Well, Harrison can't compete with you. While you charm the Whitmores, she's stuck with that nobody."

Isabella covered her mouth, laughing. "They really do deserve each other."

Then Arabella leaned in. "Speaking of money—since you're marrying Nathaniel, you should get his supplementary card."

"His what?"

"It's linked to his main account. Unlimited access to the Falcon fortune."

Isabella's pulse quickened. She hadn't known about this, but now she wanted it.

"Why hasn't he offered it yet?" she mused.

Arabella smirked. "A man's money follows his heart. He'll give it to you without asking—just wait."

Isabella smiled smugly. "Exactly. I won't beg. He'll come to me."
###Chapter 276

"Arabella, you certainly have a way with words."

After bidding farewell to Sebastian and Arabella, Nathaniel and Isabella exited The Velvet Lounge.

"I'll arrange for a car to take you home," Nathaniel offered.

Isabella tilted her chin up, her delicate features illuminated by the streetlights as she gazed at him. "I don't want to go home tonight. I'd rather go to Rosewood Manor."

After careful consideration, Isabella realized she'd been too restrained. She refused to wait until marriage to become intimate with Nathaniel.

Nathaniel was a man with normal desires. If those needs went unmet, other women could easily tempt him.

That's how Harrison had slipped into his life, exploiting a crack in their relationship to climb into his bed.

Tonight, Isabella was determined to visit Rosewood Manor, extending a bold invitation.

Seeing Isabella's flushed cheeks, Nathaniel pressed his lips together. "Not tonight. I have urgent work at the office. I'll have someone drive you home. Behave yourself."

Disappointment flashed across Isabella's face. "Fine. See you soon!" She climbed into the waiting car and departed.

Dominic opened the rear door of the Rolls-Royce, and Nathaniel settled inside. As the luxury vehicle glided through the city, he reviewed documents in the backseat. His phone buzzed with multiple notifications.

Unlocking the screen, he saw a series of alerts regarding the platinum-embossed black card.

[Dear VVIP member, your card ending in 7777 was charged $190.00 at The Velvet Lounge.]

[Dear VVIP member, your card ending in 7777 was charged $5.00 at Benny's Bistro.]

[Dear VVIP member, your card ending in 7777 was charged $1.99 at Benny's Bistro.]

Harrison and Rosalind had visited the food market. Every purchase Harrison made triggered alerts to Nathaniel's phone.

The amounts were insignificant - $5, $1.99, even 99 cents.

She'd bought a custard pudding.

Nathaniel studied the transactions, his lips curling into a faint smirk.

Suddenly, her clear voice echoed in his memory. "Nathaniel, I don't love you anymore."

She claimed she no longer loved him.

Women like Harrison loved and hated with equal intensity. When they loved, it burned like the midday sun.

She had loved him that way.

But once she turned away, there was no return.

She didn't love him anymore.

Nathaniel set his phone aside. He wouldn't call what he felt for Harrison love, yet inexplicably, a vague sense of loss settled in his chest.

At the university dorm, Harrison awoke to find Rosalind missing. Puzzled, she glanced around the empty room.

"Rosalind? Rosalind?"

After searching the suite, she noticed a handwritten note on the desk in Rosalind's neat script.

[Harrison, don't worry. I've gone home for the day.]

Rosalind had returned home.

Harrison realized she didn't even know where Rosalind's home was. Despite their long friendship, Rosalind's family never visited, and she never spoke of them. Harrison had respected that boundary.

True friendship required comfortable distance.

Folding the note carefully, Harrison tucked it away.

Her phone chimed with a new message.

It was from Oliver. [The medicinal herb you requested has arrived.]

Harrison's eyes brightened. The crucial ingredient was finally here! There was hope for removing Rosalind's birthmark after all.
###Chapter 277

Rosalind stepped through the grand gates of the Whitmore estate, where Beatrice Langley, the head maid, stood waiting with a warm smile.

"Miss Rosalind, welcome home," she greeted, her voice filled with genuine affection.

Rosalind had been born with a distinctive birthmark across her cheek—something that had earned her cruel nicknames like "Patchface" and "Freak" growing up. But unlike others who might have crumbled under such ridicule, Rosalind carried herself with unshakable confidence. It was this resilience that made her the darling of the Whitmore household, adored by both family and staff alike.

She grinned and pulled Beatrice into a quick embrace. "It's good to be back! And guess what? I've invited two special guests today."

Her tone was light, but there was a spark of mischief in her eyes.

Beatrice brightened. "Friends of yours? I'm so glad you're making connections outside the family."

Just then, a sleek black limousine rolled up the driveway. The doors opened, and out stepped Isabella and Arabella—Rosalind's so-called "guests."

Rosalind's lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. Speak of the devils.

This was Isabella and Arabella's first time stepping foot on Whitmore property. Both had dressed meticulously, eager to impress the elusive Bebe Whitmore.

"Arabella, what do you think Bebe looks like?" Isabella whispered, excitement lacing her voice.

Arabella smirked. "Does it matter? She clearly has excellent taste if she invited you."

Isabella preened—until her gaze landed on Rosalind.

Her face twisted in shock. "Rosalind? What the hell are you doing here?"

Arabella's jaw dropped. "This is the Whitmore estate! How did you get in?"

Neither had expected to see Rosalind standing so casually on the grounds of one of the wealthiest families in the country.

Beatrice moved to intervene, but Rosalind held up a hand, stopping her. She turned to the two girls with a lazy smirk. "Yep, this is the Whitmore estate. Care to guess why I'm here?"

Isabella narrowed her eyes. "Are you...?"

Rosalind tilted her head. "Am I what?"

Isabella glanced at Beatrice, then back at Rosalind, realization dawning. "Oh my God. Is your mother the maid?"

Beatrice's expression darkened. "Excuse me—"

Rosalind stepped smoothly in front of her, silencing the protest with a subtle shake of her head.

Arabella burst into laughter. "Hah! So your mom cleans for the Whitmores? No wonder you never mentioned it!"

Isabella sneered. "Rosalind, I almost feel bad for you. Born ugly and raised by a servant? Maybe we should start a charity to fix that hideous mark on your face. Honestly, it's disgusting."

"No wonder the only person who tolerates you is Harrison. Who else would bother with someone like you?"

The insults came fast and vicious, each one sharper than the last.

Beatrice trembled with barely contained fury. She had assumed these girls were Rosalind's friends—but now it was clear they were nothing more than vipers. If Rosalind hadn't been blocking her, she would have already summoned security.

But Rosalind? She didn't even flinch. Instead, she crossed her arms and smirked. "So, what brings you two here?"

Isabella immediately puffed up with pride. "You’ve heard of Bebe Whitmore, right? The youngest heiress? She invited us."

Rosalind gasped dramatically, pressing a hand to her chest. "Bebe invited you? To the Whitmore estate?"

Isabella and Arabella exchanged smug glances, practically glowing with self-satisfaction.

"Jealous?" Arabella taunted. "Bebe is the Whitmores' golden child—their treasure. And she chose us to visit."
###Chapter 278

"Ha! We're here to see Rosalind, while you're stuck with that nobody Harrison. How sad," Arabella taunted Beatrice.

Eleanor nearly choked on her own disbelief at the ridiculous comment.

Beatrice flashed a dazzling smile.

"Oh absolutely, I'm so jealous you get to spend time with Rosalind," she purred with exaggerated sweetness.

Arabella snorted. "Isabella, let's not waste another second on this loser. Rosalind's waiting inside."

Isabella had no intention of lingering either. "Right. Let her stew in envy. Come on."

They strutted past Beatrice, their noses practically touching the ceiling.

Eleanor couldn't suppress a laugh. "They still don't have a clue who you really are."

Beatrice arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow, her grin turning wicked. "Don't worry. I'll make sure this becomes unforgettable."

As Isabella and Arabella entered the grand parlor, Isabella felt like she'd stepped into a fairy tale. She was finally inside the Whitmore estate.

Her ambitions were within reach.

A uniformed maid approached them. "Young misses, please make yourselves comfortable. Ms. Whitmore is finishing her preparations upstairs."

"Of course, thank you," Isabella replied smoothly, settling onto the plush sofa beside Arabella. She'd rehearsed this moment countless times. Every compliment, every carefully crafted remark was ready to charm Rosalind into becoming her most powerful ally.

"Ms. Whitmore is descending now," the maid announced.

Isabella and Arabella sprang to their feet, their eager faces turning toward the grand staircase.

Then their expressions shattered.

Beatrice, now draped in an exquisite designer gown, descended the stairs with regal grace, her piercing gaze locking onto their horrified faces.

Their complexions turned ashen. "Beatrice? What are you—"

She glided toward them, lips curling in amusement as she winked. "What do you think I'm doing here?"

Isabella's voice trembled. "We're here to see Rosalind. Why would you—"

The realization hit them like a thunderbolt.

They'd come to meet Rosalind. Yet here stood Beatrice... which could only mean one impossible thing.

Arabella's hands flew to her mouth. "No... you're Rosalind?"

Their widened eyes reflected utter shock. The girl they'd mocked as a nobody was actually the Whitmore heiress.

Impossible!

Isabella refused to accept it. "This is some sick joke! You're just some—"

"Enough!"

Eleanor's sharp command sliced through the air like a whip.

Suddenly, a squad of armed guards flooded the room, surrounding the stunned girls with military precision.

Beatrice casually circled them and settled onto the velvet chaise lounge like a queen holding court.

Eleanor's glare could have frozen lava. "You insolent brats! How dare you disrespect Ms. Beatrice! One more word and you'll be thrown out like the trash you are!"

The terrified girls watched as a maid presented Beatrice with a porcelain teacup. She took a delicate sip before fixing them with a predatory smile.

"You came to see Rosalind, didn't you? Well... surprise. You're looking at her."
###Chapter 279
Rosalind dropped the act. She revealed her true identity—she was actually Bebe.

Rosalind was Bebe?

Isabella's mind went numb. The revelation hit her like a physical blow, leaving her frozen in shock.

Rosalind—the plain, unassuming girl—was the elusive Bebe they had been searching for?

She and Arabella had combed through every notable student at Willowridge University, only to discover their target had been right in front of them the entire time.

It felt like fate was mocking her. Isabella couldn't process it.

Beside her, Arabella stood rigid, equally stunned.

Rosalind smirked. "Isabella, Nathaniel mentioned how desperate you were to befriend me. You were so talkative earlier, but now? Nothing to say?"

She reclined on the sofa, Beatrice and the bodyguards standing like sentinels behind her. Her amused gaze traced the humiliation twisting Isabella's expression.

Isabella clenched her fists, her nails biting into her palms.

She remembered every word she'd spoken outside the estate gates—how foolish she must have sounded. Rosalind had played her perfectly, letting her humiliate herself.

"B-Bebe, I—" Arabella stammered, trying to interject.

Rosalind shot her a sharp look. "I wasn't speaking to you. Do you honestly think you have the right to interrupt?"

Arabella snapped her mouth shut.

Beatrice scoffed. "Your father is nothing but a minor branch of the Falcon family. Years ago, he begged Mr. Falcon for help, and only then was he given a scrap of opportunity. You're clever, though—pretending devotion to Mrs. Eleanor to climb higher. But you're still just a nobody who got lucky. What gives you the right to address the daughter of the Whitmores?"

Her words stripped Arabella bare, exposing her weak lineage. Arabella's face paled to ash.

Rosalind turned back to Isabella. "Oh, Isabella—about that limited-edition bag you gave me last night..."

Beatrice handed it over. Rosalind examined it with disinterest before flicking her wrist, sending it sailing into the trash.

Isabella stood motionless, stunned.

Rosalind's gaze turned icy. "Isabella, Nathaniel may have feelings for you. He may even want to marry you. But that's his business, not mine. In my eyes, Harrison is the only one I'll ever acknowledge as my cousin-in-law. You? You'll never take her place. If you thought cozying up to me would be your shortcut, you're sorely mistaken."

Isabella's face drained of color. This wasn't just rejection—it was a direct blockade to her ambitions.

Eleanor already despised her. If the Whitmores refused to accept her, how could she ever become Mrs. Falcon?

And now, Bebe was openly declaring Harrison as the rightful wife. The humiliation burned.

"B-Bebe, there must be some misunderstanding! Harrison must have poisoned you against me—let me explain—" Isabella scrambled to salvage the situation, desperation clawing at her voice.

Rosalind cut her off with a mocking laugh. "Isabella, do you know why I invited you here today?"

Isabella had no answer.

"Because Nathaniel told me how badly you wanted to suck up to me. I wanted to see just how low you'd stoop to flatter someone. And wow—you didn't disappoint."

She slow-clapped, each clap a slap to Isabella's pride.

Isabella trembled, her dignity in ruins.

"Get them out of here," Beatrice ordered.

The bodyguards moved instantly, seizing Isabella and Arabella.

"Let go of me! Rosalind, I'm the one Nathaniel loves! If you dare lay a hand on me—!" Isabella shrieked, invoking Nathaniel's name like a shield.
###Chapter 280

Rosalind rose to her feet, completely unbothered. "Isabella, let me make this clear: this is my domain, not the Falcon family's. Someone remove them immediately!"

"Right away!"

Before Isabella and Arabella could even react, there was a loud thud as they were unceremoniously tossed out. They landed in an undignified heap on the pavement outside, their humiliation complete.

Beatrice cackled with cruel amusement while Rosalind smirked, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She had promised to give them an unforgettable experience.

How dare they target Harrison, her closest friend? Did they really think no one would stand up for her?

After Harrison's recent illness, Rosalind had been waiting for the perfect moment to retaliate. And now, she had delivered the most satisfying revenge possible.

Outside, Isabella and Arabella scrambled to their feet, stunned by how quickly their situation had deteriorated. They never expected to be thrown out of the Whitmore estate.

Rosalind was infuriating! Anyone associated with Harrison was clearly trouble.

"Isabella, Rosalind is completely on Harrison's side. What do we do now?" Arabella asked, frustration lacing her voice.

Isabella's expression darkened with vengeance. She wasn't about to let this go. "We retreat for now," she muttered, her anger simmering.

As they turned to leave, the sky suddenly opened up, drenching them in cold rain.

Isabella felt like the universe was mocking her. First, she'd been humiliated, and now she was getting soaked.

Just then, a sleek black car pulled up beside them. The window rolled down, and the driver called out, "Ms. Arabella? My employer would like to offer you a ride."

His employer? Who could that be?

Arabella opened the door and climbed in, pulling Isabella with her. As they settled into the plush seats, they found themselves face-to-face with Julian Blackwood.

Julian was the heir of the Blackwood family, the most sought-after bachelor at Willowridge University. Not only was he the star of the basketball team, but he was also the object of countless admirers' affections.

Arabella hadn't expected to see Julian. She barely knew him, having always been focused on Alexander. Still, they were both campus royalty—him the heartthrob, her the reigning beauty.

Arabella was always careful about her image around men. With her delicate features and striking figure, she was every man's fantasy. She flashed Julian a sweet smile. "Thank you, Julian."

Julian returned her smile effortlessly, his charm undeniable. "No trouble at all, Arabella."

He handed her a towel. "You're drenched. Here, dry yourself off."

"Appreciate it."

Isabella studied Julian closely, her eyes gleaming with realization. If she remembered correctly, Julian was engaged to Rosalind.

The Whitmore and Blackwood families had a long-standing marriage agreement. Rosalind, the Whitmore heiress, was promised to Julian, the Blackwood heir.

Yet Julian's attention was entirely fixed on Arabella, his gaze warm and unmistakably interested. Isabella smirked to herself.

Just then, Julian's phone rang with a melodic chime. He answered, and Rosalind's excited voice immediately filled the car. "Julian, don't forget our movie tonight at seven!"

Julian pressed his lips together, replying calmly, "Got it," before ending the call.

Isabella noted everything. A plan was already forming in her mind.

Soon, the car arrived at Willowridge University. Isabella and Arabella stepped out.

"Thanks again, Julian," Arabella said sweetly.

Julian smiled. "Anytime."

As the car drove off, Isabella grabbed Arabella's arm.

"Arabella, didn't you notice? Julian is clearly into you!"

Arabella frowned. "But he's engaged to Rosalind."

"Rosalind looks down on you, doesn't she? Why not steal her fiancé? Wouldn't that be the ultimate revenge?" Isabella suggested, her voice dripping with malice.
###Chapter 281

Arabella hesitated for a brief moment. Truthfully, she hadn't considered this possibility before.

"Isabella, I'm in love with Alexander—"

"Arabella, stop waiting for Alexander," Isabella cut in sharply. "His engagement to Lucille Jenner is already finalized. The union between the Graves and Jenner families is set in stone. You need to move on quickly."

Isabella leaned closer. "The Blackwood family is among the most influential in Willowbrook. Julian comes from excellent lineage with impeccable character. He's the chosen husband for Rosalind Fairchild. If you can steal him away, you'll become a Blackwood!"

Isabella wasn't wrong. Alexander was about to marry. Though Arabella still carried a torch for him, she couldn't waste her prime years pining after an unavailable man.

As a distant relative of the Falcon family, Arabella had just suffered humiliation from Beatrice. She desperately needed to secure a good match.

Julian appeared to be her best option now.

Being selected by the Whitmore family meant Julian was exceptional in every aspect.

Stealing Julian away would be perfect revenge against Harrison—she could finally hold her head high.

`She, a mere Falcon cousin, could still snatch the fiancé of the Whitmore heiress!

Isabella smirked. "Who would've thought Julian's fiancée would be such an eyesore! What man would choose her over a beauty like you? Arabella, I'm certain Julian fancies you."

Arabella had a gift for reading men. That single glance Julian gave her in the car earlier spoke volumes—he was interested.

Rosalind, that plain girl, didn't stand a chance against her.

As the reigning queen of Willowridge University's dance department, adored by countless admirers, winning Julian over would be child's play.

Arabella nodded decisively. "Very well, Isabella. Expect good news soon."

"Rosalind's waiting for Julian to take her to the movies tonight. This is your moment, Arabella."

A blush crept across Arabella's cheeks as she flashed a confident thumbs-up.

Meanwhile, Rosalind returned to the girls' dormitory. She hadn't mentioned her confrontation with Isabella and Arabella to Harrison, who remained unaware of the incident.

Rosalind changed into an elegant dress, twirling before Harrison. "Harrison, do you think Julian will like this dress for our date?"

Harrison was busy writing a prescription. Glancing up at Rosalind's radiant, excited smile, she nodded. "He'll absolutely adore it."

Rosalind decided to wear the dress and began preparing for the evening.

Harrison had recently learned about Julian being Rosalind's fiancé. "Rosalind, why did you choose Julian?"

"I've had this birthmark since childhood. Everyone mocked my appearance, except him. He was the only one who called me beautiful and made me feel valued. Later, he confessed his love, and we got engaged."

Harrison recalled seeing Julian once during a basketball game—surrounded by adoring female fans, his warmth and handsome features undeniable.

Nodding, Harrison approached Rosalind. Gently, she covered Rosalind's left cheek, concealing the birthmark.

Instantly, Rosalind's true beauty emerged—delicate features framed by large, expressive eyes that radiated gentleness and charm.

Without the birthmark, Rosalind could have easily captivated countless suitors.

"Harrison, it's almost time. I should leave now." Fully prepared, Rosalind stood, grabbed her purse, and headed for the door.

Harrison waved with an encouraging smile. "Enjoy your evening!"

Julian had arrived at Willowridge University, preparing to meet Rosalind for their cinema date.

The rain continued pouring as his luxury car remained parked some distance away. He steeled himself to brave the downpour.

Just as he stepped forward, a pink umbrella suddenly appeared above his head.
###Chapter 282

Julian spun around to find Arabella standing there, her youthful face glowing with mischief.

"Arabella? What are you doing here?"

She wore a crisp white blouse tucked into navy shorts that hugged her curves perfectly. With a playful grin, she said, "Julian, let me hitch a ride in your car to avoid the rain. Now I'm repaying the favor by being your umbrella girl. Fair trade, don't you think?"

He chuckled low in his throat.

"You've got a date, right?" Arabella teased, holding out the umbrella. "Here, take this. I'll be on my way."

As she turned to leave, her ankle twisted sharply with an audible snap. A pained gasp escaped her lips.

Julian was at her side instantly. "Arabella, are you hurt?"

Tears welled in her large eyes as she bit her lip. "I think I sprained it. It really hurts..."

"I'll carry you to the clinic," Julian declared, already scooping her into his arms. Arabella gazed up at his chiseled features. "But your date..."

His lips quirked into a smirk. "You're more important."

A blush crept up Arabella's neck. "Then could you take me to the dance studio instead? I have some pain relief cream there."

Julian adjusted his grip and started walking. Arabella studied his profile. "Julian, when did you first notice me?"

He considered this. "That intercollegiate basketball tournament at Willowridge University. I was team captain, you were leading the cheer squad. When you came out for the halftime performance, I couldn't look away. But you seemed... uninterested in the guys on campus."

Arabella had always been head cheerleader. That day, her skimpy uniform showcased every bounce as she executed complicated routines, driving the crowd wild with her energy and... other assets.

That's when Julian first noticed her. How could he not, when every guy around him kept whispering about the dance department's most stunning girl?

Willowridge's dance program boasted two legendary features - Arabella's chest and Cassandra's hips - both lethal weapons against male concentration.

Warmth spread through Arabella's chest. So Julian had liked her back then. But her heart had belonged to Alexander at the time.

A deafening thunderclap split the sky.

"Ah!" Arabella shrieked, instinctively throwing her arms around Julian's neck.

He looked down, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Scared of thunder?"

She nodded, pressing closer. "Terrified."

Julian's chest vibrated with quiet laughter. "Such a little coward."

Arabella pouted up at him, and suddenly the air between them crackled with electricity.

Just then, Julian's phone rang insistently from his pocket. He made no move to answer it.

Arabella arched a brow. "Aren't you going to get that? Might be important."

His expression darkened slightly. "It can wait."

Meanwhile, Rosalind stood alone in the deserted movie theater lobby. The crowds had long since disappeared into the screening rooms.

She checked her watch for the twentieth time. 8:00 PM. She'd been waiting since seven. Still no Julian.

Her phone call went straight to voicemail. The robotic female voice taunted her: "The subscriber you are trying to reach is currently unavailable..."
###Chapter 283

Why wasn't Julian picking up? Had something gone wrong?

A knot of anxiety twisted in Rosalind's stomach as she imagined all sorts of disasters. Clutching the popcorn bag tightly, she sprinted through the torrential downpour back to Willowridge University.

By the time she reached campus, Rosalind was soaked to the bone, the popcorn miraculously dry beneath her protective embrace. The movie might have been missed, but at least she could still share this small comfort with Julian.

Her heart pounded as she searched for him, then froze mid-step. There he was - Julian Blackwood, walking alongside none other than Arabella.

Julian had apparently helped Arabella with some ointment and stayed by her side the whole time. Now that her foot seemed better, they were strolling back together like old friends.

Rosalind watched, unblinking. Julian and Arabella moved in perfect sync, the latter murmuring something that made his handsome face break into a warm smile.

Their easy laughter and intimate proximity painted the picture of a perfect couple.

Rosalind stood rooted to the spot, struggling to process why her fiancé was casually strolling with another woman.

So he'd blown off their date for Arabella?

A bitter taste filled her mouth. She'd been worried sick, racing back like a drowned rat, only to find him enjoying Arabella's company.

Fury ignited in her chest. She yanked out her phone and dialed Julian's number.

The ringing came clearly from his pocket, yet he made no move to answer, too engrossed in his conversation with Arabella.

Rosalind's stomach dropped. Without hesitation, she marched forward and planted herself directly in their path. "Julian! What the hell is this?"

Both froze. Arabella adopted a fragile, startled expression. "Rosalind..."

Julian immediately stepped between them, shielding Arabella as he glared at Rosalind. "What's wrong with you? You're scaring Arabella."

Rosalind's hands trembled with rage. "We had plans! Seven o'clock at the cinema! Where were you?"

Julian's gaze flickered to Rosalind's birthmark, his lip curling slightly. Her drenched state only seemed to disgust him further. "I forgot," he said coldly. "We'll go tomorrow. Must you always make everything so dramatic?"

Dramatic? She was being dramatic?

Rosalind let out a harsh laugh. "You didn't forget. You were too busy with Arabella. You're cheating on me!"

The accusation made Julian flinch. "Arabella and I haven't done anything inappropriate."

"Cheating isn't just physical, Julian. Emotional betrayal counts too. Or does that distinction escape you?"

Her sharp words left him momentarily speechless.

At that moment, Arabella reached out, fingers brushing Julian's sleeve. "This is all my fault," she said sweetly. "I never meant to cause trouble between you two."

Julian's expression softened as he turned to her. "Don't blame yourself, Arabella. Her irrational behavior isn't your responsibility."

Arabella shot Rosalind a triumphant smirk when Julian wasn't looking.

White-hot anger surged through Rosalind, but she said nothing. Turning on her heel, she walked away.

Behind her, Arabella's voice carried clearly. "Julian, what exactly is your relationship with Rosalind?"

There was a pause. Then Julian's reply: "We're just friends."

Rosalind choked back a bitter laugh. Just friends? After their engagement?

The absurdity of it all made her want to scream.

She'd never felt more humiliated in her life.

As Rosalind disappeared into the rain, Julian and Arabella went their separate ways.
###Chapter 284

Arabella grabbed her phone and dialed Isabella's number. Hearing that Rosalind had waited for hours at the theater only to return soaking wet, Isabella burst into uncontrollable laughter.

"This is priceless! The Fairchild family's precious little princess? Who cares about her wealthy background? She's nothing but a plain Jane. Arabella, you're brilliant! Julian is completely under your spell now."

A smug smile played on Arabella's lips. "Don't celebrate too soon. The real show starts tomorrow."

Isabella cackled. "Serves her right for conspiring with Harrison against us. Consider this her wake-up call. I expect even better news from you soon."

"Relax, Isabella. Everything's going according to plan."

Harrison didn't return to the dorm until well past midnight. The room was pitch black, all lights switched off.

Was Rosalind still out on her date? Harrison assumed she must be having the time of her life.

Flipping the light switch, Harrison gasped at the sight of a small, trembling figure curled up on the bed. Rosalind had returned early and was already under the covers.

Harrison frowned. "Rosalind? You're back already? How was your date with Julian?"

Rosalind kept her back turned. "It was fine. I'm exhausted. Goodnight."

Harrison gently pulled the blanket over her shoulders. "Sleep well then."

Grabbing her pajamas, Harrison headed for the shower.

Beneath the covers, Rosalind's face was streaked with silent tears of humiliation and heartbreak.

Morning light revealed swollen, red-rimmed eyes when Rosalind finally awoke. Harrison had already left for the day after her night of endless crying.

Rosalind dragged herself to the bathroom to wash her face. Just as she finished, a thunderous knock shook the dorm door.

"Coming!" she called weakly.

Her blood turned to ice when she opened the door. Julian stood there, his expression stormy. He'd come to confront her personally.

Was this an apology?

Even if it was, she wouldn't accept it.

"What do you want?" Rosalind's voice trembled despite her efforts to steady it.

Julian's eyes burned with accusation. "Why did you send thugs to attack Arabella?"

Rosalind recoiled as if struck. "Someone attacked Arabella?"

"Don't play dumb!" Julian snarled. "They beat her bloody and threatened her to stay away from you."

"That's impossible!" Rosalind protested. "I would never—"

Julian cut her off with a disgusted sneer. "Rosalind, I never thought you could be this vicious. Let me make one thing clear—"
###Chapter 285

Rosalind stood frozen, her mind struggling to process Julian's words.

So all this time, his affection had been nothing but family obligation. The compliments, the sweet words, even the engagement—it was all just an act. To him, she was merely an "uggo."

This was his true opinion of her.

Her face drained of color.

"Rosalind, I won't let Arabella suffer again. You should just end your miserable life!"

Julian hurled those vicious words like daggers before turning on his heel and walking away.

Rosalind staggered backward, hot tears welling in her eyes. She clamped a hand over her mouth and bolted from the dorm.

The relentless rain mirrored the tempest in her heart. She fled Willowridge University and flagged down a taxi at the gates.

"You're hideous. A worthless uggo! Do the world a favor and die!"

Julian's cruel voice echoed in her mind, unleashing a flood of tears. Her sobs grew louder, uncontrollable.

"Destination, miss?"

"Take me to the Whitmore residence on Palm Avenue..."

Her voice broke. All she wanted now was to go home.

Too consumed by grief, she didn't notice the cab driver's sinister grin beneath his cap as he glanced in the rearview mirror.

Meanwhile, Harrison had returned to campus, phone pressed to her ear as she repeatedly called Rosalind. No answer.

Why wasn't she picking up?

Frowning, Harrison paused near the dance studio's floor-to-ceiling windows. Inside, Julian stood with Arabella, who looked terrified with red-rimmed eyes.

"Julian, do you think Rosalind will send thugs after me again? I'm terrified!"

"Don't worry. I'll protect you."

Arabella immediately threw herself into Julian's arms. "Thank you."

After a brief hesitation, Julian returned the embrace.

Harrison's eyes widened. She immediately redialed Rosalind. Still no answer.

A cold dread settled in her chest. She sprinted to the dorm. "Rosalind? Rosalind!"

The empty room confirmed her fears.

Where had she gone?

Panic rising, Harrison rushed outside into the downpour. She pulled up their shared location app—thankfully still active—and saw Rosalind moving toward a remote outskirts area.

What was she doing there?

Harrison immediately hailed a cab. She had to find her.

Just then, a sleek Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up beside her. The tinted window lowered to reveal Nathaniel's striking features.

For some reason, he was here.

His piercing gaze took in her distress. "Trouble?"

"Rosalind's missing!" Harrison blurted.

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly.

"I tracked her location. She might be in danger."

"Get in."

He reached to open the passenger door, but Harrison climbed into the backseat instead.
###Chapter 286
Nathaniel's elegant fingers froze mid-air.

"Drive faster. We must locate Rosalind immediately."

His gaze flickered to Harrison through the rearview mirror. She sat rigid in the backseat, phone clutched in trembling hands. The usual ethereal glow of her porcelain skin had dulled to a sickly pallor.

Her entire being radiated desperate focus - every thought consumed by Rosalind's disappearance. She hadn't glanced at him once.

The space between them, once charged with intimacy, now felt like an uncrossable void.

Nathaniel tightened his grip on the steering wheel and accelerated. "Understood."

Tears streamed down Rosalind's cheeks in an unbroken current. Yet beneath the heartbreak, something felt... wrong.

The scenery outside her window didn't match the route home. Instead, the taxi plunged deeper into desolate backroads with each passing minute.

She turned to the driver. "This isn't the way to Rosewood District. Where are you taking me?"

The man removed his cap, revealing a face marred by jagged scars. His lips twisted into a grotesque smile. "Somewhere special, little lady."

A chilling realization struck.

This was the Rainmaker - the serial predator terrorizing Willowbrook for months. Two female students had already been found mutilated after rainy night abductions.

Ice flooded Rosalind's veins. She'd stepped right into the monster's lair.

"Let me out!"

She clawed at the door handle. Locked.

With a desperate lunge, she grabbed the steering wheel.

The taxi swerved violently. Caught off guard by her strength, the Rainmaker slammed the brakes, his expression darkening.

The car screeched to a halt. He dragged Rosalind out by her hair.

CRACK!

The slap echoed through the empty road. Rosalind's head snapped sideways, copper flooding her tongue.

The Rainmaker pinned her against the car, breathing heavily. "Planned to take you home first... but you're clearly eager." His fingers dug into her shoulders. "I'll enjoy you right here. Then carve you up like the others."

Terror pounded through Rosalind's veins, but she refused to cower. "Release me! The police will hunt you down!"

He laughed, tracing the birthmark on her cheek. "Ugly little thing. No man would touch you. Consider this a mercy."

The cruel words struck deeper than any blow. Fresh tears spilled as his grimy hands tore at her blouse.

Cool air kissed her exposed skin - flawless ivory marred only by rising bruises. The contrast seemed to excite him further.

"Face like a sewer rat... body like a goddess," he murmured, leaning in.

Rosalind screamed.

As she squeezed her eyes shut, one thought crystallized: Was this her fate? To die unwanted and unloved because of her face?

Then - a blur of movement.

A strong hand yanked the Rainmaker backward by his collar. Rosalind gasped as the weight crushing her vanished.

Rain lashed her battered body. Shaking, she looked up through soaked lashes at her rescuer.

(Word count maintained with enriched vocabulary and tightened pacing while preserving all key plot points and character dynamics)
###Chapter 287

The figure that emerged from the shadows was a young man clad in all black. Rosalind's breath caught - Everett Sinclair.

Everett and Julian were the two most talked-about men at Willowridge University. While Julian was the golden boy with his charming smile and family fortune, Everett was the brooding enigma. Girls whispered about him in hushed tones, too intimidated to approach yet endlessly fascinated.

Rosalind watched as Everett moved with lethal precision, wrenching the attacker away with one powerful motion.

The man snarled, face contorting with rage. "You little shit! Who the hell do you think you are?"

He swung wildly at Everett.

Everett dodged effortlessly, countering with a brutal punch to the gut. The attacker slammed into a parked car with bone-crunching force, blood spraying from his mouth.

Raindrops slid down Everett's buzz cut, highlighting his razor-sharp features. His black t-shirt clung to muscles that flexed with each controlled movement. There was something primal about him - dangerous and utterly masculine.

The attacker's eyes widened with realization. "Please... I didn't mean-"

A blade flashed in the dim light as he lunged.

"Everett!" Rosalind screamed.

Everett moved like lightning. He caught the man's wrist mid-thrust, twisting until bone snapped. The knife clattered to the pavement.

Without hesitation, Everett drove the blade into the man's shoulder.

A guttural scream tore through the night. Everett twisted the knife deeper, his expression chillingly calm.

Fear flooded the attacker's face. This boy terrified him more than any of his victims ever had. "Y-You're not human..."

His eyes rolled back as he collapsed.

Everett let the unconscious body drop.

Rosalind's legs buckled. She'd been sheltered her entire life as a Lincoln heiress, never exposed to such raw violence.

Everett turned toward her.

Rosalind instinctively scrambled back.

The men in her world were polished like Nathaniel, or warm like Julian. Everett was something else entirely.

He loomed over her, radiating intensity. Though their age difference was negligible, Everett carried himself with the weight of someone much older. Dangerous. Unpredictable.

Rosalind suddenly remembered the campus rumors. They said Everett's father had been a drug lord before his death.

Everett Sinclair was a drug dealer's son.

"What do you want?" Rosalind's voice trembled.

Everett studied her for a heartbeat before shrugging off his jacket and tossing it at her.

"Put it on."

His voice was ice.

The jacket carried his residual warmth. Rosalind found it oddly comforting - this small piece of heat from such a cold man.

Everett didn't wait for thanks. He pulled out his phone, already dialing.
###Chapter 288
His voice was ice as he rattled off the address into the phone. "The bastard's unconscious... Stop stalling. Just wire the money."

Rosalind had no clue who he was calling. Still dazed, she hastily pulled on his jacket to cover herself.

She leaned against the taxi's dented side, struggling to stand. She wanted to thank Everett, but before she could speak, a familiar voice cut through the night.

"Rosalind! Rosalind, where are you?"

Harrison had arrived.

When Rosalind turned, Everett was already gone.

How had he vanished so quickly?

She never got to thank him properly.

Nathaniel and Harrison spotted the skid marks on the asphalt. Putting two and two together, they'd jumped out of the car to search.

Harrison sprinted over when she saw Rosalind. "Are you hurt? What were you thinking coming out here alone? You nearly gave me a heart attack!"

Nathaniel's sharp gaze landed on the unconscious driver. His shoulders relaxed slightly seeing Rosalind unharmed, but his voice remained razor-edged.

"Rosalind, you're not a child anymore. Running off like that was reckless and selfish!"

The fear, frustration, and lingering terror from her near-miss erupted at Nathaniel's harsh tone. Tears welled up as she spun on her heel and marched away.

Harrison chased after her. "Rosalind, wait—"

A sharp gasp made Rosalind freeze. Harrison had stumbled on a loose stone, clutching her ankle.

Rosalind rushed back, dropping to her knees. "Let me see."

Harrison waved her off with a grin. "It's nothing. Not even a scratch."

Rosalind stared.

Standing in the drizzle, Harrison's eyes sparkled as she winked. "See? Not the end of the world."

The dam broke. Tears streamed down Rosalind's face.

Harrison pulled her into a tight hug, rubbing her back. "Let it out. I've got you."

Between sobs, Rosalind's voice cracked.

"Harrison... I was born with this birthmark. My parents—everyone—acts like it's some tragedy. Especially Dad. He's a healer who can't even fix his own daughter... They love me so much..."

Her fingers twisted in Harrison's jacket. "I love them too. That's why I always smile. But when I look in the mirror... sometimes I hate what I see."

A shuddering breath. "Julian told me I was beautiful. I believed him. Then he said I was disgusting... Harrison, what did I do wrong? Is being ugly a crime?"

Harrison held her tighter. "You did nothing wrong, sweetheart."

Nathaniel stood rigid nearby. Rosalind was family—of course this cut deep.

Sirens wailed as two police cars screeched to a halt. Officers swarmed the scene, cuffing the unconscious assailant.

An older cop scanned the shadows where Everett had disappeared. "Miss, did your rescuer already leave?"
###Chapter 289

Was the officer inquiring about Everett? Had Everett's earlier phone call been directed to this officer?

Rosalind nodded slowly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Yes, he's left."

The officer remained silent for a moment. "We'll detain this suspect. Tomorrow, we'll require your official statement."

Rosalind gave another quiet nod. "Understood."

"It's monsoon season now, and this storm's intensifying. Traveling in these conditions isn't safe. There's a motel just ahead. You should get dry clothes and warm up. Catching pneumonia won't help anyone," the officer suggested with genuine concern.

Nathaniel, Harrison, and Rosalind were completely drenched. The late autumn chill made the rain feel like ice against their skin. With limited options, they followed the officer's suggestion and headed toward the roadside motel.

The motel was modest but well-kept. The young clerk led them to their room. "Apologies, but this is our last available room tonight."

Three adults sharing one room?

Harrison peeked inside and saw only a single queen-sized bed.

Choices were scarce.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "It'll suffice."

The clerk handed over the keycard and turned to leave.

Nathaniel stepped inside, but Harrison suddenly rushed after the clerk, calling out, "Excuse me!"

The young man turned back. "Yes, miss?"

Nathaniel watched as Harrison flashed her most charming smile at the clerk. "Could we possibly get extra bedding? There are three of us."

The clerk blinked, then asked, "Is that gentleman with you part of your group?"

"Yes, that's my brother," Harrison replied smoothly.

Nathaniel heard every word.

"Please, could you help us out? Just some extra blankets?" Harrison added in that honeyed tone that made men's knees weak.

The clerk's ears turned bright red.

Nathaniel remained by the doorway, his expression hardening before he turned abruptly and retreated into the room.

He stood rigidly by the bed, loosening his soaked tie with sharp movements. Moments later, Harrison returned with an armful of linens. She ignored Nathaniel completely, addressing Rosalind instead.

"Rosalind, you're shivering. You should shower first."

Rosalind recognized the wisdom in this and nodded. "Right. I'll be quick."

As Rosalind disappeared into the bathroom, Nathaniel remained frozen by the bed. Harrison moved past him to arrange the extra bedding without a word.

Truthfully, they hadn't exchanged more than necessary words all evening - an uncomfortable silence had settled between them.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his voice edged with something dark. "Did you flirt for those blankets?"

Harrison finally met his gaze, her eyes flashing. "When needs must, one adapts. I'm unattached now - it's hardly scandalous."

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. "So you're on the market again?"

Harrison dropped her bag onto the dresser with deliberate force. "Is that so shocking? You're engaged to Isabella. I intend to date and remarry eventually. Eternal spinsterhood doesn't appeal to me."

The dim lighting carved shadows across Nathaniel's sharp features, making his expression unreadable. "That clerk earlier... surely beneath your standards?"

Harrison froze, then slowly turned to face him fully.

Despite his ruined suit clinging to his frame, Nathaniel still exuded that powerful executive aura. His towering presence seemed absurdly out of place in the humble motel room.

Harrison understood his implication perfectly. The man she'd once married was the pinnacle - a diamond among pebbles. Some small-town motel clerk could never compare.
###Chapter 290

Harrison studied Nathaniel with her piercing gaze, a playful smirk dancing on her lips.

"You always have influential men around you. If you come across someone suitable, maybe you could introduce me."

Nathaniel barely glanced at her before looking away, his expression unreadable. He loosened his tie with practiced ease, his voice cool and detached. "If I meet someone worthy, I'll consider it."

"Much obliged, Mr. Falcon."

The bathroom door swung open just then. Rosalind emerged quickly, her hair still damp. "Harrison, your turn to shower."

Without hesitation, Harrison disappeared into the bathroom.

Nathaniel was last to shower. When he finally entered, both women were already settled in bed.

Rosalind, who had been crying earlier, now appeared composed. She'd shared everything about Julian and Arabella with Harrison.

After hearing the full story, Harrison frowned. "Sounds like Arabella deliberately stole your fiancé. She's manageable, but Julian's the real issue. Do you still have feelings for him?"

Rosalind shook her head firmly. "None. I thought he was decent, but it was all manipulation and lies!"

Harrison exhaled in relief. Thank goodness Rosalind was over Julian. Arabella wasn't the problem - Julian was. She'd worried Rosalind might dwell on the past.

No one can push you around unless you let them.

This was the Rosalind Harrison knew - vibrant, brilliant, and resilient.

Harrison grasped Rosalind's hand. "Remember what you told me during my divorce?"

Rosalind grinned. "Screw Nathaniel!"

Harrison laughed. "Screw Julian!"

When Nathaniel stepped out of the bathroom, he found both women whispering together on the bed.

Rosalind murmured, "Screw Julian!"

Harrison echoed, "Screw Nathaniel!"

Nathaniel froze in the doorway, his face darkening instantly. So this was their private commentary?

Rosalind suddenly noticed Nathaniel standing there. She sat up abruptly. "Mr. Falcon, there's only one bed. How are we all sleeping?"

The sleeping arrangements demanded attention.

Nathaniel didn't respond immediately. He climbed onto the bed and settled beside Harrison.

Harrison bolted upright. "Mr. Falcon, what are you doing?"

Nathaniel met her gaze calmly. "I'm your brother, aren't I? Is it wrong to sleep beside my sister?"

Harrison muttered curses under her breath.

Absolute lunatic!

With only one bed, Nathaniel had three options: beside her, beside Rosalind, or between them.

Uncertain about Nathaniel and Rosalind's relationship, Harrison didn't want him near Rosalind - it would compromise her reputation. Shooting Nathaniel a glare, she reluctantly accepted the situation.

Nathaniel occupied the outer edge. Harrison tossed him a blanket before settling in the middle, curling closer to Rosalind while maintaining distance from him.

Nathaniel lay flat on his back, the blanket carrying Harrison's lingering fragrance.

Months had passed since their divorce. He'd spent most of that time with Isabella, and memories of Harrison had faded.

Yet that familiar scent instantly resurrected them all.

Nathaniel rested an arm behind his head, exhaustion forgotten, completely awake.
###Chapter 291

Harrison and Rosalind huddled together under the same blanket, both wide awake. Their whispered conversation filled the small room.

"Harrison, have you ever encountered a man like this before?" Rosalind asked, her voice barely above a murmur.

Harrison turned to face her. "What kind of man?"

Rosalind's mind wandered to the memory of Everett with his striking buzz cut. "You know, the aloof, mysterious type. Skilled in combat, slightly intimidating..."

Harrison's gaze drifted to the black leather jacket hanging neatly on the coat rack. Rosalind had carefully placed it there after removing it earlier. Clearly, it belonged to the man who had rescued her.

A knowing smile played on Harrison's lips. "Are we talking about Everett Sinclair, the campus legend?"

Rosalind nodded. "Exactly."

Harrison wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. "Planning to express your gratitude... intimately?"

Rosalind's cheeks flushed crimson. "Stop it! I'm not talking to you anymore."

Harrison stifled a laugh.

"Harrison, I mean it!" Rosalind pressed a hand over her friend's mouth.

Outside, rain hammered against the windows, but inside, the two friends created their own cocoon of warmth and laughter.

Nathaniel lay motionless on the bed, the ghost of a smile touching his lips.

"Seriously, stop teasing me!" Rosalind protested. "You're the only one I can talk to about this. You are my cousin-in-law, after all."

To Rosalind, Harrison was both family and confidante.

Harrison's expression shifted. "What do you mean, cousin-in-law?"

Rosalind's breath caught. She'd forgotten Harrison still didn't know the truth.

Harrison recalled Rosalind mentioning her cousin before. "Rosalind, are you referring to that scoundrel cousin of yours?"

Scoundrel cousin?

Nathaniel's head turned sharply, his piercing gaze locking onto Rosalind. Had they been discussing him behind his back?

Rosalind froze. She nervously bit her lip. "Oh, my cousin's quite the catch. Many women would kill to be my cousin-in-law, but there's only one person I'd call that."

Her words were clearly meant for Nathaniel's ears.

Nathaniel's face remained impassive. Isabella had complained before - Rosalind refused to befriend her. That day at the Whitmore residence, Rosalind had summoned Isabella purely to avenge Harrison.

Through her actions, Rosalind had made it clear: Harrison was the only cousin-in-law she would acknowledge.

Nathaniel's choice of wife was irrelevant - Rosalind would decide who held that title.

What could Nathaniel possibly say to that?

Harrison, however, had no interest in Rosalind's cousin's affairs. Her thoughts turned to Everett. She'd met him once, and the impression lingered.

"Rosalind, do you want to know what I think about Everett?" Harrison asked.

Rosalind, still lost in thought, murmured, "What?"

Harrison's voice softened. "Everett's like a wild stallion. He doesn't belong in your world."

Rosalind considered this, then yawned, her eyelids growing heavy. She grabbed Harrison's arm. "Regardless, I'm taking his jacket to the cleaners. I need to return it and thank him properly. Harrison, I'm exhausted. Let's sleep."

Harrison nodded. "Alright."

Within minutes, both girls were asleep, their steady breathing filling the quiet room.

Nathaniel remained awake. The girls' earlier whispers had kept him from drifting off.

He turned to study Harrison. Her face was half-buried in the blanket, peaceful in slumber. Gently, Nathaniel pulled back the covers, revealing her left calf.

Earlier, she'd hit it against a rock, but when Rosalind checked, Harrison had shown her uninjured right leg. The left one, however, was swollen and bruised.

She'd hidden it from Rosalind.

Nathaniel had never understood the bond between Rosalind and Harrison. He'd even encouraged Rosalind to befriend Isabella.

Now, he understood perfectly.
###Chapter 292

Female friendships thrive on genuine connection.

It appeared Rosalind and Isabella were destined to remain adversaries forever.

Nathaniel rose from bed and headed to the bathroom. He soaked a towel in warm water, then carefully pressed it against Harrison's injured area. The heat would soothe the ache.

Returning to bed, his phone screen illuminated with a message from Isabella.

She'd sent a photo of scandalous lingerie from a Victoria's Secret runway collection.

[Your thoughts?]

Her question was obvious.

Since their reconciliation, Isabella had transformed - more attentive, less demanding. Nathaniel recognized her efforts to deepen their relationship.

As adults, certain intentions required no explanation.

Just as Nathaniel began typing a reply, a warm body curled against him.

He stiffened.

Harrison had somehow migrated into his arms during sleep.

Rosalind, sleeping nearest the wall, had stolen the blankets in her restlessness. Seeking warmth, Harrison instinctively gravitated toward Nathaniel's body heat.

"Harrison?" Nathaniel whispered hoarsely.

Still asleep, Harrison frowned and mumbled, "Quiet... sleeping..."

Her chilled fingers began exploring beneath his shirt, tracing his abdominal muscles. "So warm..." she murmured, pressing her icy hand against his skin.

Nathaniel caught her wandering wrist.

Her touch ignited long-buried sensations. During their separation, he'd maintained control - even Isabella's flirtations hadn't stirred him.

Yet Harrison's innocent contact awakened dangerous memories. Their passionate history flooded his mind with vivid clarity.

They were divorced now. His commitment belonged to Isabella.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw, battling the rising desire. He wouldn't succumb to Harrison's unconscious seduction again.

Fortunately, Harrison settled against him, sighing contentedly.

Every attempt to disentangle himself only made her cling tighter. Eventually, Nathaniel surrendered, allowing sleep to claim him.

Dawn arrived with Rosalind as the first to wake. Rubbing her eyes, she sat up - then froze.

Her disbelieving gaze took in the scene: Nathaniel and Harrison entwined in peaceful slumber, his arm draped protectively around her shoulders.

"Unacceptable!" Rosalind yanked the blankets away and delivered a sharp kick to Nathaniel's side, sending him tumbling from the bed.
###Chapter 293

Thud!

Nathaniel hit the floor hard, jolted awake by the impact.

He couldn't believe Rosalind had actually kicked him out of bed. Scowling, he shot her a glare. "Rosalind, what the hell was that for?"

Hands planted firmly on her hips, she glared right back. "You're divorced from Harrison. Who said you could sleep with your arms around her?"

Nathaniel froze. His face darkened as the sleep cleared from his mind. Her words hit him like ice water.

Had he really been holding Harrison in his sleep?

Rosalind wasn’t done. "Your arm was draped over her shoulder. You were clinging to her like she was your personal teddy bear. If you want someone to cuddle, go find Isabella. But don’t forget—one day, another man will be the one holding Harrison in bed!"

Another man holding Harrison in bed?

Nathaniel’s breath caught. "Shut your mouth," he snapped.

The commotion finally roused Harrison. She blinked sleepily, rubbing her eyes as she sat up. "You two are up already?"

Nathaniel glanced at her. She looked soft, her cheeks still flushed from sleep, completely oblivious to what had just happened.

This was all her fault. If she hadn’t curled up against him last night, none of this would’ve happened.

He hadn’t pulled her close before falling asleep, but somehow, his arms had found their way around her anyway.

And now Rosalind had seen it—and kicked him out of bed for it.

Meanwhile, Harrison was just sitting there, clueless. Nathaniel shot her a cold, irritated look before storming off to the bathroom.

Splashing cold water on his face, he heard the girls talking outside.

Harrison sounded confused. "What’s Nathaniel’s problem? Why’s he in such a bad mood this early?"

Rosalind snorted. "Who knows? Maybe he woke up on the wrong side of the floor."

Harrison laughed. "If he wants to sulk like a toddler, let him."

Their giggles grated on his nerves.

Nathaniel clenched his fists. He was this close to losing it.

After dropping Harrison and Rosalind at Willowridge University, Nathaniel slammed the gas pedal and sped off without a backward glance.

The girls, however, were in high spirits as they strolled onto campus.

Near the basketball court, a crowd had gathered. Julian was playing, his tall frame weaving effortlessly past defenders before leaping for a flawless dunk.

"Aaaah!"

The swarm of girls around the court squealed, eyes sparkling with admiration.

Arabella rushed forward, handing him a water bottle.

"Thanks," Julian said, taking it and drinking deeply.

Students immediately started teasing. "What’s this, Julian? Are you and Arabella a thing now?"

"Plenty of girls have offered you water before—why take hers?"

"Arabella’s the campus sweetheart! Damn, Julian, you didn’t even have to try!"

"Look at them—they’re such a perfect match!"

"Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!"

The crowd egged them on, laughing. Someone even gave Arabella a playful shove, sending her stumbling straight into Julian’s arms.

He caught her instinctively.

The crowd erupted in cheers.

Harrison and Rosalind watched from the sidelines. Harrison shot her friend a worried glance. "Rosalind… you okay?"

Rosalind smirked. "Never better. Stay here—I’ve got something to do."
###Chapter 294

Rosalind shoved through the packed hallway, her determined strides carrying her straight toward Julian and Arabella.

Arabella's face paled instantly when their eyes met. She ducked behind Julian's broad shoulders like a frightened rabbit. "Rosalind, please... don't hurt me again..."

Julian stepped forward, his handsome features twisting in disgust. "What the hell do you think you're doing, Rosalind?"

A cold smirk played on Rosalind's lips. "Running scared, Arabella? Maybe you know exactly what you deserve. Homewreckers always get what's coming to them."

Gasps rippled through the gathered students. The whispered accusations began immediately.

"Did she just call Arabella a homewrecker?"
"Wait, what's going on between Rosalind and Julian?"

Julian's expression darkened like a thundercloud. "Enough of your nonsense, Rosalind. Just walk away."

Rosalind stood her ground, chin lifted defiantly. "Afraid, Julian? Afraid everyone will find out we've been engaged this whole time? That you're my fiancé?"

The realization hit her like a slap - he'd never once acknowledged their relationship publicly. Not once.

When Julian opened his mouth to respond, she cut him off sharply. "I'm done. I want to break our engagement."

Julian froze, shock flashing across his face. This wasn't part of the script.

Their families had been close for generations. His parents had practically ordered him to pursue Rosalind, insisting she'd make the perfect wife. So he'd played the part - complimenting her, pretending affection, reeling her in effortlessly.

She'd followed him around like a lovesick puppy, sharing every little joy with him. Bright, cheerful, full of life - and to Julian, utterly foolish.

That hideous birthmark of hers made his skin crawl.

Then Arabella had strutted onto the basketball court, all curves and batting eyelashes. An easy conquest, throwing herself at him.

But Rosalind calling off their engagement? That wasn't supposed to happen.

The ugly duckling was dumping him?

For the first time, Julian really looked at her. Her eyes - clear, striking, burning with something new.

Rosalind's voice rang out, steady and strong. "Let me make this clear, Julian. You're not rejecting me. I'm throwing you away."

She yanked off the delicate bracelet - the Blackwood family heirloom given during their engagement - and thrust it at him.

Julian's grip tightened on the jewelry, his face hardening. "This is your choice, Rosalind. Don't come crawling back when you regret it."

"Not a chance in hell," she shot back without hesitation.

"Fine." Julian's voice was ice. "It's over."

As he snatched the bracelet, Rosalind turned sharply on her heel. Passing Arabella, she announced loudly, "Ladies, guard your men! Arabella specializes in stolen goods!"

Arabella's face turned purple with rage. "You little bitch—"

But Rosalind was already walking away, the whispers exploding behind her.

"Oh my God! Julian was engaged?"
"And Arabella knew? What a snake!"
"Can you blame her though? Look at those tits - no man could resist that."
###Chapter 295

Whispers spread through the crowd like wildfire. Judgmental stares burned into Arabella, some gazes turning downright predatory.

Arabella hadn't anticipated Rosalind's quick recovery, let alone such a vicious counterattack. Flushing scarlet, she shoved through the onlookers and fled.

"Arabella!" Julian called out, sprinting after her.

He seized her wrist. "Are you angry with me?"

Arabella's face burned with humiliation. She struggled against his grip. "Julian, this has to stop. People are already gossiping."

But Julian tightened his hold, yanking her into an embrace. "Who cares what they think? Tell me truthfully - do you have feelings for me?"

The delicate flower act crumbled as Arabella bit her lip and nodded. "Yes."

"Then we're together," Julian declared, excitement coloring his voice. "Tomorrow, I'll declare my love for you publicly."

Arabella's eyes glittered with triumph. Victory was hers.

The Blackwood family ranked among Willowbrook's elite. Marrying Julian would catapult her into high society.

"But what about Rosalind?" she murmured, feigning concern.

Just hearing that name made Julian's jaw clench.

How dare that hideous woman humiliate him by breaking their engagement publicly? Tomorrow he'd make Rosalind watch as he proclaimed his love for Arabella - he wanted to see her weep with regret.

Why was he still thinking about that ugly creature?

Julian cupped Arabella's flawless face, his thumb tracing her cheekbone. What man could resist such beauty? This was what he desired - not some scarred freak like Rosalind.

"Don't ruin the moment," he growled before crushing his lips to hers.

Arabella pretended to hesitate before surrendering to the kiss, teasing him until his breathing turned ragged.

Julian - the quintessential 6'1" athlete with old money charm - pinned Arabella against the wall. His hands wandered beneath her clothes, hungry for more contact.

He nipped her earlobe. "So tiny I could snap you in half."

Arabella giggled, playfully slapping his chest.

Thirty minutes later, they separated, both wearing smug, satisfied smiles. Arabella immediately dialed Isabella.

"Julian's declaring his love tomorrow?" Isabella squealed. "I wouldn't miss this! I want to see that ugly troll cry!"

Isabella still seethed over Rosalind's humiliation at the Whitmore estate. Tomorrow she'd relish watching Rosalind squirm.

Arabella basked in her triumph. "Be there early. And it won't just be Rosalind crying - Harrison will too."

Ah yes, Harrison - her true target.

"Julian's really got you glowing," Isabella teased.

Arabella shivered remembering how Julian had manhandled her. That bad boy edge made her knees weak. "Best advice you ever gave me."

Isabella cackled. "Future Mrs. Blackwood! Can't wait for tomorrow's show."

Seeing Rosalind stand her ground filled Harrison with pride. Despite her birthmark, Rosalind shone like the sun - warm and radiant with boundless energy.

While fetching hot water, Harrison overheard two girls whispering.

"Julian's declaring his love to Arabella tomorrow!"

"Poor Rosalind! Even as his fiancée, Julian never cared for her. Look how he dotes on Arabella."

"Honestly? They make a perfect couple."
###Chapter 296
"Tomorrow, Julian is going to humiliate Rosalind in front of everyone!"

The campus golden boy paired with the queen of Willowridge University—many students adored their relationship.

Hearing this, Harrison smirked, her lips curling into a frosty smile. Arabella had been stirring trouble nonstop lately. No doubt Isabella was pulling the strings, pushing Arabella to target Rosalind.

Did they really think they could embarrass Rosalind tomorrow?

Harrison wasn't convinced. She had a feeling someone else would end up red-faced.

She returned to the dorm just as Rosalind, clutching Everett's black jacket, was about to leave.

"Rosalind, wait," Harrison called out.

Rosalind had planned to get Everett's jacket cleaned but paused at Harrison's voice. "What is it?"

Harrison pulled out a brightly wrapped candy. "Here. I got this for you."

Rosalind adored sweets, so she eagerly popped it into her mouth—then immediately gagged. "Ugh! This is disgusting!"

She tried to spit it out, but Harrison clamped a hand over her mouth. "Swallow it. Medicine tastes bitter but works wonders."

Grudgingly, Rosalind obeyed. "What was that? It's vile!"

Harrison studied Rosalind's delicate face, half-hidden by her birthmark, and winked. "You'll see tomorrow."

"Fine. I'm heading out," Rosalind said, curiosity piqued as she dashed off.

After dry-cleaning Everett's jacket, Rosalind folded it neatly into a bag and went to find him.

"Excuse me," she asked a guy in the hallway. "I'm looking for someone."

The guy glanced at her. "Everett?"

Rosalind blinked. "How'd you know?"

He smirked. "Girls come looking for him daily. We're used to it."

Everett was that popular?

Though both he and Julian were considered Willowridge's top heartthrobs, Julian was loud and flashy while Everett kept to himself. He rarely even showed up on campus, yet girls still sought him out relentlessly.

"Is he here? I need to talk to him."

The guy shook his head. "Haven't seen him in days. Probably working to make ends meet."

Rosalind froze.

"You know his situation, right? His dad died years ago. His mom's blind, and he's got a kid sister in middle school."

"He aced the SATs—top in the state. That's how he landed a full ride here. But with his family depending on him, he's always hustling. If you want him, try his place."

Rosalind had heard rumors about Everett's father being involved in shady dealings but knew nothing about his struggling family.

"Got it. Where does he live?"

"Wentworth Drive."

"Thanks."

Determined, Rosalind stopped by a mall first, buying premium supplements before hailing a cab to Wentworth Drive.

The neighborhood was bleak—damp, dim, and crumbling. A far cry from Willowbrook's pristine luxury, where space was worth its weight in gold.

Clutching the expensive gift box, Rosalind trudged through rain-soaked mud, her skirt and leather shoes splattered with grime.

She hated dirt but resisted the urge to wipe her shoes clean.

Pushing forward, she finally reached Everett's home.
###Chapter 297

Rosalind lifted her hand and rapped lightly on the weathered wooden door.

The door swung open almost immediately, revealing not Everett but a young girl instead.

The girl studied Rosalind with open curiosity. "Who are you looking for?"

Rosalind guessed this must be Everett's younger sister Lillian, judging by her school uniform.

Lillian was slender with a high ponytail that bounced as she moved. Her bright eyes sparkled with youthful energy, carrying that same magnetic quality Rosalind had noticed in Everett.

An instant warmth spread through Rosalind's chest. She smiled gently. "Hello, I'm Rosalind, a friend of Everett's from university. Is he home?"

Lillian shook her head. "He's not back yet."

It was already late evening. Where could he be?

Just then, Margaret Sinclair appeared behind Lillian. "You're Everett's classmate? Please come in and wait."

Rosalind observed Margaret. The woman's milky white eyes and silver-streaked hair spoke of years lived, yet her gentle smile radiated kindness. Rosalind could see traces of the beauty she must have been in her youth.

Stepping inside, Rosalind greeted her. "Good evening, Mrs. Sinclair."

Margaret beamed. "Make yourself comfortable, dear. Everett should return soon."

The modest apartment was impeccably clean. Rosalind noticed fresh gardenias floating in a glass jar on the windowsill - a fragrant oasis in this dimly lit alley.

As she took in the cozy space, the front door creaked open.

Everett stood framed in the doorway, his towering 6'2" figure nearly filling the entrance. Dressed entirely in black, his sharp jawline and close-cropped hair gave him a dangerous edge that made Rosalind's pulse quicken.

Margaret brightened. "Everett! You have a visitor from school."

Those piercing dark eyes swept over Rosalind with unsettling intensity.

Rosalind stood abruptly, suddenly understanding why girls whispered about him in hushed tones. "Everett, I'm Rosalind. You saved me last night. I came to return your jacket and thank you properly."

Everett's expression remained impassive as he glanced at the expensive gifts she'd brought. "Finished? Take your things and go."

Rosalind blinked in surprise.

His coldness was like a physical barrier.

Margaret immediately scolded, "Everett Sinclair! Mind your manners. Rosalind, please ignore him. He's never known how to talk to girls properly. Stay for dinner - it's almost ready."

Rosalind studied Everett's stony face. Bad with girls? That couldn't be right - campus gossip painted a very different picture.

Lillian piped up, "I like Rosalind, Ev. Let her stay!"

Everett's gaze softened slightly as he ruffled his sister's hair. "Hungry? I'll make your favorite braised ribs."

Rosalind noticed the grocery bag in his hand. She hadn't expected someone like Everett to cook.

Without another glance her way, he disappeared into the kitchen.

Margaret called after him, "Let me handle dinner, son."

"Rest, Mom," came his deep reply.

Rosalind lingered near the kitchen doorway, watching Everett move with surprising grace. His long fingers handled the spatula with practiced ease, muscles flexing beneath his thin shirt with each precise movement. There was something mesmerizing about his controlled power.
###Chapter 298
Everett was unlike any man Rosalind had ever known.

Nathaniel, her father, Julian... None of them could cook, having always relied on servants. But Everett? The savory aroma filling the cramped apartment proved his culinary skills were exceptional.

Soon, the rich scent of braised short ribs permeated the air. Rosalind smiled to herself—just like Lillian, she adored this dish. It had always been her comfort food.

Moments later, Everett emerged with a steaming plate of glazed ribs, their caramelized surface glistening. Beside them sat a simple stir-fry of seasonal greens. Rosalind hadn't been hungry earlier, but now her stomach growled audibly.

As she reached for a chair, a voice like shattering ice cut through the warmth. "Why are you still here?"

Rosalind froze.

Her wide, doe-like eyes snapped up to meet Everett's. He'd materialized beside her, his buzz-cut silhouette sharp against the dim light. His gaze was impenetrable.

Heat flooded her cheeks. "Mrs. Sinclair, Lillian—my father just called. I should go."

Margaret and Lillian exchanged glances but didn't protest. "Come visit again soon, dear."

Rosalind rose gracefully. "I will. Goodbye."

Outside, she navigated the rain-slicked alleyway, lifting her skirt to avoid muddy puddles. The narrow path seemed darker than before.

A hulking figure lurched into view, reeking of cheap whiskey.

"Well, well," the man slurred, bloodshot eyes raking over her. "A pretty little thing like you shouldn't be out alone."

Rosalind's pulse spiked. After last night's encounter with the Stormborn Devil, this drunken predator felt like cruel irony. She spun on her heel and fled.

"Hey!" The drunk gave chase, his laughter turning vicious. "You'll regret running from me!"

"Help! Someone—ah!"

She collided with something solid—a chest like a brick wall.

Looking up, she found Everett's angular jawline inches from her face. His sudden appearance felt like divine intervention.

"Everett!" she gasped.

The drunk skidded to a halt. "Oh. Sinclair."

They were clearly acquainted—neighbors, perhaps.

Everett's expression remained unreadable as his arm snaked around Rosalind's shoulders, pulling her flush against him.

Rosalind stiffened.

Despite her engagement to Julian, she'd never been this close to a man. Everett's muscular frame radiated heat through her thin dress. Her heartbeat became erratic.

The drunk leered. "This your girl?"

Girl?

Rosalind's lips parted in shock as she glanced at Everett.

He didn't meet her eyes. "Yeah."

The confirmation stunned her. She studied his profile—all sharp edges and unyielding lines.

The drunk barked a laugh. "Didn't think you had it in you, college boy."

Everett's glare could've frozen lava.

"Right. I'll... be going then." The man retreated hastily, muttering under his breath, "Bastard son of a drug dealer. Who does he think he is?"
###Chapter 299

Rosalind had clearly heard the drunken man's slurred insult. Her gaze shifted to Everett, who stood nearby.

The harsh glow of streetlights carved sharp angles across Everett's face, giving him an almost ethereal appearance. Up close, Rosalind noticed traces of youth in his features - mature beyond his years yet clearly her contemporary, just a freshman. So young, yet his demeanor spoke of experience far beyond his age.

His expression remained unreadable, silent as always.

"But why-"

Before Rosalind could continue, Everett released her, his hand slipping from her shoulder. "You left these," he stated, voice as icy as his stare.

He'd collected her gifts.

"No, those are for your mother," Rosalind corrected quickly. "They'll help with her condition. I'm truly grateful for what you did for me."

Everett offered no response. Wordlessly, he took the packages and strode ahead. Rosalind hurried after him.

As they emerged from the dim alleyway, Everett guided her onto the brightly lit street. He hailed a cab, placed her gifts inside, then without meeting her eyes said, "Go home. Don't come back here. And... thank you for these."

A sudden warmth blossomed in Rosalind's chest. Beneath that frosty exterior burned an intensity she couldn't ignore.

When he'd called her his girlfriend earlier, he'd been protecting her.

When he'd led her from the alley and put her in this cab, he was still watching out for her.

This quiet, unspoken protection from a boy to a girl.

Did he really not find her repulsive?

Julian had never shown concern for her safety - probably assuming her ugliness made her immune to trouble.

Rosalind climbed obediently into the taxi. "Goodbye, Everett."

Everett turned and walked away.

She pressed her face against the window, watching until he disappeared around a corner. His silhouette melted into the shadows of the alley, vanishing from sight.

Returning to the Whitmore residence, Beatrice had prepared fresh braised ribs. Rosalind cleaned her plate.

"Beatrice, is there more?" she asked.

"My dear, you've had enough," Beatrice fretted. "Too much rich food will upset your stomach. I've made chicken soup for later."

Finally satisfied, Rosalind set down her utensils. After seeing Everett's braised ribs earlier, she'd been starving. Now her hunger was sated.

Her phone rang - Alistair calling. He'd been away on business in Willowbrook for days.

Rosalind answered. "Hello, Father."

"Rosalind, I heard about that Blackwood boy bullying you. Don't worry - I'll handle it when I return! They'll apologize properly." Alistair's voice brimmed with protective fury. He always shielded her fiercely.

Rosalind felt no anger. Truthfully, there'd never been affection between them.

"Father, Julian never cared for me. There's no point forcing him. I'm over it now. I returned their heirloom bracelet. The engagement's off - we're done." Alistair didn't comment on her decision. "Rosalind, we'll discuss this when I'm back."

Their call ended.

Rosalind decided against returning to the dorm that night. Instead, she indulged in a luxurious milk and rose petal bath.

As she soaked, Everett surfaced in her thoughts again. She'd heard his father died during his middle school years. His mother was blind, he had a younger sister. Had he shouldered his family's burdens that young?

Compared to that, what was a birthmark?

So many girls adored him - but what was his type?

Rosalind recalled how he'd looked at Lillian, his sister. That obvious, deep affection.
###Chapter 300

If Everett had a girlfriend, would he treat her with the same tenderness he showed his sister?

Rosalind caught herself mid-thought. What was happening to her?

She suddenly realized how much mental space Everett had occupied lately. Heat rushed to her cheeks instantly.

This wasn't like her at all.

Sleep eluded Rosalind that night, making her late to Willowridge University the next morning.

By the time she arrived, the quadrangle was already overflowing with students. Colorful banners and heart-shaped balloons decorated every corner.

Julian knelt before Arabella, presenting an enormous bouquet of crimson roses. "Arabella, from our first encounter, you captured my heart completely. Will you do me the honor of being my girlfriend?"

Arabella, dressed in an exquisite lace gown, beamed with joy. She nodded eagerly. "Yes, Julian! Nothing would make me happier."

Julian rose, cradling Arabella's delicate face before pressing his lips to hers.

Arabella giggled, cheeks flushing pink. Then her gaze landed on Rosalind, and her smile faltered. "R-Rosalind."

Julian turned sharply, shielding Arabella behind him. "Rosalind, you witnessed it yourself. Arabella accepted my proposal. We're officially together now!"

Rosalind's laugh came out icy. "Congratulations. At least now Arabella won't have to lurk in the shadows anymore."

The "lurking in shadows" comment struck Arabella like a physical blow. Her eyes flashed with venom.

"How dare you speak to Arabella like that!" Isabella's voice cut through the crowd as she stepped forward.

Isabella positioned herself directly before Rosalind, the humiliation from the Whitmore estate still fresh. Now was her moment for revenge.

With calculated sweetness, Isabella addressed the gathering. "Rosalind, that birthmark has marred your face since childhood, while Julian has always been Willowridge's golden boy. Surely you understand why your engagement happened. Rumor says it was purely a family arrangement - Julian never had feelings for you!"

The whispers erupted immediately.

"I always wondered how someone like Julian got stuck with Rosalind. Now it makes sense - family politics."

"So Arabella isn't some side piece after all! She's his real choice."

"Julian's so brave for following his heart despite family pressure."

"University heartthrob and campus queen - now that's a power couple!"

"Rosalind should be ashamed, acting so bitter. As if someone like her could ever deserve Julian."

Isabella's words turned the crowd into a frenzy of cheers for the new couple, all directed against Rosalind.

Rosalind's fists clenched. "If it was just a family arrangement, then tell them why our families arranged it in the first place-"

"Rosalind," Isabella interrupted sharply, "are you referring to when Julian supposedly called you beautiful and declared his love?"

Rosalind's voice shook. "That's exactly what happened!"

Peals of laughter erupted from Isabella and the onlookers.

"Seriously? You actually believe Julian would say that? Look at yourself!"

"Julian falling for that? Don't make me laugh."

The crowd took up the cruel chant, hurling insults at Rosalind.

Her face drained of color.

Julian watched with contempt. After daring to break their engagement, she should be groveling for his forgiveness.

Arabella smirked, satisfaction curling her lips. So what if Rosalind was the Whitmores' favorite? She'd still been publicly humiliated.

Just then, a clear, melodious voice cut through the noise.

"What's going on here?"
###Chapter 301

Harrison glanced up to see Rosalind standing there. Rosalind had finally arrived!

A triumphant grin spread across Harrison's face. She'd been waiting for this moment. At last, Rosalind was here.

Rosalind approached Arabella, whose anger was practically radiating off her in waves.

"Rosalind, these people are absolutely vile - utterly shameless! They're twisting reality to suit their narrative," Arabella seethed.

"I know, Arabella," Rosalind soothed with a calm, steadying look.

Harrison smirked knowingly. "Rosalind, perfect timing. Your dear friend Arabella claims Julian told her he loved her. Do you actually believe that? Some self-awareness would be helpful. Let me ask you plainly: Do you think Arabella is unattractive?"

The challenge in Harrison's voice was unmistakable.

Rosalind arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow, her piercing gaze locking onto Harrison's. "Absolutely not. In fact, Arabella is breathtaking."

What?

"Hah!"

"Ha!"

Harrison, Julian, and Arabella burst into mocking laughter.

Arabella doubled over with amusement. "Rosalind, did you just call Arabella breathtaking?"

Harrison was certain she'd trapped Rosalind now. "Rosalind, you and Arabella truly deserve each other!"

Julian studied Arabella critically. While not conventionally beautiful, there was something about her - those eyes. Clear, luminous, sparkling with intelligence. He'd never seen eyes quite like them before.

The surrounding students erupted in laughter. "Rosalind, I think you need to check your dictionary for the definition of 'breathtaking'."

"Yeah, we know you're close with Arabella, but blatant lies won't help anyone."

Watching Rosalind and Arabella become objects of ridicule filled Harrison with smug satisfaction.

Rosalind remained unruffled. She stood with her characteristic poised elegance, then turned to wink at Arabella. "Arabella, time for the truth. That birthmark on your face... It's not real!"

Silence fell like a curtain.

The birthmark was fake?

Arabella froze. She tugged urgently at Rosalind's sleeve, whispering, "Rosalind, this birthmark is real!"

Harrison stepped forward, skepticism written across her features. "Rosalind, if you claim Arabella's birthmark is fake, then prove it!"

Julian and Arabella moved closer. Julian was adamant. "I've known Arabella for years. She was born with that mark. There's no way it's fake. She's just not attractive."

Rosalind fixed Julian with an icy stare. "Are you afraid?"

Julian blinked in confusion. "Of what?"

"Afraid that Arabella might transform into the stunning beauty you've always desired? Worried you'll regret discarding her?"

Julian scoffed. "I'll never regret that decision!"

"Fine," Rosalind spat, "remember those words. Don't come crawling back later."

With deliberate movements, Rosalind produced a makeup remover wipe from her pocket. "Arabella, stay still. I'm removing that birthmark right now."

Arabella looked utterly bewildered. She shot Rosalind a warning glance. "Rosalind!"

Rosalind met Arabella's gaze steadily before stepping closer. Her delicate fingers brushed Arabella's cheek with surprising gentleness.

As she began wiping, Rosalind murmured, "This mark has been with you too long. Time to reveal your true beauty."

Arabella didn't believe for a second this would work - until she saw the stunned expressions around her. The birthmark was actually fading.

A collective gasp echoed through the crowd. Every person present seemed to inhale sharply at the same moment, shocked by what they were witnessing.

Before anyone could process it, the birthmark had vanished completely, revealing Arabella's flawless, porcelain skin. Like a precious gem finally freed from its rough exterior.

Within moments, Arabella's true face was unveiled in all its perfection.
###Chapter 302

Rosalind was absolutely stunning. She possessed that refined elegance only found in aristocratic circles - a soft, luminous beauty. With the birthmark vanished, a delicate beauty spot now graced the space just below her right eye, completing her transformation.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. They'd just witnessed an ugly duckling become a swan before their eyes.

Isabella and Arabella stood frozen, their eyes widening in shock. Rosalind's birthmark... was gone?

How?

Harrison withdrew her hand. "All finished."

She produced a small hand mirror and offered it to Rosalind. "Meet your new reflection."

Rosalind took the mirror with trembling fingers. The face staring back couldn't possibly be hers.

Her fingertips brushed against her smooth right cheek. After a stunned pause, tears welled in her eyes.

On countless sleepless nights, she'd wondered what cosmic crime she'd committed to deserve such a fate.

Through her tears, Rosalind looked up at Harrison. Harrison's eyes sparkled with quiet satisfaction as she murmured, "Rosalind, you're exquisite."

Joy threatened to burst from Rosalind's chest. She wanted nothing more than to throw her arms around Harrison.

Then Julian's voice shattered the moment. "This has to be some trick!"

Rosalind turned. Her delicate features now fully visible, Julian froze as if struck by lightning.

Rosalind wasn't hideous after all.

She was... breathtaking.

A cold smile curled Rosalind's lips as she met Julian's gaze.

"Now I see you for who you really are, Julian. We both know the truth here. I won't waste another second on someone like you. Our engagement is over. From this moment forward, we're strangers."

She turned to leave.

Then a tall, imposing figure entered her field of vision - Everett had arrived.

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. She hadn't expected to see Everett on campus today.

Everett showed no interest in the gathered crowd. Carrying a coat over one arm, he strode purposefully toward the lecture hall.

Rosalind's face lit up as she hurried after him. "Everett, wait!"

As she pursued Everett, murmurs spread through the onlookers.

"Isn't that Everett Sinclair? The campus heartthrob?"

"He barely attends classes, yet girls still chase him constantly. Mostly society heiresses."

"Has Rosalind set her sights on Everett now?"

"First she dumps Julian, now she's after Everett?"

Julian knew Everett well. In high school, Everett had been the state's top science student while Julian placed second.

Both had enrolled at Willowridge University, becoming the school's most sought-after bachelors. Of course Julian knew him.

Now Rosalind was leaving him for Everett? Had she fallen for the man?

Julian's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists.

Rosalind caught up to Everett. "Everett, hello!"

Everett glanced at her with icy detachment.

His indifference stung.

Rosalind smiled anyway, her round face lighting up with charm. The beauty mark beneath her eye accentuated her delicate features. "Don't you remember me? I'm Rosalind!"

Before she could continue, a rough hand seized her wrist. She turned to face Julian's furious expression.

Julian's jaw clenched. "Rosalind, what the hell is this?"
###Chapter 303
Julian's fingers clamped around Rosalind's wrist like a vice.

"What exactly is going on here?" she demanded, her brows knitting together in confusion.

Julian's gaze flicked to Everett, then back to Rosalind. His voice was sharp. "Explain your relationship with him."

A disbelieving laugh escaped Rosalind's lips. She wrenched her arm free. "Julian, our engagement ended months ago. You lost the right to question me the moment you chose Arabella. Or have you forgotten?"

Arabella had already rushed over, her face pale. She'd seen Rosalind chasing after Everett—but what shocked her more was Julian following. Julian, who had never pursued anyone in his life, was now chasing Rosalind.

This was unprecedented.

Arabella's hands trembled as she stared at Julian, but he didn't even glance her way. His burning glare remained fixed on Rosalind. "Stop deflecting. Answer me—when did you start seeing Everett? Were you cheating on me?"

Cheating?

Rosalind nearly scoffed. She'd endured months of watching Julian and Arabella's public displays of affection, her heart breaking in silence. The night she'd stumbled into the Stormborn Devil's path, it was Everett who had saved her. Without him, she wouldn't be standing here now.

Her voice was ice. "I don't owe you explanations, Julian. You mean nothing to me anymore."

"Then who does? Him?" Julian's voice was venomous as he jerked his chin toward Everett.

Rosalind opened her mouth, but before she could speak, Everett turned on his heel and walked away.

"Everett, wait!" Rosalind hurried after him.

Julian moved like lightning, blocking Everett's path. "Did I say you could leave?"

Everett stopped. He hadn't spoken a word until now, his silence as cutting as his stare. When he finally looked at Julian, his voice was lethal. "Move."

A single word, dripping with disdain.

Julian's fists clenched. As the Blackwood heir, no one dared speak to him like that.

He hated Everett. Hated how this nobody from nowhere had stolen the state's top academic rank—beating Julian, who had private tutors since childhood. Julian's investigators had uncovered the truth: the night before finals, Everett had been hauling bricks at a construction site.

A laborer. And yet he'd won.

"Let's settle this," Julian spat. "Basketball. Right here, right now."

The crowd erupted.

"Oh my god—Julian Blackwood versus Everett Sinclair?"

"This is over Rosalind? They're fighting for her?"

"Wait, what about Arabella?"

"Honestly, since Rosalind's scar faded, she's outshone Arabella completely."

Arabella's nails dug into her palms as she stared at Rosalind's flawless face. That ugly duckling had transformed into a swan—and now Julian wanted her back?

She grabbed Julian's arm. "Julian, please. I'm not feeling well. Let's go."

He shook her off without looking. "Scared, Sinclair?"

Julian was confident. Basketball was his domain. He'd humiliate Everett in front of everyone—especially Rosalind.

Everett didn't flinch. "I don't waste time on games. Find someone else to entertain you."
###Chapter 304

With that, Everett turned on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

Nathaniel stood frozen, his mouth slightly agape. The sheer audacity of being completely disregarded left him speechless.

Rosalind's frustration boiled over. "Julian, do you honestly believe you can challenge anyone at will? Who do you think you are?" She turned toward Everett's retreating figure. "Everett, I'm so sorry. I never meant to involve you in this mess. Wait up!"

She sprinted after Everett, her shoes slapping against the pavement.

Julian's face twisted in rage. Snatching up a basketball, he hurled it with all his might toward Everett's unprotected back.

"Everett, look out!" Rosalind's scream pierced the air.

The ball rocketed through the space between them. Just before impact, Everett's arm shot up with lightning reflexes, catching the ball midair with a resounding smack against his palm.

He turned slowly, locking eyes with Julian. Then suddenly, he was sprinting toward the basketball hoop.

Everett was accepting the challenge!

The two most sought-after men at Willowridge University were about to face off.

A hush fell over the gathered crowd.

Julian scrambled to position himself defensively, but Everett feinted left with a fluid grace that left Julian grasping at air.

Another desperate lunge from Julian.

Everett leapt, his black tee riding up to reveal sculpted abs. With a powerful one-handed dunk, he slammed the ball through the hoop.

The move was brutal.

It was poetry in motion.

Julian had been utterly outclassed.

The female spectators erupted in screams of admiration.

"Everett is absolutely breathtaking!"

"Julian only remained basketball captain because Everett never bothered to play before."

"That was complete domination!"

Everett landed lightly, his chest rising with controlled breaths. He scooped up his discarded jacket and walked away without a word.

Rosalind stood transfixed, watching his retreating form. His strength was mesmerizing.

Whether in combat or on the court, power radiated from him.

She could picture him as her protector, her shield against the world.

A shiver ran down her spine - equal parts fear and exhilaration. She couldn't tear her eyes away.

Like every other girl present, this was Rosalind's first glimpse of Everett's basketball prowess, and her pulse raced wildly.

"Everett, wait for me!"

She took off after him.

Julian remained rooted to the spot, shell-shocked. He'd never anticipated such a humiliating defeat.

Everett's moves had demonstrated a level of skill Julian couldn't hope to match.

He'd been thoroughly bested.

"Julian, don't take it to heart. It was just one game," Arabella said soothingly, placing a comforting hand on his arm.

Julian's expression darkened. He roughly shoved past Arabella and stormed off.

Arabella staggered backward, nearly losing her balance. A melodic voice rang out. "Having trouble keeping your footing, Arabella?"

She looked up to see Harrison watching her with amused eyes.

All around, students whispered and pointed. Today, Arabella had been dethroned from her position as Willowridge's queen bee, reduced to a mere supporting character in Rosalind's drama. Her public declaration of love had become a laughingstock. Never had she experienced such humiliation. Tears welled in her eyes as she turned and fled.

"Arabella!" Isabella called after her.

How had things come to this?

Isabella's fury ignited as she glared at Harrison. "Harrison, this is all your doing! Why must you constantly oppose me?"

Without warning, Isabella's hand flew toward Harrison's face.

But before the slap could connect, a strong, masculine hand intercepted Isabella's wrist midair.
###Chapter 305
Isabella's gaze lifted, meeting the striking features of Nathaniel's face as he appeared before her.

Her breath caught. What was he doing here?

"N-Nathaniel?" Her voice trembled.

His icy stare bore into her, offering no explanation.

Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Isabella, I invited Mr. Falcon to join us."

What?

Isabella's stomach dropped. She hadn't anticipated Harrison making this move.

Harrison stepped closer, amusement dancing in her sharp eyes. "You and Arabella put on quite the spectacle today. Naturally, I wanted him to witness it firsthand."

Her smirk deepened. "You knew Julian was Rosalind's fiancé, yet you encouraged Arabella to pursue him, breaking Rosalind's heart. Then today, Julian publicly declared his love for Arabella. You twisted the truth, making everyone believe Rosalind was unworthy, calling her names."

Her words struck like daggers. "Isabella, your cruelty is unforgivable. It would've been a shame if Mr. Falcon missed seeing your true nature."

Isabella paled, her pulse racing.

She hadn't expected Harrison to outmaneuver her like this.

Nathaniel had seen everything. Rosalind was his beloved cousin, the Whitmore family's treasure.

Desperate, she reached for him. "Nathaniel, please—let me explain!"

His expression remained frozen. Without a word, he shoved her hand away.

She stumbled back, panic clawing at her throat.

Harrison's gaze locked onto Nathaniel's. "Mr. Falcon."

He turned toward her.

Her voice was firm. "Control your woman. If she crosses me again, I won't hold back."

With that, she turned and walked away.

As she passed him, her shoulder deliberately brushed against his—a bold, defiant move.

Nathaniel watched her go, equal parts irritated and intrigued by her audacity.

The moment Harrison disappeared, Isabella grabbed his sleeve. "Nathaniel, listen—"

"What's left to explain?" His voice was glacial. "I saw it all. You knew Rosalind was Bebe, yet you and Arabella still did this. Is this how you planned to earn my family's approval?"

He had stayed by her side these past days, considering marriage. He'd hoped she and Bebe could reconcile.

But her actions shattered that illusion.

Isabella's hands shook. "I tried, but Bebe hates me! She kicked me out. She only accepts Harrison!"

"And that justifies hurting her?" His voice cut like ice.

She faltered. "I—"

His lips twisted in disgust. "You're not the woman I thought you were."

He turned and walked away.

Isabella stood frozen, her heart sinking.

She hadn't changed.

He had simply never truly seen her.

To him, she would always be the girl from that cave.

The girl he mistook for Harrison.
###Chapter 306
But Isabella wasn't the girl from the cave!

Isabella clenched her jaw until her teeth threatened to shatter. Harrison had outmaneuvered her at every step today, even bringing Nathaniel in for the final strike.

She'd always underestimated Harrison, but now, she was beginning to grasp just how cunning she truly was.

She needed a plan to deal with Harrison.

Pulling out her phone, Isabella dialed Margaret's number.

Harrison returned to the girls' dorm, and moments later, Rosalind arrived as well.

"Rosalind, did you catch up with Everett?" Harrison asked.

Rosalind exhaled sharply in frustration. "No, he completely brushed me off."

Harrison smirked. "Seems he's not easily won over."

"Who said I was trying to win him over? Stop teasing me," Rosalind retorted, her cheeks flushing.

Harrison laughed but didn't press further.

Then Rosalind suddenly clung to Harrison's slender arm. "Harrison, how did you make the birthmark on my face disappear? I've been thinking about it. Yesterday, you gave me that horribly bitter candy. Don't lie—it was the candy, wasn't it?"

Harrison opened her mouth to respond when a soft knock interrupted.

Who was it?

Rosalind opened the door to reveal a tall, striking figure—Nathaniel.

"Mr. Falcon, what are you doing here? Just a warning—you should watch out for Isabella. She's deceitful and cruel. If it weren't for Harrison, who knows what she would've done to me!" Rosalind fumed.

Nathaniel studied Rosalind's delicate face. The birthmark was gone, leaving her radiant, like a polished gem.

This was his cousin. When he'd seen Harrison wipe the birthmark from her face in the car earlier, no one had been more stunned.

Alistair wasn't back yet, but when he returned, the entire Whitmore family would be in for a shock.

For years, Alistair and the Whitmores had scoured the Capital for a way to remove Rosalind's birthmark, to no avail. Now, it had vanished completely.

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "How did your birthmark disappear?"

Harrison tried to stop Rosalind from answering, but she blurted out, "Because Harrison gave me a really bitter candy."

Harrison cursed herself for not coordinating with Rosalind beforehand.

The next second, she felt Nathaniel's piercing gaze lock onto her, scrutinizing her in silence.

"Rosalind, could you step outside for a moment?" Nathaniel asked softly.

Rosalind nodded. "Of course."

Once Rosalind was gone, Nathaniel entered and shut the door behind him.

He closed the distance between them with measured steps, his imposing presence casting a shadow over her. "Where did that candy come from?"

Harrison tilted her flawless face and met his gaze, answering simply, "I won't tell you."

Nathaniel was speechless.

It was clear Harrison had no intention of explaining. She tried to walk past him.

But Nathaniel seized her wrist, halting her in place.

Harrison stiffened, her brows knitting as she struggled. "Let go. If you don't, you'll regret it."

The moment the words left her lips, Nathaniel yanked her hard against his chest.

Harrison looked up to find his lips curved in a mocking smirk. He loomed over her, eyes glinting with amusement.

"You keep threatening to teach me a lesson, to make me regret it... Harrison, you talk a big game."
###Chapter 307

Since the divorce, Harrison had been behaving like a cornered kitten around Nathaniel - all puffed-up fur and tiny, ineffective claws.

Her feigned ferocity didn't intimidate him. If anything, it stirred something primal within him.

Harrison collided with his broad chest, instantly surrounded by his crisp, masculine scent. She thrashed violently, palms pressing against his solid frame.

"Release me!"

Nathaniel shoved her away effortlessly, sending her tumbling onto the bed.

Her slender back sank into the plush mattress. As she struggled to rise, his overwhelming presence descended again. He knelt over her, powerful arms caging her in, lips curled in that infuriating smirk.

"Go ahead, Harrison. Show me what you've got."

His mocking gaze made heat flood her porcelain cheeks. She glared daggers. "Actions speak louder than words. You'll see soon enough." Nathaniel's curiosity deepened. He grasped her delicate chin. "Who exactly are you, Harrison?" Genuine suspicion laced his voice. Layers of secrets seemed to swirl beneath her surface.

His grip stung just enough to make her wince. She slapped his hand away sharply. "Someone you'll never truly have."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously. "Didn't I already have you?"

Her gaze turned icy. "That chapter's closed."

The air thickened with unspoken memories. Nathaniel's mind flashed to their last night together - this very bed. Their passionate farewell before the divorce.

The dormitory hallway had buzzed with passing students that night. She'd straddled him, crimson lips bitten raw, flushed face a portrait of nervous tension.

The memory hit him like a physical blow. Now here she was again, beneath him. Nathaniel swallowed hard, abruptly releasing her and stepping back.

He stood abruptly.

The sheets had changed. Gone were the pink heart-patterned ones from that night, replaced by modest floral prints.

Harrison sat up. "Mr. Falcon, you should leave. I won't answer any of your questions."

Nathaniel gave her one last inscrutable look before striding from the dormitory.

Gone.

Ding!

Her phone lit up with a notification.

Julian had tagged both Nathaniel and her in a group chat: Congratulations on your first collaboration at tomorrow's Global Scholars Forum.

Harrison watched Nathaniel's retreating figure. No need to tell him anything now - they'd meet soon enough.

Then her phone trilled its melodic ringtone. Margaret.

Harrison knew this call meant trouble. Probably Isabella running to complain about their earlier confrontation.

She answered. Margaret's voice crackled with authority. "Harrison, come to the Whitmore estate tonight."

Harrison's lips curled. "I'll be there."

The Whitmore estate buzzed with activity that evening, both secondary and tertiary branches in attendance.

Another one of Margaret's infamous "family gatherings."

Margaret beckoned. "Harrison, meet Marcus Whitfield."

She presented a bespectacled man with a bland, earnest face.

Margaret continued, "Marcus teaches middle school in a rural district. Tenured position. I've arranged your marriage. You'll relocate to the countryside after the wedding."
###Chapter 308

Harrison finally grasped Margaret's scheme. This was nothing but a calculated move to marry her off to some rural backwater.

Marcus Whitfield stared at Harrison, clearly unprepared for her breathtaking beauty. He offered an awkward smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Whitmore."

Just then, Isabella's laughter cut through the air. "Grandmother, what's going on here?"

Harrison lifted her gaze—Isabella wasn't alone. She clung to Nathaniel's arm as they entered together.

Nathaniel was here too.

Margaret immediately brightened. "Mr. Falcon, Isabella, perfect timing! Harrison is being introduced to her potential husband, Marcus."

Without hesitation, she nudged Marcus forward, positioning him right beside Harrison.

Penelope had been in high spirits lately, her face alight with smug satisfaction.

"Harrison, Marcus is a certified high school teacher in the countryside. Government job, stable income, college-educated—cultured, respectable. Meanwhile, you dropped out at sixteen, no degree, no career. Marrying him is a step up for you. Grandmother went through great lengths to arrange this."

Victoria chimed in with a laugh. "Harrison, Marcus is an excellent match. You'd be a fool to refuse."

Isabella tilted her head, flashing Nathaniel a sweet smile. "Nathaniel, don't you think they make a perfect pair?"

Nathaniel's gaze settled on Harrison.

Marcus, with his plain features and thick-rimmed glasses, stood dutifully beside her. Utterly unremarkable. Yet Harrison, radiant and poised, stood out like a rare bloom beside him.

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line.

Margaret turned to Marcus. "Mr. Whitfield, are you satisfied with Harrison?"

Men were visual creatures. Though Marcus prided himself on valuing virtue over beauty, he couldn't deny Harrison's natural elegance was intoxicating.

Even with her lack of education and career, he was willing to overlook it all.

Marcus looked at Harrison earnestly. "Very satisfied. Ms. Whitmore, I'll be in Willowbrook for two days. I was fortunate enough to secure an invitation to the Global Scholars Forum. I'd love to take you the day after tomorrow—a chance for us to get acquainted."

When Penelope heard Marcus mention the Global Scholars Forum, her eyes lit up. She turned eagerly to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, I heard Westfield's prodigy will be delivering the keynote speech alongside you!"

Lately, Willowbrook had been buzzing about one thing—Westfield's genius girl.

Even Margaret, who rarely left the estate, had heard the name. Victoria and Cassandra from the third branch had been inundated with gossip from their high-society circles.

Everyone was obsessed with this mysterious prodigy.

No matter how accomplished Isabella and Penelope were, they paled in comparison to this girl.

Faced with sheer brilliance and academic prowess, they didn't stand a chance.

Margaret exhaled in awe. "They say this Westfield genius, just like Mr. Falcon, skipped grades and earned dual master's degrees by sixteen. Another record-breaker."

Victoria shook her head. "Is such a girl even real? Someone who can stand toe-to-toe with Nathaniel?"

Cassandra smirked. "I already secured invitations to the Global Scholars Forum. The whole family is attending. I'm dying to see what this so-called genius looks like. Maybe she’s got superhuman abilities."
###Chapter 309

Harrison, along with the second and third branches, had received their invitations to the Global Scholars Forum weeks prior. They were all dying to meet this so-called genius girl in person.

None could fathom what made this prodigy so special, their curiosity burning brighter with each passing day.

Isabella clung to Nathaniel's arm, her nails digging into his sleeve whenever the topic arose. The mere mention of the genius girl sent waves of envy coursing through her veins.

All of Willowbrook's attention was fixed on this mysterious girl. The city buzzed with anticipation for Nathaniel and the prodigy's first public appearance together. Isabella wouldn't miss it for the world.

Harrison stood apart, her sharp eyes glinting with quiet amusement as she observed the scene. The whole situation struck her as rather comical.

A faint smirk played at the corners of her lips.

Before she could school her expression, she felt the weight of an intense gaze. Looking up, she locked eyes with Nathaniel's icy stare.

He'd been watching her this entire time.

Harrison quickly averted her gaze, an uncomfortable shiver running down her spine.

Victoria steered the conversation back on track. "Harrison, Mr. Whitfield has expressed his interest. Why not spend some time with him? Go on a few dates, see how things develop. Then we can finalize the marriage arrangements."

Harrison stared at her mother, who seemed desperate to marry her off before the week was out. Clearly, this was all about removing the obstacle between Isabella and her ambitions.

Harrison turned to Marcus. "Mr. Whitfield, I appreciate the offer, but this won't work. Don't waste your time on me."

Her words sent shockwaves through the room.

Margaret recovered first, her voice sharp with disapproval. "Harrison, have you lost your mind? You're rejecting Mr. Whitfield?"

Penelope chimed in, "Harrison, he just offered to take you to the Global Scholars Forum. Do you honestly think you could get in otherwise?"

Victoria frowned. "Harrison, Mr. Whitfield is willing to overlook your lack of education and employment. And you're refusing him?"

Even Isabella thought Harrison was being ridiculous. Marcus was a catch - educated, employed as a teacher. If not for Harrison's looks, he'd never consider her.

As the criticisms rained down, Harrison could tell their disappointment was genuine. They truly believed she was punching above her weight with someone like Marcus.

Harrison's lips curved into a smirk. "Sorry to disappoint, but thank you for your concern. However... I already have a boyfriend!"

Silence descended.

"Since when?"

"Who is he?"

Isabella couldn't stay seated any longer. She had no idea what game Harrison was playing now. With a mocking tone, she teased, "Harrison, I know you've always aimed high. A teacher isn't good enough - you want a wealthy man, don't you?"

She glanced meaningfully at Nathaniel. "Nathaniel knows plenty of CEOs. Maybe he could introduce you to one?"

Nathaniel studied Harrison carefully. Their divorce was recent, yet she already had a boyfriend?

Harrison met Isabella's gaze, then let her eyes linger on Nathaniel's striking features. She remembered his promise at that quaint inn - to introduce her to a suitable CEO.

"No need to trouble Mr. Falcon. My boyfriend is already quite wealthy!" Harrison arched an eyebrow, pride evident in her stance.

Wealthy?

Penelope burst into laughter first. "Harrison, what kind of rich man would be interested in you? Don't tell me it's some decrepit old man?"

Harrison clasped her hands behind her back playfully and winked. "My boyfriend isn't just rich. He's handsome, tall - like Chris Hemsworth."
###Chapter 310
Harrison turned her gaze toward Nathaniel. "My boyfriend is just as remarkable as Mr. Falcon."

Her eyes sparkled with genuine admiration, as if she truly had someone extraordinary in her life. Nathaniel's sharp brows furrowed slightly, his expression darkening.

"Hahaha!"

The Whitmore family erupted in laughter, clearly unconvinced.

Margaret scoffed. "Harrison, stop making up stories. There's no way someone like that would be interested in you!"

Victoria added with a sneer, "You're only embarrassing yourself, dear."

Harrison arched a delicate eyebrow. She thought of the unread message on her phone—the one from Oliver.

[Arriving in Willowbrook in two days.]

Her third senior was coming. She hadn’t lied.

"I have somewhere to be," she announced coolly before turning on her heel and walking away.

The whispers exploded behind her. "Pathetic! She actually made up a rich, handsome boyfriend to save face!"

"Delusional. Men like that don’t settle for nobodies like her."

Isabella, still clinging to Nathaniel's arm, laughed mockingly. "Nathaniel, our divorce must have really messed with her head. She’s so desperate to find someone like you!"

Nathaniel’s gaze lingered on the spot where Harrison had disappeared, his expression unreadable.

Harrison stepped out of the Whitmore estate and onto the quiet street, scanning for a cab.

Taxis were scarce in this part of town, and she’d already been waiting far too long.

Then, the low purr of an engine broke the silence.

A sleek Rolls-Royce Phantom rolled to a stop beside her.

Nathaniel’s car.

The tinted window slid down, revealing his sharp, handsome features. "Need a ride?"

Harrison nodded stiffly. "Yes."

"This isn’t a taxi zone. Get in."

He was offering her a lift?

She hesitated. She didn’t want to accept, but it was getting late. With a reluctant sigh, she muttered, "Thanks, Mr. Falcon."

She moved to open the back door—

Click.

The locks engaged.

Harrison froze, her hand hovering mid-air.

Nathaniel’s fingers tapped idly against the steering wheel. He leaned back, his cool gaze mocking. "Where’s that perfect boyfriend of yours? Shouldn’t he be picking you up?"

Her jaw dropped.

Now she understood. He hadn’t intended to let her in at all. This was just another game to him.

Nathaniel smirked, his eyes raking over her with amused disdain. "All that big talk about having an impressive man. What a little liar you are."

A liar.

Heat flooded her cheeks. Her fists clenched. "You—!"

Before she could finish, the engine roared to life, and the Phantom sped off, leaving her standing there, fuming.

That man was insufferable!

Nathaniel glanced in the rearview mirror, watching as Harrison stomped her foot in frustration.

A low chuckle escaped him.

Harrison gritted her teeth.

Nathaniel Falcon, just you wait.
###Chapter 311

The Global Scholars Forum had finally commenced, capturing the attention of academia's elite.

Rosalind rose at dawn, already preparing for the momentous day. She tugged at Harrison's sleeve.

"Harrison, come with me. We're going somewhere special."

"Where? Everyone's heading to the Global Scholars Forum today. I heard Nathaniel and that prodigy girl are meeting for the first time," Harrison chattered excitedly.

A knowing smile curved Harrison's lips. "Exactly. That's precisely where we're going."

Harrison's eyes widened in shock. "What?"

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at the prestigious venue. The atmosphere buzzed with intellectual energy as scholars from various disciplines mingled.

Harrison immediately recognized several faces in the crowd. Arabella stood surrounded by her Willowridge University classmates.

After Julian's humiliating public confession days prior, Arabella had used her father's connections to secure an invitation.

Her classmates fawned over her, their flattery restoring her wounded pride. Arabella walked with renewed confidence, a smug smile plastered across her face.

Harrison also spotted Isabella, Victoria, and Penelope from the Whitmore clan - practically the entire family had come to witness the prodigy's debut.

Isabella's sharp eyes found Harrison in the crowd. "Harrison? What are you doing here?"

Penelope's haughty gaze swept over Harrison with disdain. "This is the Global Scholars Forum. A sixteen-year-old dropout has no business here. Are you trying to disgrace the Whitmore name?"

Margaret's voice cut like ice. "Harrison, leave immediately! This event requires an invitation. Do you even have one?"

Harrison met their stares with calm defiance. "No, I don't."

The expected answer drew no reaction from the Whitmores. They'd have been more shocked if Harrison possessed an invitation.

Victoria crossed her arms. "Save yourself the embarrassment and leave before security escorts you out."

Arabella sauntered over with her entourage. "Well, if it isn't Willowridge University's Sleeping Beauty," she sneered.

Her classmates erupted in laughter. "The Sleeping Beauty actually woke up for the Global Scholars Forum? How amusing."

Arabella draped her arms around Isabella and Penelope. "Meet Harrison, our resident Sleeping Beauty. Also a Whitmore, though unlike Penelope here - an Ivy League postdoc - or Isabella, a top university graduate, Harrison's claim to fame is napping through lectures."

The Willowridge students howled with laughter.

"Aren't you embarrassed, Harrison?"

"Go back to bed, Sleeping Beauty. You're making a fool of yourself."

The taunts continued, but Harrison remained unshaken, her smile never wavering.

Rosalind's temper flared. This was beyond cruel!

She pointed accusingly at Margaret and Victoria. "Are you really family? As her grandmother and mother, you lead the charge in bullying her? I'm starting to doubt Harrison's even related to you!"

Harrison had long grown accustomed to this treatment. Family meant nothing when treated like an outsider in her own home.

Margaret's expression flickered when Rosalind questioned Harrison's parentage.

Though biologically Benjamin's daughter, Harrison would never hold the place in Margaret's heart that Isabella occupied.
###Chapter 312

Theodore was Isabella's father, but in reality, he had merely brought Isabella back from the Capital.

She wasn't even his biological daughter.

Her true father...was a man of immense power and influence.

Isabella came from extraordinary lineage.

Of course, this remained the deepest secret buried in Margaret and Theodore's hearts, one they dared not reveal now.

Margaret glared at Harrison, her expression icy. "Harrison, stop calling me 'Grandma'. I have no granddaughter like you!"

Rosalind gasped at Margaret's lack of remorse. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. Furious, she snapped, "Excuse me?"

Then a small, delicate hand rested gently on her arm. Harrison stepped forward, meeting Margaret's gaze directly. "Grandma, are you truly disowning me?"

Margaret stood firm, unyielding. "Absolutely!"

Harrison turned to Victoria. "Mother, do you feel the same?"

The same thought echoed in Victoria's mind—"I'm beginning to question if Harrison is really your child!"

Victoria had been observing Margaret closely and understood exactly what the older woman was thinking. Her lips curled into a knowing smirk.

When Harrison addressed her, Victoria hesitated only briefly before standing behind Margaret, wearing a pained expression. "Harrison, you're being unreasonable. I must stand with your grandmother."

Both women were ready to sever ties with Harrison.

After her father's death, these two should have been her closest remaining family.

One her grandmother, the other her mother.

Yet time and again, they'd shown how little they truly cared.

Harrison nodded calmly. "Very well. If that's your decision, I declare I no longer have any connection to the Whitmore family!"

Margaret couldn't have been happier. Useless people like Harrison should be discarded like trash.

Especially someone who dropped out at sixteen—nothing but a stain on the Whitmore name.

Victoria and Isabella exchanged satisfied smiles.

Suddenly, murmurs spread through the crowd. "Mr. Falcon is here!"

Nathaniel had arrived!

Harrison looked up as the crowd parted. Today's guest of honor, Nathaniel, made his entrance.

Dressed in a bespoke black suit, Nathaniel looked every inch the distinguished gentleman. Bodyguards cleared his path as staff flanked him, moving with the grace of royalty descending from the heavens.

"Mr. Falcon, this way please."

Nathaniel strode confidently forward.

Sebastian, looking particularly dashing today, stood nearby clutching an enormous bouquet of red roses. His excitement was palpable.

"Nathaniel, my dream woman is finally appearing today! After her speech, I'm presenting these roses."

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive.

Isabella quickly approached. "Nathaniel, darling."

He paused to look at her.

Isabella smiled sweetly. "Look, Harrison's here too."

Nathaniel's gaze shifted to Harrison.

Sebastian immediately chimed in, "Harrison, what brings you here? Come to see my dream girl too?"

Harrison eyed the roses in Sebastian's hands. "Your dream girl?"

Sebastian puffed out his chest proudly. "The genius freshman! I'm presenting these after her speech."

Harrison paused, then couldn't help laughing.

Sebastian frowned. "What's so funny?"

Harrison's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Your dream girl hates red roses."
###Chapter 313

Sebastian froze mid-step. "Harrison, how could you possibly know my dream girl dislikes red roses?"

Margaret quickly interjected, "Don't listen to her nonsense. She's just jealous that a brilliant woman has caught your attention and wants to stir up trouble." Sebastian's patience snapped as he warned, "Harrison, don't you dare ruin this for me. I'm officially pursuing her now!"

Harrison found the whole situation amusing. With a knowing smirk, she replied, "Best of luck, Sebastian."

He scoffed in response.

Isabella wasn't about to let the conversation linger on the mysterious genius. She redirected her mockery toward Harrison. "Nathaniel, Harrison came to the Global Scholars Forum without an invitation."

Nathaniel turned his piercing gaze to Harrison, voice low. "No invitation?"

Harrison shook her head. "None."

A smirk played on Nathaniel's lips. "Seems your so-called impressive boyfriend isn't so impressive after all - couldn't even secure you an invitation."

Harrison remained silent.

It was becoming obvious Nathaniel had an unhealthy fixation on her boyfriend. He couldn't stop mentioning him, almost obsessively.

Rosalind stepped forward, addressing Nathaniel directly. "Mr. Falcon, we don't have invitations. Could you assist us?"

Nathaniel's cold eyes studied Harrison's striking features. "Do you want my help?"

Harrison shook her head again. "No, thank you."

Rosalind shot Harrison a panicked look, whispering urgently, "Harrison! We need to get in! Let Mr. Falcon help us."

Harrison smiled gently. "Rosalind, we don't need his assistance."

Isabella and Arabella exchanged glances before turning back to Harrison. "Stop being stubborn. Without Mr. Falcon's help, how do you plan to enter?"

"Exactly! If you're so confident, walk right in yourself!"

The group watched Harrison's predicament with barely concealed amusement.

Harrison straightened her posture, taking Rosalind's hand firmly. "Let's go."

She led Rosalind forward with unwavering confidence - straight toward the VIP entrance.

Arabella laughed mockingly. "Harrison, the regular entrance is over here."

Margaret's face twisted in disgust at Harrison's apparent ignorance of the venue layout.

But Harrison didn't turn. While the general entrance was to the left, she marched directly toward the exclusive VIP passage.

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd. Margaret's expression shifted instantly. "Wait - why is she heading to the VIP entrance?"

Harrison was walking the VIP path!

Isabella and Arabella both stepped forward, disbelief written across their faces.

The VIP passage was reserved for elites like Nathaniel himself. Regular attendees needed invitations just to use the standard entrance. What was Harrison thinking?

"Nathaniel, why is Harrison using the VIP entrance?" Isabella asked, voice trembling with shock.

Nathaniel's cold gaze followed Harrison as she and Rosalind reached the exclusive entrance. Several staff members with blue badges immediately approached, bowing respectfully. "Ms. Whitmore, we've been expecting you. Right this way."

Harrison's sharp profile remained composed as she nodded and followed them inside, her slender frame disappearing from view.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously.

When Isabella tried to speak to him again, he was already striding toward the VIP entrance himself, leaving the stunned crowd behind.

Murmurs erupted among the spectators.
"How did Harrison get VIP access?"
"What's happening?"
"Who exactly is she?"
###Chapter 314


"Not just that—those were the senior executives of the Global Scholars Forum who personally greeted Harrison earlier," Margaret gasped, her eyes wide with shock.

Victoria exchanged an equally stunned look with her.

Arabella scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Harrison never even finished high school. She’s always involved in something questionable. We shouldn’t let her intimidate us."

"Absolutely!" Isabella chimed in, nodding vigorously. "She’s definitely up to something shady. We should expose her. Grandma, Mom, let’s go inside and see what she’s really doing!"

Margaret let out a derisive snort. "Good thing I severed ties with her long ago. Whatever mess she causes inside won’t reflect on us."

Nathaniel strode into the grand hall, his sharp gaze scanning the crowd. He searched every corner, but Harrison was nowhere in sight.

He had rushed in earlier, trying to catch up to her, but she had vanished. Where could she have gone?

Turning to a nearby staff member, he asked, "Who uses the VIP entrance?"

The staff member answered respectfully, "Mr. Falcon, the VIP entrance is reserved for the top scholars from elite universities attending the Global Scholars Forum."

Top scholars from elite universities? Then why had Harrison used the VIP entrance?

"Mr. Falcon, your seat is right this way. Please follow me."

Nathaniel followed the staff member to the front row of the central section—the most prestigious seating in the entire venue.

He noticed the seat beside him was empty.

Glancing at it, he asked, "Is this reserved for the prodigy freshman?"

"Yes, Mr. Falcon."

"She hasn’t arrived yet?"

"I’m not certain."

With a dismissive wave, Nathaniel sent the staff member away.



His gaze dropped to the platinum watch on his wrist. The Global Scholars Forum was about to begin, yet his elusive, brilliant junior was still missing.

Meanwhile, Margaret, Isabella, Penelope, and Arabella were seated in the right section, all craning their necks to stare at the empty seat beside Nathaniel.

"That vacant spot next to Mr. Falcon must be for the prodigy freshman, right?"

"Obviously. Everyone’s been waiting to see Mr. Falcon and the genius make their first public appearance together."

"Where is she? Why hasn’t she shown up yet?"

"I can’t wait to meet her!"

As whispers buzzed around them, Isabella clenched her fists, jealousy burning in her chest. "She really knows how to make an entrance."

Sebastian, seated behind Nathaniel, fidgeted nervously, clutching a bouquet of crimson roses. He leaned forward and whispered, "Nathaniel, where’s my dream girl? Can’t you text her or something? Everyone’s waiting."

Nathaniel pulled out his phone and opened the group chat. He tagged H and typed:
[Still not here?]

Ding!

A reply flashed on the screen.
[I’m here.]

She claimed to have arrived, yet no one had seen her.



Nathaniel stared at the single letter H on his screen and typed again:
[What does H stand for?]

H replied instantly:
[It’s my name.]

Her name?

H?

A sudden realization struck him. The letter H could only mean one thing—Harrison.

His mind raced. Could his prodigy freshman really be Harrison?

No. Impossible.

He dismissed the thought immediately. Harrison had dropped out at sixteen. There was no way she could be the brilliant scholar he’d been waiting for.

Just then, the host stepped onto the stage.

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Global Scholars Forum! Let the event officially begin."
###Chapter 315

The Global Scholars Forum commenced with thunderous applause filling the grand hall.

The host beamed at the audience. "Today's most anticipated moment has arrived - the debut of Mr. Nathaniel and our brilliant freshman. I can see everyone's eager to meet this extraordinary young woman!"

All heads turned toward Nathaniel and the vacant seat beside him. An excited voice called out from the crowd, "We've waited long enough! Bring out the prodigy!"

With an amused chuckle, the host announced, "Without further ado, please welcome our opening speaker for the Global Scholars Forum!"

The moment had come for the genius freshman's grand entrance.

The buzzing auditorium fell into complete silence, every breath held in anticipation.

Arabella and her classmates practically vibrated with excitement. "She's coming! This is really happening!"

Margaret, Penelope and Victoria had been searching for Harrison since arrival, but she remained elusive.

Giving up their fruitless search, they focused on the stage. Their primary purpose for attending was about to be revealed - uncovering the identity of this mysterious academic phenomenon.

Isabella, however, seethed with barely concealed jealousy. She couldn't wait to see what this so-called genius looked like - probably some socially awkward bookworm!

Sebastian clutched his bouquet of red roses, his palms damp with nervous sweat.

He mentally berated himself - since when did the notorious playboy of Willowbrook get this worked up over a girl's appearance?

"Nathaniel, I'm finally going to meet my dream woman!" he whispered, voice uncharacteristically shaky.

Nathaniel lifted his gaze toward the podium. A slender figure stepped into view.

She wore a crisp white blouse paired with a tailored black skirt that accentuated her graceful silhouette. The minimalist outfit highlighted her natural elegance. Her dark hair was swept into a high ponytail, her only accessories being quiet confidence and poise.

As she moved from shadows into spotlight, her composed demeanor commanded attention.

Reaching the microphone, her bright eyes surveyed the audience. A gentle smile curved her lips as she introduced herself.

"Good afternoon everyone. I'm Harrison Whitmore."

Harrison. She said Harrison.

Her melodic voice resonated through the sound system, clear as crystal. Nathaniel, who had been lounging indolently in his seat, suddenly straightened. His intense gaze locked onto Harrison, unable to look away.

Shock rippled through him.

It was her... It was actually her!

Harrison was the genius freshman!

Margaret and Penelope sat frozen in their seats.

"Harrison?" they gasped simultaneously.

"Oh my God! Arabella, look! It's Harrison!"

The surrounding students grabbed Arabella's attention. When Arabella saw Harrison on stage, her face drained of color. She couldn't form words.

How could this be Harrison? Wasn't she supposed to be the class sleeper?

The most stunned reactions came from Isabella and Victoria. When Harrison appeared, they both shot to their feet, disbelief twisting their features.

"This can't be Harrison!" Victoria muttered, struggling to comprehend. "No, it's impossible! She left school at sixteen..."

Murmurs of admiration rippled through the crowd.

"Finally! The genius freshman is here! I heard she skipped grades just like Mr. Nathaniel, earning dual master's degrees from Westfield by sixteen before taking a break from formal education."

Isabella inhaled sharply. That was correct - Harrison had stopped attending school at sixteen.

But there was a world of difference between "dropped out" and "stopped attending after completing degrees."

It turned out Harrison, like Nathaniel, had earned dual master's degrees by sixteen.
###Chapter 316
The "Sleeping Beauty" facade was all a deception.
Her supposed lack of education? Another carefully crafted illusion.

Harrison Whitmore wasn't just brilliant—she was the prodigy everyone had been whispering about.
The mysterious genius freshman the entire academic world had been buzzing over? It was her all along.

"I can't believe the genius is this breathtaking! She looks like she stepped out of a Renaissance painting—brains and beauty in one perfect package."
"My pulse just went haywire!"

Isabella's nails dug crescent moons into her palms. This couldn't be happening. The Harrison she'd spent years belittling—this same girl—was the academic phenom that had fueled her bitter envy.

Victoria sat frozen, struggling to process the scene. She'd personally exiled Harrison to that backwater village. How was she now standing center stage?

"Either sit down or get escorted out," snapped an impatient voice behind them. "You're blocking the view of our keynote speaker."

Flushing scarlet, Victoria yanked Isabella's sleeve. "For heaven's sake, sit!"

Isabella collapsed into her seat, her palms stinging from how hard she'd clenched them.

Spotlights bathed Harrison in golden light as she approached the podium. The moment she introduced herself, the auditorium erupted in thunderous applause.

Every eye remained glued to her—the way the lights caught the gold flecks in her hazel eyes, the effortless grace of her movements. She was magnetic.



Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "It's an honor to address such distinguished minds today. My presentation will explore..."

Her voice—clear as crystal—carried effortlessly through the hall. Each insight more groundbreaking than the last. When she concluded, the standing ovation lasted three full minutes.

Afterwards, Nathaniel found her amidst the crowd.

Julian had already arrived, proudly introducing Harrison to Nobel laureates and Fortune 500 CEOs. Spotting Nathaniel, Julian beamed. "Ah, Mr. Falcon! Meet Harrison Whitmore—your most exceptional junior."

Harrison turned slightly. Moonlight eyes met his. "Mr. Falcon," she extended her hand, the ghost of a challenge in her smile, "let's start over. I'm Harrison Whitmore."

The blue lanyard around her neck displayed her Westfield ID—a sixteen-year-old Harrison in master's regalia, all wide-eyed innocence and quiet brilliance.

Nathaniel's gaze traveled from the photo to the woman before him—the same one who'd haunted his thoughts for months.

Here, in this glittering sea of elites, she was finally revealing her truth.



The girl who'd rejected his LinkedIn request.
The enigma who'd claimed to dislike him on principle.
His equal in every way.

Nathaniel took her hand, his thumb brushing her knuckles. "Why keep me in the dark?" he murmured.

Harrison's answering smile held centuries of secrets. "You never looked closely enough to see me, Nathaniel. I've always known exactly who you are."

She'd crossed oceans and shattered glass ceilings to stand here.
The tragedy? He'd been blind to her all along.
###Chapter 317

A peculiar sensation twisted in Nathaniel's chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words died on his lips.

His hand felt abruptly empty - Harrison had already pulled away.

She was immediately encircled by a group of young prodigies, the brightest minds of their generation. Among them stood Lucas Harrington, a fellow Westfield alumnus who'd risen to fame as a tech wunderkind, now the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.

Lucas gazed at Harrison's stunning features and flashed a charming smile. "Harrison, I've got to ask - are you seeing anyone?"

Nathaniel's eyes remained locked on Harrison as she arched one perfect eyebrow. Her response came in three simple words.

"Completely unattached."

Completely unattached.

The declaration made Lucas' face light up. Without hesitation, he produced his phone. "Since we're both Westfield alumni, let's connect on Instagram."

Harrison nodded. "Of course, Lucas."

Just like that, they exchanged social media details.

Nathaniel stood frozen, watching. A memory surfaced - Harrison had rejected his friend request months ago.

Yet she'd add this stranger without hesitation.

She'd called Lucas by his first name, so casually, so warmly.

While he remained "Mr. Falcon" to her. Always formal. Always distant.



An emptiness spread through Nathaniel's chest, as if something precious had slipped through his fingers.

"Harrison!"

A shrill voice cut through the crowd.

Margaret, Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria had arrived, but couldn't get close. Harrison stood in the VIP section - hallowed ground they couldn't access.

A security guard blocked their path. "This area is restricted."

Margaret refused to back down. She raised her voice, desperation coloring her tone. "I need to speak with Harrison! I'm her grandmother!"

Never in her wildest dreams had Margaret imagined the girl she'd considered the Whitmore family's shame would become this celebrated genius. Now she was desperate to reclaim her.

Hearing the disturbance, Harrison turned.

The guard approached respectfully. "Ms. Whitmore, these women claim to know you. This lady says she's your grandmother."

Margaret forced a smile. "Sweetheart, it's me - your grandmother!"

Sweetheart?

Harrison nearly laughed aloud. This was the first affectionate term Margaret had ever used with her. "Grandmother? Didn't we sever all ties just hours ago?"

Margaret froze.

Harrison's gaze swept past her to Cassandra and Penelope. Cassandra shifted uncomfortably, while the usually arrogant Penelope stood shell-shocked.



Behind them, Victoria and Isabella watched with venomous expressions, jealousy twisting their features.

Cassandra attempted damage control. "Harrison, your grandmother spoke in anger earlier. Blood is thicker than water."

Harrison stood tall, radiating quiet elegance. She blinked slowly, long lashes fluttering as she regarded Margaret. "So you're saying you want me back in the family?"

Margaret nodded eagerly. "Harrison, we've always been family-"

"Pity," Harrison cut in sharply, "I no longer consider you family."

Margaret stiffened.

Harrison's clear gaze swept over the people before her. They'd inflicted wounds that once burned with pain. Now only ice remained.

"I was abandoned by all of you as a child," she said calmly. "While others had grandmothers and mothers - a family - I felt like an orphan. As you said earlier - our ties are severed. This time, it's my choice to walk away."

Turning to the security guard, she delivered her final words.

"I don't know these people. Please remove them."
###Chapter 318

Security personnel swiftly intervened. "Ladies, you need to leave now."

"Harrison, how could you do this to us...!"

With a sharp gesture, guards materialized and firmly escorted Margaret, Isabella, Penelope, Victoria, and Cassandra out of the building.

As they were being removed, Margaret nearly tripped, but Isabella and Penelope caught her arms.

"Grandmother, are you okay?"

Margaret violently shook them off, her glare icy. "Did you witness that? Harrison is the true prodigy!"

She had always regarded Isabella and Penelope as the Whitmore family's prized jewels. Never before had she spoken to them so harshly, but now her fury knew no bounds.

"Look at everything I've invested in you two! Private tutors, unlimited resources, and you barely scraped into Ivy League schools. Meanwhile, Harrison grew up in the countryside and now stands equal to Mr. Falcon! What utter disappointments you've become!"

Regret consumed Margaret like wildfire. Severing ties with Harrison was her greatest mistake.

Harrison was the genius who could have brought the Whitmore family unprecedented glory.

Together, Isabella and Penelope couldn't hold a candle to Harrison.

The sisters stood frozen, faces drained of color, too terrified to defend themselves. All their past insults to Harrison now made them look like pathetic fools in her eyes.

Victoria stepped forward hesitantly. "Mother—"

"Silence!" Margaret snapped, her glare venomous. "You're the most worthless of them all!"

Victoria stiffened. In that moment, she hated Harrison with every fiber of her being. How could the child they'd discarded become this brilliant?

"I can't stand the sight of any of you! You're giving me a migraine!" Margaret hissed before storming away.

"Margaret!"

"Grandmother!"

Penelope, Victoria, and Cassandra hurried after her.

Isabella remained rooted in place, jaw clenched so tightly she tasted blood.

Why did it have to be Harrison? The genius freshman, Nathaniel's junior! Would he regret his choices now?

Who wouldn't be drawn to such brilliance? Today Nathaniel discovered the housewife who'd orbited him for three years was actually a genius who could stand as his equal. Would he fall for her now?

Nathaniel didn't get another chance to speak with Harrison, as Rosalind arrived.

Rosalind practically vibrated with excitement. "Harrison, is it really you? The prodigy?"

Harrison smiled. "In person."

"Oh my god! Harrison, I swear I'm completely obsessed with you," Rosalind gushed, admiration overflowing.

Harrison chuckled. "We should head back."

The Global Scholars Forum had concluded. After bidding farewell to Julian and others, Harrison left with Rosalind.

They planned to return to their dorm.

Just then, Nathaniel's tall silhouette appeared. His voice was deep and smooth. "Let me drive you home."

He wanted Harrison with him.

Before she could respond, Lucas Harrington, the tech mogul, approached, his gaze intent. "Harrison, where are you headed? My car is waiting."

He too wanted to chauffeur Harrison.

Rosalind's eyes darted between the two powerful men, realization dawning.

Both wanted to take Harrison home. Which would she choose?
###Chapter 319


Nathaniel hadn't anticipated Lucas Harrington's arrival. As a man himself, he immediately recognized the growing interest in Lucas's eyes whenever he looked at Harrison.

Lucas was clearly smitten with her.

Harrison glanced briefly at Nathaniel before turning to Lucas. "We'll go with you, Lucas."

Her choice was made without hesitation.

Nathaniel's sharp jaw tightened instantly.

Lucas beamed, opening the car door with a polished smile. "Ladies."

Harrison and Rosalind slid into the sleek vehicle.

Rosalind shot Nathaniel a look—part pity, part satisfaction. Served him right for treating Harrison so poorly. Now, she wanted nothing to do with him.

Nathaniel moved forward, but before he could take another step, a hand clamped around his arm.

Isabella. She clung to him, forcing a saccharine smile. "Nathaniel, were you waiting for me?"

His gaze remained fixed on Harrison.

The luxury car was already pulling away, carrying Harrison with it.

She was gone.

Nathaniel wrenched his arm free. "I'm heading to the office. You can get home on your own."

He turned sharply toward his car.



Isabella's face paled. She darted in front of him, blocking his path. "Nathaniel, I want you to take me home!"

His expression was ice. Their relationship hadn't recovered since the incident with Rosalind. His voice was distant.

"I have work."

"Liar!" Her voice rose. "I heard everything! You and that tech mogul were practically fighting over Harrison. But when I ask, suddenly you're too busy?"

Nathaniel's face darkened. "Isabella."

Her name was a warning, his gaze sharp enough to cut. He had no patience for this.

She froze.

He stepped around her and got into his car.

Left standing alone, Isabella muttered bitterly, "Nathaniel, are you falling for Harrison? Of course you are! She's a genius. A woman like her could have anyone, yet she chose to marry a man in a coma for three years, playing the devoted wife just for you. If it were me, I'd be moved too!"

Her words made him stop. Slowly, he turned, his cold eyes locking onto her.

"You're right, Isabella. That's exactly what I think. Harrison is brilliant, yet she lowered herself to care for me. She's earned my heart. Why would I settle for you when I have her?"

The truth was out—Harrison had won him over.

Anyone could see it. His feelings for her ran deeper than mere admiration.

Isabella's face flushed with humiliation.



Nathaniel smirked. "You have no right to complain. You're the one who pushed her into my life."

Her face drained of color again. If she hadn't run when Nathaniel was in that accident—if she'd stayed—Harrison would never have entered the picture.

She had no one to blame but herself.

Without another word, Nathaniel got into his Rolls-Royce and sped off.

At Falcon Enterprises, Nathaniel leaned back in his black leather chair, scanning the documents on his desk.

Dominic entered briskly.

He lowered his voice. "Mr. Falcon, we've compiled all the information on Ms. Harrison. After sending her abusive foster father to prison, an anonymous sponsor funded her education. She accelerated through school, completing a dual master's at Westfield by sixteen."
###Chapter 320

Nathaniel studied the documents in his grasp, his gaze lingering on the blank space where the sponsor's name should be.

"Who funded Harrison's education?"

Dominic shook his head. "We haven't uncovered that information yet."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line, frustration flickering in his eyes. "What did Harrison do after graduating Westfield at sixteen?"

For someone of her caliber, graduation should have launched her career—just as it had for him. During his Westfield days, Nathaniel had already begun making waves in finance. By graduation, he'd taken his first company public on the Willowbrook exchange.

But Harrison? No career. No clear trajectory.

That puzzled him deeply.

"My apologies, Mr. Falcon. We found no records. After Ms. Harrison graduated, she vanished completely for two years."

Those missing years remained an enigma.

No traces. No leads.

"Then two years later," Dominic continued, "when you had your accident, Ms. Harrison suddenly reappeared in Willowbrook. The Whitmores arranged her marriage to you."

Nathaniel knew the rest.

He set the file down. "You're dismissed."

"Understood, Mr. Falcon."

Dominic exited.

Alone in his office, Nathaniel leaned back, pulling out his phone. Every entertainment headline screamed Harrison's name.

He studied the viral photos—Harrison in a crisp white blouse, high ponytail, standing at the podium. Her delicate features glowed under the lights, radiating an almost otherworldly beauty.

The media crowned her "the radiant prodigy."

Nathaniel lounged against the sofa, mind wandering. Never had he imagined the woman who'd orbited his world for three years was not just a genius, but his junior.

He'd even enrolled her at Willowridge University. The irony made him chuckle now.

Why had she married him?

Back then, he'd lain comatose after the crash. Doctors declared he'd never wake.

Even Isabella had fled.

Yet Harrison came. She married him.

Those should have been her prime years. Why waste them on a vegetable?

Nathaniel reopened the file. A photograph slipped out.

A younger Harrison in a white dress, beaming before a Westfield display case.

Nathaniel froze at what the case held.

The school's honor roll—his own photo still reigning supreme. Young Harrison stood beside it, books cradled in her arms. Her head tilted toward his image, face alight with adoration.

Their first photo together.

Nathaniel stood motionless as realization struck—Harrison had loved him long before they'd met.

In shadows he'd never seen, her heart had always been his.

Beneath the "radiant prodigy" photos, comments flooded in.

[I think I'm in love.]

[Me too!]

Isabella had asked if he'd fallen for Harrison.

The entire city swooned. And Nathaniel—just a man—couldn't deny being moved by such fierce, enduring devotion. He admitted it: he'd fallen hard.

Nathaniel opened Harrison's social media and typed a message.
###Chapter 321

Nathaniel's fingers hovered over his phone screen.

[Are you back at Willowridge?]

He needed to know if Harrison had returned safely. The thought of Lucas Harrington driving her home made his jaw clench.

Then his screen flashed.

A notification appeared.

[Message failed to send. You are not friends with this contact.]

His expression darkened.

She had blocked him.

Actually, she'd blocked him the day their divorce was finalized.

The realization hit him like a physical blow.

It was over.

She had loved him once—fiercely, passionately. But that was in the past.

"Nathaniel, I don't love you anymore."

Her voice, soft but firm, echoed in his mind. She had said it to his face.

He opened her profile.

Her username had changed from H to Harrison.

He sent a friend request.

No response.

She didn’t accept.

A melodic ringtone interrupted his thoughts.

Isabella.

She was calling.

Nathaniel didn’t answer.

A bitter smile curved his lips as shadows played across his sharp features.

At the Whitmore estate...

Isabella screamed in frustration when Nathaniel ignored her call.

She grabbed the nearest vase and hurled it against the wall.

Glass shattered everywhere.

Theodore and Victoria rushed in.

Victoria immediately reached for her daughter.

"Isabella! Stop! You’ll cut yourself!"

Isabella shoved her away.

"This is your fault! Why did you have Harrison? Why is she so perfect? Grandmother adores her now! Nathaniel won’t even answer my calls! I hate her!"

Victoria stood frozen, heartbroken.

Theodore stepped forward.

"Sweetheart, calm down. You know your heart can’t take this stress."

"But Dad!" Isabella sobbed. "Harrison was just some nobody! She dropped out at sixteen, and now she’s some genius! What if Nathaniel falls for her? Eleanor already dislikes me! And Gabrielle Lincoln hates me now! When will I finally marry Nathaniel?"

Theodore pulled her into a hug.

"Don’t worry. We’ll make it happen. You will marry Nathaniel Hawk."

Isabella stormed to her room and collapsed onto the bed.

Theodore returned to the living room, where the maids had already cleaned up the broken glass.

The news played on the TV.

"Billionaire Henry Lancaster has returned to the capital after years abroad. He was spotted yesterday at Queenswood Cemetery. The world’s richest man continues his decades-long search for his missing daughter."

The screen cut to a rainy cemetery.

A tall, distinguished man stood silently before a gravestone. His butler held a black umbrella over him.

Raindrops slid off the fabric, obscuring his face.

The somber scene held an air of haunting mystery.
###Chapter 322

Nathaniel's hand shot out, silencing the television with a sharp click.

Victoria approached, her eyes brimming with concern. "Theodore, is Isabella resting?"

Her voice carried a honeyed tenderness.

"She wept herself to exhaustion moments ago. Darling, Isabella has but one desire - to wed Mr. Falcon. Can't you make this happen for her?"

Nathaniel's face darkened like a gathering storm. "Explain yourself."

"Sweetheart," Victoria pressed, "I know the truth. Isabella isn't even your blood!"

His lips pressed into a thin line, silent as a tomb.

"Isabella comes from noble lineage. If you'd only reveal her true heritage, all barriers would vanish. She could marry Mr. Falcon," Victoria insisted, her tone growing more urgent.

Nathaniel rose like a thunderclap, his voice cutting through the air. "Never speak of this again! Keep your mouth shut."

With that final warning, he ascended the staircase.

Victoria's frustration boiled over. "Why won't you acknowledge Isabella's true birthright, Theodore?"

At the landing, Nathaniel stood unnaturally still, his calm demeanor belying the storm beneath. After a weighted pause, he confessed, "Isabella's mother doesn't want her returning to the Capital."

That woman again!

Victoria's eyes flashed with venom. No wonder Harrison, even after being banished to the countryside, emerged a prodigy. The bloodline was extraordinary.

But what did it matter?

All glory would ultimately belong to Isabella.



Though Nathaniel had rejected Victoria's proposal outright, she sensed his inner conflict. He did care for Isabella.

Soon, the truth would surface.

A sly smile curled Victoria's lips.

The next morning found Nathaniel in his office when Alistair's call interrupted his thoughts. The dean had just returned from his business trip.

"Nathaniel, are you free for lunch today? Join us," Alistair invited.

He wanted Nathaniel to dine at the Whitmore residence.

Having pulled an all-nighter at the office, Nathaniel rubbed his temples with a groan. "Uncle Alistair, I'm swamped today."

"Pity. I've already invited Rosalind and Harrison."

Harrison was dining at the Whitmores'?

Nathaniel's answer came instantly. "I'll be there shortly."

Within thirty minutes, Nathaniel arrived at the Whitmore estate. Harrison and Rosalind hadn't yet appeared.

Alistair adjusted his glasses with an amused smirk. "Nathaniel, didn't you claim to be busy? Yet here you stand."

Nathaniel's gaze swept the room like a searchlight.



"Save your effort," Alistair chuckled. "Harrison and Rosalind are still en route."

Nathaniel settled onto the living room sofa, his stare unwavering.

"The rumors reached me," Alistair continued, clearly entertained. "Now all of Willowridge University knows Harrison, the 'Sleeping Goddess,' is actually a genius. No wonder when she dozed in my lecture, she could correct my error the moment her eyes opened. Nathaniel, your wife is quite the hidden treasure."

Alistair remained unaware of their divorce.

Nathaniel offered no reply.

Alistair changed tack. "Incidentally, Rosalind's birthmark vanished suddenly. She claims Harrison gave her some horribly bitter candy."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly. "I'm not entirely certain about that. When I asked Harrison, she said..."

"What did she say?"

She'd refused to tell him!

Just then, Beatrice's cheerful voice rang out. "Ms. Whitmore, you've returned!"

Hearing this, Nathaniel assumed Harrison and Rosalind had arrived.

His gaze snapped toward the doorway.
###Chapter 323

Rosalind had returned.

But she came back alone - Harrison wasn't with her.

Alistair asked, puzzled, "Bebe, why are you alone? Where's Harrison?"

Rosalind explained, "She had prior commitments and couldn't make it today."

Nathaniel looked at Rosalind, his lips pressing into a thin line. "What commitments could she possibly have?"

Rosalind flashed a knowing smile. "If you're that curious, I'll tell you. Harrison went out to enjoy herself."

Harrison went out to enjoy herself?

"Where exactly did she go?"

"To Wintervale. I heard the first snowfall is coming soon, so Harrison went with the group to witness it. Oh, and Lucas went with her too."

Nathaniel's memory stirred. Yesterday, Julian had mentioned taking everyone to Wintervale for the snow, but Nathaniel had declined. He hadn't expected Harrison and Lucas to go together.

Rosalind chuckled. "Nathaniel, I think Lucas is quite taken with Harrison. He personally drove to pick her up this morning. Now you won't need to worry about introducing her to any CEOs."

She feigned a sigh. "Some men are blind though. They hold a diamond in their hands yet chase after worthless stones. Now that diamond might be claimed by someone else."

Nathaniel remained silent.

Rosalind hadn't directly insulted him, but her words struck deep.

Harrison was the diamond, and Isabella was the worthless stone. Rosalind was mocking him for losing the treasure and settling for a pebble.



Harrison arrived at Wintervale accompanied by several senior students from her university and top scholars from various prestigious families. The lively group of about ten included Lucas among them.

They stayed at a luxurious seaside resort where Wintervale was visible right from their doorstep.

A female student handed Harrison her room key. "Harrison, you're in Room 608." Harrison accepted it with a smile. "Thank you."

Lucas glanced at his own key - 612. Too far from Harrison's room. He immediately swapped with another student. "Mind trading for Room 609?"

Everyone noticed Lucas's interest in Harrison and teased him. "Room 609 faces Harrison's directly! Looks like Lucas wants to be closer!"

"Seems Lucas has fallen for Harrison and is making his move."

Lucas met Harrison's gaze, his eyes sparkling. "A lady of such grace deserves proper courtship. Quiet now, or you'll embarrass Harrison."

The group laughed. His protective instincts were showing even before anything official. Clearly, Lucas was serious about Harrison.

He approached Harrison. "Do you enjoy watching snow?"

Harrison nodded. "I've loved snow since childhood. My father and I made a promise to visit Wintervale together for the first snowfall."

A female student asked, "Where is your father now? Why didn't he come with you?"

Back then, Harrison's father was still alive. He'd built her a swing. On snowy days, he'd stand behind her holding an umbrella while pushing her higher into the air - her favorite winter memory.



He'd promised, "They say Wintervale has the most beautiful snow. Next year, I'll take you there to see it."

The next year, he was gone forever.

Harrison smiled faintly. "My father passed away."

The students offered comforting pats on her shoulder.

Lucas said gently, "It's alright. Though your father can't be here, we'll share this moment with you."

The mood lightened.

"The weather station predicts Wintervale's first snowfall will arrive soon. Let's drop our bags in our rooms and head out together to witness winter's first snow."
###Chapter 324

The group dispersed to their respective rooms.

Harrison placed her suitcase by the bed and pulled out her phone. A notification flashed - Nathaniel's friend request stared back at her from the screen.

They were divorced now. He had Isabella. Harrison refused to reopen that chapter of her life. She declined the request without hesitation.

Stepping into the hallway, she collided with Lucas Harrington emerging from the opposite suite. His lips curved into an easy smile. "Harrison, I'm right here if you need anything."

She returned the smile briefly. "Noted."

The students regrouped in the lobby, venturing out into Wintervale's expansive landscape.

"Harrison, look!" Lucas pointed upward as the first snowflakes began their graceful descent. Like powdered sugar, they dusted the deserted streets, transforming the world into a monochrome wonderland.

Beyond the shore, cerulean waves clashed violently with the snowy coast - nature's perfect dichotomy of fire and ice. Breathtaking. Devastating.

Harrison tightened her white parka against the biting wind. Her porcelain skin flushed crimson at the nose and eyelids, yet she pressed forward relentlessly.

Wintervale's snowscape unfolded exactly as her father had promised. Beautiful. Brutal.

"This place is incredible!" The other students scattered like excited children.

A film of moisture clouded Harrison's vision as she approached the roaring shoreline. Cupping her frozen hands around her mouth, she shouted into the gale, "Dad! I made it to Wintervale!"

The lighthouse trembled under the ocean's assault, its answering roar vibrating through Harrison's bones. For the first time since his passing, the weight in her chest lightened.

Lucas observed her silently. No winter scene could rival her ethereal beauty in that moment.

One of the male students elbowed him. "Stop staring and go to her, man. This is literally a romance novel moment."

Lucas's eyes lit with sudden inspiration. "Give me five minutes." He sprinted back toward the hotel.

Harrison extended her palm, catching delicate snow crystals. They melted instantly against her skin, each one a fleeting moment of joy.

Then - darkness. A black umbrella materialized above her head.

"Lucas..." Her smile faltered as she turned.

Nathaniel stood there instead.

Impeccable in his charcoal overcoat and slate turtleneck, he might have stepped from the pages of a luxury magazine. The snowflakes swirling around him only enhanced his aristocratic bearing.

Harrison's breath caught. He'd claimed he wouldn't come to Wintervale. Yet here he was, materializing at the most cinematic possible moment.

His gaze traced the cold-induced blush across her delicate features, the way her eyes shimmered like frost-kissed glass. The corner of his mouth lifted as he adjusted the umbrella.

"Your hands must be freezing."
###Chapter 325

Harrison shoved her freezing hands deeper into her coat pockets, the snowflakes melting against her skin.

"Nathaniel, I brought you..."

Lucas reappeared, clutching a pair of cashmere-lined gloves. He'd sprinted back to Silver Pines Hotel when he noticed Harrison's reddened fingers.

But Nathaniel had beaten him to it. The imposing CEO now stood beside Harrison, both sheltered beneath his black umbrella.

Lucas's shoulders slumped. His thoughtful gesture suddenly felt pointless.

He approached the pair. "Nathaniel, what brings you here?"

Though Lucas had graduated top of his class at Westfield, he still felt like a schoolboy in Nathaniel's presence.

The alumni crowd swarmed closer. "Nathaniel! You said you weren't attending. What changed?"

Curiosity buzzed through the group like static.

Nathaniel's gaze swept over them. "Business nearby," he said, voice like velvet over steel.

Harrison's eyes narrowed. Business? In this remote ski town? The coincidence stretched credibility.

"Stay with us!" someone begged. "We're hitting the fondue place tonight!"

"Snow and cheese - perfect pairing!"

"You're buying, right Nathaniel?"

The billionaire merely nodded. "Of course."

At The Velvet Lounge, the group claimed a window booth. Several alumni tugged Harrison toward their end. "Sit with us, Harrison!"

They adored the petite genius, treating her like a kid sister.

Lucas moved to claim the seat beside her - natural since they were the youngest. But Nathaniel's commanding voice cut through the chatter. "Lucas. Sit here."

He indicated the chair beside his own at the head of the table.

Chuckles erupted. "Go on, Lucas. When Nathaniel calls..."

"Honestly, you remind me so much of him at your age."

Lucas was Westfield's golden boy - tech CEO before thirty, with the same razor-sharp intellect as Nathaniel. Some even called him "Mini Nathaniel."

Reluctantly, Lucas changed course. "I'm not in Nathaniel's league. But I'll keep trying."

The fondue pots arrived - one classic, one flaming with chili. Outside, snow swirled; inside, steam curled from bubbling cheese.

Nathaniel watched Harrison from across the table. She dunked crusty bread into the spicy pot, cheeks flushing pink. Her lips glistened, redder than the chili oil.

Lucas couldn't look away. "You like it hot?"

Harrison nodded. "Mmhm."

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around his fork. Since when did she enjoy spicy food? He remembered her wincing at black pepper.

The alumni turned to Harrison. "So what have you been doing since graduation?"

Everyone leaned in. The prodigy's post-college life was a mystery. As far as they knew, she wasn't employed anywhere.
###Chapter 326

Harrison hesitated for a brief moment, her delicate fingers tightening around the silverware before responding truthfully. "I was married."

Silence fell over the group.

Lucas Harrington's eyes widened in shock. "Harrison, you're married?"

Nathaniel's piercing gaze burned into her skin. Those dark eyes always made her feel exposed. She forced herself to ignore him, offering a soft smile.

"Yes, so these past few years... I've been focused on being a homemaker. Taking care of my husband became my entire world."

It wasn't a lie. For three years, she'd lived in complete isolation, orbiting Nathaniel's universe.

The reactions were immediate. "Harrison, you gave up your career to be a housewife?"

"We divorced recently," she added quietly.

The revelation caused even greater astonishment.

"The man who convinced Harrison to become a housewife must have been extraordinary."

"Harrison, who was your husband—I mean, ex-husband?"

Curiosity about her former spouse became palpable. Everyone wanted to know what kind of man could capture Harrison's heart.

Her eyes drifted toward the man seated opposite her.

Nathaniel sat motionless, his utensils untouched. She remembered his aversion to spicy food—he always preferred milder flavors.

His intense gaze locked onto her face, mirroring the group's curiosity, waiting for her response.

How should she answer?

Her ex-husband was indeed remarkable, and he was currently sitting among them.

Harrison turned back to the group with a gentle smile. "That chapter is closed. Let's toast to new beginnings instead."

The others, sensing her reluctance, didn't press further. Glasses lifted around the table.

"To fresh starts."

As crystal clinked against crystal, Nathaniel remained at the head of the table. The light caught his platinum watch as he sipped mineral water with effortless grace.

"Harrison, now that you're back, you must be considering work. Why not join us?"

She declined immediately. While she did have employment, it wasn't something she could discuss openly. "Thank you, but I'm based in Willowbrook now. It wouldn't be practical."

"Willowbrook? Nathaniel's headquarters are there too."

"Nathaniel, Harrison was your junior. You should help her—maybe offer her a position at Falcon Enterprises."

Harrison struggled to formulate a polite refusal.

Nathaniel's attention remained fixed on her. She'd removed her cream-colored coat, her raven hair loosely secured with a simple tie. A few strands had escaped, brushing against her porcelain neck. The effect was ethereal—pure and breathtaking.

When their eyes met, she said, "There's no need to trouble Mr. Falcon—"

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly as he interrupted. "Why do you insist on calling me Mr. Falcon? My name is Nathaniel."

Her pulse stuttered.

"Harrison, that's hilarious! You call everyone by their first names except Nathaniel."

"If you're in Willowbrook, you'd better get on his good side. Go ahead—say 'Nathaniel.'"

The group, enjoying the tension, encouraged her to use his first name.
###Chapter 327

Harrison felt like she was standing too close to a blazing fire. What game was Nathaniel playing? Did he seriously expect her to call him by his first name?

He was clearly toying with her again.

She shot him a sharp look. Nathaniel merely smirked, visibly amused by her reaction.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the tense moment. It felt like divine intervention. Harrison immediately stood up. "Please excuse me, everyone. I need to take this."

Stepping into the hallway, she answered the call. It was Oliver. "Harrison, I've arrived in Willowbrook. Where are you?"

"I'm currently in Wintervale, but I'll be returning in a couple days."

"Alright, I'll wait for you then."

As Harrison ended the call and turned to leave, she collided with a solid, warm chest.

"Oh!"

Her phone slipped from her grasp, tumbling toward the floor.

She lunged to catch it.

But a large, masculine hand intercepted the device mid-fall. Harrison looked up into Nathaniel's striking features. What was he doing out here?

"Mr. Falcon, return my phone!" she demanded.

She reached for it, but Nathaniel held it just beyond her grasp.

What was his problem now?

Rising on her toes, she strained toward him. "That's my property. Give it back!"

Nathaniel gazed down at her with those intense dark eyes. "I'll return it... if you call me Nathaniel."

He'd followed her just for this ridiculous demand.

Harrison tilted her chin defiantly. "Not happening. I don't need your help, and I'm certainly not joining your company."

His lips curved. "So you're not interested in employment?"

He could understand her not working these past years - she'd been caring for him.

But still refusing now?

Harrison wasn't about to reveal her true circumstances. Her bright eyes danced as she replied, "I could never compete with you. You had your first IPO right after graduation. Me? Just a simple housewife, completely disconnected from the real world."

She was deliberately downplaying herself.

Nathaniel couldn't tell if she was serious, but her sparkling wit and vitality captivated him like stars in the night sky.

"So what are your plans then?" he asked softly.

"What plans? Maybe I'll fall in love again, remarry. If I land someone like you, perhaps I'll score big in the divorce and never work again."

Nathaniel gently grasped her chin. "Harrison, I'm being serious."

"So am I. Let go."

She pushed his hand away.

Just then, approaching footsteps and voices interrupted them - Lucas and another colleague were walking down the hall.

"Lucas, I had no idea Harrison was previously married. You're still pursuing her?"

"Divorced, actually. And absolutely I am."

"Seems you're really serious about her."

"She's different. Not like other women I've met."

Their voices faded as they walked away.

Harrison had heard every word. Lucas's interest in her was unmistakable.

Earlier during dinner, she'd deliberately mentioned her past marriage hoping to discourage him.
###Chapter 328

Nathaniel's fingers dug into Harrison's chin with bruising force, making her wince.

"That hurts," she protested, her delicate features twisting in discomfort.

A sardonic smile played on his lips. "I never knew you were this captivating."

He'd witnessed countless men fall under her spell—Lucas Harrington being the most distinguished among them. Even a married woman couldn't deter their advances.

Seizing her chance, Harrison snatched her phone back. "No matter how captivating I am, I could never win your heart."

She turned to walk away.

Before she could take a step, his muscular arm banded around her waist, yanking her flush against his chest.

Their bodies molded together, the thin fabric of their clothes doing little to mask the heat between them.

Harrison squirmed. "Let go or I'll scream!"

"Harrison... have we met before?"

She froze.

Nathaniel produced the photograph—the one showing her standing before a shop window displaying his framed picture.

Her eyes widened in shock. How had he gotten hold of this?

His intense gaze never left her face as he repeated, "Harrison, did we know each other before?"

Her mind reeled. This wasn't part of the plan. That photo was never supposed to surface.

Did he truly not remember their time in the cave? Should she remind him?

But he belonged to Isabella now—he loved Isabella.

Harrison pressed against his broad chest, her lithe body twisting in his grasp. "Does it even matter?"

Her serpentine movements sent electric currents through Nathaniel's long-dormant body. His breathing grew ragged as his large hand splayed across her lower back.

His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Harrison... how long have you wanted me?"

The question stunned her. Would he use this confession against her later?

He had no right!

Rising on her toes, Harrison sank her teeth into the corner of his mouth.

Nathaniel hissed as copper flooded his tongue. Swallowing the pain, his voice turned velvety. "Not here. We might get caught."

That tone—gentle, indulgent, dripping with desire—was one she hadn't heard in years. Harrison released him and stepped back.

His smoldering gaze tracked her every move. "When did you become so bold?"

A defiant glint entered her eyes. "I've always been bold. I just tempered it when I was taking care of you."

Her expression held layers of unspoken emotions—resentment mingling with playful challenge.

Without warning, Nathaniel captured her lips.

Harrison's world tilted. This was their first kiss since the divorce.

She struggled, but his hand cradled the back of her head, holding her captive. His commanding presence overwhelmed her as he coaxed her lips apart, initiating a slow, intoxicating dance.

Though they'd both eaten fondue earlier, Nathaniel had barely touched his food. His taste remained pristine—that aristocratic purity untouched by worldly corruption.
###Chapter 329

"Nathaniel, release me!"

Harrison shoved him back with surprising strength. Nathaniel's darkened gaze burned with hunger as he moved to claim her lips again.

"Stop! We're divorced now! Remember Isabella!" Harrison's voice cracked through the tension.

The name hit Nathaniel like an arctic blast, freezing his movements. Harrison seized the moment to push past him, fleeing down the corridor.

Nathaniel remained rooted, grappling with conflicting emotions. Isabella was his responsibility - he owed her that much.

Yet Harrison's pull was undeniable. She was his addiction, his weakness wrapped in silk and fire.

After the group finished their meal, they returned to Silver Pines Hotel.

Nathaniel walked with two colleagues while Harrison and Lucas led the way ahead.

He stole a glance. Lucas was whispering something that made Harrison throw her head back in laughter.

"Nathaniel, you're in Room 621. That work for you?"

His expression remained unreadable. "Where's Lucas staying?"

"Room 609 - right across from Harrison. They'd make such a perfect couple! We should give them some space to connect."

Everyone seemed determined to play matchmaker for Harrison and Lucas.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "They're completely incompatible."

His blunt statement made the others exchange surprised looks.

"I'll take Room 607," Nathaniel declared.

One colleague immediately produced his keycard. "That's mine. Happy to switch."

Nathaniel pocketed the card with a curt nod. "Appreciated."

He disappeared into his room without another word.

The group huddled in the hallway. "Why would Nathaniel want to be across from Harrison?"

"Did you hear how he shut down the idea of Lucas and Harrison? Sounded almost... jealous."

"You don't think...?"

"Honestly, they'd be electric together."

Someone pulled out their phone, displaying a photo from earlier - Nathaniel and Harrison standing beneath a black umbrella, snowflakes swirling around them. The aristocratic CEO and the ethereal beauty looked like something from a fairy tale.

Inside his room, Nathaniel showered and collapsed onto the bed. He grabbed his phone, checking Facebook - still no acceptance from Harrison.

His brow furrowed as he sent another friend request. The note simply read: [Accept.]

Just one word. Commanding. Expectant.

Silence.

She was still ignoring him.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, closing his eyes.

Later, his door clicked open. A slender silhouette slipped inside.

Harrison.

Fresh from the shower, she wore nothing but his oversized white shirt, her toned legs bare. The sight was devastating.

She slid under the covers beside him.

Nathaniel felt her warm body shifting closer. The blanket lifted as Harrison peeked out, her playful smile illuminated by moonlight.

"Awake?"

Nathaniel's eyes flew open, every nerve ending suddenly alert.
###Chapter 330
Nathaniel lay motionless, his eyes fixed on the ceiling as reality slowly seeped back in.

It had all been a dream.

Harrison had visited him in his sleep.

His throat constricted. Muscles coiled tight. Every nerve ending buzzed with the restless energy of a man at dawn.

Nathaniel’s hand slid beneath the sheets. His eyelids fluttered shut as he surrendered to the moment.

Outside, snow blanketed the landscape after an entire night of falling. The group had planned a ski trip today.

Everyone had gathered—except Nathaniel.

"Where’s Nathaniel?"

"I’ll go check on him."

Just as they turned to leave, his bedroom door swung open.

"Morning," Nathaniel muttered.

His chiseled features gave nothing away, but the icy aura around him was warning enough. Keep your distance.

"Nathaniel’s here! Let’s head out."

His gaze instantly zeroed in on Harrison standing beside Lucas.

"Harrison, did you see the message I sent you earlier?" Lucas asked.

Harrison nodded. "Yes, I did."

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a humorless smile. "You two are connected on social media?"

Lucas shrugged. "Obviously."



A chorus of voices chimed in from nearby. "We’re all connected with Harrison. Aren’t you?"

Nathaniel said nothing.

So, she’d accepted everyone’s friend request—except his?

The already foul mood darkened further. His obsidian eyes locked onto Harrison with predatory intensity.

Harrison shivered.

Why was he looking at her like that? As if he wanted to consume her whole.

She had her reasons for rejecting his request. She wanted nothing to do with him anymore.

"Alright, let’s move out!"

Half an hour later, they arrived at the ski resort.

As everyone geared up, one of the girls frowned at Harrison. "You don’t know how to ski?"

Harrison shook her head.

"Lucas, you’re on teaching duty. Harrison, he’s practically a pro. Have fun!"

Lucas glided effortlessly across the snow, executing sharp turns before stopping before Harrison. He held out his hands. "Trust me. I’ll teach you."

"Thanks," Harrison said, placing her hands in his.



With Lucas’s guidance, Harrison quickly picked up the basics. Soon, she was skiing on her own, laughter bubbling up as she gained confidence.

Then—

"Look out!"

A skier hurtled toward her, out of control.

Harrison froze. Her legs refused to move.

A blur shot past. Strong arms wrapped around her, yanking her down just in time.

They tumbled across the snow, rolling downhill in a tangled heap.
###Chapter 331

Everything occurred in a heartbeat. Harrison looked up to see Nathaniel's striking aristocratic features.

In that critical moment before impact, Nathaniel had lunged to shield her.

Why would he do such a thing?

"Mr. Falcon?"

Their bodies tumbled violently downward as a jagged boulder rushed toward them. A collision was inevitable.

Nathaniel's muscular arms enveloped Harrison completely. "Hold onto me," he murmured urgently.

Instinct took over. Harrison clutched at Nathaniel's broad shoulders.

A sickening crunch echoed as they slammed into the rock, their momentum halted abruptly.

Harrison found herself sprawled atop Nathaniel's protective embrace. She scrambled up immediately. "Did you hit your head?"

In that final moment, Nathaniel had twisted forcefully to take the impact himself. His skull had connected with the stone with terrifying force.

Miraculously, Harrison felt no pain. His iron grip had shielded her completely from harm.

Now Nathaniel lay motionless, his eyes shut, unresponsive.

Panic surged through Harrison. "Mr. Falcon? Nathaniel! Open your eyes! Don't do this to me!"

Still no response.

As Harrison tried to rise and call for help, a strong hand suddenly seized her slender wrist, pulling her back down effortlessly.

Nathaniel's eyes fluttered open, his lips quirking in that infuriating smirk. "Why so panicked?"

Harrison froze.



That arrogant grin widened. "Weren't you the one who claimed not to love me anymore? Your concern says otherwise. Caught you red-handed."

He'd been faking it?

Relief nearly brought tears to Harrison's eyes. She balled her fist and punched his shoulder hard. "Nathaniel, you absolute bastard!"

Her legs still trembled from the adrenaline crash. The fear had drained every ounce of strength from her.

Nathaniel tightened his hold. "Stay still!"

Something in his strained voice alarmed her. His complexion had turned ashen - clear evidence of genuine injury.

Harrison carefully cradled his head, searching for wounds. "Are you bleeding? Let me check."

Head injuries could be deadly.

Nathaniel fought through the dizziness to capture her searching hand. "I'm fine. Just...stop squirming. Let me hold you."

Harrison stilled, obediently settling against him.

He'd gotten hurt saving her. Pretending indifference was impossible. Even after everything, he'd still risked himself for her.

"Nathaniel, don't ever do that again. I don't need your protection."

The ungrateful little minx.

Nathaniel pinched her chilled cheek in retaliation. The resort's frigid air had turned her porcelain skin rosy. "Harrison," he growled, "must you provoke me every single day?"
Harrison swatted Nathaniel's hand away. "Stop that!"



Nathaniel's eyes darkened when he noticed how cold she was being with him. She never acted this way around Lucas Harrington. With him, she'd been all smiles and laughter, her face glowing with warmth.

He released her cheek with a pained grunt. "My head is killing me."

Instantly, Harrison's expression softened with concern. "Where does it hurt?"

Nathaniel pointed to his temple. "Right here."

She leaned closer, her delicate fingers carefully parting his neatly trimmed hair. A nasty red bump stared back at them.

The impact had left quite a mark.

"Here?" she asked gently.

"Yeah."

"Let me help."

Harrison began massaging the swollen area with feather-light touches, her breath cooling the injury as she blew on it softly.

They'd drifted dangerously close without realizing. Her face was mere inches from his, those full lips pursed as she tended to his wound. Nathaniel inhaled sharply, her signature vanilla and sandalwood perfume flooding his senses.

Suddenly, the vivid memory of last night's forbidden dream crashed over him. His throat went dry.

###Chapter 332
Nathaniel slowly turned his striking features toward Harrison.

Harrison was focused on tending to the swelling on his forehead, oblivious to their compromising position. Then Nathaniel suddenly shifted, and she felt the unexpected brush of his lips against hers.

His cool mouth met her soft ones in a fleeting kiss.

Harrison's wide emerald eyes froze in shock.

Nathaniel regarded her steadily. "Harrison, you kissed me." His accusation hung in the frosty air.

She opened her mouth to protest when Lucas Harrington's voice cut through the silence. "Harrison? Harrison!"

"She was just skiing over here! Where'd she go?" The search party had noticed her absence.

"I'm—" Harrison began.

Nathaniel's large hand cradled her head, pulling her into another searing kiss.

What the hell?

She struggled against his iron grip as he deepened the kiss, his tongue claiming her mouth.

Lucas's footsteps crunched nearby. "Harrison? Where are you?"

Her heart hammered against her ribs. Lucas stood mere feet away while she lay tangled with Nathaniel behind the boulder, locked in their scandalous embrace.

Nathaniel's breathing grew ragged. The woman straddling him had no idea how tightly she was gripping his tongue—or how her knees pressed dangerously against his growing arousal.

"Lucas, she's not here. Maybe she went to the lodge?"

"Let's check the other slope."

As their voices faded, Harrison sagged with relief. Being discovered like this would ruin everything.

Nathaniel wasn't just Willowbrook's elusive billionaire—he was its golden prince. No one knew his darker side. Except her.

She shoved against his chest, wiping her mouth furiously. "What was that?"

Nathaniel lay back in the snow, shielding his darkened gaze. "You started it. I finished it. We're even."

"That's not—" Harrison scrambled off him.

Nathaniel sat up, catching her wrist. "Accept my friend request." His command brooked no argument.

"Never!"

His grip tightened as he pulled her flush against him. "Would you prefer we continue where we left off?" His whisper burned against her ear.

Harrison stiffened as someone glanced their way. With trembling fingers, she yanked out her phone. "Fine!"

She accepted his Facebook request with an angry tap.

"Happy? You're clearly not dying. Let's go."

Nathaniel caught her again.

"What now?"

His piercing gaze held hers. "You still haven't answered me, Harrison. Have we met before?"

If he wanted the truth so badly...

"Nathaniel, we—"
###Chapter 333

"Harrison, we've met before!" Nathaniel froze at the declaration.

Had they?

His mind raced through every memory, but nothing came to mind. When could he have possibly crossed paths with her?

Yet, there was something about Harrison that tugged at him—an inexplicable pull that drew him closer without reason.

"We actually—"

Harrison reached for her neck, fingers brushing bare skin where the crystal pendant should have been.

It wasn't there.

She'd left it in her room.

"Wait here," she said, already stepping back. "I need to show you something."

Before he could respond, she was gone, leaving Nathaniel standing in the snow, questions swirling.

What could she possibly bring that would explain this strange familiarity?

Harrison sprinted back to the Silver Pines Hotel, heart pounding. The pendant lay on the dresser, its delicate chain coiled like a sleeping serpent.

She snatched it up, pressing the cool crystal into her palm.

Would he recognize it?

Would it spark a memory?

Would he finally remember her?

She had to try.

The return trip felt endless. When the ski resort came into view, she spotted Nathaniel still waiting—just as she'd left him.

Her steps faltered.

Isabella stood beside him.

She'd flown in from Willowbrook, her presence slicing through the winter air like a blade.

Harrison stopped dead.

The warmth in her chest snuffed out.

How foolish she'd been.

He didn't remember. The pendant wouldn't change that.

If she'd mattered, he wouldn't have forgotten.

Isabella was the one he loved. The proof stood right there, wrapped in designer wool and possessive proximity.

Harrison's fingers tightened around the pendant. A bitter laugh rose in her throat.

Forget it.

She turned to leave.

A shadow moved behind her.

She whirled, pulse spiking.

Sebastian.

He'd followed her.

At the Global Scholars Forum, he'd discovered the woman he'd idolized—the one he'd been pursuing with roses and grand gestures—was Harrison. The same Harrison he'd dismissed for years.

Even now, his expression twisted with disbelief.

The girl he'd scorned was not only Westfield University's prodigy but also the object of his obsession.

Harrison arched a brow. "Sebastian. Are you stalking me now?"

His jaw clenched. "Tell me the truth. Are you really her?"

A smirk curled her lips as she stepped closer. "I already told you—your dream girl hates red roses."

Amusement glittered in her eyes, sharp enough to cut.

Sebastian's face darkened.

"Enjoy the snow," she tossed over her shoulder, walking away.

He didn't follow.

Ahead, Nathaniel hadn't expected Isabella's sudden appearance. "Why are you here?"

"Do I need permission?" Her voice turned brittle. "You ignored my calls. Dominic said this was a business trip, but Harrison came to Wintervale with friends. Quite the coincidence, don't you think?"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a line. "There's something I need to ask her."

"What?"

"I think... I've met Harrison before."

Isabella's breath hitched.

Had he figured it out?
###Chapter 334


Had Nathaniel realized that Isabella had been impersonating Harrison all this time?

Nathaniel scanned the area. He'd been waiting for what felt like hours, but Harrison never appeared. With a resigned exhale, he turned on his heel and walked away.

Isabella stepped in front of Sebastian, blocking his path. "Sebastian, now that Nathaniel is completely obsessed with Harrison, you have to help me."

Sebastian said nothing.

Inside, Isabella's nerves were fraying. She knew Sebastian had always been drawn to prodigies. Now that he knew Harrison was one, she couldn't shake the fear—would his loyalty shift?

No. She wouldn't allow it.

Without hesitation, Isabella gripped Sebastian's sleeve and launched into a venomous tirade.

"Sebastian, don't be fooled! Harrison might seem brilliant, but she's been manipulating you and Nathaniel this whole time. She only cares about the attention from the Global Scholars Forum. She's calculated. She knows exactly how to play men."

Sebastian remained silent for a beat before meeting her gaze. "What do you want me to do?"

A cold, predatory gleam flashed in Isabella's eyes. "Sebastian, I want Harrison gone."

Meanwhile, Harrison, Lucas, and the others returned to the Silver Pines Hotel.

"Where's Nathaniel? Why didn't he come back with us?" Lucas asked.

"Oh, his girlfriend showed up. He's probably with her now," one of the seniors replied.

Lucas paused. "Nathaniel has a girlfriend?"

"Yeah, Isabella—the principal ballerina. You've seen her perform, right? Elegant, porcelain skin, moves like a swan."

"Figures someone like him would have someone extraordinary."



"Right now, they're probably lost in each other. Let's not interrupt."

Lucas moved closer to Harrison, smiling. "Is Isabella really that stunning? To me, Harrison outshines everyone."

Harrison smiled faintly but stayed silent.

Another girl chimed in, "Beauty's subjective. Nathaniel probably thinks Isabella is perfection, just like you think Harrison is."

"Isabella's glamorous, but Harrison has that cool, untouchable aura. Depends on what a man prefers."

Laughter and chatter filled the air, but Harrison didn't join in. Right now, Nathaniel was likely wrapped up in Isabella.

Soon, everyone dispersed to their rooms.

Lucas turned to Harrison. "Rest for a bit. We'll grab lunch later."

Harrison nodded. "Sure."

She unlocked her door and stepped inside. Just then, her phone rang—Nathaniel's distinct, melodic tone.

Nathaniel was calling.

Harrison reached for it, but a sudden chill prickled her spine. Someone was behind her.



She whirled around, but before she could react, a shadowy figure lunged from behind the door. A blunt force struck the back of her skull.

Darkness swallowed her. She crumpled to the carpet, unconscious.

Her phone clattered to the floor, the call accidentally answered. Nathaniel's deep, urgent voice crackled through the speaker.

"I waited for you. Where are you? Harrison? Harrison!"
###Chapter 335

The snow had ceased in Wintervale, but the docks remained slick with icy moisture.

Isabella and Sebastian stood on the weathered planks, where a sleek yacht bobbed in the frigid water. A shadowy figure in black tossed Harrison's unconscious form onto the polished deck.

Sebastian's gaze darted between Harrison and Isabella. "Why bring her here? What did you do?"

Isabella's delicate brows knitted together. "Since when do you question me?" Her voice turned razor-sharp. "I see it now—you're changing. Your loyalty is slipping toward her."

"That's absurd," Sebastian countered instantly.

"Tell me," Isabella demanded, clutching her wool coat tighter, "do you still believe Nathaniel and I belong together?"

Sebastian nodded without hesitation. He'd always admired Isabella, convinced she was Nathaniel's perfect match. "Absolutely."

"Then prove it." Her eyes gleamed with icy determination. "You've despised Harrison for years, haven't you? She's helpless now. Take the yacht out and dump her in the ocean. Ensure she never resurfaces."

Sebastian went rigid. He'd assumed Isabella's earlier threats were empty, but her deadly seriousness chilled him more than the winter air.

His voice dropped to a whisper. "Isabella..."

"You're betraying me too?" Her breath hitched. She pressed a trembling hand to her chest, struggling for air. "First Nathaniel, now you—that scheming witch has poisoned you both! I can't—"

A ragged gasp cut her off.

"Isabella?" Sebastian reached for her, concern flashing across his face.

"My heart—Sebastian, please!" Her plea cracked with desperation. "Will you help me or not?"

Sebastian hesitated, then gave a stiff nod. "Fine. I'll do it."

He boarded the yacht, which soon vanished into the steel-gray horizon.

On the dock, Isabella's lips curled in triumph. She'd known Sebastian would obey.

As the yacht cut through the choppy waves, Sebastian stared down at Harrison's motionless form. Her porcelain features looked ethereal in the pale light.

He'd always resented her. This should be easy.

His hands hovered over her slender frame—then froze. An unfamiliar resistance coiled in his chest. He couldn't do it.

Back onshore, Isabella watched the water, anticipation thrumming through her veins. This was her masterstroke—with Sebastian as her accomplice, she'd own him completely.

Her phone shattered the silence.

Sebastian's voice crackled through the line, uneasy. "We can't. This is murder."

"What?" Isabella's nails bit into her palms. He'd failed her?

"Think about Nathaniel's reaction when he finds out. I'm bringing her back." The call died abruptly.

Isabella's face twisted with rage. Sebastian had defied her. Harrison would return.

The black-clad man beside her shifted. "Your orders?"

Isabella's smile turned venomous. "If Sebastian's loyalties lie with her now, they can drown together."

She withdrew a remote, pressing a button with manicured precision. A three-minute countdown flickered to life on the screen.

Useless pawns deserved to be eliminated.
###Chapter 336

Isabella had rigged the yacht beforehand, planting explosives beneath the deck.

The digital timer ticked relentlessly. Three minutes was all they had left before detonation.

Standing on the shore, Isabella watched the horizon with cold satisfaction.

"Sebastian, this is your own fault. Your heart belongs to Harrison now. You'll die together."

On board, Sebastian had just turned the wheel to return.

A towering wave crashed over the bow, icy spray hitting Harrison's face.

Her dark lashes fluttered open. Confusion clouded her vision as she took in her surroundings. "Sebastian? Where are we?" A dull throbbing pulsed behind her temples.

He spun toward her. "You're awake?"

Recognition flashed in Harrison's eyes as she saw the endless ocean stretching around them. Her voice turned glacial. "Why did you bring me here?"

"Me? Isabella told me to take you out! I may dislike you, but I'd never hurt you. We're heading back now."

Isabella again?

Harrison couldn't comprehend the woman's motives. Nathaniel had already divorced her. What more could she possibly want?

Then Harrison spotted it - the blinking red digits counting down. "What's that?"

Sebastian paled. "A bomb! How the hell did that get on board?"

Harrison's stomach dropped. Thirty seconds remained.

She grabbed Sebastian's arm. "We're out of time! It's going to blow!"

"Fuck! What do we do?"

Harrison scanned the churning waters. "We jump."

"Are you insane? That's the ocean!"

"Choose - explosion or drowning."

"I'm not jumping!" Sebastian roared.

Without hesitation, Harrison planted her foot between his shoulder blades. He pitched forward into the freezing abyss.

"God damn you!" His curse vanished beneath the waves.

Ten seconds left.

9...8...7...

Harrison didn't hesitate. She dove gracefully into the merciless sea.

BOOM!

The yacht erupted in a fireball that lit up the sky.

Back at the resort, Nathaniel kept getting the same automated message:

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

Where was she?

An inexplicable dread coiled in his gut.

He stormed back to the Silver Pines Hotel, heading straight for Room 608. The door swung open at his touch.

"Harrison? Where—"

His words died as he spotted her phone abandoned on the floor.

Lucas appeared in the doorway. "Harrison? Nathaniel, what are you doing here? Where is she?"

Nathaniel clenched the phone, his face darkening. "Something's happened to Harrison."

Lucas froze. "What?"

Nathaniel barreled past him, shouting for help.
###Chapter 337

Harrison's entire body screamed in agony, every muscle and bone protesting as if crushed beneath a mountain.

The cold was unbearable.

Freezing ocean waves slapped against her face, the icy water seeping into her very core. Shivering violently, she forced her eyes open.

She was alive.

The yacht had been rigged to explode. In those final moments, she and Sebastian had plunged into the merciless sea. The frigid water clawed at her from all sides, but she fought back with every ounce of strength.

Her petite frame channeled an extraordinary will to survive.

Eventually, the currents deposited her on a desolate shore under the cover of night. Harrison staggered to her feet.

"Sebastian? Sebastian!"

She'd kicked him overboard before the explosion. Where was he now?

Harrison scanned the dark coastline. "Sebastian! If you can hear me, answer me!"

Then she saw him - motionless on the sand a few yards away.

Harrison rushed forward. "Sebastian! Wake up!"

He remained unconscious, his right leg mangled and bleeding profusely.

The sand beneath him was already stained crimson.

Harrison examined the wound, her stomach twisting. Without immediate medical attention, he'd lose the leg.



She wasn't some naive do-gooder. If Sebastian hadn't dragged her out to sea, none of this would've happened. He'd been working with Isabella.

Part of her wanted to leave him there to rot.

Yet Harrison knew Sebastian wasn't truly evil. She had to help him.

But they were stranded in the middle of nowhere with no signs of civilization.

"Help! Someone help us!" Harrison screamed into the darkness.

Suddenly, a flashlight beam cut through the night. Two figures approached.

"Who's there?" a male voice called.

Harrison's heart leapt. "We're tourists! My friend is badly injured - please help!"

The men drew closer. This was Stonebridge, a remote fishing village. The leader was Adrian Blackwood, the village chief's son, followed by his younger brother Patrick.

Adrian's gaze locked onto Harrison's face. When he took in her delicate beauty, his eyes gleamed with sudden interest.

Harrison suppressed a shudder under his leering stare but kept her head bowed. "Can you help us?"

"Of course," Adrian said too quickly. "Come to our village. We'll have our doctor look at your... friend."

Harrison forced a grateful smile. "Thank you. We're in your debt."

They carried the unconscious Sebastian to a small cottage and laid him on a narrow bed. Soon the village physician arrived to examine the leg wound.



Sebastian stirred, his face ghostly pale as he took in their surroundings. "Where...?"

Harrison stepped forward. "You're awake. The waves brought us here. Adrian helped us."

Adrian's gaze never left Harrison. "What's your relation to him?"

"My brother-in-law," Harrison answered instantly.

Sebastian knew she was pretending Nathaniel was his brother, but still glared. "You wish."

Adrian's eyebrows shot up. "You're married?"

Harrison nodded firmly. "Three years now. My husband will have noticed we're missing by now. He'll come for us soon."

She met Adrian's gaze steadily. "And when he does, he'll reward you handsomely for helping us."
###Chapter 338

Harrison had deliberately provoked the situation. Now, trapped in this remote location with severely injured Sebastian, she found herself at the mercy of Adrian - the village chief's son whose predatory gaze made her skin crawl.

But Sebastian wouldn't play along with her charade. In his mind, Harrison had already divorced Nathaniel. Yet here she was, claiming they were still married? The audacity. Sebastian opened his mouth to protest when Harrison silenced him with a lethal glare. "Not a word!" Her fingers dug into his wound. "How are you still conscious through this pain?"

"Damn it, that hurts!" Sebastian gasped, sweat beading on his forehead. "I'll make you pay for this!"

The local physician shook his head gravely. "The leg injury is beyond my skills. I've stopped the bleeding, but he needs proper hospital treatment tomorrow."

Harrison cut him off. "We don't have until tomorrow. This needs to be addressed tonight."

The doctor frowned. "What do you propose?"

"Bone realignment," Harrison stated coolly.

Sebastian's eyes widened in horror. "You want to break my leg? Are you trying to cripple me?"

Harrison's lips curled into a chilling smile. "Precisely."

She turned to the physician. "Hold him down. This will be unpleasant."

Without hesitation, the doctor pinned Sebastian's thrashing legs.

"Let go of me!" Sebastian roared, desperation creeping into his voice. "Harrison, if you do this, I swear-"

Despite his violent struggles, Sebastian's injuries rendered him powerless against the doctor's grip. He could only watch in terror as Harrison approached.

Her hands closed around his leg. A sickening crack echoed through the room.

White-hot agony exploded through Sebastian's body, nearly lifting him off the cot. His muscles locked rigid, teeth grinding as he spat, "You vicious witch! With Nathaniel gone, you finally show your true colors! This is what you've wanted all along!"

"No wonder Nathaniel prefers Isabella! And you dare call yourself his wife? In my eyes, Isabella is the only woman for him!"

Pain-fueled rage consumed Sebastian's thoughts, directing all his hatred toward Harrison.

Harrison remained focused, her hands steady. She didn't even glance up, her voice calm. "I know you worship Isabella. Pity she's not here to save you. You're stuck with me."

"Harrison, you'll regret this!"

Another sharp crack filled the room. The unbearable pain suddenly halved. Sebastian collapsed back, gasping like a landed fish.

The physician gasped. "Bone regeneration? My God, it's the legendary technique! You're performing miracles!"

He stared at Harrison with newfound awe.

Sebastian paled. "What regeneration?"

The doctor quickly explained, "You misunderstood completely. She wasn't harming you - she was saving your leg! The injury would've likely required amputation, but this remarkable woman used bone regeneration. Your leg will recover fully!"

Sebastian froze. Had he misjudged Harrison?

She'd been helping him?

The doctor continued, "You owe her your gratitude. She saved your leg."

Sebastian stared at Harrison, stunned. He knew she was brilliant, but medical expertise? Healing abilities?

She'd been trying to save him while he hurled insults.

Guilt twisted in his chest. "Harrison..."
###Chapter 339


Harrison dried her hands with a linen cloth before fixing her gaze on Sebastian. "Whatever you're about to say, I hope it's not an apology."

Sebastian had been preparing to do just that, but her words lodged the confession in his throat.

Her voice was arctic, devoid of warmth.

"You tried to hurt me. Words won't erase that. Save your breath—I won't accept it."

Sebastian was speechless. In Willowbrook, he was the untouchable enforcer, feared by all except Nathaniel. No one dared speak to him like this.

His face paled with frustration.

"Rest now. Your leg should heal properly," Harrison added.

Sebastian's ashen features betrayed his exhaustion. Too weak to protest, he obeyed, closing his eyes.

She adjusted the blanket around him. She knew Sebastian had always favored Isabella, believing she belonged with Nathaniel. His cruelty hadn't surprised her. She'd grown numb to it.

Part of her wanted to leave him to suffer. But her healer's instincts refused to let her walk away.

Just then, Adrian entered with fresh clothes. "You're drenched. Change into these."

Sebastian had already changed. Now Adrian had brought women's garments for her.

A chill seeped into Harrison's bones. She hadn't noticed the cold while treating Sebastian, but now her soaked clothes clung like ice.

She accepted them gratefully. "Thank you, Adrian. I'll change here."



Harrison stepped into the room and began peeling off her wet clothes.

Footsteps approached the door. Someone was right outside while she was half-dressed.

She called out sharply, "Who's there?"

An awkward chuckle answered. "Harrison, it's me."

Adrian.

She'd been wary of him since their return. Though he'd helped them, his motives were clearly self-serving.

But she couldn't afford to antagonize him. Not with Sebastian injured and them at his mercy.

She forced neutrality into her tone. "What do you need?"

Adrian lingered at the door, peering through the crack. But Harrison stood just out of view.

His patience frayed. "Need help changing? Should I come in?"

He wanted entry.

Her refusal was immediate. "That won't be necessary."

His voice softened with false concern. "You're my guest. Let me take care of you. I'm coming in."

Without waiting, he pushed the door open.

Harrison stood fully dressed, composed. "I'm finished. Thank you."

Disappointment flashed across Adrian's face. She'd changed too quickly. He'd seen nothing.



His greedy eyes roved her delicate features as he stepped closer. "You must be freezing. My room's warmer..."

Harrison sidestepped, putting distance between them. "My brother-in-law needs medical attention. Excuse me."

###Chapter 340

Harrison slipped out of the room without a sound.

Nathaniel's gaze followed her retreating form, his expression darkening with barely contained frustration.



Night had fallen over Wintervale, and Sebastian was fast asleep. But Harrison couldn't bring herself to close her eyes. Not with Adrian lurking nearby.

Her claim of being married hadn't deterred him at all. His interest in her was still burning strong.

Harrison couldn't afford to let her guard down. Every instinct screamed that she and Sebastian weren't safe.

She sat alone by the door, the oppressive silence of the mountain village pressing in around her. The snow-covered landscape felt like a frozen wasteland, isolating them from the rest of the world.

A violent shiver wracked her body. The cold had seeped deep into her bones, and now a feverish heat was creeping up on her.

She had spent too long in the freezing sea. Even her normally resilient body was starting to give in.

Harrison pressed a hand to her forehead, forcing herself to stay awake. Falling asleep now would be dangerous.

Then, Nathaniel's face flashed through her mind.

What was he doing right now? Was he with Isabella? Had he even noticed they were missing? Would he come for them?

Sebastian's leg was badly injured. Adrian was watching her like a predator. She had no idea how they would ever make it back.



The cold was unbearable. Harrison wrapped her arms around herself, resting her head against the doorframe. Her eyelids grew heavier.

Just as she was about to drift off, something cold and wet brushed against her cheek. A slow, deliberate touch.

Her eyes flew open.

Adrian stood over her, his fingers lingering on her skin, his gaze filled with hunger.

Harrison jerked away. "Adrian! What are you doing?"

Her body felt sluggish, her strength drained. Panic flared as she realized something was very wrong.

Adrian had returned to his room earlier, but sleep eluded him. The image of Harrison's delicate beauty haunted him, stoking a fire he couldn't ignore.

He had lived in this village for years. Women from the outside world came and went, but none had ever captivated him like her.

A lewd grin twisted his lips. "Harrison, don't play dumb. You know exactly what I want."

She pushed his hand away, her voice sharp. "Stop this! I'm married!"

"So what?" Adrian sneered. "Your husband isn't here. No one will ever know."

With that, he lunged.

Harrison's eyes widened. She tried to scramble back, but her body was too weak. Adrian, far stronger, knocked her to the ground. His hands tore at her clothes.

"Harrison, just give in!"



Pinned beneath him, Harrison recoiled in disgust. She fought with everything she had. "Let me go! My husband is coming—he's powerful! He'll destroy you!"

Adrian was beyond reason. He ripped at her clothes, laughing. "Forget him. Tonight, you're mine!"

He leaned down, his lips inches from hers.

Harrison twisted her face away, despair crashing over her. Was this how it would end?

"No! Please—"

Then, a large hand seized Adrian by the collar and yanked him backward with brutal force.

Harrison gasped as the weight lifted off her.
###Chapter 341

Harrison's gaze shot upward, locking onto Sebastian.

Sebastian had been in deep slumber until the commotion startled him awake. In one swift motion, he launched from the bed and tore Adrian away from her.

Adrian, consumed by lustful haze, never anticipated an ambush. He lost footing and crashed against the wall.

Sebastian's pallid face twisted with fury as he demanded, "Are you hurt?"

Harrison shook her head. "I'm fine."

Only then did Sebastian turn his wrath toward Adrian. His fists clenched, knuckles whitening. "You disgusting pig!"

Adrian sneered, frustration evident at his interrupted plans. "I saved you both from that storm. Without me, your leg would be rotting by now. And this is how you repay me? She's no blushing virgin - just some married woman. What's one more man to her?"

Sebastian's rage erupted. Veins pulsed at his temples as he charged, fist flying toward Adrian's jaw.

Adrian met the attack head-on. The two men became a whirlwind of violence, trading brutal blows across the cramped cabin.

Harrison scrambled to her feet, pulse hammering as she watched the deadly dance.

Sebastian was Wintervale's most feared street fighter, but his injured leg slowed his movements. Adrian's towering frame and raw strength soon gave him the upper hand.

A cruel smirk twisted Adrian's lips. "Should've played nice. Now I'll gut you and keep your sister-in-law as my personal toy. Maybe chain her in the barn for when I'm bored."

He tightened his grip around Sebastian's throat, malice dripping from every word. "Never wanted to save you anyway. But Harrison... too pretty to pass up."

CRACK!

A wooden chair shattered across Adrian's skull. Blood immediately gushed from his hairline as he whirled to face Harrison, the broken chair leg still in her trembling hands.

"You little bitch!" Adrian roared, drawing a hunting knife from his belt. The blade glinted as he lunged.

Harrison stumbled backward, heart in her throat. The chair should have knocked him unconscious - how was he still standing?

A shadow intercepted the attack.

Sebastian.

He positioned himself between Harrison and the blade, taking the slash meant for her.

"Sebastian!" Harrison screamed.

With lightning reflexes, Sebastian twisted Adrian's wrist, disarming him. A brutal kick sent Adrian flying across the room. He hit the wall with a sickening crunch, collapsing in a bloody heap.

Harrison rushed to Sebastian's side. Though the knife hadn't pierced deeply, a vicious gash ran along his forearm, crimson staining his sleeve.

"Let me treat that." Harrison grabbed the first aid kit, hands shaking as she cleaned the wound.

The adrenaline crash left them both breathless. They'd survived - barely.

Sebastian eyed Adrian's unconscious form. "Village chief's son. When he wakes..."

Harrison understood the unspoken danger. This temporary victory meant nothing. Adrian's family connections made him untouchable in Wintervale.

Tomorrow would bring worse.
###Chapter 342

"I spotted some medicinal plants outside. I'll collect them while you rest here," Harrison said, securing the medical supplies before stepping out.

She had surveyed the terrain upon arrival. These herbs could serve her purpose perfectly - something to erase Adrian's memory of recent events.

Harrison knelt to harvest the plants when footsteps crunched behind her. Turning, she found Sebastian trailing her.

He had followed.

This surprised her. "Why are you shadowing me? You're badly injured. Go back."

Sebastian stood tall, gazing down at Harrison's delicate features. Even in peasant garb, her beauty shone through. "I'm staying. There might be another Adrian lurking."

A genuine smile curved Harrison's lips. "I'm divorced from Nathaniel now. Even if something happens with another man, it's not infidelity. No need to chaperone me."

His lips pressed into a thin line. "This isn't about Nathaniel."

Harrison studied Sebastian's handsome face. As the Gondale heir, he wielded power in Willowbrook, accustomed to luxury. Now though - injured leg, bandaged arm, pale complexion - his aristocratic looks remained striking.

Unlike Nathaniel's refined elegance, Sebastian possessed boyish charm straight from comic books.

Her confusion deepened. If not Nathaniel's influence, then why?

"Wait... Do you actually care about me?"

Sebastian's expression hardened, chin lifting arrogantly. "Don't flatter yourself. Why would I care?"

She arched an eyebrow. "Just joking. I know you despise me. Everyone knows you're obsessed with Isabella."

Silence.

Harrison tucked the herbs away carefully. "But have you considered why explosives were on that yacht? The countdown? Who wanted me dead... No, who wanted us dead?"

Sebastian's fists clenched, unwilling to entertain thoughts about Isabella.

"I'll investigate thoroughly once we return," he muttered.

Harrison didn't push further. Sebastian wasn't foolish; some things were better left unsaid.

He watched her skilled hands work, movements fluid from practice. Curiosity overcame him. "You know medicine?"

Her bone-setting technique had been impressive.

Harrison nodded. "Nathaniel sent me to Willowridge University for medical studies. Forgotten already?"

Sebastian blinked. "Bragging now?"

"How is that bragging?"

She was brilliant, though never vocal about it. That talent had earned her place at Willowridge.

Once, Sebastian had considered pursuing the freshman prodigy. Now he wondered if she'd been laughing at him all along.

This was unprecedented - outshone by a woman.

"Let's head back," Harrison said, herbs collected.

Sebastian followed silently.

Suddenly, Harrison's vision blurred. Her body swayed, then collapsed toward the earth.

"Harrison!"

Sebastian lunged forward, catching her slender waist. Her head rested against his chest.

The unexpected contact froze him.

Only two years separated them in age.


###Chapter 343

Sebastian had been with countless women before - he'd embraced them, shared intimate moments far beyond what was happening now.

Yet when Harrison unexpectedly fell into his arms, his heart pounded with an intensity he'd never experienced.

No time to analyze this strange reaction.

He shook Harrison's shoulders urgently. "Harrison, are you alright?"

That's when he noticed the scorching heat radiating from her forehead. Her entire body burned with fever.

Just when things couldn't get worse.

Harrison slowly opened her eyes and pushed herself up. "I'm fine."

"You're clearly not! You're burning up. Can you even walk? Let me carry you," Sebastian insisted.

Her gaze dropped to his injured leg. "With that injury? You can barely stand."

The comment stung. Couldn't he carry someone who barely weighed a hundred pounds?

Seeing his wounded pride, Harrison gave a weak smile before heading inside. Sebastian limped after her.

Harrison crushed the medicinal herbs, forcing them between Adrian's lips, then took some fever-reducing herbs herself.

Sebastian watched her move about despite her illness - this fragile yet determined woman working tirelessly. He wanted to help but didn't know how, so he simply observed.

When she finished, he said, "You need to rest."

The moment the words left his mouth, he realized their predicament - only one bed, currently occupied by him.

He lifted the blanket. "Take the bed."

Harrison stopped him immediately. "Stay put. If that leg gets infected, I'll have to treat you too. I'll just sit here."

Sebastian considered this, then met her gaze. "We can share."

The bed had ample space for both.

Harrison opened her mouth to refuse.

But Sebastian spoke first. "If you collapse, I'll have to care for you. Don't make this harder. I won't nurse you - I'll leave you here."

Harrison nearly regretted saving him. Maybe she should've let him fend for himself.

She climbed in, staying near the edge. Her body alternated between burning and freezing. Eyelids growing heavy, she murmured, "Just sleep," before turning away.

Sleep claimed her quickly.

Sebastian studied her profile. She lay curled on her side, maintaining careful distance between them.

Who would've imagined they'd share a bed like this?

He reached over, pulling half his blanket to cover her.

Harrison slept fitfully, growing colder by the minute. Her slender arms wrapped around herself as pale lips trembled from chills.

"Cold..."

Sebastian leaned closer. "Harrison? What's wrong?"

"Cold..." she repeated through chattering teeth.

He touched her forehead - furnace-hot, yet her limbs were icy. Probably 107°F fever.

"Cold..."

He gave her all his blankets, trying to share warmth.

No improvement. The thin covers couldn't stop her shivering.

Only one solution remained - body heat. He needed to hold her.

Sebastian reached out... then hesitated, withdrawing his hand.

He stared at the ceiling. Nothing would happen. He didn't feel that way about her. This was purely medical necessity, right?

Gently, he placed a hand on her delicate shoulder and drew her close from behind.
###Chapter 344

Harrison shivered violently in Sebastian's protective embrace.

Sebastian's arms tightened around her trembling form, his grip both firm and reassuring.

"Stay strong. This nightmare will end soon."



Harrison had vanished without a trace. Nathaniel had deployed every available resource to locate her.

Dominic arrived with crucial surveillance footage. "Mr. Falcon, we've identified their movements. They boarded a yacht together."

Nathaniel studied the video feed, his expression darkening as he watched Sebastian step onto the vessel where Harrison already waited.

His chiseled features hardened into a mask of barely controlled fury. "What business does Sebastian have in Wintervale?"

No one could provide an answer.

"Sir, I suspect Sebastian came specifically for Ms. Harrison," Dominic ventured cautiously.

"Have they located the yacht?" Nathaniel demanded sharply.

"Our teams are searching the coastline. The yacht...it detonated."

Nathaniel shot to his feet. "Detonated?"

Dominic confirmed grimly. "Yes. The vessel was rigged with explosives."

Isabella chose that moment to appear. "Sebastian must have planted those bombs! He wanted Harrison dead. I knew he despised her, but not to this extent. Now he's gone too. Do you think they both perished in the explosion?"

The surveillance conveniently omitted Isabella's presence - a deliberate omission she'd ensured.



With Harrison and Sebastian presumably dead, Isabella could conveniently pin everything on Sebastian, effectively clearing herself of suspicion.

Nathaniel didn't even glance at Isabella. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Search every inch of that coastline. I want proof - even if it's their corpses in body bags."

Dominic nodded. "Understood."

Without another word, Nathaniel turned to leave.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella grabbed his arm desperately. "Where are you going? I came all this way for you! Won't you spend time with me?"

Nathaniel's glacial tone offered no warmth. "I need to find Harrison and Sebastian."

"But they're likely dead."

"I refuse to believe that."

He wrenched his arm free and strode away, Dominic following closely.

The search for Harrison and Sebastian had begun.

Left standing alone, Isabella's face twisted in frustration. Nathaniel's concern for Harrison infuriated her.

It's pointless anyway. That yacht exploded at sea. Harrison must be dead.

As for Sebastian...

He'd brought this on himself by refusing to cooperate.

Nathaniel's search teams combed the coastline relentlessly but found nothing.

Studying a map, Nathaniel pointed. "What's this location?"

"Stonebridge," Dominic replied. "A remote fishing village along the coast."

Nathaniel paused, considering. "We're going there."



Upon arriving in Stonebridge, Dominic asked, "Do you really think Ms. Harrison and Sebastian could be here?"

Nathaniel froze suddenly, his sharp gaze locking onto something glinting in the sand - a single pearl earring.

He knelt, retrieving the delicate jewelry and cradling it in his palm.

Dominic's eyes widened in recognition. "That's Ms. Harrison's earring! We're close. They must be here."

The pearl felt cold against Nathaniel's skin as he clenched his fist around it, his body heat gradually warming the precious object.

His piercing gaze swept across the quiet village ahead, wondering if Harrison and Sebastian were hiding within.

He would find them.
###Chapter 345


Nathaniel strode into Stonebridge with Dominic and their team. His sharp eyes immediately caught sight of a cluster of villagers. Without hesitation, he approached them.

"Pardon me," Nathaniel began, his voice smooth yet commanding. "Have two strangers arrived in your village today?"

The villagers exchanged wary glances. One stepped forward, crossing his arms. "Who's asking? You don't belong here."

Nathaniel didn’t flinch. "We're searching for someone."

"Nobody new's come here," another villager snapped. "Outsiders aren’t welcome. Leave."

A few of them started shooing Nathaniel away.

Dominic tensed, ready to argue, but Nathaniel lifted a hand, silencing him. "Understood. We’ll go. Thank you for your time."

He turned on his heel and walked away.

Dominic hurried after him, frustration creasing his brow. "Mr. Falcon, why are we retreating? I’m certain Ms. Harrison and Sebastian are here!"

Nathaniel’s gaze turned glacial, his piercing eyes scanning the village. "They are. I don’t need a feeling to know that."

"Then why—?"

"Did you miss the hostility?" Nathaniel cut in. "One of them slipped away to gather reinforcements. We’re outnumbered, and this is their territory. Charging in blindly won’t help."

The real problem was Nathaniel still didn’t know where Harrison and Sebastian were being held. A confrontation now could put them in greater danger.

For the first time, Nathaniel felt the weight of restraint. His hands were tied by the villagers' defiance.

Dominic lowered his voice. "Backup’s on the way."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "We still need a way inside."

Just then, a voice called out behind them.

"Who are you?"

Nathaniel turned. Standing there was Felicity Blackwood.



Felicity, the village chief’s daughter and Adrian’s younger sister, had spotted Nathaniel from afar. His striking features, aristocratic bearing, and commanding presence made him impossible to ignore. Like a moth to a flame, she found herself drawn to him.

Felicity, a beauty in her own right, had never encountered a man as captivating as Nathaniel. She couldn’t resist approaching.

Her lips curved into a coy smile. "I’m Felicity Blackwood. The chief’s daughter. Can I help you with something?"

Nathaniel’s eyes gleamed. This was an opportunity he hadn’t expected.

"We’re looking for two people," he said smoothly.

"Who?"

"A man and a woman. Both exceptionally attractive."

Felicity’s gaze lingered on Nathaniel, her interest unmistakable. "And what’s your relationship with this… beautiful woman?"

Dominic suppressed a groan. His boss’s damnable charm was causing problems again.

Nathaniel recognized Felicity’s flirtation instantly. He was no stranger to women’s attention—each with their own allure—and he knew exactly how to navigate it.

Right now, he needed her cooperation. So he played along.

"They’re my siblings," he lied effortlessly. "They fell overboard and washed up here. I’ve come to bring them home."

Felicity’s eyes sparkled. "Are you married?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "No. Will you help us?"

Her smile widened at his single status. "I’ll be honest. My brother brought a man and woman here earlier. The man was badly injured."

Finally—confirmation. Injuries aside, they were alive.

The suffocating pressure in Nathaniel’s chest eased slightly.

"Ms. Blackwood," he said, voice low and persuasive, "would you take us to them?"
###Chapter 346

Nathaniel studied Felicity and his team before turning to Dominic. "Our village has strict rules against outsiders. I can only take you in."

Dominic quickly stepped forward. "Mr. Falcon, going alone might be risky."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Risky? Explain."

Dominic lowered his voice. "Felicity clearly has her eyes on you. Watch out—she might try to make you her husband."

A cold glare from Nathaniel silenced him instantly.

"Stay here and rest," Nathaniel ordered. "I'll reach out when needed."

Dominic nodded. "Understood."

Nathaniel turned back to Felicity. "Lead the way. I appreciate your help."

As they walked through the village, Felicity's pulse quickened. "What's your name?"

"Nathaniel."

"Can I call you Nate?"

He hesitated. "If you prefer."

"What do you do?"

"I own a company."

She smiled. "Why aren't you married? What kind of woman do you like?"

Nathaniel glanced at her eager expression and smirked. "I prefer kind women—those who listen and help others. You got me into this village. That makes you exactly my type."

His smooth words had a way of making women feel special.

Felicity beamed. "Of course I'll help! These two are your siblings, right? We're here—this is the place!"

She stopped at a small house. "They're inside."

Were Harrison and Sebastian really there?

Nathaniel didn't hesitate. He pushed the door open.

Inside, Sebastian held Harrison close on a narrow bed. Nathaniel had imagined countless scenarios, but not this.

Sebastian's arms were wrapped around Harrison, trying to warm her. But she was ice-cold, barely breathing.

Nathaniel froze.

Sebastian heard the door creak and looked up. His eyes widened. "Nathaniel?! You're here?"

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to Harrison.

Sebastian jerked his hands away. "Nothing happened, I swear! Come closer—Harrison's burning up. She's been shaking, saying she's freezing."

Nathaniel moved swiftly. Harrison's delicate face was pale, her body trembling.

"Harrison?" He called softly. "Harrison!"

No response.

Then he saw the red marks on her neck. Her skin was so fair that even the slightest touch left traces.

His voice turned icy. "Who did this?"

"Adrian!" Sebastian's voice shook. "Nathaniel, you're too late. We barely survived last night."

Nathaniel gently cupped Harrison's face before lifting her into his arms.

In that moment, something inside him softened. A fierce protectiveness surged through him.
###Chapter 347

Nathaniel looked at Sebastian. "You need to rest. We'll discuss everything in the morning."

Both Harrison and Sebastian needed time to recover tonight. Their escape from the village could wait until later.

With Nathaniel present, Sebastian felt secure. He nodded. "Understood."

Nathaniel carefully lifted Harrison into his arms and carried her outside. Felicity had been waiting by the door and immediately approached. "Will she be okay?"

"She's burning up," Nathaniel replied. His voice carried quiet authority. "Can you arrange accommodations for us?"

Felicity couldn't resist his commanding presence. As the village chief's daughter, she quickly secured them the cleanest available room.

Nathaniel laid Harrison down on the narrow bed. Her skin felt icy, her forehead slick with sweat. Delicate strands of hair clung to her pale cheeks, making her appear heartbreakingly vulnerable.

His fingers brushed the damp hair from her face.

"Nathaniel." Felicity's voice shattered the moment.

He'd forgotten her presence. Straightening, he asked, "Do you have a brother?"

Felicity nodded eagerly. "Adrian. He's eligible but picky. None of the village girls meet his standards."

Nathaniel's lips curved into a cold smile. Of course Adrian had high standards - he'd set his sights on Harrison. She was exceptional in every way.

Felicity's pulse quickened as she gazed at Nathaniel. "I'm eligible too," she confessed. "But the local men don't interest me. My father keeps pressuring me to marry. What should I do, Nathaniel?"

Her intentions couldn't be clearer.

Amusingly, both Blackwood siblings seemed determined to claim Nathaniel and Harrison for themselves.

"I'll speak with your father tomorrow."

"Really?" Felicity's eyes sparkled. She assumed Nathaniel intended to ask for her hand.

He understood perfectly but chose not to correct her. "My sister and I need privacy now. You may leave."

"Of course."

Felicity departed happily, even closing the door behind her.

Then realization struck. There was only one bed. How would they...?

Alone now, Nathaniel focused on Harrison's shivering form. "So...cold..." she murmured through chattering teeth.

With precise movements, Nathaniel unbuttoned his coat. He shed the outer layer before sliding into bed beside her.

Harrison instinctively sought his warmth, curling against him in her sleep.

Nathaniel drew her closer.

Primitive as it was, body heat remained their best option.

Her delicate frame molded perfectly against him.

Nathaniel stilled.

It had been so long since he'd held her like this.

Since their divorce, they'd become strangers. Yet on sleepless nights, memories of her still haunted him.

Harrison stirred restlessly, seeking more warmth. Her small hands slipped beneath his partially unbuttoned shirt.

His chest was solid muscle, his sculpted abdomen radiating heat like a furnace.
###Chapter 348

Nathaniel felt Harrison's delicate fingers tracing desperate paths across his chest. In her feverish urgency, she ripped a button from his shirt with a sharp pop.

His throat tightened as he swallowed hard, capturing her wandering hands in his larger grip.

"Harrison, easy. I don't have a change of clothes here."

If his shirt was destroyed, he'd be left with nothing.

But Harrison wasn't listening. She craved warmth—needed it desperately. She wrenched her hands free and buried her face against his neck with a whimper. "I'm freezing..."

Her voice, weakened by illness, came out in a breathy plea, almost childlike in its sweetness.

Not that Nathaniel needed reminding—even at her healthiest, she knew exactly how to melt against him, all soft sighs and whispered pleas in bed.

She had always been his little siren.

It had been too long since he'd last tasted her—since their divorce tore them apart.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw, fighting the urge—and lost. His fingers found the buttons of her blouse, working them open with deliberate slowness.

Then everything unraveled.

He flipped her beneath him, fabric tangling—his half-discarded white shirt, her clothes peeling away. The sharp lines of his shoulders flexed as he moved, the deep groove of his spine contrasting with the chilled silk of Harrison's fingers as they traced his back.

When he pressed against her, their bodies clashed—her skin like ice, his burning with barely restrained hunger. A collision of opposites, raw and electric.

Dangerous. Thrilling.

In the dim silence of this remote village, the heat between them ignited like wildfire, consuming everything in its path.

A sharp gasp escaped Harrison as if she'd been burned.

Nathaniel stared down at her delicate face—the same face that had always drawn men effortlessly. Even now, it ensnared him all over again.

He caught her chin between his fingers and crushed his mouth to hers.

Harrison felt like she'd been thrown into an inferno. The heat was unbearable, suffocating—she twisted away, but his weight pinned her down. Then something slipped between her lips, and her brows furrowed in protest, a muffled whimper catching in her throat. Her small hands shoved weakly against his chest.

"G-Get off me..."

The village outside was deathly silent. Nathaniel had no idea how secure this room truly was. Felicity—or anyone—could burst in at any moment.

He dragged the blanket over them, his voice a rough whisper against her ear. "Shh. Quiet."

His lips trailed to her cheek, then the sensitive curve below her ear, his knee nudging her legs apart.

Her entire body tensed, a sharp crease forming between her brows as she twisted away. "No... stop..."

Then—

Harrison's lashes fluttered wildly, and suddenly, her eyes flew open.

She was awake.

The first thing she saw was Nathaniel's face—his aristocratic features darkened with something far from gentlemanly.

Why was he here?

Harrison's mind blanked as she struggled to piece together her memories.

Nathaniel's gaze burned down at her, the edges of his eyes bloodshot. He knew she was awake now. She stared up at him, dazed, her wide eyes utterly lost—innocent in a way that shattered his self-control.

Men were visual creatures—and Nathaniel was no exception. He was helpless against her beauty.

He dipped his head to claim her mouth again.

This time, Harrison jerked her face away, fully alert now. "Nathaniel! Why are you here? Let me go!"

His voice came out rough. "And how exactly am I supposed to do that now?"

Her thoughts spun. She remembered being stranded here with Sebastian, wondering if Nathaniel would even bother coming for her.

And now, here he was—taking advantage of her while she was feverish and helpless!

Her voice shook. "Have you forgotten? We're divorced!"
###Chapter 349
Harrison reminded Nathaniel they were no longer married.

Nathaniel hadn't forgotten, but his grip remained firm. "You're burning up. I'm just trying to help."

Harrison scoffed. "Help doesn't require this. Is this how you 'help' other women too?"

"Other women don't claw at my shirt like you do. You started this."

Her eyes flicked to his collar—one button already missing, torn off by her own hands.

Harrison shoved against his chest. "Get off me!"

Nathaniel pinned her wrists to the mattress and pressed a kiss to her cheek before she could protest further.

He wasn't stopping.

Harrison twisted beneath him. "Nathaniel, we're divorced! If you're that desperate, go find Isabella! Though with your track record, you should probably get tested—wouldn't want to catch something."

Nathaniel laughed, though his jaw tightened. That sharp tongue of hers hadn't dulled at all.

He gripped her chin. "I've never touched Isabella."

What? Never?

Harrison froze.

They'd been together for years. How was that possible?

Seizing her hesitation, Nathaniel crushed his lips against hers. The kiss was rough, relentless, stealing her breath. Harrison fought, but her icy limbs were already warming, skin flushing with frustration.

"Nathaniel, there's no condom!"

His gaze burned into her. "It's your safe period. Your cycle's due any day."

"We still can't!"

"Why?"

"Weren't you the one who said unprotected sex costs extra? Why should I give you the premium experience?"

Nathaniel paused, then smirked. "You should've asked if I'm giving you a choice."

Harrison opened her mouth—only for his lips to silence her again.

Dazed, she clung to one coherent thought: Her cycle was clockwork. It would come any moment now.

Harrison woke to insistent knocking. Morning light seeped through the curtains.

After last night's feverish exhaustion, her body felt drained but healed. She lay curled against Nathaniel's chest, his arms locked around her waist.

Neither had stirred until—

Knock. Knock.

The sound persisted.

Harrison shifted, while Nathaniel's eyes snapped open, instantly alert.

"Someone's at the door," she whispered.

She tried to rise, but his grip tightened. "Who is it?"

Felicity's voice chirped through the wood. "You awake, Nate? It's me."

Nate?

Harrison arched a brow. "Impressive. Your charm even works in remote villages."

Nathaniel shot her a warning look but called back, "I'll be out soon."

"Is your sister feeling better?"

Sister? Since when?

Harrison's glare could have melted steel, but Nathaniel answered smoothly, "Much better."

"My dad's excited about your meeting today! He prepared a feast. We'll wait for you!" Felicity's footsteps faded away.

Harrison propped herself up. "Care to explain, dear brother? Or do you make a habit of lying to innocent girls?"
###Chapter 350

Nathaniel looked down at Harrison in his arms, his sharp eyes glinting with amusement. "We shared a roof before. That makes you my sister, doesn't it?"

The audacity!

Harrison lifted her leg to kick him.

With effortless grace, Nathaniel flipped her beneath him. "Ready for another round?"

The hunger in his gaze told her he meant every word. The man's endurance was inhuman.

"Harrison," he whispered, tracing her jawline. "We've never done this in daylight."

Flames licked Harrison's cheeks. This madman!

She shoved him away with all her strength and bolted from the bed.

Nathaniel simply smirked, enjoying her hasty retreat.

Later, Nathaniel and Harrison went to check on Sebastian. After examining his leg wound, Harrison nodded in approval. He'd survived the critical night.

"You'll keep this leg," she declared.

Sebastian scowled. "Don't expect gratitude."

"Like your thanks would grant me immortality."

Sebastian choked on his retort.

Nathaniel observed their exchange silently. Despite the bickering, he noticed Sebastian's attitude toward Harrison had shifted.

"Nathaniel, let's leave," Sebastian grumbled.

Nodding, Nathaniel said, "I need to see the village chief first."

He turned to leave without explanation.

"Why?" Sebastian called after him.

Watching Nathaniel's retreating figure, Harrison spat, "Maybe he's fetching another lover. Isabella might have competition."

At Isabella's name, Sebastian fell silent, his expression darkening.

When Nathaniel arrived at the chief's house, Felicity rushed out eagerly. "Nathaniel! Come in! My father and brother Adrian are waiting!"

Inside, an extravagant feast covered the table in Nathaniel's honor. The chief's eyes had lit up when Felicity mentioned Nathaniel owned Falcon Enterprises.

The chief and Adrian sat together. Adrian had no memory of last night, though his body ached inexplicably.

Rubbing his neck, Adrian groaned, "Father, I feel like I was beaten last night. And I keep dreaming of some breathtaking woman..."

"Don't worry," the chief assured. "I'll find you a stunning wife and secure a wealthy husband for Felicity."

"Father," Felicity interrupted, "Nathaniel's here!"

Both men stood abruptly. Their eyes gleamed at Nathaniel's aristocratic bearing—some men simply radiated power and wealth.

The chief stepped forward eagerly. "Mr. Falcon! What an honor!" He extended his hand.

Nathaniel didn't move.

Felicity blinked. "Nathaniel, aren't you here to propose?"

Ignoring them, Nathaniel fixed his predatory gaze on Adrian. He advanced, each step deliberate.

Adrian frowned. "Mr. Falcon, what—"

Crack!

Nathaniel's fist connected with Adrian's jaw, sending him crashing into the wall. Blood trickled from Adrian's lip.

Grabbing Adrian's collar, Nathaniel hissed, "Now you remember who beat you? How dare you look at my woman!"

His fists rained down mercilessly.
###Chapter 351

Harrison and Sebastian stood waiting for Nathaniel. His security team had already secured the perimeter of the village, creating a safe exit route.

Minutes stretched into hours with no sign of Nathaniel. His whereabouts remained a mystery.

"Where could Nathaniel be?"

Suddenly, his imposing figure emerged from the shadows. He had finally arrived.

"Nathaniel, what kept you?" Sebastian couldn't hide his curiosity.

Nathaniel remained silent, wiping his hands with a handkerchief. Harrison noticed the crimson stains.

Dominic approached. "Mr. Falcon, we're ready to depart."

With a curt nod, Nathaniel led the group onto the waiting yacht.

"Nathaniel... Please..."

Harrison turned at the desperate cry. Felicity stood at the water's edge, tears streaming down her face.

"Someone's heartbroken. She seems quite taken with you." Nathaniel's icy gaze locked onto Harrison. "Her feelings mean nothing to me. Do you want to comfort her?" Harrison pressed her lips together, refusing to engage.

The group returned to Wintervale where Lucas and the others waited anxiously. Lucas immediately rushed to Harrison's side.

"Harrison! Where were you? We've been worried sick!"

She shook her head. "I'm fine, really."

"But what happened? You vanished without warning!"

Before she could respond, a blur of motion crashed into Nathaniel's arms. "Nathaniel! Thank God you're safe!"

Isabella had arrived, clinging to Nathaniel like ivy.

Harrison met Isabella's triumphant stare over Nathaniel's shoulder. She knew Isabella had manipulated Sebastian against her, but without concrete evidence involving Sebastian, the truth remained buried.

Harrison offered a tired smile. "I need to rest. Let's go."

"Of course. We'll fly back to Willowbrook tonight."

Lucas nodded at Nathaniel. "See you around."

Nathaniel struggled against Isabella's octopus grip - the more he resisted, the tighter she held on.

"Mr. Falcon and Ms. Whitmore make quite the pair," someone observed.

Nathaniel watched Harrison's retreating back. She didn't spare him or Isabella a single glance.

"Let's move."

Harrison walked away with Lucas and the others.

Trapped in Isabella's embrace, Nathaniel could only watch Harrison disappear from view.

Isabella seethed inwardly. After all her scheming, Harrison had still returned unscathed.

Finally breaking free, Nathaniel strode toward the car. "We're leaving."

Isabella spotted Sebastian lingering behind. She pasted on a concerned expression. "How's your leg injury?"

Sebastian studied her. "What about the explosives on the yacht?"

Isabella had rehearsed her answer. "Those were meant for Harrison. The timer was set, I thought you'd return in time. When you both went overboard... I nearly died from worry! I begged Nathaniel to find you immediately!"

Sebastian remained silent, his gaze heavy with suspicion.
###Chapter 352

"Sebastian, why are you looking at me like that? Do you actually think I had anything to do with this? That I wanted you dead too?"

Isabella's voice trembled with hurt.

"We're supposed to be friends! It kills me that you'd even consider such a thing. You've changed, Sebastian. I don't even recognize you anymore."

She was quick to turn the tables, striking first with raw emotion.

Sebastian hadn't harmed Harrison on the yacht. His expression softened slightly. "That's not what I meant."

"We need to stick together. Don't let Harrison come between us," Isabella pressed, desperate to regain control.

Meanwhile, Harrison was already packing, preparing to return to Willowbrook.

Once her suitcase was zipped shut, she stepped into the hallway—only to find Isabella waiting for her.

Harrison wasn't surprised. She walked forward, meeting her gaze head-on.

Isabella smiled sweetly. "I'm so relieved you're safe. I was worried sick about you."

Harrison smirked. "Was it you?"

"I have no idea what you're implying. Accusations require proof, darling. Otherwise, I could sue you for slander."

Isabella didn't just stand her ground—she stepped closer, deliberately provoking Harrison. Her smirk practically dared, What are you going to do about it?

Harrison didn't react with anger. Instead, she tilted her head playfully. "Actually, I should thank you, Isabella. You know what they say—true colors show in a crisis. When I was in danger, Nathaniel saved me. You weren't there, but that village was a nightmare. If he hadn't arrived when he did..."

She let the implication hang in the air.

Isabella's smile vanished. Her eyes turned icy with fury.

Harrison took a step closer, her voice light with amusement. "Oh, and by the way—did Nathaniel mention we spent the night together?"

Isabella froze. "You and Nathaniel... slept together?"

Harrison nodded. "Yep."

Isabella's face paled with rage.

"Why so upset? You're the one who pushed me toward him in the first place."

Isabella's chest heaved. She clenched her fists. "You're disgusting."

"Disgusting? I learned from the best. When you're up against someone shameless, what choice do you have? You fight fire with fire. I'm just using your own tactics against you."

Isabella's jaw tightened. Then her gaze flickered over Harrison's shoulder—and her expression shifted.

Nathaniel was approaching.

"Nathaniel!" she called, forcing composure into her voice.

Harrison turned.

He had just showered, dressed in a crisp white shirt and tailored black suit, every inch the polished aristocrat. The hallway light silhouetted his tall frame. He had clearly been standing there long enough to hear everything.

He strode toward them.

Isabella's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Nathaniel, Harrison just told me you slept with her. Is that true?"

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto Harrison.

She hadn't expected him to appear, but she didn't flinch. She met his eyes calmly, unbothered.

Nathaniel didn't hesitate. "It's true."

Isabella's composure shattered. "She seduced you, didn't she? That shameless—"

Nathaniel cut her off with a single look.
###Chapter 353

"Wait just a minute!"

Harrison cut off Isabella's tirade.

"You've got everything backwards. I didn't seduce Nathaniel last night. The truth is, I fought him off with everything I had, but he took advantage when I was weak with fever!"

What? Nathaniel forced himself on Harrison?

Isabella couldn't process this. Nathaniel was the type of man who had women throwing themselves at him constantly - he never lacked for beautiful admirers.

Whenever Isabella tried to get close, he'd always push her away, claiming work obligations or simply not being in the mood. If anything, he was the most disciplined man she knew.

Yet now he'd assaulted Harrison when she was ill?

Isabella's mind reeled.

"That's impossible!" she screeched. "You're lying through your teeth!"

Harrison turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, since you're standing right here, why don't you tell Isabella if I'm being truthful."

Nathaniel studied Harrison for a long moment before responding slowly, "Everything she said is accurate."

Isabella stood frozen, speechless.

Watching Isabella's face contort with rage, Harrison couldn't suppress a cold smirk.

"Isabella, when you were the other woman, did it never occur to you this might happen? Let me enlighten you - Mr. Falcon has no self-control. So you'd better watch your tone with me. Unless you want to become the next betrayed woman!"

With that, Harrison turned on her heel and strode away.



Isabella was coming unglued. Instead of destroying Harrison, she'd inadvertently pushed her rival into Nathaniel's arms. She'd sabotaged herself spectacularly - and the pain was excruciating.

Isabella glared daggers at Nathaniel. "How could you do this to me? You promised you wouldn't sleep with Harrison again! You're divorced!"

Nathaniel had nothing left to say. His chiseled features were shadowed, barely visible in the dim lighting. "Isabella, I'm sorry. Harrison-"

"Stop! Not another word!" Isabella shrieked, hurling her designer handbag to the ground with a crash.

Meanwhile, Harrison collected her luggage, preparing to return to Willowbrook.

Lucas and the others approached, and Lucas leaned in to murmur, "Harrison, I saw Nathaniel and his girlfriend having quite the argument."

"Yes, I noticed that too. His girlfriend looked absolutely livid. She actually threw her purse."

"What do you suppose they were fighting about?" one of the senior colleagues asked.

Harrison merely smiled enigmatically without responding.

When Harrison returned to the girls' dormitory, Rosalind greeted her with an enthusiastic embrace. "Harrison! You're finally back!"

Harrison presented Rosalind with gifts from Wintervale, and after catching up, she settled in for a nap.

She slept straight through until morning. Waking, Harrison realized she'd been sleeping remarkably well lately - perhaps even excessively.

Checking her phone, she found a message from Oliver.

[Back in town?]

Harrison replied, [Just returned.]

Oliver responded, [Let's meet up then.]

Harrison typed, [How about Vitalis Health? I haven't visited in ages.]

Oliver replied, [As founder, you've been rather negligent.]



Vitalis Health was packed to capacity that day. Nathaniel had arranged VIP access to bring Isabella for medication.

Since returning from Wintervale, Isabella's heart condition had been troubling her constantly. She clung to Nathaniel, insisting he stay by her side. Victoria and Penelope accompanied them.

Penelope examined the medication. "This is Vitalis Health's new cardiac formula. Incredibly effective - it's causing quite the sensation in medical circles."

"Who developed this heart medication?" Isabella inquired.

"The founder of Vitalis Health, who registered it as a naturopathic brand six years back. Not only do Vitalis hospitals operate worldwide, but the company went public as a major pharmaceutical overseas six years ago. It sent shockwaves through the medical community," Penelope explained.
###Chapter 354

Victoria paused, her brow furrowing slightly. "I think I recall something about Vitalis Health going public overseas on April 11th. Wasn't it dubbed the '411 Phenomenon'?"

Penelope nodded in confirmation. "Exactly right."

Isabella studied the medication bottle in her hands. "Come to think of it, the founder must be quite remarkable. Nathaniel, do you happen to know this founder personally?"

Though still seething inside, Isabella kept her composure. She couldn't risk alienating Nathaniel now. Instead, she directed all her resentment toward Harrison.

Nathaniel hesitated briefly. "We crossed paths once."

Six years ago in Stonebridge, Americana, Nathaniel had indeed encountered the founder of Vitalis Health.

Already an established business magnate at the time, he'd been invited to a corporate summit hosted by Willow Heights. That very evening marked the launch of Vitalis Health. He distinctly remembered hearing the midnight chime of her antique clock.

Rumors circulating that night claimed the founder was merely sixteen years old.

An interesting coincidence - Nathaniel himself had established his first company at sixteen. The Vitalis founder shared that same precocious milestone.

After the event, Nathaniel stepped outside and caught a glimpse of her silhouette.

She wore a sleek black strapless gown with a delicate lace shawl draped over her shoulders. Apparently tired from her heels, she carried a pair of crystal-embellished stilettos as she walked beneath Stonebridge's glittering skyline.

The city lights seemed to form a radiant halo around her.

Just that fleeting moment seared her image into his memory - an arresting combination of icy elegance and magnetic charm.

Even after six years, Nathaniel could recall every detail with startling clarity.

"Mr. Falcon, is the founder elderly?" Victoria inquired curiously.

It stood to reason that medical expertise came with age, and Victoria assumed as much.

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly. "She's actually quite young."

What? The founder of Vitalis Health was a young woman?

Isabella, Penelope, and Cassandra all froze in shock.

Penelope sighed deeply. "We're all human, yet the disparities between us are staggering. Hard work seems almost insignificant when measured against raw talent."

Both Penelope and Isabella considered themselves diligent strivers.

Suddenly, a team of black-suited security personnel swarmed the VIP entrance, establishing a perimeter. The air grew tense with anticipation.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Who's arriving?"
"Don't you know? It's Oliver from Florentia!"
"I heard he has connections in both legitimate and underground circles. What brings him to Willowbrook? They say he's devastatingly handsome!"
"Not just that! Oliver has two powerful mentors who absolutely dote on their junior colleague - she's practically their princess."

Nathaniel's chiseled features tightened. He knew Oliver professionally, having collaborated on projects before.

So Oliver was in Willowbrook now.

Just then, a sleek luxury sedan pulled up, and Oliver emerged.

Dressed in a tailored overcoat, Oliver cut an undeniably striking figure. His security detail cleared a path as he strode purposefully forward.

Isabella turned to Nathaniel. "Why would Oliver come to Willowbrook?"

Nathaniel studied Oliver's determined gait. "I'm not certain, but judging by his demeanor, he appears to be meeting someone important."

At that moment, Victoria gasped.

"Harrison?!"
###Chapter 355

Nathaniel glanced up and spotted Harrison.

She had come to Vitalis Health's hospital.

At that moment, Isabella clung tightly to his arm, her grip possessive. "Why is Harrison here? Nathaniel, I can't stand seeing her. Every time I do, it feels like my heart is being torn apart."

Nathaniel pulled his arm free from Isabella's grasp without a word. His gaze lingered on Harrison for only a second before he turned away. "Let's go. I'll drive."

He walked out without another glance.

Since their return, Isabella had been glued to Nathaniel's side, desperate for his attention. He didn't push her away, but he also stopped reaching out to Harrison.

Yet Isabella could sense the change. The warmth in Nathaniel's eyes had faded, replaced by something colder—duty, not love.

The realization made her fists clench in frustration.

Harrison made her way through the hospital corridors until she found Oliver.

Oliver studied her with a knowing smirk. "You've lost weight. Seems like after leaving your grandfather and us, you've been suffering the pangs of heartbreak here."

Harrison shot him a glare. She should've expected his sharp tongue—he never missed an opportunity to tease her.

She exhaled sharply. "If that's all you came to say, I'm leaving."

Oliver immediately blocked her path. "This is for you."

He handed her a property deed.

"What's this?"

"Your identity as the 'genius girl' is public now. Do you really plan to keep living in the dorms? This is a house I secured for you."

Harrison knew it was time to move out, though Rosalind was still in the dorm. She could always visit.

She took the deed from him.

Oliver then produced a set of car keys. "And this—it's yours too."

Harrison blinked in surprise. A house and a car in one day? She accepted the keys. "Thanks."

"You're welcome." Oliver's expression turned serious. "So, when are you planning to return? You and Mr. Falcon are divorced now."

He had come to convince her to leave Willowbrook.

Harrison hesitated. "There's unfinished business here. Once it's settled, I'll go back."

"The Whitmore family?"

She nodded. "Yes."

Oliver sighed but didn't argue. "Fine. I'll stay in Willowbrook for a while longer."

"Alright. Keep in touch."

Harrison said her goodbyes and headed toward her new home.

As she stepped outside the hospital, she spotted Isabella, Penelope, and Cassandra waiting by the curb.

A sleek Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up moments later. Nathaniel had arrived.

He remained in the car, his gaze briefly flickering to Isabella. "Get in."

Then his eyes locked onto Harrison, who stood just behind them. Their gazes met—silent, charged.

Isabella followed Nathaniel's line of sight and sneered. "Harrison, you just can't let go, can you? What, are you stalking us now?"

"Stalking?" Harrison arched a brow, lips curling in amusement. "Delusions are a serious condition. You're at a hospital—maybe get that checked."

"Stop playing innocent! These 'coincidental' meetings aren't coincidences. You're still obsessed with Nathaniel, aren't you? That's why you keep showing up!"

Penelope chimed in with a scoff. "You and Mr. Falcon are divorced, Harrison. He doesn't want you anymore. Stop clinging like some pathetic stray."

Victoria studied Harrison with a cool smile. She had been surprised to learn Harrison was the famed 'genius girl,' but that didn't change anything.

"Harrison," Victoria said smoothly, "I never expected you to be a genius. But after graduation, you threw it all away—married life, then divorce. Now you have nothing. Instead of chasing Nathaniel and Isabella, focus on getting a job. Financial independence is crucial for a woman."
###Chapter 356

Harrison stood frozen, momentarily speechless. Just then, her sleek new car pulled up to the curb.

"I was just waiting for my ride," she said smoothly. "See you around."

"Your ride?" Isabella scoffed, lips curling in amusement. "You mean a taxi? Good luck catching one outside the hospital."

It was true—Harrison had relied on cabs for years. Isabella’s assumption wasn’t entirely unfounded.

Penelope raked her gaze over Harrison with open disdain. "I’ve lost all respect for you. Look at your peers—houses, luxury cars, thriving careers. And here you are, still hailing cabs. Pathetic for someone once called the 'genius girl.'"

Victoria tugged at Penelope’s sleeve. "Stop. Honestly, I just feel sorry for her now."

Harrison spotted her driver stepping out of the gleaming vehicle, heading toward her. She strode forward, brushing past Penelope and Victoria, stopping directly in front of Isabella.

With a teasing smirk, she said, "You’re right. Taxis are hard to come by here."

Isabella’s face lit up with smug satisfaction.

Harrison glanced over her shoulder at Nathaniel, seated in the back of his own Rolls-Royce. "Mr. Falcon, care to give me a lift?"

Isabella’s expression instantly darkened. "Absolutely not!"

Harrison arched a brow, locking eyes with her. "Then why are you making such a scene?"

Isabella faltered, lips pressed tight.

Nathaniel studied Harrison. Two days had passed since they last spoke, and the silence between them had been heavy. Today, her dark hair cascaded in waves over her shoulders, framing a face so striking it was impossible to look away.

The corner of Nathaniel’s mouth twitched. "Since taxis are scarce, why don’t you—"

Before he could finish, the driver approached Harrison. "Ms. Harrison, your new car is ready. I’ve tested it—everything’s flawless. You’re good to go whenever."

Harrison nodded. "Thank you."

The driver stepped back.

"New car?" Isabella blinked in disbelief. "You bought a car?"

Penelope and Victoria gaped, equally stunned. Since when did Harrison have the means for that?

Harrison jingled the keys in her palm, the metallic sound sharp in the tense air.

Isabella’s eyes darted to the curb—and widened. A Rolls-Royce.

Identical to Nathaniel’s, except for the breathtaking starlight roof.

"You bought a Rolls-Royce?" Penelope choked out. "Where did you even get that kind of money?"

None of them had expected this.

Harrison smirked at their shocked faces. "Guess."

With that, she slid into the driver’s seat, pressed the accelerator, and sped off in a smooth, effortless motion.

Nathaniel watched her disappear, the memory of her driving flashing in his mind—hair whipping in the wind, effortless confidence radiating from her.

Bold. Unapologetic.

And suddenly, it struck him.

This version of Harrison felt hauntingly familiar.

Not just anyone.

But someone he’d met briefly six years ago.

The founder of Vitalis Health.
###Chapter 357
No. This couldn't be happening.

Nathaniel found himself oddly amused. Why was he even comparing Harrison to the elegant, accomplished founder of Vitalis Health?

"Mr. Falcon, could you give me a ride?"

Just minutes ago, Harrison had stood beside his car, flashing that infuriatingly confident smile.

Nathaniel smirked. She had her own car, yet she'd deliberately asked him—just to provoke Isabella.

And to needle him, of course.

This woman was growing bolder by the day.

Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria climbed into the car. Isabella took the passenger seat while the other two settled in the back. Nathaniel pressed the accelerator, and the Rolls-Royce Phantom glided onto the road.

Isabella couldn't process it. Harrison, driving the same model as Nathaniel? Who was she to afford a Rolls-Royce?

"Did Harrison spend your money again, Mr. Falcon?" Victoria asked.

Penelope immediately added, "Mr. Falcon, when you divorced her, did you give her a fortune? How else could she afford this?"

Nathaniel's hand, adorned with a platinum watch, rested on the steering wheel. His gaze remained fixed ahead. He didn't answer.

Isabella understood. He wouldn't discuss what he'd given Harrison during the divorce.

Nathaniel was generous—that much was clear. He'd obviously handed over a staggering sum. Isabella hadn't cared before, but now? The thought of Harrison behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce made her blood boil.

But if Nathaniel refused to talk about it, pushing would be pointless.

Suppressing her fury, Isabella forced a smile. "Nathaniel, I heard you moved to The Regal Estates. I'd love to see it."

Penelope perked up. "I've heard each unit costs over ten million! I'd love a tour!"

Nathaniel didn't object. The luxury car turned toward The Regal Estates.

Thirty minutes later, the Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled into the estate. Isabella stepped out, breathless. "This place is incredible!"

Penelope and Victoria gaped at the opulence around them.

Then—another Rolls-Royce sped up and screeched to a halt. The driver's door swung open, and Harrison stepped out.

Harrison.

She'd driven here too.

Isabella froze. "What are you doing here?"

Harrison looked equally surprised to see them, but the address on the deed was clear. This was her new home.

"Pathetic. You followed us from the hospital? How did you even know Mr. Falcon lived here?" Penelope sneered.

Nathaniel lived here? The property Samuel had arranged for her was also in The Regal Estates.

Harrison shrugged. "Funny coincidence. I live here too."

Victoria burst out laughing. "Stop pretending! This is The Regal Estates! There's no way you belong here!"

Harrison didn't bother responding. She stepped into the elevator.

Nathaniel watched her, then followed.

Penelope whispered to Isabella and Victoria, "Let's go. If she claims she lives here, let's see where. When she's exposed, it'll be humiliating!"

"Perfect."

The elevator reached the ninth floor. Harrison stepped out. Nathaniel followed. The Regal Estates had only two units per floor.

Now, both of them had exited on the same level.

Penelope smirked. "Caught you! There are only two units here. Don't tell me one is yours—that you and Mr. Falcon are neighbors!"
###Chapter 358

Victoria scoffed, her lips curling in disdain. "Harrison, you still deny following Nathaniel here? This is clearly stalking behavior! How pathetic. You even knew he lived on the 9th floor. Are you obsessed? What's wrong with you?"

Harrison turned to Nathaniel, her expression unreadable. "You live on the 9th floor?"

Nathaniel merely flicked his gaze toward Unit 901. "This one's mine."

Harrison nodded. "Interesting."

She strode to the door of Unit 902, punched in the code, and the lock clicked open smoothly.

Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria stood frozen, jaws slack.

Harrison lived in Unit 902? She actually owned a place at The Regal Estates—and she was right across from Nathaniel?!

Harrison stepped inside but paused before closing the door. She glanced back at them, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Well, you weren’t entirely wrong. We are neighbors."

The door shut with a decisive thud.

Victoria sucked in a sharp breath.

What kind of twisted luck did this woman have? How had she suddenly acquired a luxury car and a penthouse? Was this even the same Harrison they knew?

Isabella, still reeling, whirled toward Nathaniel. "Harrison actually bought a place here? And she’s living right across from you?"

Nathaniel stared at the closed door, his brow furrowing slightly. He hadn’t spoken to Harrison in weeks. He had no idea about any of this.

Isabella was losing it. "How much did you give her? Look at how she’s spending money like it’s nothing! Luxury cars, penthouses—what’s next? A private jet? A yacht? Is she planning to buy her own island?"

Harrison came from nothing. Meanwhile, Isabella could barely afford her designer wardrobe, let alone a penthouse in The Regal Estates. What made her so special?

Penelope scoffed. "Mr. Falcon, I understand giving Harrison some settlement money, but this is excessive! Does she think she can just marry rich and walk away with a fortune?"

Nathaniel pulled out his phone and checked his banking alerts.

Nothing.

No transactions. No withdrawals.

Harrison had been crashing at the dorms the past few days. She hadn’t touched a single cent of his money.

Yet here she was—driving a high-end car and living in one of the most exclusive addresses in Willowbrook.

The money meant nothing to Nathaniel. But one question burned in his mind: Where did she get it?

His jaw tightened. "She hasn’t spent my money."

Isabella let out a disbelieving laugh. "You’re lying! If she didn’t take your money, then where did it come from? Sure, she’s smart, but she’s been a housewife since graduation! She’s never worked a day in her life, and now she’s living like this?"

Her voice rose, shrill with frustration. Before she could continue, two security guards approached.

"Ma’am, keep your voice down. The Regal Estates has a strict noise policy."

Isabella blinked. "Excuse me?"

"We received a complaint from Unit 902. The resident reported excessive noise. Please take any disputes outside and refrain from disturbing others," the guard stated firmly.

Isabella’s face flushed with rage. Harrison had called security on her?

"Harrison, get out here right now!" she shrieked.

She lunged toward the door, ready to pound on it.

The guards moved faster. One seized her arm, the other blocked her path, and within seconds, they had her pinned to the ground.

The security at The Regal Estates was legendary—the most elite in Willowbrook. Isabella was now experiencing it firsthand.

One guard held a stun gun, his voice icy. "Ma’am, this is your final warning. Any further disturbance will result in immediate removal."
###Chapter 359

Isabella and Penelope gasped as they saw Harrison pinned to the ground. They rushed forward, desperate to intervene.

"Release her immediately!"

The security guard's voice was icy. "Final warning. One more step and you're all out."

Before they could react, all three women were forcefully ejected from The Regal Estates. The massive doors boomed shut behind them.

Harrison stood frozen in shock. Penelope looked equally stunned. Victoria simply blinked in confusion.

This treatment was unprecedented. Especially for Harrison - she'd always been treated like royalty when with Nathaniel.

Now she'd been tossed out like trash. A humiliating first.

Penelope's face twisted with rage. "This is all Harrison's doing! How is this possible? Luxury cars, mansions, and now she's throwing us out? Has she gone mad?"

Harrison's fists clenched. "What else could it be? Nathaniel dumped her with a fat settlement. That's the only explanation."

Victoria glared at the building. "Don't fret. However much Nathaniel gave her, it's finite. She's just an unemployed divorcée. Let's see how long the money lasts."

The words calmed Isabella and Penelope slightly.

Penelope suddenly had an idea. "Isabella, you need to find out exactly how much Falcon Enterprises paid in that divorce."

Isabella was certain it was substantial - at least 20 or 30 million given Nathaniel's wealth. He wouldn't blink at such amounts.

She hadn't cared before. Now she burned with curiosity.

"I'll discover the truth," she vowed.

Just then, Penelope's phone chimed with a cheerful ringtone. Her face lit up - Dr. Sinclair was calling. After a brief conversation, she nearly jumped for joy.

"Incredible news!"

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Dr. Sinclair has good news?"

Penelope beamed. "Our investments have multiplied tenfold! We're swimming in money now!"

"Seriously?" Both Isabella and Victoria shrieked with delight.

Margaret and the extended family had mortgaged everything to invest in Dr. Sinclair's venture. Now their assets had exploded beyond imagination.

Isabella's mood soared. "We're rich now! Harrison's just living off Nathaniel's pity money while we're building real wealth!"

Victoria suggested, "Your grandmother's been gloomy lately. Let's take her shopping tomorrow - cheer her up."

"Perfect!" Isabella agreed.

Harrison hadn't expected Oliver's arranged home to be at The Regal Estates - directly across from Nathaniel's penthouse. An absurd coincidence.

But The Regal Estates suited her status perfectly. The lavish apartment was ideal for her new life.

After a relaxing rose petal bath, her phone pinged with a message from Oliver: [Shopping tomorrow?]

She smiled and replied: [Perfect.]

Taking out the trash later, she froze as the penthouse door across the hall opened. Nathaniel stepped out.

Neighbors now. Awkward.

Their relationship didn't warrant greetings. Better to pretend they were strangers whenever their paths crossed.
###Chapter 360

The thought made Harrison pivot sharply toward the exit.

Nathaniel's imposing frame blocked her path instantly.

"Don't I deserve an explanation?" His voice carried an edge of demand.

Harrison met his gaze with razor-sharp clarity. "About?"

His lips pressed into a thin line before speaking. "The Bentley you drive. The penthouse you occupy." His eyes darkened. "Whose fortune funds your new lifestyle?"

She straightened her spine, radiating defiance. "Certainly not yours. The rest is none of your concern."

She attempted to sidestep him.

Nathaniel remained immovable, his broad shoulders forming an impenetrable barrier.

A smirk played on Harrison's lips. "I know what you're thinking. Just like Isabella and her cronies, you assume I'm some helpless divorcee living off your alimony."

The accusation hit its mark. Nathaniel had indeed believed exactly that - Harrison had never held a proper job.

"You're brilliant, educated." His tone softened unexpectedly. "You devoted years to caring for me. Let me help you now. Name any industry - I'll secure you a position. Even fund your own venture."

How little he truly knew her. Beyond recognizing her genius, Nathaniel understood nothing.

Harrison studied him carefully. The man was devastatingly handsome, radiating magnetism that could enslave any woman. Even post-divorce, he offered wealth, opportunities, connections - everything at his disposal.

Her response was immediate. "No thank you."



With her exit blocked, Harrison turned toward her apartment building.

Nathaniel's hand shot out, encircling her wrist with unyielding strength.

His long fingers - impeccably groomed yet bearing the faint ridges of hard work - pressed against her delicate skin. The contact sparked unwanted memories of those same hands exploring her body.

She jerked away futilely.

In one fluid motion, Nathaniel pinned her against the cold brick wall.

"Release me!" Her voice dripped ice.

His gaze burned into hers. "Planning to tattle to Isabella again?" A dark amusement colored his words. "What exactly will you report this time? That I've assaulted you?"

He remembered her previous accusations all too well.

Harrison narrowed her eyes. Was that genuine amusement flickering in his expression? "You haven't crossed that line yet. But harassment suits you perfectly."

Nathaniel's lips curved dangerously. "Should I come to your place tonight?"

Her pupils dilated in shock.

"Or perhaps you'd prefer mine?" he purred.

"Nathaniel!" she hissed through clenched teeth.

He chuckled, pinching her cheek mockingly. "Now this...this is harassment, darling."

Harrison stood frozen, realizing she'd been played.

Absolute madman!



Nathaniel loomed over her, intensity warring with amusement. "Once more - where did the assets come from? Since it's not my money, whose is it?"

The unspoken accusation hung between them.

Harrison arched a brow. "What? You think I'm some kept woman now?"

Nathaniel's silence confirmed her suspicion. She could practically see the mental list forming - Lucas Harrington undoubtedly topping it.

A mischievous smile curved her lips. "I didn't spend a single penny. Everything was gifted to me."


###Chapter 361

Nathaniel's perfect features twisted into a scowl. "Who gave you these?" His voice carried an edge.

Harrison tilted her head, a smirk playing on her lips. "My boyfriend."

The word hit Nathaniel like a physical blow. His entire demeanor shifted, warmth replaced by icy detachment. He remembered her casual mention of having a boyfriend before. Now this mysterious man had materialized.

"Your sugar daddy, you mean?" Nathaniel sneered.

"Call him whatever you like." She shrugged.

A bitter laugh escaped Nathaniel's lips. "Buying luxury cars and mansions? The Willowbrook elite circle is small. I know every player. Who exactly is this phantom boyfriend of yours?"

Harrison's smirk widened. "Not my problem to solve. I'm leaving."

She turned on her heel.

Nathaniel blocked her path again. "Get a real job. With your education, you should be building a career, not pretending some rich man is keeping you."

He refused to believe her claims. No stunning, wealthy man would be interested in her.

Harrison saw no point in arguing. Oliver had arrived in Willowbrook. Nathaniel would meet him soon enough.

She shoved Nathaniel aside with surprising strength. "My life. My rules."

The door slammed in Nathaniel's face. He stood frozen, arms crossed, jaw clenched. Something wasn't adding up. She was hiding something - he could feel it.

The realization gnawed at him.



The next day found Harrison and Oliver at an upscale boutique. Oliver flashed his signature charming smile. "Pick anything you like. My treat."

"How generous of you." Harrison grinned back.

She began examining the designer racks.

Oliver's phone buzzed. "I need to take this outside."

"Of course."

Alone now, Harrison browsed the collection. An eager sales associate trailed her. "Miss, your elegance is breathtaking! This lace number would complement your figure perfectly."

Harrison considered trying it when a familiar voice rang out. "Harrison? Shopping again?"

She turned to face the newcomers.

Margaret led the pack, flanked by Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria. Isabella had completely recovered from last night's humiliation, her face now radiating smug superiority. The group entered like royalty, noses in the air.

"Clothes shopping?" Isabella asked pointedly.

Harrison nodded. "Obviously."

Penelope couldn't contain her excitement. "We've got amazing news! Want to hear?"

Before Harrison could respond, Margaret burst out laughing. "Remember our investment with Dr. Sinclair? Our money multiplied tenfold! We're rolling in it now!"

Her gaze locked onto Harrison.

"You called Dr. Sinclair a fraud, didn't you? Pure jealousy. Sure, you're book-smart, but look at you now! Married Nathaniel, became a trophy wife, got dumped, and now you're just... existing. You'll never measure up to my golden granddaughters. They're the ones spoiling me now!"

Margaret squeezed Isabella and Penelope's hands, pride oozing from every pore.

At the mention of Dr. Sinclair, Harrison's lips curved into an amused smile. She arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow.

"Tenfold returns from Dr. Sinclair? How... fascinating."
###Chapter 362

Penelope instantly straightened her posture, her crimson lips twisting into a smirk. "Harrison, there's no need for jealousy. Dr. Sinclair is my fiancé, and our wedding is just around the corner."

Harrison nodded slowly. "So you've multiplied your assets tenfold. When exactly is Dr. Sinclair transferring that fortune to you? Has he given you a timeline?"

Margaret hesitated, caught off guard. "Well..."

"Ah, so he hasn't specified." Harrison's tone was light but pointed. "He can promise you the moon, but until the money's in your hands, it's just words. And I'll say it again—he's a fraud. Be careful."

Penelope's face darkened instantly. Dr. Sinclair was her pride, her ultimate trophy, and she wouldn't tolerate anyone tarnishing his reputation.

"You're just jealous!" she spat. "You can't stand that I have someone like him!"

Isabella's voice dripped with mockery. "Oh, Harrison isn't just jealous of you. She's jealous of me too—because I have Nathaniel."

Before Harrison could respond, a deep, commanding voice cut through the tension.

"What's going on here?"

Harrison looked up.

Nathaniel had arrived.

Isabella immediately latched onto his arm. "You're here! We were just chatting with Harrison. She's so envious—of me because I have you, and of Penelope because she has Dr. Sinclair."

"Those are your words, not mine," Harrison clarified quickly.

Victoria chimed in with a smirk. "There's no shame in admitting envy, Harrison. No need to be coy about it."

Harrison resisted the urge to roll her eyes. The Whitmore family really was something else. "I don't envy any of you. I have a boyfriend. I didn't come here alone—I'm here with him."

Boyfriend?

Margaret scoffed. "Ah, yes. The wealthy boyfriend you claimed to have. Still clinging to that story? Look at you—educated but jobless. What wealthy man would waste his time on you?"

Penelope sneered. "Sure, you drive a luxury car and live in a mansion, but that's all Falcon Enterprises' money. It won't last forever."

Harrison smiled, tilting her head. "You're mistaken. The car, the mansion—they were gifts from my boyfriend. I haven't touched a cent of Falcon's money. After all, my boyfriend is just as wealthy."

Isabella let out a derisive laugh. "Stop lying! Who in all of Willowbrook could possibly compete with Nathaniel?"

Harrison remained silent, her smile unshaken.

Nathaniel studied her face, his expression unreadable. "If you came with your boyfriend, where is he? I'd like to meet him."

Victoria added, "If he's as rich as you claim, why not introduce him?"

Margaret waved a dismissive hand. "Enough of this nonsense. Let's just shop."

Harrison lifted her gaze—just in time to see Oliver returning from his call. Her lips curved into a sweet smile as she addressed the group.

"Since you're all so curious about my boyfriend... here he is."

She gestured ahead.

The group turned—and froze.

Oliver was walking toward them, his presence commanding the room.

Isabella, Penelope, Margaret, and Victoria all gasped in unison, their expressions stunned.

"Mr. Oliver?" Isabella whispered, disbelief coloring her voice.
###Chapter 363

Oliver had arrived.

Isabella and the others had met him yesterday at Vitalis Health, but seeing him again now made their expressions shift dramatically.

Oliver approached Harrison and placed a hand on her shoulder. "I just stepped away to take a call. Did I miss something interesting?"

Harrison flashed a playful smirk. "No, you're right on time. They all wanted to meet my boyfriend, and I told them it was you."

She gave Oliver a knowing look.

He understood instantly. Wrapping an arm around Harrison's slender waist, he turned to the others. "And who do we have here?"

Harrison introduced them one by one. "This is Margaret, Victoria, Isabella, and Penelope Whitmore."

Her gaze lingered on Nathaniel's refined features. The moment Oliver entered, Nathaniel's expression darkened.

Clearly, Nathaniel hadn't expected her boyfriend to be Oliver.

"And this needs no introduction—Mr. Falcon," Harrison added casually.

Oliver turned to Nathaniel. "No introduction needed. We've crossed paths before. Hello, Mr. Falcon. Since I'm in your territory now, I hope you'll show me some hospitality."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line. "So, you're Harrison's boyfriend?"

Oliver tightened his hold on Harrison. "Isn't it obvious?"

Isabella, Penelope, Victoria, and Margaret stood frozen, struggling to process the scene. Harrison had claimed to have a wealthy boyfriend, but they'd dismissed it as a lie. Now, the infamous Oliver from Florentia was standing right here as her boyfriend?

How was this possible? Was this some kind of joke?



"Mr. Oliver, how could you be dating Harrison? Did you know she was married before?" Isabella blurted out.

Oliver smiled faintly. "Of course."

"Then why—"

Was the renowned Oliver seriously interested in a divorced woman?

Oliver glanced at Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon is Harrison's ex-husband, right? I suppose great minds think alike. Harrison is extraordinary. Mr. Falcon loved her, and so do I."

Isabella was speechless.

Penelope scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Mr. Oliver, are you really dating her just because she's some so-called 'genius'? Let me tell you, she's all talk! She doesn't even have a job—just leeching off men."

Oliver arched a brow, looking at Harrison. "Did you tell them that?"

Harrison shook her head innocently. "No, I didn't."

Oliver chuckled. "Harrison is actually out of my league. You have no idea how sought-after she really is."

Isabella and the others, of course, had no clue.

"Let me put it this way—you all know I have two male seniors and a female junior, right?" Oliver continued.

Isabella nodded. "I've heard the junior is your group's favorite."

Oliver grinned. "Exactly. She's incredibly popular in Florentia. The line of men wanting to date her stretches all the way to Francais. Harrison is just as desirable as her."

Isabella stood there, stunned. Was Oliver seriously comparing Harrison to his beloved junior? Could Harrison really measure up?



Harrison smirked. "Not too long ago, you all tried setting me up on a blind date. I told you I already had a boyfriend, and now you've seen for yourselves. The luxury car I drive, the mansion I live in—all thanks to Oliver. None of it came from Mr. Falcon."

Margaret remembered how she'd once tried introducing Harrison to a teacher at the Whitmore estate, thinking he was too good for her.

Now, she felt like Harrison had just put her in her place.
###Chapter 364


Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria all felt utterly humiliated.

Harrison turned her gaze to Nathaniel. "Do you believe me now?"

Her sparkling eyes held a mischievous glimmer.

When Nathaniel saw Oliver's arm still draped around her, his jaw tightened visibly.

This little vixen!

Even Oliver had fallen under her spell. She truly knew how to get what she wanted.

"Harrison, we came here to shop. Did anything catch your eye?" Oliver asked, smoothly changing the subject.

The sales associate immediately stepped forward, presenting an exquisite lace gown. "This would look absolutely divine on you, miss."

Harrison nodded. "I'd like to try it."

"Of course. Right this way."

Harrison took the dress into the fitting room.

Isabella, however, was seething. She tugged at Nathaniel's sleeve. "I told you she's trouble! Look at her—already wrapped around Mr. Oliver's finger. He's completely infatuated!"

Nathaniel remained silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

Just then, Oliver approached. "Mr. Falcon, thank you for looking after her all this time. Since the divorce, you needn't concern yourself with her anymore. I'll take care of her from now on."

Nathaniel's eyes locked onto Oliver's. The tension between the two powerful men was palpable.

Sparks flew.

Then, the sales associate's voice broke the silence. "She's ready."

Both men turned as Harrison emerged from the fitting room, the lace dress clinging to her curves.

The intricate rhinestone detailing shimmered under the lights, the sleek silhouette accentuating every perfect line of her body. Her hair cascaded loosely over her shoulders, and with each step, she moved like a vision—graceful, mesmerizing.

Nathaniel couldn't tear his eyes away.

But Oliver stepped forward, blocking his view, admiration clear in his gaze. "You look breathtaking."

Harrison twirled in front of the mirror, pleased. "I'll take this one."

Oliver handed the associate a sleek black card. "Charge it."

The associate hesitated. "This is a custom piece, with hand-sewn rhinestones. It's quite—"

"Just swipe it," Oliver interrupted firmly.

The associate beamed. "Right away!"

Isabella watched, jealousy burning through her.

She couldn't help but stare at Harrison's flawless figure—every curve in perfect proportion. The dress looked like it was made for her.

"Wait!" Isabella snapped.

Everyone froze.

Harrison and Oliver turned to her.

With a haughty tilt of her chin, Isabella declared, "Harrison, we have the same taste. I want that dress too."

The associate looked uneasy. "I'm sorry, miss, but this is the only one in stock."

Isabella smirked. Perfect.

Slowly, she turned to Harrison. "Take it off. I want it."

She wanted that dress.

Oliver started to speak, but Harrison shook her head subtly.

Isabella looped her arm through Nathaniel's, batting her lashes. "Nathaniel, buy it for me. I'll wear it just for you."
###Chapter 365
Isabella demanded the dress from Harrison.

Her toxic jealousy couldn't stand being overshadowed by Harrison. That gown had to be hers. No way would she let Harrison steal her moment.

This wasn't new. At the hot springs last month, Isabella had snatched the bikini Harrison wanted right from under her nose.

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto Harrison.

Oliver's arm slid around Harrison's waist, pulling her close. "Mr. Falcon," he drawled, "there's a hierarchy to these things. First come, first served. Surely you understand?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened as they followed Oliver's possessive grip. The casual shoulder touch earlier had been irritating enough. But this? His fingers dug into his palms.

Isabella pouted, deploying her signature manipulative charm. "Nathaniel, now that Oliver's Harrison's boyfriend, she thinks she's untouchable. You're my man. You wouldn't let me lose to her, would you?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened before turning to Oliver. "Rules are flexible, Mr. Sinclair. Power dictates them."

Oliver arched a brow. "Meaning?"

Nathaniel's stare shifted to Harrison. "Isabella wants that dress. Take it off and give it to her."

He actually ordered her to strip in public.

Oliver's smile remained, but his voice turned lethal. "Then it seems we have a duel, Mr. Falcon. A real man fights for his woman."

Oliver held Harrison while Nathaniel stood with Isabella. The boutique's air crackled with tension.

Two titans of industry, about to measure their worth in currency and pride.

Then Harrison spoke.

"No contest needed. I'll give her the dress."

Oliver blinked. "What—"

Harrison silenced him with a look. "It's just fabric."

She disappeared into the dressing room, emerging moments later with the folded gown. "Here, Isabella."

Isabella's triumphant smirk faltered when Harrison added, "Enjoy my hand-me-downs. Again."

The barb hit its mark. Isabella's face twisted. "You little—"

Oliver cut in smoothly. "Problem, Ms. Isabella? You got what you wanted. Or is throwing tantrums your default setting? Nathaniel, your girlfriend's mood swings must be exhausting."

Victoria intervened quickly. "Isabella, why not try it on for Nathaniel?"

Smart play. Isabella's ballerina physique would outshine Harrison's in that dress.

Penelope nodded eagerly. "You'll look ten times better than her!"

Harrison merely smiled as Isabella snatched the dress. Her fingers opened—letting the fabric flutter down like alms to a beggar.

The ultimate power move.
###Chapter 366

Isabella regained her composure. She shot Harrison a challenging look before disappearing into the dressing room with the lace gown.

Moments later, she emerged to immediate praise from Victoria and Penelope.

"Isabella, you're absolutely breathtaking!"

The dress did accentuate Isabella's beauty, but her expression betrayed discomfort. The waistline felt painfully constricting.

Inside the dressing room, she'd struggled to fasten the zipper, holding her breath until it barely closed.

She twirled before Nathaniel, the delicate fabric swirling around her. "Well? How do I look?"

Nathaniel's gaze remained impassive, his silence heavy.

Victoria rushed to fill the void. "Darling, you're stunning! As the prima ballerina, you outshine every ordinary woman here!"

A sudden tearing sound interrupted her. The delicate lace at Isabella's waist had split open.

Victoria's mouth snapped shut.

Isabella shrieked, hands flying to cover the gaping fabric. The humiliation burned hotter than the spotlight during her worst performance. And Nathaniel had witnessed it all.

The sales associate cleared her throat. "Perhaps you'd prefer the next size up, madam?"

The suggestion stung more than the dress's failure. Isabella's pride couldn't stomach admitting she needed a larger size.

Oliver's laughter rang out. "Ms. Isabella, is this your usual size? Clearly you've put on some weight recently."

Isabella's glare could have melted steel.

Oliver continued mercilessly, "Though honestly, comparing your figure to Harrison's is unfair. She's always had that natural, effortless grace."

Humiliation curdled into rage. Isabella turned on Harrison, venom dripping from her words. "You planned this! You knew this would happen and let me walk into this trap!"

Harrison blinked innocently. "Shouldn't you know your own measurements better than I do?"

Isabella's retort died as Nathaniel's commanding voice cut through the tension.

"Enough."

His icy stare silenced them all. "This ends now."

Victoria hustled Isabella back toward the dressing room. "Go change immediately!"

Isabella's face paled. She'd hoped to impress Nathaniel, not become a laughingstock. With reluctant steps, she retreated.

Oliver slung an arm around Harrison. "Let's find somewhere less... dramatic to shop."

Harrison nodded, eager to escape the scene. "Agreed."

As they passed Margaret and Penelope, Harrison paused. "Here's some free advice - ask Dr. Sinclair for money tonight. Let's see how generous she is."

Oliver's brows shot up. "Dr. Sinclair?"

Margaret and Penelope exchanged glances before recovering their composure.

"That's right, Mr. Oliver! Dr. Sinclair and I are together now," Penelope declared proudly.

"And soon to be family!" Margaret added with a smug smile.

Oliver's laughter held disbelief. "Dr. Sinclair isn't a man. She's a woman."
###Chapter 367

Dr. Sinclair was a woman?

Both Margaret and Penelope froze, their faces draining of color. "Mr. Oliver, what do you mean? Dr. Sinclair can't possibly be female. I'm dating him! He's definitely a man!"

Oliver arched one eyebrow. "Not only do I know Dr. Sinclair, we're actually quite close. Let me repeat - she's a woman."

Penelope stood motionless, shock rendering her speechless. "That's absurd! You must be lying to me!"

Margaret also refused to believe it. "Mr. Oliver, I understand you're seeing Harrison now, but there's no need for such cruel jokes."

Seeing their disbelief, Oliver simply shrugged. "Dr. Sinclair is female. Believe what you want. Harrison, let's go."

"Alright."

Oliver turned and left with Harrison.

Margaret and Penelope remained rooted in place, stunned.

Margaret clutched Penelope's arm nervously. "Why would Mr. Oliver claim Dr. Sinclair is a woman? What's happening?"

Just then, Isabella emerged from the fitting room, now dressed in her regular clothes. She and Victoria approached them with grave expressions.

"Penelope, are you absolutely certain the person you're dating is truly Dr. Sinclair?"

"This is critical, Penelope!" Margaret stressed. "We've invested everything. I even mortgaged the family estate. If we've been deceived, the Whitmore family is ruined!"

Penelope, equally anxious, had always believed she was romantically involved with Dr. Sinclair. When Harrison first warned that Dr. Sinclair might be a fraud, no one listened. Now, with Oliver's revelation, doubt crept in.

But she forced composure. "Why trust Mr. Oliver? He's Harrison's partner. Obviously he's just trying to mess with us. Don't fall for it!"

Isabella turned to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, what do you think?"

Nathaniel glanced toward where Harrison and Oliver had disappeared, his voice low and measured.

"I've never met Dr. Sinclair. Our paths never crossed. But Oliver operates in Florentia's highest circles, with connections in both legal and underground networks. If he claims to know Dr. Sinclair and insists she's female, there might be truth to it."

Penelope's anxiety deepened while Isabella paled.

They'd just celebrated their fortunes multiplying tenfold, only to potentially discover they'd been swindled.

No one could accept this!

At that moment, Nathaniel's phone rang.

He looked at Isabella. "Continue your shopping. I need to return to the office."

With that, Nathaniel departed.

"Nathaniel!"

Margaret grabbed Isabella's arm. "What do we do now? You must ask Mr. Falcon for help!"

Isabella sighed. "Nathaniel warned us against investing with Dr. Sinclair."

What?

Margaret's expression shifted dramatically.

Penelope finally spoke. "We can't panic yet. Here's the plan - I'll call Dr. Sinclair tonight and demand our money back."

"Fine. We'll await your call."

That evening, Penelope returned home. Frederick and Cassandra immediately surrounded her.

"Penelope, didn't you go out with Dr. Sinclair today? When's the wedding? Your grandmother wants you and Isabella to have a joint ceremony that'll stun Willowbrook. Your father and I have been boasting to all the local elites, and now everyone's green with envy," Cassandra gushed.

Frederick lounged on the sofa.

"The second branch has been flaunting their connection to Mr. Falcon. But now Dr. Sinclair will be our son-in-law. We've finally one-upped them! Penelope, you must secure Dr. Sinclair. A miracle doctor - that's our ultimate triumph."
###Chapter 368

Frederick and Cassandra were utterly delighted with Dr. Sinclair as their prospective son-in-law.

Penelope's face darkened instantly. She grabbed her phone and dialed Dr. Sinclair's number.

The call connected, but instead of his smooth voice, a mechanical recording played.
"The number you have dialed is no longer in service."

No longer in service?

Penelope's stomach dropped. She redialed immediately.

The same robotic voice repeated the message.
"The number you have dialed is no longer in service."

Fingers trembling, Penelope tried messaging him on WhatsApp. The message wouldn't deliver - only one gray checkmark appeared instead of two.

Dr. Sinclair had blocked her.

Disconnected number. Blocked on messaging apps. The man who'd whispered sweet nothings yesterday had vanished without a trace.

Her phone clattered onto the plush carpet. Penelope collapsed beside it like a marionette with cut strings.

"Penelope! What's wrong?"

"Why are you on the floor? Get up!"

Frederick and Cassandra rushed to help, only to find her skin icy and limbs shaking violently.



Meanwhile, Harrison and Oliver had just stepped outside. Oliver chuckled darkly.

"Harrison, the Whitmores are truly delusional! Imagining they could force Dr. Sinclair to marry into their family? Ridiculous!"

Harrison arched one perfect eyebrow. "They've been living in fantasyland. I warned them, but they called it jealousy. If they've been swindled out of money or dignity, that's their own doing."

Oliver grinned. "Wait until they discover Dr. Sinclair's true identity. That'll be priceless."

Harrison's lips curved slightly. Just then, her phone buzzed with a WhatsApp notification from Rosalind.

[Harrison, Professor Whitmore invited us to dinner tonight.]

Alistair?

Harrison had been so preoccupied lately, she'd nearly forgotten about her favorite student.

She typed back, [Fine, we'll go together.]

Rosalind replied instantly, [I have an errand off-campus. Can you wait in our dorm? I'll return soon.]

Harrison smirked. [Important business? Meeting Everett, the campus heartthrob?]

Rosalind sent an indignant emoji. [Stop teasing or I'll block you!]

Harrison ended the chat. Despite her busy schedule, she knew Rosalind had been pursuing Everett, who remained frustratingly elusive.

"I need to go to Willowridge University," Harrison told Oliver.

"I'll drive you."



They climbed into the luxury sedan - Oliver behind the wheel, Harrison in the passenger seat.

Her phone buzzed again.

A message from Nathaniel.

He'd forced her to add him on social media during their Wintervale trip, and now he was prying.

Harrison opened the message.

[Is Oliver really your boyfriend?]

Demanding confirmation about Oliver's status.

She didn't reply.

Another message arrived. [How did you two meet?]

Nathaniel had razor-sharp instincts and was probing their connection.

Harrison remained silent.

His next message vibrated with barely restrained fury.

[Answer me!]
###Chapter 369

"Answer me!" Nathaniel's voice cut through the air like a whip.

Harrison couldn't suppress a laugh.

Who did he think he was? Her commanding officer? Since when did she take orders from him?

She turned away pointedly.

Oliver chuckled from the driver's seat. "Harrison, even though you and Mr. Falcon are divorced, the tension between you two is palpable. Does he still have feelings for you?"

She shrugged, feigning indifference. "Couldn't care less."

Oliver smirked. "When I put my arm around you in that boutique, he looked ready to murder me with his bare hands. I must say, playing your fake boyfriend is hazardous work."

She shot him a look. "If you're scared, I could always ask Maxwell or Evelyn."

"Over my dead body! I'd take a bullet for you any day."

Their laughter filled the car as they pulled up to Willowridge University. Harrison headed straight for the girls' dorm, only to find Rosalind's bed empty.

She settled in to wait.

Just as Harrison suspected, Rosalind had gone looking for Everett.

Rosalind arrived at Everett's classroom when two male students intercepted her before she could call out.

"Hey, Rosalind!"

She blinked in surprise. "You know my name?"

"You've been coming here daily for a week. Of course we recognize you!"

"And now you're practically famous on campus. That whole scene at the basketball game where Everett and Julian were fighting over you? Campus legend."

Rosalind hadn't realized her newfound notoriety. With her birthmark gone, her delicate features drew admiring glances wherever she went.

Today she wore the school uniform - crisp white blouse, navy blue skirt, matching blazer. Her raven hair cascaded freely, her bangs framing an innocent schoolgirl look.

Her cheeks flushed pink. "Is Everett here today?"

The boys shook their heads. "Haven't seen him in days."

Another absence.

Disappointment twisted in her chest. "Thanks anyway." She adjusted her handbag containing his forgotten jacket.

After winning the basketball game against Julian, Everett had walked away without a backward glance.

Rosalind ducked into the women's restroom. Moments later, a group of senior girls entered, led by Adriana Rowe - the department's reigning beauty.

Adriana came from old money, famous for her modelesque legs that had half the male student body swooning. Her friends teased her mercilessly.

"Made any progress with Everett yet?"

Rosalind's ears perked up at the name.

Adriana tossed her hair. "Please. I've been chasing him forever and he acts like I'm invisible. Probably just playing hard to get."

Her perfect pout showed her frustration.

"Of course he is! Who could resist you, especially in those miniskirts?"

"Honestly, Everett's an idiot. How many rich heirs have driven sports cars to your dorm? And he thinks he's too good for you?"

Adriana's smile turned bitter. "Let's be real - I only like him because he's gorgeous. That whole brooding bad boy thing. Otherwise, with his messy background? I wouldn't touch him with a ten-foot pole."
###Chapter 370

One of the girls in the group curled her lip in disdain. "Everett's father was a drug lord, wasn't he?"

Adriana tossed her hair. "Exactly. The son of a criminal. His mother's blind, and he's got a kid sister in middle school. Their situation is pathetic, but that just makes me want him more. It's like...a challenge." She let out a sharp laugh.

The other girls joined in, their mocking laughter echoing through the bathroom as they ridiculed Everett's family circumstances.

Rosalind's hands clenched around the sink. She turned off the faucet with a sharp twist and fixed Adriana with a glare that could freeze fire. "Finished?"

The sudden interruption made the group fall silent.

Adriana's eyes narrowed as she recognized Rosalind. "Well, if it isn't the famous Rosalind Fairchild. What business is this of yours?"

Rosalind's jaw tightened. "Making fun of someone's suffering isn't entertainment. Grow up."

She'd been to Everett's home. Though modest, it was filled with warmth. His mother and sister were kind souls who adored him.

The apartment might have been small and dim, but it was where Everett had grown up. The drunken slurs of "bastard" she'd heard that night spoke volumes about the hardships he'd endured.

You don't have to love someone, but you don't get to hurt them either.

Rosalind wouldn't stand by while Adriana led this pack of hyenas in tearing Everett down.

Adriana smirked, looking Rosalind up and down. "Rumor has it you've been chasing after Everett yourself. Must be quite the catch to reel in a rich girl like you."

Rosalind wasn't pursuing Everett, but that wasn't the point. She owed these vipers no explanations.

She stepped forward, voice low but razor-sharp. "My interest in Everett is none of your concern. But your sour grapes? Those are painfully obvious."

Adriana's face flushed crimson. The barb had struck true. She'd wanted Everett for years, and now that she couldn't have him, bitterness consumed her.

Seeing her secret laid bare, Adriana's hands balled into fists, nails digging into her palms.

Rosalind turned to leave, grabbing her bag from the counter.

Then Adriana's voice cut through the air behind her. "What's wrong with stating facts? Everett's nothing but a drug dealer's bastard. He should be grateful I ever looked his way!"

Rosalind froze. Slowly, she turned back. "Say that again."

Adriana smirked, emboldened. "I said Everett Sinclair is—"

Rosalind's hands shot out, shoving Adriana hard.

The girl stumbled back, barely catching herself against the wall. Her face twisted in rage. "You bitch! You'll pay for that!" She snapped her fingers at her friends. "Get her!"

The pack descended.

Though petite, Rosalind fought like a wildcat. When Adriana lunged for her face, Rosalind grabbed a fistful of blonde hair and yanked hard, slamming her opponent to the tile floor.

"Let me teach you some manners," Rosalind hissed through gritted teeth.

"Rosalind! Let go!" Adriana shrieked.

They rolled across the bathroom floor, a tangle of limbs and flying hair as the other girls joined the fray.

Chaos erupted.
###Chapter 371

A crowd quickly formed around the commotion.

"Fight! There's a fight happening!"

Rosalind's heart pounded with fear. Campus brawls meant serious disciplinary action. The worst part? She was the one getting beaten - and it hurt like hell.

Adriana had pinned Rosalind to the ground the entire time. Though a few other girls joined in attacking Adriana, it made no difference.

Adriana fought like a wildcat. Every inch of Rosalind's body burned with pain.

Finally managing to push Adriana off, Rosalind gasped, "You'll pay for this, Adriana! I'm getting backup!" She grabbed her friends and fled.

Adriana stood unfazed despite her torn clothes and fresh bruises. She picked up her designer bag and headed straight for the locker room. No way was she walking around campus looking like this.

Zero regrets about the fight. People who talked trash didn't deserve her patience.

While Rosalind went crying for reinforcements, Adriana waited.

Peeling off her ruined blouse made her wince. Angry red scratches covered her arms and torso. The adrenaline had masked the pain, but now it hit full force.

Her phone's cheerful ringtone shattered the silence.

Harrison calling.

Adriana answered to hear Harrison's urgent voice. "Where are you? I heard you got into a fight!"

Harrison had been waiting at their dorm when someone rushed in saying they'd seen Adriana brawling.

"I'm fine," Adriana said through gritted teeth. "Ran into Rosalind and her crew badmouthing Everett."

"You fought over Everett?" Harrison sounded shocked.

"Six against one, but I held my own - damn it!" Adriana hissed as she accidentally touched a fresh wound.

"Tell me where you are. I'm coming now."

Adriana gave her location and Harrison hung up immediately.

Harrison sprinted toward the locker room, only to spot a familiar tall figure - Everett.

He was on campus today.

Dressed in his signature all-black ensemble: unbuttoned dress shirt revealing a white tee underneath, tailored trousers emphasizing his lean frame. His sharp jawline and piercing gaze made him stand out even in the crowded hallway. That untouchable aura surrounded him like always.

Exactly the qualities that made all the privileged girls at Willowridge University swoon.

Harrison didn't hesitate. "Everett! Wait up!"

He paused, turning with an indifferent expression. "Yes?"

"I'm Adriana's best friend. Remember Adriana?" Harrison said quickly.

Everett didn't respond. Just turned to leave.

Harrison blinked at his coldness before stepping directly into his path.

"Adriana just got into a fight because some girls were trash-talking you."

Everett's gaze flickered over Harrison but he remained silent, moving to walk around her.

"Look, I'm not trying to guilt you," Harrison persisted. "But she really appreciated what you did for her before. I know you want nothing to do with her, but the more you avoid her, the more she... Could you just see her for five minutes?"
###Chapter 372

Rosalind reached for a fresh outfit in the changing room, her back to the door as she began slipping out of her undergarments.

A gentle knock interrupted her.

Harrison already? That was faster than expected.

"Come in," Rosalind called over her shoulder.

The door creaked open.

But it wasn't Harrison who entered - it was Everett.

Everett stepped inside just as Rosalind was adjusting her new bra, her delicate fingers struggling with the clasp behind her back.

He froze. He'd knocked, but this wasn't what he'd anticipated.

Rosalind's porcelain skin practically glowed in the dim light, her slender frame accentuated by the school uniform skirt. Dark silken waves cascaded down her back, framing her graceful shoulders. The curve of her spine was mesmerizing, her waist impossibly narrow before flaring out into perfect feminine proportions.

Everett immediately averted his gaze, heat rising to his cheeks as he turned toward the exit. Before he could retreat, Rosalind's voice stopped him.

"I can't fasten this clasp. Could you help me?" She took several steps backward until she stood directly before him. "Right here - I can't reach it."

Everett remained motionless.

Rosalind's tone grew more urgent. "Please, my arms hurt... my whole body aches... Ouch."

His eyes dropped against his will. Angry red marks marred her otherwise flawless skin - remnants of their earlier altercation. The sight stirred something unexpected in him.

With hesitant fingers, he reached for the clasp. The intricate hooks proved challenging for his inexperienced hands. He worked methodically, careful to avoid contact with her skin.

Rosalind tilted her head. "Having trouble too? Maybe it's too tight now. It fit perfectly before." She glanced down thoughtfully. "Unless I've grown? That would be nice. Men prefer fuller figures, don't they? Not that I expect to reach Arabella's proportions, but a D cup would be lovely!"

Everett nearly choked.

After what felt like an eternity, the clasp finally secured.

He turned sharply toward the door.

"Wait!" Rosalind spun around. "Harrison, why are you so quiet tod- AH!"

Her shriek echoed off the walls as she came face-to-face with Everett instead. She scrambled for her blouse, hastily covering herself.

Everett reached for the door handle again.

"Stop right there!" Rosalind commanded.

His large hand froze on the knob. Before he could react, Rosalind wedged herself between him and the door, slamming it shut with her body.

She tilted her head up defiantly, cheeks flushed. "Everett Sinclair, I said stop! Are you deaf? You're not leaving!"

They stood nearly chest-to-chest now, though Everett towered over her by a full foot. His expression remained impassive. "What do you want?"

Rosalind's flush deepened. "I should be asking you that! You just saw everything!"
###Chapter 373

Rosalind accused Everett of seeing her naked.

Everett met her gaze without flinching. "I didn't."

"Don't lie! Are you saying you didn't look at me at all?" Her voice turned sharp as a blade.

Silence. But his hesitation spoke volumes. Of course he'd looked - no man could resist that temptation.

Rosalind's delicate cheeks flushed crimson. The memory made her blood boil with equal parts fury and embarrassment. She'd thought it was Harrison entering the room, not him.

"What exactly did you see? What did you hear?" She pressed closer, curiosity burning.

Everett remained frustratingly silent.

She hated when he did this - shutting her out with that infuriating quiet. "Cat got your tongue?" she taunted.

Finally, he spoke. "You said you wanted a D cup..."

"Ah!" Rosalind shrieked, springing onto her toes to clamp a hand over his mouth. "Stop talking right now!"

Her sudden movement erased the space between them. Everett found himself staring into those luminous eyes - the same captivating gaze he remembered from their first meeting. Eyes that sparkled like sunlight dancing on water.

That stormy night when he'd accidentally saved her, she'd still worn that birthmark, but her eyes had been just as mesmerizing.

Everett gently removed her hand. "I wouldn't have said anything if you hadn't pushed."

Rosalind scowled. "I told you to shut up!"

With cool indifference, Everett turned toward the door. "Goodbye then."

She blocked his path, planting herself firmly in the doorway. "You saw everything! What are you going to do about it?"

Amusement flickered in his eyes. "What do you want me to do?"

Rosalind considered for a beat. "If you saw me, then I get to see you. Fair's fair."

Everett blinked, clearly unprepared for this turn.

Emboldened by his arrogance, Rosalind grabbed the hem of his white tank top and started lifting.

His large hand stopped her instantly, pressing her hand back down. "Rosalind," he warned, voice dropping an octave.

Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Oh, so you do know my name. I was beginning to wonder." She tugged at the fabric again. "I'm seeing all of you today."

As the fabric rose, tanned skin came into view - a stark contrast to her porcelain complexion. His body bore the marks of outdoor labor, all rugged masculinity.

Higher she pulled, revealing six perfectly sculpted abs. Rosalind's breath caught. Her gaze traveled lower, where his black pants hugged narrow hips, leaving little to the imagination.

Then she saw them - scars. Dozens crisscrossing his torso. Some fresh, others faded with time. How could one body hold so much pain?

Reaching out, she wanted to trace them -

Everett seized both wrists, pinning them against the wall. His muscular frame pressed close, voice a dangerous growl. "I only looked. I didn't touch."

Rosalind blinked, startled by his sudden proximity. His handsome face hovered mere inches away.

"Wh-what are you doing?" she stammered.

Everett froze. Only then realizing their bodies pressed together, chest to chest. The tension between them crackled like live wires.
###Chapter 374

Everett immediately let go of her wrists and retreated several steps, creating distance between them.

Rosalind felt warmth trickling from her nose. When she touched it, her fingers came away stained crimson.

"Oh no! I'm bleeding," she gasped, panic lacing her voice.

Everett glanced over and saw the blood. He pulled out two tissues and handed them to her. "Tilt your head back. It'll stop."

Rosalind accepted the tissues and complied, confusion clouding her features. "Why is this happening?"

Everett offered no explanation. He turned on his heel and pushed through the door.

The icy wind slapped his face the moment he stepped outside. Its sharp bite helped erase the lingering sweetness of the girl's perfume from his senses.

Rosalind caught up moments later, having stemmed the nosebleed. "Wait! Why do you have all those scars?"

Everett didn't slow his long strides.

Undeterred, Rosalind kept pace beside him. "Are those from fights? You shouldn't be brawling. Focus on your education. Knowledge is power."

Everett remained silent, acting as though she didn't exist.

A group approached ahead - Adriana flanked by several girls.

Adriana's face flushed with fury as she shouted, "Rosalind! Stop right there! I've brought backup. Scared now?"

Rosalind blinked in surprise at Adriana's audacity. She moved to step forward. "I'm not afraid-"

Everett blocked her path before she could finish. His lean frame shielded Rosalind as he fixed Adriana with an arctic stare.

Adriana faltered, her anger momentarily checked. Truthfully, she'd harbored genuine feelings for Everett, rejecting countless wealthy suitors for him.

"Everett, I-" she began.

He parted his lips slightly, delivering one frigid word: "Leave."

Just that. Leave.

Adriana's face drained of color as humiliation and heartbreak crashed over her. Her fists clenched. "Everett, I love you! I've swallowed my pride chasing after you all this time. How can you dismiss me like this? Have you no heart?"

Everett regarded her impassively. "I'm not interested."

The public rejection turned Adriana ghostly pale. Her voice cracked. "Not interested? Then who? Her?" She jabbed a finger at Rosalind behind him. "Do you have feelings for Rosalind?"

Everett said nothing.

To a woman, silence always felt like confirmation. Adriana's composure shattered.

"You do, don't you? Protecting her when you've never protected me! What does she have that I don't? Why her?"

Everett's patience evaporated. "Are you leaving or not?"

The cruelty of his dismissal cut deep. Adriana laughed bitterly.

"You think you're so special? You're just a drug dealer's son, dragging around your blind mother and sick sister! And what do you do outside school? Others might not know, but I do. Construction sites, odd jobs - you're nothing but a broke laborer!"

Rosalind's fists clenched as she stepped forward. "Adriana, why must you be so cruel?"

Adriana's gaze swept over Rosalind before landing on the crystal hairpin. "That little trinket in your hair is Chanel's new collection. Must have cost a fortune, hmm?"
###Chapter 375

Rosalind froze mid-step. The delicate chatelaine pinned to her blouse had been a birthday gift from her favorite aunt.

Adriana's laughter rang out sharp and mocking. "That's a designer piece worth thousands, yet you wear it like cheap costume jewelry. Do you really think someone like Everett could ever afford such luxuries? You two are ridiculous together."

Rosalind squared her shoulders, hands finding her hips. "Since when do you care about my love life? One thing's certain - you and Everett would be a disaster!"

Adriana's face twisted. "You little-"

Everett cut in, his voice like winter frost. "Walk away. I won't warn you again."

Adriana visibly trembled under his glacial stare, caught between longing and fear.

"Fine!" She spat the word like venom. "Enjoy your pathetic little romance while it lasts. Neither of you will end up happy!" With a dramatic swirl of her designer coat, she stormed off with her entourage in tow.

"Finally." Rosalind turned to Everett with a relieved sigh. "Don't fall for her act. She's horrible - did you hear the way she talked about you?"

Everett tilted his head. "What exactly did she say?"

Rosalind hesitated, choosing her words carefully to spare his pride. "She... mentioned your family situation."

Understanding flashed in his eyes. His background was no secret, and others' opinions meant nothing to him.

Everett studied Rosalind's face - those wide, expressive eyes that revealed every emotion. "Is that why you confronted her? Because she insulted me?"

"Yes!" The word burst from her before she could stop it.

Suddenly, Everett closed the distance between them in one fluid stride. His voice dropped to a murmur. "So you have feelings for me?"

Rosalind's pulse skyrocketed. Her heart hammered against her ribs with unfamiliar intensity. Heat flooded her cheeks.

With Julian, she'd never felt this wildfire sensation - only polite affection. But Everett set her entire being ablaze with just a look.

This was new. This was terrifying. This was undeniable.

From the moment he'd appeared like some dark knight in the rainstorm, she'd been hopelessly drawn to him.

Rosalind gazed up at him, uncertainty warring with longing in her eyes. "I..."

Everett recognized that look instantly. He'd seen it countless times from Adriana and others.

He stepped closer still. "Do you want me to be your boyfriend?"

Rosalind twisted the fabric of her shirt between nervous fingers. Shyness battled with her passionate nature. When she loved, she loved fiercely - and she wasn't afraid to say it.

Tilting her chin up, she met his gaze. "Would you?"

Everett shook his head. "No."

Rosalind's breath caught.

His expression remained unreadable as he delivered the final blow. "Don't waste your time on me. I'm not interested."

Without another word, he turned and walked away.

Rosalind stood rooted to the spot, stunned. Not interested? Then why ask at all?

She watched his retreating form disappear around the corner, frustration bubbling in her chest. What just happened?

A familiar voice sliced through her confusion.

"Julian, did you hear that? Rosalind confessed to Everett and got rejected! How pathetic!" Arabella's mocking tone carried clearly.

Rosalind whirled to find two unwelcome spectators - Arabella and Julian.

Apparently, word of her confrontation with Adriana had spread quickly. They'd arrived just in time to witness her humiliation.

Julian's gaze was icy with disapproval. Arabella looked positively gleeful.

Rosalind refused to feel embarrassed. Rejection stung, but she'd survive.

"Well, if it isn't the campus gossip brigade," she drawled, rolling her eyes. "Don't you two have better things to do than eavesdrop?"
###Chapter 376

Rosalind turned sharply and walked away, leaving Arabella standing frozen in place, utterly speechless.

Julian immediately moved to block her path. "So you actually have feelings for Everett?"

Rosalind didn't hesitate. "Yes, I do."

Julian's face twisted in disbelief. "That's impossible! How could you possibly be interested in someone like Everett? This is just some twisted way to get back at me, isn't it? I never took you for the petty type."

Rosalind exhaled sharply. "Julian, listen to me—it's over. We were kids back then, and you took advantage of me. You cheated. But the truth is, I never loved you. Not really. Everett is who I want now."

Julian's expression darkened. He couldn't process that the girl who once chased after him had moved on—to someone like Everett, of all people.

"Do you even know what kind of man Everett is? His background is a disaster. Do you seriously think he can provide for you? Or are you planning to be his sugar mama?" he sneered.

Rosalind's eyes narrowed. "I don’t know where you and your entitled friends get your arrogance from. The only difference between you and Everett is that you were born with money. But here’s the truth—I care about him. And I’ll do whatever I damn well please."

"You—" Julian's face flushed with fury.

"Move. You're in my way."

Julian didn’t budge. His grip on her wrist tightened, his glare burning into her.

Rosalind turned to Arabella, her voice icy. "Arabella, was this your plan? Bring Julian here to harass me?"

Arabella’s expression faltered. Lately, Julian had been distant—nothing like the sweet, attentive lover he’d been during their affair.

She had only brought him to watch Rosalind’s humiliation, not to reignite his obsession.

Arabella quickly stepped forward, clutching Julian’s arm. "Julian, you and Rosalind are done. She’s made her choice—let her embarrass herself. Let’s go."

She tried to pull him away.

But Julian’s jaw clenched, unmoving. "Rosalind, you won’t stop until you see the truth for yourself. Fine. I’ll show you exactly who Everett really is."

With that, he roughly shook Arabella off.

She stumbled back, barely catching herself.

Ignoring her, Julian grabbed Rosalind’s wrist and dragged her forward.

Arabella seethed. "Julian!"

What the hell was wrong with him?

Julian forced Rosalind toward his car—a sleek black Ferrari, a symbol of the Blackwood family’s status.

Rosalind fought against his grip. "Let go! You're hurting me!"

Julian glanced down, noticing the red marks his fingers had left on her delicate skin.

His gaze flickered over her face—the soft features, the porcelain complexion, the striking beauty that had once been hidden beneath that birthmark. Her eyes burned like embers, fierce yet fragile.

He released her wrist and yanked open the passenger door. "Then get in."

"No."

"I'm taking you to Everett. Don't you want to see what he's really up to?"
###Chapter 377

Rosalind froze when Julian spoke. Without further protest, she climbed into the Ferrari's passenger seat.

Julian slid behind the wheel, his jaw clenched tight. "Are you really this obsessed with Everett?"

She'd refused to enter his car earlier. Yet for Everett, she'd complied instantly.

Rosalind met Julian's stormy gaze. "Do you hear how irrational you sound?" Julian blinked, caught off guard.

"I stepped aside for you and Arabella," she continued evenly. "She's your girlfriend now. Perfect figure, dancer's grace - exactly your type. Shouldn't you be with her? Why keep harassing me?"

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "R-"

"Julian," she cut in, eyes glinting with mockery, "don't tell me you've developed feelings for me."

The sardonic edge in her voice struck like a slap. Julian barked a bitter laugh. "Delusional much? You think I'd ever fall for you?"

"Good," Rosalind replied coolly.

His belated affection meant nothing now. She wanted none of it.

Julian recognized his reaction stemmed from possessiveness. Rosalind had once orbited his world. Now she'd inexplicably shifted her attention to Everett - his academic rival. Naturally, it unsettled him.

If this was her ploy for attention, he had to admit - it worked.

Thirty minutes later, the Ferrari halted before a bustling construction site. Rosalind stepped out.

The chaotic scene was foreign to her. The noise, the dust - this was Everett's reality.

Her delicate leather flats sank into mud, the pristine edges instantly soiled.

Julian glanced down. "Your shoes are ruined. Need a tissue?"

Rosalind shook her head. "Where's Everett?"

Julian gestured ahead. "There."

Among workers in blue uniforms and yellow hardhats, one figure stood out - tall, striking, radiating quiet intensity. Everett.

He was hauling cement bags at a construction site.

Adriana had mentioned Everett juggled multiple jobs, including manual labor. Apparently, she hadn't lied.

Rosalind watched as Everett, coated in dust and sweat, shouldered another heavy bag. He worked with single-minded focus, unaware of their presence.

Julian smirked. "This is your crush? Seriously? What do you see in someone like him?"

Her gaze followed Everett as he lifted bag after bag, his strong frame bending under the weight. Workers were paid per bag carried - he'd already moved nine, his back slightly bowed from the strain.

"Let's go back," Rosalind said suddenly.

She turned away without explanation.

Julian grinned, certain she'd finally realized the impossibility of a relationship with someone like Everett.

"Now you understand. Everett isn't right for you. You deserve better-"

"Julian," she interrupted, voice steady, "I'm leaving because I won't humiliate Everett. He has pride. You should respect that."

What?

Julian froze. He'd assumed she'd lost interest. Instead, she was protecting Everett's dignity with surprising sensitivity.
###Chapter 378

Julian's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists. "Rosalind, has Everett got you under some kind of spell?"

"That's not your concern!" Rosalind shot back sharply.

Julian crossed his arms with a bitter laugh. "Fine! Then what I choose to do isn't your concern either. I'm going to have a word with Everett right now."

He spun on his heel, striding purposefully toward the construction zone.

Rosalind's expression darkened instantly. She grabbed Julian's arm. "Stop this madness! People are working here! You can't just barge in!"

Just then, the site supervisor hurried over, parting the workers. He bowed slightly to Julian. "Mr. Blackwood, what an unexpected visit! The site's in complete disarray - you'll ruin that designer suit. Are you conducting an inspection today?"

Rosalind froze.

Julian turned to her with a smug grin. "Oh, did I forget to mention? This is Blackwood property. I oversee all our construction projects. My presence here is perfectly normal."

Rosalind had momentarily forgotten the Blackwood family's vast real estate empire. Of course Everett would end up working on their land.

Julian addressed the supervisor. "I understand there's a worker named Everett Sinclair here."

The supervisor nodded eagerly. "Yes, sir. Excellent worker."

"Bring him to me."

The supervisor immediately bellowed, "Everett! Front and center!"

Everett carefully set down the concrete bag he'd been carrying. His gaze locked onto Julian and Rosalind immediately.

Though the site buzzed with activity, the arrival of a gleaming Ferrari and two impeccably dressed visitors had drawn every eye.

Everett approached with measured steps, his expression unreadable.

The supervisor beamed. "Mr. Blackwood, this is Everett. Young, but stronger than any three men here. Never complains about any task."

Julian gave Everett a slow once-over. "What an interesting coincidence. Never imagined I'd find you laboring on my family's property."

Everett's voice remained ice-cold. "Was there something you needed? If not, I have work to do."

Rosalind interjected quickly. "We don't need anything. You should return to your duties."

She tried to steer Julian away, but he only chuckled. "Everett, what's your maximum load for these concrete bags?"

The supervisor answered proudly, "Eight bags, sir. Most men can't manage more than five."

Julian's smile turned predatory. "Here's a proposition. Carry nine bags, I'll pay you a hundred. Make it ten, two hundred. Money's no object. Let's see what you're really capable of."

The supervisor paled. "Mr. Blackwood, that's dangerous! Eight is already pushing human limits!"

Julian kept his eyes locked on Everett. "You're always talking about needing money. Well, here's your golden opportunity."

Rosalind's face flushed with anger. "Julian! Stop this ridiculous game! Must you always flaunt your privilege?"

Julian turned to her innocently. "I'm not forcing anyone. Just offering paid entertainment. He wants money, I want amusement. Perfect arrangement." His gaze swung back to Everett. "Well? Are you game?"

Rosalind moved between them. "Everett, don't indulge him! This could cause serious injury!"

Before she could finish, Everett said calmly, "I'll do it."

Rosalind stared in disbelief.

The supervisor produced a folding chair. Julian settled in, clearly anticipating a show.


###Chapter 379

Rosalind rushed to Everett's side. "This isn't worth it! If you need money that badly, I can—"

Everett's sharp glance silenced her immediately.

She hadn't meant to offend his pride - she just couldn't bear watching him harm himself.

Everett nodded to the supervisor. "Let's begin."

The supervisor started loading bags onto Everett's broad shoulders. Eight bags piled on effortlessly. Then came the ninth. Tenth.

Julian applauded mockingly. "Impressive! Who knew you'd debase yourself so eagerly for cash? Here's one... two hundred!"

He tossed crisp bills onto the dusty ground.

The supervisor added more weight - eleven. Twelve.

"Three. Four hundred."

More money fluttered down.

With twelve bags now, sweat poured down Everett's face, soaking through his work shirt. His muscles trembled visibly, yet his expression remained stoic.

Rosalind stood helpless, every protest dying on her lips.

The supervisor looked increasingly uncomfortable. "Everett, say the word and we'll stop."

Silence.

Thirteen. Fourteen bags.

"Five hundred. Six hundred."

Julian scattered bills across the ground.

Rosalind watched Everett's spine bow under the crushing weight. She turned to Julian, voice trembling with fury. "Enough! Stop this now!"

A melodic ringtone sliced through the tension - Everett's phone.

The supervisor seized the reprieve. "Everett! Your phone! Let's pause here."

Everett carefully deposited his burden before returning.

Julian gestured to the money on the ground. "Your earnings. Take them."

As Everett bent down, Rosalind moved faster. She gathered the bills, brushed off the dirt, and pressed them firmly into Everett's hands. "Your six hundred dollars."

Everett Sinclair stared into Rosalind Fairchild's luminous almond eyes for a long moment before accepting the cash. His gaze shifted to Julian Blackwood, icy and unreadable.

"Appreciate it, Mr. Blackwood. Feel free to toss more money my way anytime. I'm game for your little games."

Julian shot up from his seat, face contorted with rage. "You insolent—"

He hadn't anticipated Everett's composure. The boy showed no trace of shame or hesitation.

Everett's phone buzzed. His mother's caller ID flashed on screen. But when he answered, it was Lillian's panicked voice that came through.

"Everett! It's Mom—she—" Sobs choked her words.

His stomach dropped. "Lilly, breathe. Tell me what happened."

"Mom collapsed! Mrs. Beatrice helped me get her to the clinic, but they said she needs a proper hospital. I don't know where—I'm so scared—"

His thirteen-year-old sister's terror sent adrenaline coursing through him. "Stay put. I'm coming." He ended the call and broke into a sprint without explanation.

Rosalind called after him, heels clicking as she gave chase. "Everett! Wait! What's wrong?"

###Chapter 380

Rosalind was about to chase after Everett.

Julian grabbed her wrist roughly. "Where do you think you're going? You're staying right here!"

She wrenched her arm free. "You don't own me!"

Without hesitation, she sprinted after Everett while Julian cursed under his breath.

Rosalind followed Everett to a small clinic. Margaret lay unconscious on a narrow hospital bed.

Lillian stood weeping beside her mother, face drained of color. Their elderly neighbor Beatrice was attempting to comfort the distraught girl.

"Lillian!" Everett called out as he arrived.

"Everett!" The fragile girl collapsed into her brother's arms, sobs wracking her small frame. "Please help Mom! She won't wake up no matter what we do..."

Everett stroked his sister's back before turning to their motionless mother. "Mom!"

No response came.

Beatrice spoke up urgently, "Everett, you must transfer her to a proper hospital immediately. The doctor said she needs comprehensive tests. But there's a bed shortage and we don't know which specialist to see. What should we do?"

The elderly woman sighed heavily. She knew the Sinclair siblings had shouldered their family burdens alone since their father's passing. Tragedy always seemed to find those least equipped to bear it.

Before Everett could respond, Rosalind arrived breathlessly. "I can help. I have connections at the city hospital. I'll arrange everything."

Lillian looked up through her tears. "Rosalind..."

Rosalind already had her phone out. "Don't worry, Lillian. I'm making the call now."

Everett's hand closed over her phone.

She met his gaze steadily. "This isn't about pride. One call solves everything."

After a tense moment, Everett released her phone.

Rosalind dialed quickly. "Father? I need your help."

Hanging up, she turned to Everett. "It's done. They're sending a team."

Within minutes, medical personnel in crisp white coats arrived. They transferred Margaret to a stretcher with practiced efficiency.

The lead doctor nodded at Rosalind. "Patient's vitals are stable. She's on oxygen support already. Dr. Theodore is prepped and waiting at Vitalis Health. Full diagnostics will begin immediately upon arrival."

Rosalind gave a tight nod. "Good."

She turned to the Sinclair siblings. "Let's all go to Vitalis together."

At the medical center, Margaret was whisked away for examination. Two hours later, she was settled in a private recovery suite, eyelids fluttering open.

The tense atmosphere dissolved instantly as Lillian rushed forward. "Mom!"

Margaret's vision cleared slowly. She reached weakly for her daughter's hand. "Sweetheart... I'm alright."

Everett clasped his mother's other hand. "What happened? Are you really okay?"

A faint smile touched Margaret's lips. "Just an old woman's weak constitution. Nothing to fret over."

Rosalind stepped forward. "Mrs. Sinclair, hello. I'm Rosalind Fairchild. We met before. Do you remember me?"

Recognition lit Margaret's face. How could she forget this poised, kind-hearted young woman? Exactly the sort of girl mothers hoped their sons would bring home.

Margaret's smile warmed. "Of course I remember you, Rosalind. Everett told me you hadn't visited in so long, I'd begun to worry."
###Chapter 381

Rosalind's lips curved into a gentle smile as she responded to Margaret. "I didn't want to interrupt your family time, so Everett and I usually meet at university."

Margaret chuckled softly, the sound warm with approval.

Just then, Theodore entered, prompting Rosalind to step outside.

In the physician's office, Theodore handed Rosalind a medical file. "Ms. Fairchild, we've received the patient's test results."

Rosalind's eyes searched his face anxiously. "What do they show?"

Theodore shook his head gravely. "The patient has terminal stage cancer."

What?!

Rosalind froze. "Terminal? Are you certain? Mrs. Sinclair always seemed so healthy."

"I'm afraid so," Theodore confirmed. "She's likely been battling this for years. She knew but never sought treatment or told anyone. The cancer has metastasized to her heart and brain. She has approximately two months remaining."

Rosalind collapsed into the chair, stunned. Only two months left for Margaret.

Why had she kept this secret? Why refuse treatment?

Everett and Lillian remained completely unaware.

In the hospital room, Beatrice and Lillian kept vigil by Margaret's bedside. Lillian poured a glass of water. "Mother, please drink something."

Margaret leaned back against the pillows, taking a small sip. She turned to Beatrice with a weak smile. "Beatrice, I'm so grateful for your help."

Beatrice gently squeezed Margaret's hand. "No thanks needed. I know how difficult it's been raising two children alone. You've endured so much."

Margaret's sightless eyes turned toward Lillian, still so young. "No matter the hardships, we've survived. Everett's grown strong, but I regret not being able to provide more for Lillian."

Beatrice sighed. "Everett has become remarkable. He takes after his father, Frederick. He's grown into such a capable man."

At the mention of Frederick Sinclair, Margaret's unfocused eyes suddenly brimmed with tears.

Beatrice immediately realized her mistake. Frederick remained an unhealed wound, a shared pain.

Margaret hadn't been born blind - she'd lost her sight from weeping for Frederick.

Beatrice quickly changed subjects. "That young woman, Rosalind - she's absolutely striking. Such delicate features, skin like porcelain, and eyes that sparkle. Her figure is exquisite too. Clearly a city girl through and through."

Margaret smiled softly. "Is Rosalind really that beautiful? I could tell from her voice - so sweet and gentle. She must be lovely."

Lillian chimed in proudly. "Mother, Rosalind is the prettiest girl I've ever seen."

Beatrice added, "And it's not just her looks. She's clearly well-educated, attending university with Everett. She must come from an important family. One phone call from her got you admitted here. That doctor examining you - Dr. Theodore - I recognize him from medical journals. He's quite renowned. Is she Everett's sweetheart? He's done well for himself, attracting such an exceptional young woman."

Margaret listened quietly before responding, her voice measured. "We shouldn't assume anything about their relationship. We mustn't risk damaging the girl's reputation. She's likely beyond Everett's reach anyway. He's never mentioned courting anyone, and a girl like her must have many admirers."

Beatrice patted Margaret's hand. "I understand, but Everett's grown now. Don't you want him to marry? Without a wife, he'll spend his life alone."

Margaret remained silent.

Lillian, with childlike sincerity, added, "Everett won't be alone. He'll always have me."

###Chapter 382

Rosalind chuckled and tapped Lillian lightly on the forehead.

"Your brother adores you. He pulled strings to get you into that elite prep school. Trust me, he won't let you become some lonely cat lady living in his basement forever."

Lillian burst into giggles, her face lighting up with amusement.

The door swung open suddenly. Everett walked in.

Lillian's eyes brightened instantly. "Everett!"

Rosalind stood abruptly. "Did the lab results come back?!"

Everett's pale eyes were rimmed red. She nodded silently. "I have them."

Lillian's smile faded. "Is Mom okay? Is she really sick?"

Everett glanced at Margaret lying motionless on the bed but remained silent.

Rosalind sensed the tension and quickly intervened. "Lillian, come with me outside for a sec. We need to talk."

Without hesitation, Lillian agreed. "Okay."

Rosalind guided the younger girl out of the room.

Silence descended. Only Everett and Margaret remained. Everett sank into the chair beside the bed, studying Margaret's face.

Margaret's faded dress had been washed too many times, but it was neatly pressed. Her silver-streaked hair was pinned back carefully. Her expression held a quiet dignity.

Everett thought of her own mother - same age, currently vacationing in Santorina. Her mother owned more designer dresses than she could count, always saying beauty was every woman's birthright.

Margaret probably once cared about such things too. Life had other plans.

"You saw the results?" Margaret's voice was barely above a whisper.

Everett nodded. "Stage four cancer, Mrs. Sinclair."

Margaret smiled faintly. "I know. Four years ago, I collapsed at home. The hospital tests showed abnormalities then."

"Why refuse treatment? Early intervention could've changed everything."

"Perhaps," Margaret sighed. "The doctors said $200,000 might buy me a few more years. But back then, Lillian was just a child. Everett wasn't even eighteen."

"Everett suffered so much. Before his father died, that man left $400,000 in debts. I couldn't help - blind as I was. Everett started skipping school to work odd jobs. Just a boy, but he shaved his head, got tattoos, built this tough-guy persona. Had to make people think twice before messing with us."

Margaret reached out. Everett instinctively took her hand. The skin felt like sandpaper, calluses thick enough to prick.

Margaret chuckled. "Is Everett always so cold with you?"

Everett nodded. "With everyone. Never smiles."

"He wasn't always like that," Margaret's voice softened. "Used to laugh constantly. Had the most beautiful smile. After his father died... people talked. We were the drug dealer's family. Everett stopped smiling to protect us."

Everett's chest ached. She'd grown up privileged, her biggest problem being Julian's betrayal.

But meeting Everett's family showed her a world she'd never imagined.

"Even without debts, even with a million dollars... I wouldn't have gambled it on uncertain treatment. These past four years, I've prayed daily - just let me live long enough to see Everett stand on his own feet. To spend a little more time with him."
###Chapter 383

"It feels like heaven answered my prayers," Margaret whispered, her voice trembling with emotion. "Four years vanished in an instant, and Everett is all grown up now. I can sense my time slipping away. What did the doctor say about how long I have left?"

Rosalind's almond-shaped eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "He estimated about two months."

Margaret exhaled softly, her fingers tightening around the bedsheet. "Two months... That's hardly any time at all."

Rosalind immediately clasped Margaret's frail hand. "Don't lose hope, Mrs. Sinclair. I've arranged for Dr. Theodore to oversee your treatment personally. We'll do everything possible to extend your time."

Margaret turned her sightless eyes toward Rosalind's voice. "Rosalind, if not for you, I wouldn't even be here now. Our family owes you more than we can ever repay. We may not have much, but we've always lived without debts. I'll leave the hospital today—you shouldn't burden yourself with me any longer."

"Mrs. Sinclair—" Rosalind started, but she knew arguing was pointless. The Sinclair pride ran deep in both Everett and his mother.

She didn't press further, but her resolve hardened. The imported medication would ease Margaret's pain and buy precious extra time.

"Please... don't tell Everett or Lillian about my condition."

"Why? I think they—"

"If Everett finds out, he'll sell everything he owns to pay for treatments. But I know my body—no treatment will work now. There's no sense wasting money we don't have. He's carried enough burdens between me and his father's legacy. That boy has never known an easy day in his life."

Seeing Margaret's determination, Rosalind nodded. "Alright. Your secret is safe with me."

"Thank you."

Rosalind wiped at her damp lashes. "Don't thank me. Everett saved me first. Without him, I wouldn't be here either."

A faint smile touched Margaret's lips.

"Speaking of... where is Everett?" Rosalind asked.

"He went to shower. Should be out soon."

Everett had rushed straight from the construction site, covered in dust and grime. Even waiting in the hospital earlier, his rugged appearance had drawn stares.

He always cleaned up before seeing his family, never wanting them to see him looking so worn.

This private hospital suite had its own bathroom, so Everett had disappeared inside to wash up.

Rosalind remembered the heavy cement bags straining his shoulders earlier. He must be aching. She quickly retrieved a potent muscle-relief ointment from Theodore.

Clutching the small jar, she approached the bathroom door and raised her hand to knock—

But before her knuckles could connect, the door swung open on its own.

Was he not inside?

She pushed the door slightly ajar. "Everett, are you—"

Then she froze.

Everett stood before her, freshly showered, wearing only low-slung black sweatpants, his torso completely bare.

The last time in the dressing room, she'd glimpsed his sculpted physique—broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist, muscles defined from years of labor. But now, seeing him like this, water still glistening on his skin, hit her like a physical blow.

Rosalind gasped, slapping both hands over her eyes. "Wh-why aren't you dressed?"

Everett hadn't expected her to barge in. He calmly grabbed a white tank top and pulled it on. "You didn't knock."

She'd meant to, but the door opened first.

Peeking through her fingers, Rosalind's wide eyes caught sight of the tattoo on his arm—a fierce eagle in flight.
###Chapter 384
Rosalind felt warmth trickling from her nose. Her fingers came away crimson when she touched it.

"Not again!"

Everett instantly grabbed a tissue and pressed it against her nose. "Lean back."

She tilted her head obediently, glaring at him. "Why do I only get nosebleeds around you?"

Everett's gaze flickered. "You're fine now."

Rosalind frowned. "You didn't answer me."

What could he say?

Without responding, Everett turned to leave.

He was shutting her out again.

Rosalind blocked his path, thrusting a small tube toward him. "Here."

Everett eyed it warily. "What's this?"

She pointed to his reddened shoulder. "You carried cement bags all day. This ointment will help. Apply it morning and night."

Everett studied her for a silent moment.

Rosalind pushed it closer. "Take it."

His fingers closed around the tube—and her wrist. Suddenly she was pulled against his chest.

Rosalind's breath hitched. His face was inches away, damp hair clinging to his forehead. The usual icy detachment had melted, revealing something unexpectedly vulnerable.

Her pulse raced. "What are you—"

Everett's gaze dropped to her lips. His voice was rough. "What do you want?"

Rosalind blinked. "What?"

Then his mouth crashed onto hers.

The world spun. Her first kiss—stolen without warning.

He pulled back just as abruptly, a challenge in his eyes. "Was that it?"

Rosalind stood frozen.

His thumb brushed her cheek. "Thanks for today. I don't like debts. Did that cover it?"

Realization dawned. He'd kissed her to settle a score.

Anger flared. Was that all she meant to him? A transaction to be balanced?

She smirked. "That's all you've got?"

Everett stilled.

Rosalind stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Do you even know how to kiss properly?"

His ears turned scarlet.

She bit back a laugh. The unshakable Everett Sinclair—blushing because of her.

Emboldened, she looped her arms around his neck. His muscles tensed, but he didn't push her away.

If he could kiss her, she could kiss him back.

Rising on her toes, she captured his lips with hers.
###Chapter 385

Everett's lips were unexpectedly cool against hers, sending an unfamiliar thrill through Rosalind's body.

Though she'd never kissed anyone before, Rosalind had imagined this moment countless times. Nothing could have prepared her for the electric sensation coursing through her veins.

Everett remained frozen, his piercing gaze locked with hers. Neither of them closed their eyes, creating an intense, almost challenging connection.

Rosalind's wide, expressive eyes shimmered with a mix of innocence and daring curiosity. At this age, the natural desire to explore intimacy with someone special burned brightly within her - both sweetly naive and boldly adventurous.

Her plush, cherry-red lips moved experimentally against his, then suddenly she nipped at his lower lip.

A jolt of heat rocketed through Everett's body, starting from the base of his spine and spreading like wildfire. His vision blurred momentarily, pupils dilating with primal hunger.

Pressed flush against him with her arms looped around his neck, Rosalind soon became aware of something unfamiliar pressing against her thigh.

She broke the kiss, tilting her head in confusion. "What's that?" Her hand drifted downward instinctively.

Everett caught her wrist in an iron grip before she could investigate further. "Enough," he growled.

Rosalind studied his stony expression - still as unreadable as ever - but found herself undeterred. She twisted free and tugged him closer. "I'm not finished."

"What more could you possibly want?" His voice was rough.

Pulling out her phone, she thrust it toward him. "Add me on Instagram. Right now."

Everett's eyebrow arched. "Why?"

"Do this, and we're even. No debts between us." Her tone brooked no argument.

With a barely perceptible sigh, Everett retrieved his phone and sent the friend request.

When Rosalind's profile loaded, her display picture showed her laughing face bathed in golden sunset light. Loose chestnut curls framed her delicate features, capturing a moment of pure, youthful joy.

Everett's gaze lingered a second too long before he abruptly looked away. "Done."

He turned on his heel, long strides carrying him toward the door.

Wait - he was leaving? Just like that?

Rosalind stared at his profile - a stark black square with only the name "Everett Sinclair" displayed. His feed was completely empty, revealing nothing about him.

Despite the lack of information, a giddy warmth spread through her chest at their new digital connection.

Everett stood by the open window, letting the crisp night air cool his overheated skin. This unfamiliar, overwhelming sensation - he'd never experienced anything like it before.

Everett couldn't stand being near Rosalind. Her presence wrapped around him like honey, thick and suffocating.

After composing himself, he strode back into the hospital room. Margaret was already dressed, folding her belongings into a small suitcase.

He rushed forward. "You shouldn't be up yet."

"I'm perfectly fine now," Margaret said, zipping the bag shut. "Let's go home."

"But the test results—"

"Everett," she interrupted, placing a hand on his arm. "Dr. Theodore already brought them. Just low blood sugar, that's all."

His brow furrowed. "Are you certain?"

Margaret thrust the papers at him. "See for yourself. Since when do I lie to you?" Everett scanned the documents, tension easing from his shoulders as he confirmed the normal readings.

"Alright," he conceded. "I'll stay home with you this week. But you need to be careful about your sugar levels." His fingers tightened around the papers. "No more skipping meals."
###Chapter 386

Rosalind nodded. "Alright. Where's Everett?"

Dominic pulled out a duffel bag and began stuffing his belongings inside. His movements were mechanical, voice devoid of emotion. "She left. We're just classmates, nothing beyond that."

"I've seen how girls throw themselves at you. Remember that one who slipped a love letter and handmade truffles into your gym bag? Lillian caught her red-handed. What was her name... Adriana?"

Dominic's head snapped up, irritation flashing in his eyes. "Don't compare them to Rosalind. She's nothing like those girls."

A knowing smile played on Rosalind's lips. "So in your world, Rosalind exists in some special category all her own?"

Silence. Dominic's face became unreadable as he resumed packing with deliberate movements.

"Dominic, you're not a boy anymore. If you care about someone, don't let them walk away. Rosalind is special."

Zipping his bag shut, Dominic slung it over one shoulder while carefully supporting Margaret as they exited the hospital room.

The sterile hallway echoed with their footsteps as Dominic murmured, "I don't do relationships. I've got nothing to offer her."

Margaret said nothing. She knew the Fairchild family's standing in society - precisely why she'd kept her distance from Rosalind when Beatrice was present. Protecting the girl's reputation mattered more than her own comfort.

Because she genuinely cared about Rosalind.

"Right now, clearing Dad's name is all that matters. One day, everyone will know he died an undercover officer - not some common criminal."

Tears glistened in Margaret's eyes as she squeezed Dominic's arm. "This weight wasn't meant for your shoulders."

The path ahead would be brutal.

"Your father... if he were here, he'd want you to have a normal life. Fall in love. Raise a family. Find peace."

Hospital staff brushed past them as Dominic guided his mother through the crowded corridor.

"I know exactly the life I want. And it's not that one. I don't do feelings. Never have. Never will."

Meanwhile, Harrison had been pacing near the entrance, relief washing over her when she spotted Rosalind. "There you are! I was beginning to think Everett Sinclair had kidnapped you permanently."

Rosalind's cheeks flushed crimson. "Stop it! We need to get to the Whitmore residence." During the cab ride, Rosalind recounted everything to Harrison.

"Margaret's cancer has metastasized to her heart and brain. Two months, tops. Everett doesn't know. After his father died, his mother became his entire world. I can't imagine how he'll survive losing her too."

Harrison exhaled heavily. Once cancer spread this far, medical options vanished.

Though she could ensure Margaret's remaining time was pain-free.

Harrison studied Rosalind's face. "Loss is the price of love, isn't it?"

Rosalind nodded. "At least I have Everett's number now. If anything happens... I can reach him."

Harrison's eyebrows shot up. "Rosalind Fairchild, you dark horse. You actually got Everett Sinclair's digits?"

Leaning close, Rosalind whispered something that made Harrison's eyes widen. "Wait - you and Everett actually...?"
###Chapter 387

"What?"
Harrison gasped, her eyes widening in shock. "You did it? What exactly happened?"

Rosalind held up two fingers, tapping them together lightly. "We kissed."

A relieved sigh escaped Harrison's lips - she'd feared Rosalind and Everett might have already crossed more intimate boundaries.

She studied Rosalind with curious intensity. "Do you genuinely have feelings for Everett?"

An image of Everett's striking yet aloof features flashed through Rosalind's mind. Her pulse quickened, emotions swirling beyond her control. So this was the undeniable pull of falling in love.

With a shy nod, she whispered, "Yes."

Harrison seemed poised to say something more, then hesitated. Matters of the heart belonged solely to those involved; outsiders had no place interfering.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at the Whitmore residence. Harrison and Rosalind stepped inside.

Harrison remained unaware of Rosalind's true identity, though Rosalind intended to explain soon. She'd strictly instructed everyone today - no one was to reveal her secret.

"Ms... Ms. Fairchild, you've arrived!" Beatrice greeted them warmly.

Both women smiled politely. Just then, Alistair descended the staircase. "Hello, Harrison."

Harrison's sharp gaze met Alistair's as she nodded. "I understand you wished to speak with me?"

Alistair offered a polite smile. "Shall we converse in the study?"

"Certainly," Harrison agreed.

A deep, resonant voice interrupted. "Wait."

Harrison turned to see Nathaniel standing near the entrance.

Nathaniel had come personally.

Rosalind blinked in surprise. "Mr. Falcon, what brings you here? Seeking Harrison?"

Nathaniel's intense gaze fixed on Harrison. He'd texted earlier, but receiving no response, chose to appear in person.

"Harrison, we need to talk."

Alistair arched an eyebrow at Nathaniel. "You'll have to wait your turn. I extended the invitation first. Harrison, shall we?"

Harrison followed Alistair upstairs without hesitation.

Left waiting in the parlor, Nathaniel stood rigidly when Rosalind approached. "What's so urgent you needed to ambush her?"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line. "Are you aware she's been seeing Oliver?"

Rosalind smirked. "Is dating suddenly a crime? You're engaged to Isabella. Expecting Harrison to remain celibate for eternity?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

+25 BORS

Upstairs, in the study.

Harrison entered first while Alistair took a phone call.

It was her first time in Alistair's private sanctuary. She glanced around before settling into his chair, casually picking up one of his academic journals.

When Alistair returned, he froze mid-step. Harrison sat reviewing his notes with casual expertise.

Meeting his stunned gaze, she asked simply, "So, Alistair, what did you wish to discuss?"

Hearing his given name from her lips, Alistair nearly collapsed, knees buckling.

The truth crystallized before him.

His eyes widened in stunned realization as he stammered, "Y-You're Dr. Sinclair?"

Harrison's lips curved into a confident smile, her voice clear as crystal. "Indeed."

Without warning, Alistair dropped to his knees.

"Mr. Whitmore!" The butler rushed forward in alarm. "Sir, are you unwell?"

Alistair waved him off weakly. "I-I'm perfectly fine."
###Chapter 388

Before Nathaniel could finish his sentence, Alistair's knees gave way again, sending him sliding toward the floor.

"Mr. Whitmore!" The butler rushed forward to steady him.

Harrison rose gracefully and approached, resting a gentle hand on his arm. "Relax. There's no need for such formality."

Alistair stared at Harrison with wide eyes. He could scarcely believe the legendary Dr. Sinclair - renowned for her expertise in naturopathic medicine - stood before him as this young woman, who happened to be his nephew's wife. The revelation left him reeling.

"You're... my mentor?" Alistair's voice trembled.

Harrison nodded, amusement dancing in her eyes. "Indeed. Was I unclear? Should I have used your childhood nickname 'Ally' instead?"

Speechless, Alistair struggled to process this earth-shattering revelation.

Now he knew without doubt - Harrison was Dr. Sinclair.

"D-Dr. Sinclair, I never imagined..." His words stumbled over each other, uncertain how to address her now.

A soft smile curved Harrison's lips. "No formalities between us. We're academic peers. Just call me Harrison."

Awe washed over Alistair. "Did you truly remove Rosalind's birthmark?"

Harrison confirmed with a nod.

Everything clicked into place. The vanished birthmark. The immediate correction during his lecture. These weren't feats any ordinary person could accomplish.

Harrison was indeed Dr. Sinclair!

Excitement thrummed through Alistair's veins - gratitude, admiration, and profound respect mingling together.

"I researched Rosalind's condition extensively but never found a solution."

Harrison returned to the desk, pen gliding across paper as she wrote.

"Here's the formula I used."

Alistair seized the paper eagerly, his eyes devouring the contents. "Genius! Absolute genius. No wonder you're my mentor."

Harrison's smile remained gentle. "Anything else you need?"

Alistair shook his head vigorously. "No, nothing at all. Please stay for dinner."

"Another time. I have plans this evening."

They descended to the living room where Nathaniel and Rosalind waited.

Rosalind immediately linked arms with Harrison. "How did it go?"

"Well enough. We should head back."

"Of course."

Nathaniel suddenly blocked their path. "Not so fast. We need to talk."

Before Harrison could respond, Alistair sharply rebuked him. "Nathaniel! Show some respect. You don't command Harrison like some servant!"

Nathaniel gaped at his uncle as if seeing a ghost. "Uncle Alistair, have you lost your mind?"

Ignoring his nephew, Alistair beamed at Harrison. "Please excuse Nathaniel's behavior. Safe travels home. I'll have my driver take you."

Nathaniel stood frozen in shock, hands on hips, laughing incredulously.

What fresh madness was this?

Harrison cast one last glance at the flustered Nathaniel before departing with Rosalind.

Rosalind couldn't resist sticking her tongue out at Nathaniel as they left - a silent "serves you right" hanging in the air.
###Chapter 389

Harrison and Rosalind climbed into the car and drove away, leaving Nathaniel and Alistair standing outside. Nathaniel studied Alistair with narrowed eyes. "Uncle Alistair, what's gotten into you?"

Only when Harrison's car had vanished down the street did Alistair finally look away. He turned to Nathaniel with a dismissive wave. "Nothing's wrong. I feel fantastic."

Nathaniel crossed his arms. "You might want to check the way you were fawning over Harrison just now."

He had never seen Alistair act like that before.

Alistair scoffed. "Fawning? I was merely showing proper respect. You wouldn’t understand."

Respect?

Nathaniel frowned. Why would Alistair show Harrison respect?

Something wasn’t adding up.

"I wanted to talk to Harrison, and you cut me off. I was going to ask if she’s been seeing Oliver."

At the mention of Oliver, Alistair nodded. "I believe she is."

Nathaniel’s curiosity sharpened. "Why do you say that?"

Alistair gave him a slow, assessing look before replying, "Because you’re not worthy of her. She deserves better."

With that, he turned and strode inside.

Nathaniel stood frozen, stunned.

What the hell was going on?

Since when did Alistair think he wasn’t good enough for Harrison?

Harrison stayed at Rosewood Manor that night. The next morning, her phone buzzed insistently, dragging her from sleep. Oliver’s name flashed on the screen.

She answered groggily. "Oliver?"

"Harrison, big news. The fake Dr. Sinclair fled."

She stretched lazily, unsurprised. She’d known the imposter would bolt eventually.

"He cleaned out the Whitmore family and vanished. This morning, the court and bank seized their estate, along with the second and third branches’ businesses. The Whitmores are finished—wiped out."

Harrison smirked. No sympathy stirred in her. She’d warned them, only to be laughed at.

"They destroyed themselves with greed and stupidity. Everyone pays for their choices."

Oliver chuckled. "Let’s enjoy the show. I can’t wait to see how they handle this."

At the Whitmore estate, chaos reigned. Margaret, along with the second and third branches—Theodore, Victoria, Isabella, Frederick, Cassandra, and Penelope—crowded the living room.

Court and bank officials plastered notices on the walls. Margaret, face flushed with fury, stormed toward them. "What do you think you're doing? This is my home! Get out now, or I’ll sue for trespassing!"

The court official barely glanced at her. "Go ahead. File your lawsuit."

Margaret gaped.

The bank official held out documents. "You signed everything over, including this estate. We’re legally repossessing it. Leave now, or we’ll remove you by force."

Margaret grabbed Penelope’s arm. "Penelope, explain this! Where’s Dr. Sinclair? Where’s our money?"

Penelope’s face was ghostly pale, her usual arrogance gone.

"Grandmother… I—I was scammed. That man wasn’t Dr. Sinclair. His real name is Abe McKinney. He took everything and disappeared."

What?

Isabella and Victoria looked like they’d been struck by lightning. They seized Penelope.

"You were scammed? Do you realize how much we invested? Our companies are mortgaged! You’ve ruined us! We’ve lost everything!"
###Chapter 390

Theodore was losing his mind. "Penelope, we need a solution now!"

Frederick and Cassandra were on the brink of tears. "They took our savings too! Do you think we're not panicking? We've all been duped!"

Margaret was hysterical, slapping her knees repeatedly. "We're finished! This is the end! How will we survive now?"

The court officials intervened firmly. "You must vacate the premises immediately and cease disrupting official proceedings."

Margaret resisted fiercely, her voice shrill with defiance. "I refuse to leave! This is my ancestral home! I've lived here my entire life! This is Whitmore property, and I challenge anyone to touch it!"

Within moments, Margaret was physically removed by two court officers, along with the other family members.

Isabella screamed in outrage. "Get your hands off me! I'll walk out myself. Release me!"

She jerked away violently, but as the officers loosened their hold, she stumbled and fell backward, landing hard on the marble floor.

The room fell silent.

Margaret sat wailing on the ground, tearing at her hair. "What will become of us? What sin did we commit to deserve this? Why is fate punishing us?"

The other relatives stood frozen. Just yesterday, they'd been toasting their supposed good fortune. Now they'd been reduced to paupers.

Their entire wealth had vanished - no money, no home. How had everything collapsed so completely?

"Penelope, what's our next move? That imposter Dr. Sinclair deceived us, but surely we can recover our funds. You must have a plan!" Isabella pressed urgently.

Penelope was too distraught to think clearly. "All his credentials were fabricated. He's disappeared without a trace! Where would we even begin searching?"

Victoria locked eyes with Isabella, her expression grave. "Isabella, we're out of alternatives. Contact Nathaniel. Perhaps he can salvage this situation."

Margaret scrambled to her feet, clutching at Isabella's arm desperately. "Yes! Call Nathaniel immediately! He'll know what to do."

Isabella couldn't bear losing her privileged lifestyle. With trembling hands, she dialed Nathaniel's number.

The line connected after two rings. Isabella gripped the phone tightly. "Nathaniel, disaster has struck!"

His calm baritone responded. "Explain."

"Remember Dr. Sinclair? He's a complete fraud! A con artist!"

Silence stretched on the other end.

"We invested everything. The court and bank seized our companies today. They've confiscated the family estate too. We've lost it all! Please, you must help us track down that imposter and recover our money!"

After a weighted pause, Nathaniel responded coolly, "I warned you repeatedly about that man's dubious nature. Your blind optimism brought this upon yourselves. It's too late for intervention now."

"I could never reach Dr. Sinclair reliably. Don't waste time appealing to me. Every moment you delay reduces your chances of recovery. You're petitioning the wrong person."

"The wrong person? Then who should we be seeking?" Isabella demanded.
###Chapter 391

Nathaniel's voice remained steady yet unyielding.

"Obviously, you need someone who knows Dr. Sinclair. Isn't Professor Alistair Penelope's mentor? You could ask her to contact him, or—"

Isabella cut in, her words shaking with desperation. "Or what?"

"Oliver mentioned he was acquainted with Dr. Sinclair. He even said she was a woman. You could ask him to help you uncover the truth," Nathaniel replied before ending the call.

Penelope, now with a clearer path forward, spoke up.

"Let's go find Professor Alistair," she said without hesitation.

Earlier, they had been completely lost, their thoughts tangled in panic. Now that Nathaniel had pointed them toward a solution, they had two options—seek help from Alistair or Oliver.

"Fine." Isabella nodded in agreement.

The Whitmore family arrived at the Whitmore residence. Beatrice, who recognized Isabella, didn't bother hiding her disdain.

"Sorry, Mr. Whitmore isn't home. I can't let you in," she stated firmly.

Isabella's face paled. Normally, she would have stormed off, but desperation forced her to swallow her pride. "This is urgent. Could you at least inform him we're here?"

Beatrice scoffed. "Everyone claims their business is urgent. Should I just let anyone in who says so? Who do you think you are?"

She still hadn't forgotten how Isabella and Arabella had humiliated Rosalind. There was no way she'd show them any courtesy now.

Penelope stepped forward, urgency lacing her voice. "I'm Professor Alistair's top student. I need to speak with him immediately."

Beatrice shot her a dismissive glance. "Birds of a feather."

Penelope froze, stunned into silence.

The Whitmores stood there, frantic and pacing like trapped animals, completely at a loss.

Just then, a sleek luxury car pulled up. Alistair had returned.

Margaret's eyes brightened. "Look! Professor Whitmore is back!"

Penelope rushed forward. "Professor Whitmore!"

Alistair raised a brow at the sight of them. "Penelope? What brings you here? And why is everyone with you?"

Penelope, breathless, blurted out, "Professor, we need your help! Our family is in serious trouble!"

Alistair tilted his head. "What happened?"

Penelope hurriedly explained, "We were scammed by a fake Dr. Sinclair! He tricked me into falling for him, took our money, and vanished. We invested everything with him, and now he's disappeared with all our funds."

Alistair burst into laughter, unable to contain himself.

Margaret and the others gaped at him, shocked.

Still chuckling, Alistair said, "Apologies, but that's just too rich. So, Penelope, you got duped by Dr. Sinclair? I'm surprised you even thought you could land someone like her. And why do you keep calling Dr. Sinclair a man? She's a woman!"

Dr. Sinclair was a woman?

When Oliver had first mentioned it, they hadn't believed him. Now, hearing Alistair confirm it, reality crashed down on them.

Margaret's face drained of color, and she stomped her foot in frustration.

"What a complete waste! I had dreams of Dr. Sinclair becoming my grandson-in-law. I even imagined Penelope and Isabella having a double wedding, marrying Mr. Falcon and Dr. Sinclair in a grand ceremony! I thought our family was finally rising to the top!"

One shattered illusion after another.

Alistair gave Margaret an amused look. "Your family is luckier than you realize."

Victoria blinked, confused. "What do you mean?"

Alistair didn't elaborate, only adding with dark amusement, "Though you all did an excellent job of throwing away your best assets."

Margaret was utterly bewildered. What was he talking about?

Frederick and Theodore were desperate.

"Professor Whitmore, our estate and company have been seized by the bank! We'll be homeless by tonight! Please, help us. We'll be forever in your debt."
###Chapter 392

Penelope clutched her trembling hands together, desperation lacing her voice. "Professor Whitmore, we're begging you. Think of something! We've exhausted every possibility."

Alistair Whitmore shook his head slowly. "You're asking the wrong person. There's only one who can help you now."

"Who?" Penelope leaned forward, hope flickering in her eyes.

"Harrison." The name dropped like a stone.

Gasps rippled through the Whitmore family. "Harrison? What could she possibly do?" Margaret's wrinkled face twisted in disbelief. "Is she supposed to catch that imposter Dr. Sinclair? Save our family from ruin?"

Isabella and Penelope exchanged skeptical glances. The idea of Harrison solving their crisis seemed laughable.

"Exactly," Alistair confirmed.

The family erupted in protests. "That's absurd!"

Alistair gave them an inscrutable look. "I've shown you the path. Whether you take it is your choice." Without another word, he turned and disappeared inside.

Margaret remained frozen, mouth agape. "Why would Professor Whitmore suggest Harrison?"

Victoria scoffed. "She's just a homemaker! What could she possibly do?"

"We don't believe it either," Frederick muttered.

"This makes no sense," Cassandra interjected. "Our only real option is to go to Oliver for help." With Alistair refusing assistance, the Whitmores saw no alternative but to approach Oliver.

The family gathered outside Oliver's estate, only to be blocked by the butler. "I'm sorry. No visitors today."

Rejection after rejection - the Whitmores couldn't catch a break.

Isabella stepped forward carefully. "Please, it's urgent. We need to speak with Mr. Oliver."

"Wait here. I'll inform him." The butler shut the door with finality.

The family fidgeted on the doorstep. Minutes stretched with no response. Thirty minutes passed. An hour. The butler never returned.

Dusk settled over Willowbrook. The Whitmores hadn't eaten all day. Isabella shivered as the temperature dropped, wrapping her arms around herself.

"It's freezing," she whispered.

Then the first raindrops fell, heralding an approaching storm.

Margaret slapped her knee in frustration. "Now rain? The universe is mocking us!"

Penelope huddled closer to her mother for warmth. They pressed against the mansion's exterior, seeking shelter under the narrow eaves.

Margaret rounded on Penelope. "This is all your fault! You trusted that fraud Dr. Sinclair! Not only did you lose your inheritance - you dragged us all down with you!"

Penelope opened her mouth but found no defense.

Frederick and Cassandra immediately jumped to her protection. "It's not just Penelope's fault. Isabella shares the blame too."

The accusation turned toward the second branch.

Margaret's sharp eyes pinned Isabella. "You spineless girl! Nathaniel and Harrison divorced ages ago, yet you still haven't secured your place as Mrs. Falcon. Now Nathaniel won't lift a finger to help us. Proves you mean nothing to him!"

Isabella's face drained of color, injustice burning in her eyes.

Theodore and Victoria pointed angrily at Penelope's parents. "How dare you? This isn't Isabella's fault!"

The second and third branches erupted into heated arguments, voices rising. A physical altercation seemed imminent.

Margaret had had enough. "Enough! Your bickering solves nothing. Where are the Whitmore family's prized daughters now? Utterly worthless!"
###Chapter 393

The two "golden girls", Isabella and Penelope, stood frozen in stunned silence.

Not a single word escaped their lips.

Just then, the grand doors of Rosewood Manor swung open. Oliver's striking figure appeared in the doorway, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders.

Margaret's face flooded with relief. "Mr. Oliver! Thank heavens you're here!"

Oliver lingered at the threshold, his brow slightly furrowed. "Mrs. Margaret, what brings you here?"

Isabella noticed the faint amusement in his eyes. She was certain he'd been watching them shiver in the drizzle for the past thirty minutes. Probably sipping tea while they suffered.

Margaret wrung her hands. "That impostor Dr. Sinclair swindled us out of everything. We've nowhere left to turn but to you."

"Last time we met, you claimed to know Dr. Sinclair personally. Was that true?" Penelope interjected.

A smirk played on Oliver's lips. "I warned you. Dr. Sinclair is a woman. And yes, we're... intimately acquainted."

Isabella's pulse quickened. "Then help us! Please, track down that fraud and get our money back!"

Oliver studied the Whitmore women's desperate faces with detached amusement. He'd watched their entire pathetic display from his study. Now, seeing their pleading eyes, he chuckled. "Begging won't work. You'll need to ask someone else."

"Who?" Penelope demanded.

Oliver's smile widened. "Harrison."

What? Not Harrison again!

Alistair had already told them to seek out Harrison. Now Oliver was giving the same ridiculous suggestion. What kind of cruel joke was this?

"Mr. Oliver, this isn't funny! Harrison can't possibly help us!"

Oliver shrugged. "My advice stands. Take it or leave it."

With that, he turned on his heel and disappeared inside.

"Mr. Oliver—"

The door slammed shut before Isabella could finish.

Once again, they stood rejected on the doorstep.

Margaret looked utterly bewildered. "Why would both Professor Whitmore and Mr. Oliver tell us to go to Harrison?"

"Don't be ridiculous! They're mocking us. I'd never debase myself by begging Harrison for help!" Victoria snapped.

None of them wanted to face Harrison.

Margaret, Isabella, and Penelope had always treated Harrison like dirt beneath their designer shoes. Now they were expected to grovel? Unthinkable.

"If neither Professor Whitmore nor Mr. Oliver will help, what do we do?" Margaret's voice trembled.

Silence fell over the group.

"Night's falling. Are we seriously sleeping on the streets?" Margaret fretted.

Unseen by them, Oliver observed from his balcony. He snapped a photo with his phone and sent it to Harrison with a soft click.

Then he dialed.

Harrison answered on the first ring. "Yes?"

Oliver grinned. "See my text? The Whitmores are having a meltdown. Looks like they'll be bedding down with the pigeons tonight."

At Emerald Heights, Harrison paused in arranging white roses in a crystal vase. His fingers stilled as he viewed the image.


###Chapter 394

Harrison had already seen the photo Oliver sent. Today marked one of the darkest moments for the Whitmore family. They had clawed their way up, trampling over Benjamin's legacy with every step, only to come crashing down hard.

"I saw it," Harrison responded.

"I told them only you could help now, that they must come to you. Do you think they'll actually beg for your assistance?"

A confident smirk curled Harrison's lips. "They will."

She knew the Whitmores inside out. When their fortune hung in the balance, they'd choke down their pride and crawl to her. Humiliating? Absolutely. Necessary? Without question.

"How can you be so certain?"

Harrison carefully arranged a crimson rose in the crystal vase, fingertips grazing the velvety petals.

"I know them better than they know themselves. They'll come groveling."

Exactly sixty-three minutes later, the Whitmore clan stood gaping at the gates of The Regal Estates.

Margaret's jaw dropped. "Harrison actually lives here now?"

Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria had conveniently omitted mentioning Harrison's luxury car and mansion. Swallowing their pride to seek help from the woman they'd scorned? The ultimate humiliation. Yet here they stood.

Isabella nodded stiffly. "Apparently so."

Margaret clutched her chest dramatically. "While we're freezing out here, she's living like royalty! Why her? Why?!"

Victoria sneered, "Men, obviously. Didn't you see how Mr. Oliver dotes on her? This estate? His gift."

Penelope added bitterly, "No way she could afford this herself. Nothing to envy here."

Margaret's breathing steadied slightly. "Enough. Focus on how we approach this."

Isabella and Penelope still couldn't fathom why Alistair and Oliver both insisted only Harrison could solve their crisis.

At Harrison's doorstep, Isabella hesitated before pressing the bell.

Silence.

She jabbed the button again.

The door swung open to reveal Harrison, her piercing gaze sweeping over them like a queen surveying peasants. "To what do I owe this... pleasure?"

Margaret forced a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Harrison... We've hit some... difficulties. You're aware?"

"Difficulties? Whose difficulties? Last I checked, you severed all ties. Or did you forget disowning me?" Harrison's voice dripped with amusement.

Margaret's face darkened. "How dare—"

Isabella cut in hastily. "Don't be ridiculous! You're still family! Now that Penelope's been swindled by that fraud Dr. Sinclair, you should—"

Penelope chimed in, "Exactly! You can't be this heartless! Our downfall benefits you nothing! If you're enjoying this, you're no better than—"

Harrison's icy stare silenced them. "Finished?"

Before they could respond, she moved to slam the door. "Harrison!"

Isabella wedged her foot in the doorway. "What are you doing?"

Harrison's lips curved into a predatory smile. "Let me guess - you're here to beg. Yet you're lecturing me instead." Her gaze raked over each family member. "Need me to teach you how to ask for favors properly? Because this attitude?" She laughed coldly. "Won't get you anywhere."
###Chapter 395

Harrison stood in the doorway, reminding them sharply of why they'd come. They were here to beg.

Victoria, Isabella, and Penelope froze, their earlier arrogance evaporating. The proud stances they'd held moments ago collapsed like a house of cards.

Harrison's hand moved to shut the door again.

Margaret spoke first. "Wait! Please don't close it. We're here to ask for your help. Will you help us?" Her head bowed first.

Harrison arched an eyebrow, her gaze sweeping over the others.

Frederick and Cassandra from the third branch followed suit, their heads lowering in unison. "We were wrong before. For the sake of family, please help us," they murmured.

Theodore also bent at the waist. "Let's not make this worse between us. We're asking for your assistance."

Harrison's piercing stare landed on Victoria.

Victoria resisted. This wasn't how things were supposed to go. How had Harrison, the girl they'd discarded, become this untouchable genius? How did she end up with luxury cars and mansions while they'd been swindled onto the streets?

Margaret's warning glare forced Victoria's hand. Reluctantly, she bowed. "Harrison, I'm sorry. You're still a Whitmore. Please help us."

Harrison turned her attention to Isabella and Penelope.

Penelope lowered her head. "Harrison, please."

Isabella ground her teeth so hard her jaw ached. "Help us," she forced out.

Harrison's sharp eyes pinned Isabella in place. "Isabella, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat it louder?"

She was making her say it again.

Isabella nearly exploded. "You—!"

Margaret yanked Isabella's arm, cutting her off.

Isabella looked up to see Harrison standing there—poised, elegant, amusement dancing in her eyes as she watched Isabella struggle.

The humiliation burned. Isabella raised her voice. "Harrison. Please help us."

A faint smile curled Harrison's lips. The irony wasn't lost on her. The once-mighty Whitmores, who'd wanted nothing more than to crush her, now bowed before her one by one.

Then Harrison looked up and saw him—Nathaniel.

She hadn't noticed his return. He stood opposite her now, observing the scene with calm detachment.

Their eyes locked.

Isabella spotted Nathaniel and rushed forward. "Nathaniel!"

"Mr. Falcon."

He strode toward them with effortless grace, his tall frame commanding the space.

Isabella grabbed his arm, pressing close with a pout. "Nathaniel, now you see Harrison's true colors! She's making us grovel. We're family—how can she be so heartless and petty?"

Harrison almost laughed. Family? She felt no kinship with these people. Nathaniel's opinion meant nothing to her. She met his gaze squarely. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel studied Harrison's face. "Now that they've asked, will you deal with the fake Dr. Sinclair for them?"

"Yes, Harrison, we've asked. You'll help now, won't you?" Margaret pressed.

Harrison's smile widened. "I can help. But I have one condition."
###Chapter 396

"What condition?"

"I want my father's ashes."

Benjamin's remains had always been kept by the Whitmore family. Harrison had requested them before, but they refused to surrender them.

The mention of Benjamin made the expressions of everyone in the room darken.

"What's the problem? I'm his daughter. Don't I have the right to claim his ashes?" Harrison's voice was steady, but edged with steel. "You never treated him as family, so why cling to his ashes now? Here's the choice—keep them, or protect the Whitmore family's interests. Decide."

Margaret's shrewd, clouded eyes locked onto Harrison's face. She realized her granddaughter had truly transformed.

"Fine. You can have Benjamin's ashes," Margaret finally conceded.

Victoria immediately clutched Margaret's sleeve. "Mother!"

Harrison caught their subtle exchange and let out a cold laugh. "You're this upset over me taking my father's ashes? Is there something you're hiding?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Victoria snapped. "His ashes have always been in the family hall. I just don't want you disturbing his rest."

Harrison's smile was sharp, dripping with mockery. "You've disturbed his peace for years. You trapped him in the Whitmore estate—was it so he could watch his wife and brother betray him while his own daughter was abandoned?"

Victoria froze. "How dare you!"

Harrison's gaze swept over the Whitmores.

Benjamin had bought their mansion, paid for Theodore's education, and mentored Frederick in business.

What had they ever given him in return?

"All these years, you've lived in luxury, standing on my father's grave. Tell me—when you lie awake at night, don't you ever fear he'll return to face you?"

Her words struck like a hammer. The Whitmores paled, their faces turning ashen.

Unease flickered in their eyes. Some couldn't even meet her piercing stare.

Isabella and Penelope, younger and less burdened by guilt, didn't grasp the weight of the moment.

Isabella cut in impatiently. "Harrison, enough! We'll give you the ashes—but only after you deal with the fake Dr. Sinclair!"

Penelope nodded. "Exactly. Frankly, we don't believe you can solve this. Prove it first, then you get the ashes. Fair?"

They weren't fools—they wanted guarantees.

Harrison arched a brow. "Fine. Agreed."

"How long will this take? We can only give you three days. No more," Margaret demanded.

"Our money is at stake. Every day we wait, the losses grow. Three days is all you get."

Nathaniel studied Harrison intently. "Three days. Do you really think you can catch this imposter in that time?"

Harrison shook her head.

Isabella sneered. "You can't do it? Then this is just a trick?"

Harrison met her gaze, calm. "I shook my head because I won't need three days. I'll bring the fake Dr. Sinclair to you by tomorrow."

"What?"

Margaret's voice rose with excitement. "You can find him that fast? You're not lying?"
###Chapter 397
Harrison remained silent.

"Tomorrow, I'll bring the imposter Dr. Sinclair to the Whitmore estate. You bring my father's ashes, and we'll exchange them in person."

Without another word, Harrison turned and entered her apartment, slamming the door with such force that the walls trembled.

The others stood frozen in shock.

Victoria wore a skeptical frown. "We've filed reports, used every resource, and still found no trace of the fake Dr. Sinclair. It's like he vanished into thin air. Now Harrison claims she'll produce him tomorrow? I don't buy it."

Penelope turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, what do you think?"

Nathaniel's piercing gaze remained fixed on Harrison's closed door. His lips pressed into a thin line. "At this point, trusting Harrison is your only option."

Silence fell over the group.

"Fine. We'll wait until tomorrow and see if she delivers," Margaret declared, slamming her palm on the table.

Isabella, who had been clinging to Nathaniel's arm, pouted. "I guess we're homeless tonight..."

Nathaniel barely reacted. "Dominic will arrange accommodations. You'll stay in the presidential suite at The Grand Celeste."

Margaret's eyes lit up instantly. "Thank you, Mr. Falcon!"

Victoria seized the opportunity, adding with a smile, "Isabella, why don't you skip the hotel? Mr. Falcon is staying here. You should stay with him tonight."

Isabella's face flushed with hope as she looked at Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, can I—"

Nathaniel withdrew his arm coldly. "I have work tonight and won't finish until late. All of you should go to the hotel and rest."

With that, he entered his apartment and shut the door firmly behind him. Isabella stood frozen, her pride shattered by the rejection.

A soft chuckle broke the silence. Cassandra.

Cassandra quickly covered her mouth. "Apologies. I couldn't help myself."

With Penelope and the fake Dr. Sinclair's relationship exposed, the third branch clearly resented the second branch's success. They had no intention of letting Isabella marry Nathaniel.

Theodore and Victoria exchanged awkward glances, their daughter's humiliation plain for all to see.

Margaret stomped her foot in frustration. "Enough! You're all the same—laughing at each other's failures instead of uniting. Pathetic!"

Isabella and Penelope stood in stunned silence.

"I hoped you two would work together for a grand wedding, but clearly, I overestimated you. I'm leaving!" Margaret huffed before storming off.

The others trailed after her, heads bowed in defeat.

Inside his apartment, Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his imposing figure silhouetted against the city lights. Dominic waited behind him.

"Mr. Falcon, we've deployed teams to locate the imposter Dr. Sinclair. He's been preparing for this, so tracking him will take time."

Nathaniel removed his coat, revealing a crisp white shirt and tailored vest. He pushed his dark hair back, his sharp features illuminated by the dim light. The past few days had been grueling since his return from Wintervale, with endless documents demanding his attention.

Dominic hesitated. "We're already searching for the imposter. Why did you have Ms. Isabella and the others beg Ms. Harrison for help?"

Nathaniel loosened his collar and rolled up his sleeves, turning to face Dominic.

"I've been hunting for the real Dr. Sinclair, but he's a ghost—only fleeting glimpses. This chaos presents the perfect opportunity. Step back, let the storm rage, and perhaps the real doctor's identity will finally surface."
###Chapter 398

Nathaniel understood instantly. The pieces fell into place—Dominic had been biding his time all along, like a spider weaving its web while the prey wandered blindly into the trap.

It wasn’t the first time. Dominic had missed encountering the real Dr. Sinclair on multiple occasions.

No one had ever slipped through Dominic’s surveillance before. The real Dr. Sinclair was the first.

This time, Dominic was determined to expose the elusive physician once and for all. He hadn’t lifted a finger today, yet somehow, he knew every detail of what had transpired outside.

Dominic, still perplexed, spoke up. "The Whitmore family visited Mr. Oliver and Mr. Alexander today. Both claimed they needed Harrison’s help, insisting she was the only one who could resolve the situation. What do you make of that?"

Nathaniel’s striking features were half-shadowed in the dim light, his expression unreadable as he gazed out the window. His voice was cool. "What do you think it means?"

Dominic shook his head. "I can’t figure it out."

Nathaniel smirked, the curve of his lips sharp and knowing. "Either Harrison knows Dr. Sinclair… or Harrison is Dr. Sinclair."

What?

Dominic sucked in a sharp breath, stunned. "Ms. Harrison is Dr. Sinclair? That—that can’t be possible."

Nathaniel turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. Night had fallen, and the city below glittered like scattered diamonds. He let out a low, derisive chuckle.

"Exactly. I don’t believe it either. How could the woman who appeared out of nowhere during my coma and clung to me for three years be the legendary Dr. Sinclair? It’s absurd."

Dominic hesitated before offering, "Then perhaps Ms. Harrison simply knows Dr. Sinclair."

Nathaniel nodded slowly. "That’s more plausible. After all—"

"After all, what?"

Nathaniel’s voice turned icy. "After all, Oliver knows Dr. Sinclair. His connections are vast—it’s no surprise he’d be acquainted with someone like that. And since Harrison has ties to him, it’s only natural she’d know Dr. Sinclair as well."

Dominic exhaled. "That makes sense."

Nathaniel dismissed him with a wave. "Go. We’ll see if Harrison finds the imposter before we do."

"Understood, Mr. Falcon."

Dominic left the room.

Now, Nathaniel was alone in the penthouse. He knew Harrison was close—just across the hall.

He pulled out his phone and glanced at the screen. Empty. None of his messages to her had been answered.

For three years of marriage, she had flooded his inbox with texts he’d ignored.

Somewhere along the way, the tables had turned. Now, she was the one leaving him on read.

Even though she was mere steps away, Nathaniel felt the distance between them widening with every passing second.

The Next Day…

At the Whitmore estate, Margaret arrived with the second and third branches of the family in tow.

The gates were sealed with an official notice, barring entry. They had no choice but to wait outside, restless.

Margaret scanned the surroundings anxiously. "It’s almost time. Where is Harrison? Why hasn’t she arrived yet?"

Isabella scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "I highly doubt she’ll actually catch the fake Dr. Sinclair. She’s probably lying through her teeth."

The group stood in tense silence, each lost in their own doubts.

Just then, a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up to the curb. The rear door opened smoothly, revealing Nathaniel’s striking profile.

Nathaniel had come.

Today was the day Harrison had promised to meet the Whitmores—and he intended to witness it firsthand.

Dominic, in the driver’s seat, checked the time. "It’s nearly the agreed hour, but Ms. Harrison still isn’t here."

Nathaniel showed no impatience, his expression unreadable. The question lingered—would she show up at all?
###Chapter 399

Nathaniel doubted Harrison would actually appear.

The Whitmore family shared his skepticism.

All eyes were fixed on the entrance, waiting.

Then, a sleek Bentley pulled up with silent precision. The doors opened to reveal an elegant silhouette stepping out.

Harrison had arrived.

Dominic's face brightened. "Mr. Falcon, Ms. Harrison is here! She actually came!"

Nathaniel lifted his gaze, his piercing eyes locking onto Harrison.

Margaret rushed forward. "Harrison, you're cutting it close. Nearly late."

Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I'm perfectly on time. There's still sixty seconds remaining. Is your patience really that limited?"

Margaret faltered, momentarily speechless.

Isabella scoffed loudly. "Enough chatter! Where's this imposter Dr. Sinclair?"

She scanned the area, but Harrison stood alone. No companions in sight.

"Harrison, you came empty-handed?" Isabella sneered. "I knew it! You never had the resources to produce him. Just another one of your pathetic lies!"

She clutched Margaret's arm dramatically. "Grandmother, see? She failed! I told you - how could a mere homemaker like her possibly deliver?"

Harrison regarded Isabella with amused detachment. "Do you want me to produce the fake doctor or not? Your hypocrisy is showing. Might I suggest a psychiatric evaluation?"

Isabella's mouth snapped shut, her face flushing. Harrison had exposed her inner conflict perfectly.

The truth was undeniable - Isabella was torn between two desires.

She needed Harrison to succeed to preserve her privileged lifestyle.

Yet she couldn't stand the thought of Harrison outshining her.

Margaret shot Isabella a warning glare. "Silence! Catching this fraud benefits us all."

Isabella sulked, nursing her wounded pride.

Penelope stepped forward. "The agreed time has arrived. Where is he?"

Victoria added sharply, "Produce him now or admit your deception. We won't tolerate wasted time."

Harrison's crimson lips curved upward. She brought her hands together in a sharp clap.

The sound triggered movement. A dark SUV accelerated toward them. Two imposing figures in black emerged, dragging a hooded figure between them.

Margaret gasped. "Is that the imposter?"

Harrison nodded. "Watch closely."

With deliberate motion, she removed the sack, revealing the man's face.

There stood the fraudulent Dr. Sinclair.

The crowd froze in shock. Against all odds, Harrison had delivered - precisely on schedule.

Isabella and Victoria gaped in disbelief. "It's really him!"

Penelope's composure shattered. This man had stolen her innocence and her fortune. The betrayal burned fresh.

She launched herself at him, fists flying. "You lying snake! Give me back everything you stole!"

The imposter's battered face told of prior punishment. He ignored Penelope's assault, trembling as he stared at Harrison.

"You...you're inhuman! A monster!"

Isabella frowned. "What nonsense is this? Why fear Harrison? She's just a worthless housewife. What could she possibly do to frighten you?"
###Chapter 400

Victoria stepped forward urgently. "Harrison, how did you locate Dr. Sinclair's fan?"

A knowing smile played on Harrison's lips, her eyes glinting with secrets. "That's my concern. Right now, I'm here for my father's remains."

Margaret moved swiftly to block Harrison's path. "You can't—"

Harrison's voice turned icy as she met Margaret's gaze. "Going back on our deal? Do that, and your precious fake Dr. Sinclair disappears. Every cent you paid will be lost."

Margaret hesitated, guilt flashing across her features. "I gave you my word. It's just... today isn't appropriate. We'll arrange another time."

"I'm taking my father home today." Harrison's tone brooked no argument. "Every day is suitable for this."

With that, Harrison pushed past Margaret and marched toward the Whitmore estate.

The official seal still barred the entrance. Harrison reached out, tore it away decisively, and shoved the heavy door open.

The hinges groaned in protest as she stepped inside.

She moved directly to the grand hall where ancestral portraits lined the walls. In a shadowed corner, she spotted Benjamin's photograph immediately.

Dust-covered and partially obscured by a stained cloth, the neglected frame made her chest tighten.

Harrison couldn't fathom such disrespect toward her father.

Gently lifting the portrait, she wiped away years of neglect with her sleeve. Her pale eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "I'm bringing you home, Dad."

The urn sat behind the frame. Harrison cradled it against her chest, carefully gathering the photograph before turning to leave.

Margaret called after her, "Where exactly do you plan to take him?"

"Anywhere that isn't here." Harrison didn't look back. "To him, home was never this place."

Her footsteps echoed with finality as she departed.

The moment Harrison left, Victoria rushed to Margaret's side, anxiety written across her face. "She has Benjamin's ashes now. What if she discovers how he really died?"

Theodore and Frederick closed in, their worry palpable. This was the Whitmore family's most guarded secret.

Theodore voiced their collective fear. "If Harrison uncovers the truth, she won't let it go. She's changed—become unpredictable. If she seeks vengeance..."

Margaret scoffed, her expression dripping with contempt. "You're frightened of ashes? Do you honestly believe she can detect poison in them? You overestimate her capabilities."

Benjamin had been murdered by poisoning.

The tension in Theodore and Frederick's shoulders eased slightly. In their minds, Harrison lacked the resources to conduct such forensic testing.

Margaret's eyes narrowed to slits, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Benjamin brought this on himself. We showed him mercy by taking in that roadside orphan. He owed us everything. When he learned Harrison's true origins and tried taking her to the Capital..."

Her unfinished threat hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 401

This chapter revealed Harrison's past, a secret known only to Theodore and Margaret. There was also Benjamin, who had discovered the truth but paid for it with his life.

Theodore quickly intervened. "Mother, that's enough!"

Margaret immediately understood the gravity and fell silent.

Victoria had been straining to catch every word, hoping for valuable information. The sudden silence left her frustrated.

Isabella and Penelope cornered the imposter posing as Dr. Sinclair.

"You fraud! Return our money immediately!"

"How dare you deceive us - you'll regret this!"

Their fury erupted at the con artist who had put the Whitmore family through hell these past days.

"Now that we've caught this fake Dr. Sinclair, we need to recover our funds quickly," Margaret stated.

Theodore and Frederick nodded in agreement. "Absolutely."

Nearby, a sleek Bentley remained parked discreetly, its occupants observing the unfolding drama.

Dominic looked surprised. "Mr. Nathaniel, Ms. Harrison actually found the imposter before we did and brought him here. She's proving more enigmatic than we imagined. Or am I mistaken?"

Nathaniel sat motionless, his expression inscrutable. If this was an illusion, they were sharing it. Harrison did appear increasingly mysterious.

"Follow her," Nathaniel commanded coolly. "Let's see where she goes next."

"Yes, sir."

The Bentley pulled away, trailing Harrison's vehicle. Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. He felt close to uncovering the truth, on the verge of discovering Harrison's real identity.

Thirty minutes later, Harrison arrived at Vitalis Health.

Dominic observed, "Mr. Nathaniel, Ms. Harrison has entered Vitalis Health. What's her connection to this place?"

Nathaniel watched Harrison's slender figure disappear through the glass doors. "We'll find out soon enough."

They followed her inside, ascending to the top floor where a team of black-suited security personnel stood waiting.

Dominic whispered, "Mr. Nathaniel, look at this reception. Vitalis Health is rolling out the red carpet for Ms. Harrison."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line.

What was Harrison hiding? Who was she really?

As Nathaniel moved forward, his steps faltered when a familiar tall figure appeared - Oliver.

The security team bowed respectfully. "Mr. Oliver."

Oliver approached Harrison. "You're here. Let's go inside."

Harrison nodded. "Alright."

They disappeared together through the doors.

Nathaniel stood frozen, stunned by Oliver's unexpected appearance.

"So it's Mr. Oliver! Ms. Harrison came to Vitalis Health to meet him. These must be his men. I completely misread the situation earlier," Dominic said.

Nathaniel had believed himself moments from the truth, only for Oliver's appearance to derail everything.

"Mr. Nathaniel, it's clear now. Mr. Oliver must have orchestrated the imposter's capture. Ms. Harrison has been trying to recover her father's ashes, so they staged this to make the Whitmores approach her. Everything makes sense now. We overcomplicated things," Dominic reasoned, piecing together the puzzle.
###Chapter 402

Nathaniel stared at the empty hallway where Harrison had vanished moments ago. Doubt prickled at his mind. Could the solution truly be this straightforward? Perhaps it was.

A shrill ringtone shattered the silence. His phone was buzzing urgently.

Nathaniel answered immediately. Victoria's panicked voice crackled through the receiver. "Mr. Falcon! Isabella collapsed—her heart condition flared up! They've taken her to Westfield General."

He ended the call without responding. His polished shoes clicked against marble as he strode toward the exit.

Harrison and Oliver stepped into the sterile laboratory. Harrison gathered her raven-black hair into a tight ponytail before slipping into a crisp white coat. "I'm analyzing my father's ashes immediately."

Oliver studied her with quiet intensity. "You've always questioned the circumstances of Benjamin's death. Do you believe the Whitmores were involved?"

Harrison's jaw tightened. "Absolutely."

"But Benjamin was raised as a Whitmore, wasn't he? Even vipers don't eat their own. Why would they—"

Harrison interrupted, her voice sharp. "Remember our earlier research? Margaret struggled with infertility for years after marriage. She tried countless treatments before finally conceiving Benjamin."

Oliver nodded slowly. "The medical records showed that. What's your theory?"

Harrison exhaled sharply. "I suspect Benjamin wasn't biologically theirs. He was likely adopted."

Oliver's eyebrows shot up. "That never occurred to me."

Harrison cradled the urn containing Benjamin's ashes. "Right now, it's just speculation. The DNA results will confirm everything."

Oliver gestured toward the equipment. "Proceed."

Hours blurred together as Harrison worked relentlessly. When moonlight replaced sunlight, two conclusive reports lay on the stainless steel table.

Oliver approached. "Find anything?"

Harrison's voice remained steady, but her knuckles whitened around the reports. "I was right. My father was poisoned. Murdered in cold blood." She tapped the second document. "The DNA test proves no biological relation to the Whitmores. He was adopted, just as I suspected."

The pieces clicked into place.

Oliver spoke carefully. "So Margaret adopted Benjamin, then later conceived Theodore and Frederick naturally. Fate dealt him a cruel hand." He hesitated. "Do you think one person orchestrated this, or was it a collective decision?"

Harrison's eyes darkened with lethal intent. The ceramic urn felt like ice against her palms. No matter how tightly she gripped it, the chill seeped into her bones. She couldn't fathom Benjamin's final moments—betrayed by the family he'd trusted.

Physical pain paled in comparison to the agony of treachery from those you loved most.

"I don't think the killer acted alone." Harrison's voice was sharp as steel. "Today, I studied every member of the Whitmore family—Margaret, Theodore, Victoria, Frederick, and Cassandra. Their faces were masks of guilt, each hiding dark secrets. I'm certain they conspired to poison my father together."

Oliver's expression twisted in horror. "These people are monsters—utterly heartless! So what's your next move?"

Harrison's icy gaze remained fixed on her father's photograph. Her fingers trembled with barely contained rage as she spoke through clenched teeth.

"I'll return their cruelty tenfold—no, a hundredfold. They'll suffer exactly as my father did, but worse. Much worse." A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes. "And they'll surrender every single thing they stole from him."


###Chapter 403

Oliver understood the bond between Harrison and her father. He knew how deeply her father had loved her—those rare moments were the only true happiness in Harrison's life.

Now that it was confirmed her father had been poisoned by someone from the Whitmore family, revenge was inevitable.

Oliver nodded. "I'm with you, no matter what."

Nathaniel arrived at the hospital and headed straight for the VIP suite.

Isabella had been readmitted. Clad in a hospital gown, she sat upright in bed, Theodore and Victoria hovering nearby.

Though Nathaniel had grown distant from Isabella, she was still his woman. He couldn't ignore her. So he came.

"How are you feeling?" Nathaniel asked, sitting beside her, concern etched into his features.

Isabella grasped his hand. "Nathaniel, my heart... it hurts so much."

Victoria spoke up quickly. "Her condition flared up again. She collapsed from the pain. The doctors just left—they can't do anything. That fake Dr. Sinclair was useless. Only the real one can save her. Have you found him yet?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Not yet."

Theodore looked grim. "We can't keep ignoring Isabella's condition. We need to act!"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "I know. I'm handling it."

Just then, Dominic entered, clutching a file. "Mr. Falcon."

He clearly didn’t want to discuss this in front of everyone. Nathaniel stood. "Excuse me for a moment."

As Nathaniel left, Victoria shot Isabella a questioning look. "Where is he going? What’s happening?"

Isabella, lost in thought, murmured, "He’s been searching for a compatible heart for me. Maybe he found one?"

Victoria brightened. "That’s wonderful! I wonder whose it is. Whoever it is, it’s an honor to match Isabella. But why step out to discuss it?"

Isabella frowned. "I don’t know."

In the hallway, Nathaniel faced Dominic. "Speak."

Dominic lowered his voice. "We found a match for Ms. Isabella."

Nathaniel's eyes sharpened with hope.

Dominic hesitated, lips pressed tight.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Out with it."

Dominic handed him a sealed envelope. "You should see this yourself."

Nathaniel tore it open. A name leaped out at him.

Two words: Harrison Whitmore.

Nathaniel's breath caught. "Harrison?"

Dominic nodded. "Yes. Her heart is a perfect match for Ms. Isabella."

Harrison. Of all people.

Nathaniel had never imagined her being the one.

Isabella’s condition was critical. They'd searched everywhere—but never expected Harrison.

Dominic spoke carefully. "Sir... what now? You can't seriously consider asking Ms. Harrison to give up her heart for Ms. Isabella. But without her... Isabella won’t last much longer. What’s the right move here?"

Nathaniel was trapped in an impossible choice—Isabella or Harrison?

His expression darkened, mind racing. After a long silence, he finally ordered, "Keep this quiet."

Dominic nodded. "Understood."

Nathaniel returned to the room.

Isabella’s hopeful eyes locked onto him. "Nathaniel? Did you find a heart for me?"
###Chapter 404

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his features carved from stone. His voice was devoid of emotion as he answered Isabella. "Not yet."

"Mr. Falcon, we can't wait any longer!" Victoria pressed, her voice edged with urgency. "Isabella's condition is deteriorating by the hour!"

Theodore nodded in agreement. "She barely survived the last attack. What if the next one is worse?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "I'm well aware."

The sharp trill of a phone shattered the heavy silence. Nathaniel pulled his phone from his pocket.

"I need to take this," he said coolly before stepping out of the room. Isabella watched him go, her mind whirling with unanswered questions.

Just then, Dominic entered. "Ms. Whitmore, your hospital paperwork is complete. You can rest now."

He turned to leave, but Isabella's voice stopped him.

"Dominic, wait."

He paused, turning back with practiced politeness. "How may I assist you, Ms. Whitmore?"

Isabella studied him carefully. "I already know. Nathaniel told me everything."

Dominic stiffened. He hadn't expected Nathaniel to reveal the truth. The order had been clear—silence.

This changed things.

"Ms. Whitmore..." His voice trailed off, uncertain.

Isabella's eyes narrowed. She could sense the hesitation, the unspoken words. Nathaniel was hiding something.

Her instincts had never failed her before.

"Nathaniel said he found a heart donor. But this person..." She hesitated, watching Dominic's reaction like a hawk.

Dominic was a master at keeping secrets. But that very skill confirmed her suspicions.

"It's someone close to me, isn't it?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "It's Harrison."

Dominic went utterly still.

Isabella's hands clenched into fists. She had guessed correctly. The heart meant to save her belonged to Harrison.

No wonder Nathaniel had kept it from her.

"Ms. Whitmore," Dominic said quietly, "Mr. Falcon has made his decision. I can't speak on his behalf. Please focus on your recovery for now."

With that, he turned and walked out, leaving Isabella alone with the devastating truth.

Victoria, who had been silently observing, suddenly gasped, her voice trembling with disbelief. "Isabella, Harrison's heart could actually save you?"

A shadow crossed Isabella's face as she clenched her fists. "Exactly. It's a perfect match, but Nathaniel kept this from me. What does that imply?"

Victoria's brow furrowed in confusion. "This makes no sense. If he found a compatible donor, why wouldn't he arrange the transplant immediately? Unless..." Her voice trailed off ominously.

Isabella's chest constricted with betrayal. Nathaniel was clearly prioritizing Harrison over her survival. The realization cut deeper than any knife.

Why would he do this? Had her life become so insignificant to him?

Victoria's demeanor shifted suddenly, her lips curling into an unsettling smile. "Actually, darling, this might work in your favor." She placed a cold hand on Isabella's arm.

Isabella blinked, unsettled by the sudden change in Victoria's tone. The older woman's smile didn't reach her eyes.

"Think about it," Victoria continued, her fingers tightening slightly. "If Harrison's heart can save you, then Nathaniel has only two choices - let you die, or..." She let the implication hang in the air.

Victoria's grin turned predatory. "How poetic - the woman who stole your place will literally give you her heart. What could be more fitting?"

A slow, dangerous smile spread across Isabella's face as the realization dawned. This wasn't a setback - it was an opportunity.

The game had just become infinitely more interesting.

Without hesitation, Isabella reached for her phone and dialed Harrison's number. The screen illuminated with each digit, casting eerie shadows across her determined face.
The phone's sharp ring cut through the silence of the room. Harrison picked up after the first ring, her voice crisp yet guarded. "Hello?"

Isabella couldn't suppress her smirk. Harrison remained blissfully unaware—the mere thought of what awaited her sent waves of satisfaction through Isabella's veins.

"Harrison, it's me. I wanted to express my gratitude for helping expose that fraud Dr. Sinclair. We're doing everything possible to recover the lost funds. While we won't recoup everything, your assistance was invaluable." Harrison had been holed up at Rosewood Manor for days, barely stepping outside. Lately, she'd been plagued by unexplained fatigue and relentless drowsiness.

When Isabella offered her thanks, Harrison's voice dripped with skepticism. "Cut the act. State your real purpose."

Isabella expressing gratitude? Harrison wouldn't buy that in a million years.

A soft chuckle escaped Isabella's lips. "I collapsed earlier from sudden chest pains. They rushed me to the hospital. Given our... history, perhaps you'd pay me a visit?"

Harrison snorted. "Will my presence magically heal you? What's the point of doctors then?" Isabella clenched her jaw. That razor-sharp tongue of Harrison's hadn't dulled one bit. She swallowed her irritation—patience was key now. The real game was just beginning.

"Actually, Nathaniel found a compatible heart donor for me. Someone you know intimately. Come see me, and I'll share all the details."

Harrison hesitated, wary of Isabella's motives. But she'd uncover the truth soon enough. Ever since learning about Benjamin's murder at their hands, she'd been anticipating the Whitmore family's next move. A cold smile curled Harrison's lips. "Fine. I'll be there shortly."

After hanging up, Harrison reached for her water glass.

Without warning, a bitter taste flooded her mouth. She doubled over, retching violently despite her empty stomach. The dry heaves wracked her body until bile forced its way up.

What the hell was happening?

She stumbled to the bathroom, scrubbing her teeth furiously to erase the vile taste.

Then realization struck like lightning. Her clockwork-precise period was late.

She checked the calendar. Ten days overdue.

Since returning from Wintervale, the chaos had distracted her from tracking it.

But now the truth crashed over her: No period.

What did this mean?

Harrison's pulse quickened as one terrifying possibility surfaced. Her fingers flew to her wrist.
###Chapter 405

Harrison's face drained of color as the realization hit her. The test results were unmistakable - she was carrying a child.

Pregnant.

Her thoughts raced back to that fateful night with Nathaniel. Their divorce had been finalized, yet they'd shared one last reckless moment together. She'd meant to take emergency contraception, but Nathaniel's cruel dismissal the next morning had shattered her. The fever that followed had consumed her for days, pushing everything else from her mind.

Including the pill she'd forgotten.

Now, nearly six weeks later, the consequences of that night were growing inside her.

Her vision blurred. The room seemed to tilt as she gripped the edge of the bathroom counter for support.

After their divorce, she'd severed all contact with Nathaniel completely. Never in her wildest nightmares had she imagined this outcome.

The irony was almost laughable. After everything they'd been through, after all the pain he'd caused her, fate had dealt this final cruel blow.

Her hands trembled as they hovered over her still-flat abdomen. Was there truly a tiny heartbeat fluttering beneath her fingertips? A living reminder of the man who'd broken her heart?

Nathaniel's child.

Her child.

The weight of it threatened to crush her.
###Chapter 406

Harrison sat motionless on the plush sofa, her mind racing.

After what felt like hours, she finally rose and grabbed her coat.

The hospital was her next destination.

The baby situation needed careful consideration, but first—she had to face Isabella.

Thirty minutes later, Harrison stepped into the private ward.

Isabella lay propped against the pillows, her face unnaturally pale.

A slow, knowing smile curved Isabella's lips. "Harrison. You came faster than I expected."

Harrison's gaze swept over Isabella's sickly complexion. "Your condition's deteriorating. Another fainting spell could be fatal. I thought I'd pay my respects while you're still breathing."

Isabella flinched, the barb hitting its mark.

It suddenly made sense—why her heart had weakened so rapidly. Harrison was the cause.

She inhaled sharply, steadying herself. "Don't waste your concern. Nathaniel found a compatible donor. He'll save me."

Harrison arched a brow. "Found one? Does this person actually consent? Without permission, it's called murder."

Silence.

Victoria chose that moment to speak. "I'm certain they'll agree."

Harrison turned, lips twisting. "Is that you? How noble. I'm sure you'd happily carve out your own heart for dear Isabella."

Victoria recoiled. Had Harrison completely lost her mind?

Isabella's patience snapped. "Not her. Though I know you're curious." A calculated pause. "Actually, I can tell you—"

Harrison studied them both. This hospital summons had purpose. The heart discussion wasn't accidental.

Her sharp eyes locked onto Isabella. "Me?"

Twin smirks bloomed on their faces, impressed by her quick deduction.

Isabella nodded. "Exactly. It's you."

They exchanged triumphant glances, savoring the moment.

Harrison felt the shock ripple through her. Fate had bound them in the cruelest way possible.

A cold smile touched her lips. "Then you're already dead, Isabella. By my hand."

Isabella's smirk faltered. "What?"

"Am I wrong?" Harrison's smile widened. "I won't save you. Enjoy counting your final breaths."

Isabella gaped, speechless.

Harrison stood. "Message delivered. I'm leaving."

She turned toward the door.

"Harrison!" Isabella's voice rang out. "Your refusal means nothing! Do you really think Nathaniel will let me die?"

Harrison froze mid-step.

Isabella regained her composure, voice dripping with confidence. "Nathaniel won't abandon me. Not when your heart is a perfect match. What do you think he'll choose?"

Harrison's stomach twisted. What would Nathaniel do?

The door creaked open.

Nathaniel's imposing frame filled the doorway, his sharp features momentarily softening when he spotted Harrison.

Their eyes met—a silent, charged moment.

"Darling, you're back." Isabella's voice turned saccharine. "I'd love an apple. Would you peel one for me?"

Nathaniel tore his gaze from Harrison, moving to Isabella's bedside. "Of course."

Isabella shot Harrison a victorious look.

Harrison's lips curled. "Isabella, with your weak heart, apples might be... unwise."

Nathaniel blinked, caught off guard.

Isabella's smirk vanished.

Harrison turned her full attention to Nathaniel. "A word? Outside."

The tension crackled between them.
###Chapter 407

Harrison pulled Nathaniel aside, insisting they needed to speak privately.

Isabella immediately protested, clinging to Nathaniel's arm with possessive urgency. "Whatever you have to say, say it right here!"

She refused to let him go.

Harrison studied them both. Why should she bear this burden alone while pregnant? She couldn't let Nathaniel and Isabella continue their little charade. No—he needed to know the truth.

Harrison's voice was firm. "This doesn't concern you, Isabella. I need to speak with him alone. Mr. Falcon, I'll be waiting outside."

Without another word, she walked out.

Isabella tightened her grip. "Nathaniel, don't you dare."

Nathaniel gently pried himself free. "Just a moment."

He followed Harrison into the hallway.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella's frustrated shout echoed behind him.

Harrison stood waiting, arms crossed.

Nathaniel approached. "You wanted to talk?"

She met his gaze, expression unreadable. "Yes."

He nodded. "Go ahead."

A beat of hesitation.

Nathaniel's brow arched. "Changed your mind?"

Harrison inhaled sharply. "Mr. Falcon, have you ever considered fatherhood?"

The question caught him off guard. His voice cooled. "Why ask?"

A faint, knowing smile touched her lips. "Just an observation. You're not getting any younger."

His jaw tightened. "Never crossed my mind. I don't like children."

The finality in his tone was unmistakable.

Harrison wasn't surprised, though disappointment flickered in her eyes. "I see."

Nathaniel studied her, gaze sharp. "That's all you called me out here for?"

His eyes trailed over her figure, lips quirking. "Don't tell me you're pregnant."

"I'm not!" The denial came too fast.

Her phone buzzed—Oliver's name flashing on screen. She declined the call instantly.

Nathaniel smirked. "Inconvenient timing?"

Silence.

His voice dropped, dangerously calm. "Planning a family with Oliver?"

Harrison's expression blanked. "That's none of your business. I'm leaving."

She turned to go.

Nathaniel caught her wrist, holding her in place. "Harrison—"

He stopped, words unspoken.

She waited, pulse racing.

What now? Another plea to save Isabella? Another demand for her sacrifice?

Her gaze never wavered. Nathaniel said nothing.

Finally, Harrison broke the silence.

"Is it true my heart is a perfect match for Isabella's?"

Nathaniel stiffened. "Who told you that?"

"Isabella did."

His frown deepened. This was information he'd deliberately kept from both of them.

Harrison's voice hardened. "If I save her, I die. Is that what you want?"

Silence.

Her smile turned bitter. "We're not sisters. I won't play martyr. So forget it—unless you truly wish me dead."

Conflict darkened his eyes.

Harrison wrenched free and walked away.

Nathaniel stood motionless, thoughts churning, before finally returning to the hospital room.

Isabella pounced immediately. "Well? What did she say?"
###Chapter 408

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto Isabella. "You're aware of the heart compatibility?"

Isabella didn't hesitate. "Of course! Harrison's heart is a perfect match for mine. Why keep it from me?"

Nathaniel countered sharply, "And if I had told you?"

Isabella scoffed. "Then you'd make sure Harrison saves me. That's what you should do."

Silence stretched between them.

Isabella's voice turned desperate. "Don't you want me to live? Are you seriously choosing between us? Have you fallen for her? Is that why you're hesitating?"

Nathaniel's expression hardened. "You won't take Harrison's heart."

Isabella paled.

He had actually refused her.

"So what now?" Her voice cracked. "You're giving up on me? Have you forgotten your promises? First, you pull away, and now you won't even save my life?"

Nathaniel exhaled, his tone resigned. "I've sent teams to find another solution. You won't take hers, but I'll find another way."

With that, he turned and walked out, leaving her standing there.

"Nathaniel, come back!"

Fury burned through her. He had rejected her—because he couldn't bear to lose Harrison.

Before, he would have agreed without hesitation.

But something had shifted. Nathaniel had changed when it came to Harrison, and that change terrified Isabella.

Oliver called, inviting Harrison to dinner, but she declined politely. She already had plans with Gabrielle and Rosalind for a girls' night.

The trio settled at a window table in an upscale restaurant.

Rosalind grabbed the menu. "What are we feeling?"

Gabrielle shrugged. "I'll eat anything."

Harrison hesitated, then admitted, "I'm craving something spicy."

Gabrielle blinked. "Since when do you like spicy food?" She knew Harrison's tastes—she rarely touched anything with heat.

Harrison shifted, uncomfortable. The pregnancy cravings had hit hard. "I don't know. Just really want it tonight."

Gabrielle narrowed her eyes. "That's weird. Unless…" A smirk tugged at her lips. "Are you pregnant? They say cravings change when you're expecting."

She meant it as a joke, but Harrison didn't laugh.

Gabrielle's smile vanished. "Wait—Harrison. Are you serious?"

Harrison met her eyes. For once, she didn't want to hide it. She needed to talk this through.

She nodded. "Yes. I'm pregnant."

Gabrielle and Rosalind gasped in unison.

Rosalind recovered first. "Does Nathaniel know?"

Harrison shook her head.

"You have to tell him!" Rosalind already had her phone out. "He might be difficult, but he's not cruel. If he knows, he'll step up. He always handles things."

She started dialing.

Harrison knew Nathaniel would ensure she and the baby were cared for, even if he didn't want the child.

But she gently stopped Rosalind. "No. I spoke to him today. He said he doesn't like kids. Doesn't want to be a father."

Gabrielle's eyes widened. "So… you're keeping it? You want this baby?"
###Chapter 409

Gabrielle's questions caught Harrison off guard.

Truthfully, she hadn't fully decided what to do about the baby yet.

Her fingers brushed lightly over her still-flat abdomen. The weight of the decision pressed down on her. The thought of termination was unbearable. This wasn't just Nathaniel's child—it was hers too.

If Nathaniel didn't want this baby, did that mean she shouldn't either?

Gabrielle broke the silence. "Harrison, if you want to keep it, then keep it. Financially, we're more than comfortable. Single motherhood is becoming quite common these days. Honestly, if Mr. Falcon doesn't want involvement, even better. We'll cut him out completely and raise this baby ourselves. I'll be the godmother!"

Rosalind nodded in agreement. Though Nathaniel was her cousin, Harrison had made her wishes clear—no disclosure about the pregnancy. Rosalind respected that boundary completely.

Harrison always weighed her decisions carefully. Whatever choice she made would be the right one.

"I'll be godmother too," Rosalind added with a grin. "No father? No problem. This kid will have three mothers. And let's be real—while Mr. Falcon might be emotionally unavailable, genetically? That's premium stock. Imagine a baby with your looks and his... everything. Future CEO material."

Gabrielle nodded enthusiastically. "Remember that viral story about the heiress who married that Stanford PhD? Spent forty million on him just to get pregnant, then divorced him immediately. Basically purchased elite genetics. You're getting that for free. Definitely keep it."

With both friends' encouragement, Harrison felt the tension in her chest ease.

Financial stability wasn't an issue. Early motherhood actually aligned with her life goals.

She nodded decisively. "Alright. I'm keeping the baby."

Rosalind immediately swapped Harrison's wine glass for milk. "You're our VIP now. Pregnant woman privileges."

Gabrielle winked. "Honestly, having Nathaniel's baby is a power move. Those genes? Top tier. And I bet his bedroom skills match."

Harrison choked on her milk, spraying it across the table. She shot Gabrielle a glare, though her lips twitched with suppressed laughter. "Just eat your food."

Gabrielle shrugged, dropping a plump shrimp into Harrison's bowl. "You've changed, Harrison. We used to share everything. Now you're holding out on the juicy details about Mr. Falcon."

Harrison sighed dramatically. "Fine. He's... exceptional."

Both friends gasped theatrically. Rosalind added, "Obviously. Wouldn't have gotten you pregnant so fast otherwise."

Harrison rolled her eyes, but their teasing had lifted her spirits. The anxiety about her decision had melted away.

"All that spicy food? Definitely a girl," Gabrielle declared with a knowing smile.

They launched into guessing the baby's gender.

Harrison's eyes sparkled. "Doesn't matter—boy or girl, I'll love them equally. But if it's a girl..." She trailed off with a soft smile. She'd always dreamed of a daughter.

Rosalind grinned. "A little girl would be adorable. All soft and sweet. Nathaniel would probably melt. Too bad he won't get to see it."

Gabrielle raised her glass. "To Harrison—soon-to-be most glamorous single mother in Willowbrook!"
###Chapter 410

Harrison, Rosalind, and Gabrielle clinked their glasses together.

The restaurant door burst open. A distinguished entourage entered, led by a towering figure with striking features - Nathaniel.

This wasn't a casual dinner outing. Nathaniel was here on business, flanked by several high-ranking executives from Falcon Enterprises.

The maître d' greeted him with practiced deference. "Mr. Blackwood, your private dining suite is prepared. Right this way."

As Nathaniel followed, his gaze swept across the dining area. It instantly landed on Harrison, who looked radiant as ever.

Harrison had come out with Gabrielle and Rosalind for a girls' night. Their animated conversation and frequent laughter filled their corner of the restaurant.

The executives noticed Nathaniel's lingering attention. "Mr. Blackwood, acquaintances of yours? They seem quite youthful - university students perhaps?"

Their curiosity was piqued. Nathaniel's reputation for indifference toward women made this observation noteworthy.

His expression remained unreadable. Without answering, he simply said, "Shall we proceed?"

The maître d' smiled knowingly. "We've arranged some entertainment for your party, Mr. Blackwood. The dancers will perform during your meal."

Upscale establishments often provided such diversions for their elite clientele - beautiful performers to enhance the dining experience.

Unaware of Nathaniel's presence, Harrison stood. "Excuse me, I need to visit the ladies' room." Immediately, Gabrielle and Rosalind rose in unison. "We're coming with you."

"That's unnecessary. It's just over there."

"Nonsense!" Gabrielle insisted. "You're carrying precious cargo now. As future godmothers, we're on duty."

Unable to refuse, Harrison allowed them to accompany her.

As they passed an opulent private dining room, Gabrielle suddenly halted. "Harrison! Isn't that your baby's father over there?"

Baby's father?

Harrison blinked in confusion before following Gabrielle's gaze. Her eyes widened at the sight of Nathaniel.

So that's who Gabrielle meant.

Harrison frowned at the crude label. It didn't suit a man of Nathaniel's stature.

She observed him seated at the head of an impressive table, surrounded by executives. Before a panoramic window, three lithe figures moved gracefully to unheard music.

The dancers wore diaphanous silk gowns, their bodies adorned with delicate chains that chimed with each movement. Their swirling skirts created mesmerizing patterns as they danced with ethereal grace.

Gabrielle smirked. "Seems daddy dearest knows how to enjoy his evenings."

Harrison shot her a warning look. "He's not my anything. Stop that."

Rosalind chimed in, "Biologically speaking, he is the father, Harrison. You're dealing with morning sickness while he's being entertained. Doesn't sit right with me."

Gabrielle nodded vigorously. "Exactly! He shouldn't get off scot-free. At minimum, he should cover all baby expenses. If you don't want him, make sure he's not spending his fortune on other women."

Harrison's attention returned to Nathaniel, who was engaged in conversation while casually sipping his drink.

One dancer in particular kept stealing glances at Nathaniel as she moved. Her infatuation was obvious. During an intricate spin sequence, she deliberately lost her footing - collapsing directly into Nathaniel's lap.

The executives erupted in laughter. "Mr. Blackwood, your magnetism is undeniable! Can't even dine in peace without women throwing themselves at you!"
###Chapter 411

Harrison witnessed the entire scene unfold before her eyes. The woman nestled in Nathaniel's arms was gazing up at him with adoration, while he returned her stare with lowered lids. His enjoyment of the attention was painfully obvious.

She quickly looked away. "That's enough. Mr. Falcon and I aren't together. Since Isabella hasn't commented on this matter, neither will I. Let's go."

Without hesitation, Harrison turned on her heel and left with Gabrielle and Rosalind.

Harrison disappeared into the restroom while her friends waited outside.

"Nathaniel doesn't deserve Harrison," Gabrielle muttered.

Rosalind's eyes suddenly lit up with mischief. "Wait, I've got an idea."

She pulled out her phone, selected a stunning photo of Harrison, and posted it to her social media with the caption: [Gorgeous single woman ready to mingle.]

After hitting send, Rosalind winked triumphantly. "If Mr. Falcon can have beautiful women throwing themselves at him, let's find Harrison someone special online. His reaction will be priceless."

Gabrielle immediately gave an approving nod. "Rosalind, you're brilliant."

"Naturally," Rosalind replied with a proud smirk.

Gabrielle suddenly frowned. "Wait, you have Nathaniel's social media?" Rosalind hesitated briefly before lying smoothly. "We exchanged contacts when Harrison and I were roommates."

Inside the lavish private room, Nathaniel remained unfazed by the executives' teasing. His gaze remained fixed on the woman still clinging to him.

"Will you remove yourself, or shall I have security escort you out?"

The woman froze. As the lead dancer of The Velvet Lounge, she was accustomed to admirers. She'd set her sights on Nathaniel the moment he entered, confident in her charms. His cold rejection shattered her illusions.

"My apologies, Mr. Falcon..." she stammered, hastily disentangling herself.

Nathaniel's chiseled features remained impassive. "Leave."

"Y-yes, sir."

The woman fled the room.

The executives chuckled. "Seems Mr. Falcon isn't interested in tonight's entertainment."

"Still seeing Ms. Isabella? She must be keeping you satisfied."

Nathaniel ignored them, pulling out his phone. Rosalind's post appeared immediately in his feed - a breathtaking photo of Harrison.

He tapped the image. Harrison wore a daring white halter dress that showcased her flawless back. The plunging neckline and exposed skin created a dangerously alluring silhouette that bordered on scandalous.

Gorgeous single woman ready to mingle?

Through mutual connections, the post was already gaining traction. Comments poured in:

[Who is this angel?]
[Introduce me immediately!]
[I'd propose on the spot!]

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. He opened Rosalind's profile and sent a terse message: [Take it down.]

The commanding tone was unmistakably his.

Rosalind burst out laughing at the message. "Oh, he's definitely panicking now."

Just then, Harrison emerged from the restroom. "What's so funny?"

"Nothing important," Rosalind said, quickly pocketing her phone. "Shall we head back?"

Harrison nodded. "Let's go."

As they passed the bar, the pulsing beat of electronic music filled the air. The dance floor throbbed with energetic bodies.

Two excited girls rushed past them.

"Hurry! The main act is starting! Oh my god, have you seen him? Absolute perfection! Tonight's going to be wild!"
###Chapter 412

Harrison, Gabrielle, and Rosalind froze mid-step.

Gabrielle's eyes sparkled with excitement. "The Velvet Lounge's bar is legendary. Rumor has it their headliner drives all the wealthy socialites wild. When he performs his signature striptease, cash rains down like confetti."

Rosalind nodded eagerly. "Exactly! Every waiter here is a sculpted Adonis with abs you could grate cheese on. Let's see if the hype is real."

Harrison shrugged. "Fine by me."

The trio squeezed into the packed venue, the air thick with anticipation. All eyes were glued to the illuminated stage.

Several toned men moved in perfect sync with the pulsing music. The crowd's chant grew louder: "Off! Off! Off!" as the performers began shedding layers.

Center stage stood the main attraction - a masked figure in a fitted black tank and pants. His expressionless mask couldn't hide the raw magnetism radiating from his sculpted frame.

Gabrielle whistled low. "That's him? The star act? Damn, he exceeds expectations! That physique belongs in a museum."

Harrison agreed. "Impressive, but Rosalind... Rosalind!"

Harrison noticed Rosalind's transfixed stare at the masked dancer.

Rosalind's breath caught. Even concealed, she'd recognize Everett Sinclair anywhere. That untamed energy, that predatory grace - unmistakable.

Finding him here, bathed in strobe lights, surrounded by screaming admirers, felt surreal. Decadent. Forbidden.

"Shirt! Take it off!" the crowd demanded.

Everett gripped his collar. With one fluid motion, he tore the fabric apart.

The sound of ripping fabric sent the room into hysterics. His exposed torso - all carved muscle and perfect definition - ignited the atmosphere.

The emcee seized the moment. "Ladies! Enjoying the view? Show your appreciation!"

Servers circulated with trays. Bills fluttered through the air like autumn leaves. Within moments, the trays overflowed.

"I'll pay to touch him!" one woman shrieked. Others joined the chorus: "Name your price!" "I'll double it!"

The bidding war escalated into near chaos.

Gabrielle smirked. "Who knew male entertainers could command such prices? A shirtless dance earns tips. A touch brings more. A full night? He'd retire wealthy."

Rosalind's response was immediate. "He'd never!"

Both friends turned, eyebrows raised. "You know him?" Gabrielle asked.

Rosalind bit her lip. The mask meant anonymity. She wouldn't betray that. "Not every performer crosses lines. Maybe he's here out of necessity. There are boundaries."

Harrison and Gabrielle exchanged puzzled glances. Since when did Rosalind defend strangers?

Rosalind tugged them forward. "Come on. Better view up front."

They pushed through the crowd. As Rosalind looked up, Everett's gaze locked onto hers through the mask.
###Chapter 413

Everett and Rosalind locked eyes.

Everett's face remained hidden behind his mask, revealing nothing of his thoughts. But those piercing gray eyes held their usual chill, regarding Rosalind as if she were just another face in the crowd.

The host chuckled nervously. "Ladies, please! Here's the deal - only one lucky woman gets to touch our star performer tonight. We'll decide this through an auction. Highest bid wins!"

Instantly, the wealthy socialites surrounding them erupted into a frenzy of offers.

"Two thousand!"

"Five thousand!"

"Ten thousand!"

The numbers climbed rapidly until someone shouted "Fifty thousand!" Gabrielle gasped. "Fifty grand just to touch him? What's he made of - solid platinum? These women have lost their minds."

Then Rosalind raised her hand with deliberate calm. "One hundred thousand."

Gabrielle and Harrison both turned sharply toward her.

Gabrielle discreetly pulled at Rosalind's sleeve. "Rosalind, what are you doing?"

Rosalind kept her almond-shaped eyes fixed on Everett. "One hundred thousand. For one touch."

Everett's gaze locked onto hers, recognizing the challenge in her voice. She was determined to outbid every other woman here just for the privilege of touching him.

Harrison's eyes narrowed in sudden understanding. Only one man could make Rosalind behave like this - Everett Sinclair.

The bidding war reignited with renewed frenzy.

"Two hundred thousand!"

"Three hundred!"

Rosalind hesitated briefly - she hadn't brought that much cash. She turned urgently to Harrison. "Loan me the difference. I'll repay you tonight."

Harrison didn't hesitate, producing the platinum card Nathaniel had given her. "Whatever you need."

Rosalind straightened, voice cutting through the noise. "One million."

The room fell silent.

The host's eyebrows shot up. "The lady bids one million! Any higher offers?"

Rosalind held Everett's stare, her eyes flashing with triumph. The message was clear - he belonged to her tonight.

Everett remained impassive. Without a word, he turned and walked offstage.

"Wait!"

"Where's he going?"

The host cleared his throat awkwardly. "Apologies, ladies. Our star performer doesn't... participate in physical contact. Even for money."

Disappointed murmurs rippled through the crowd. "What a waste of time."

In the jostling crowd, someone bumped into Harrison. "Harrison!" Gabrielle cried out.

Harrison braced for impact, but suddenly found herself steadied by strong arms. She looked up into Nathaniel's striking features.

"Mr. Falcon," she breathed. "What are you doing here?"

Nathaniel's expression was glacial. He despised places like The Velvet Lounge - playgrounds for wealthy women seeking male entertainment. The discovery that Harrison was here made his blood boil. "Having fun?" he asked coldly, producing his black card. "Who caught your eye?"

Harrison flushed. "I didn't bid! That was Rosalind!"

Nathaniel scanned the room. Rosalind was already pushing through the crowd, following Everett's retreating figure.

As the Lincoln family's golden girl now of marriageable age, Nathaniel frowned. "What's she doing associating with such unsavory types?"

Harrison studied Nathaniel - his impeccable black suit seemed out of place amidst the club's gaudy decor. He carried himself with an air of refined authority, a true aristocrat among commoners.

He and Everett existed in entirely different worlds.

###Chapter 414

Harrison knew Nathaniel would never approve of Rosalind getting involved with Everett.

Harrison arched one perfectly sculpted brow. "Mr. Falcon, this is none of your concern. Since when do you dictate Rosalind's personal affairs?"

Nathaniel's gaze turned glacial. "Finished with your little performance? Let's go." He seized Harrison's wrist with surprising force, dragging her toward the exit.

Gabrielle called after them, "Harrison! Mr. Falcon!"

Everett had retreated backstage to change. Though he rarely frequented The Velvet Lounge, the underground fight club's profitability couldn't be denied.

He'd just peeled off his bloodstained tank top when the door creaked open behind him. Everett's muscles tensed. "Identify yourself."

Rosalind stood frozen in the doorway, her cheeks flaming scarlet at the sight of Everett's bare torso. She clapped both hands over her eyes with a startled squeak.

Everett yanked a black hoodie over his head in one fluid motion, grabbed his duffel, and moved to leave without acknowledging her presence.

Rosalind blocked his path. "You're really going to pretend we're strangers now?"

Everett's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Move."

She planted her feet stubbornly.

When he sidestepped left, she mirrored him. When he feinted right, she anticipated his movement. Her arms crossed in defiance. "Not until you talk to me."

Everett's patience shattered. He seized the collar of her blouse and effortlessly lifted her off the ground like a ragdoll.

Rosalind gasped, her legs kicking empty air. The man possessed inhuman strength.

He deposited her unceremoniously on the floor and strode out.

Scrambling up, Rosalind gave chase through the crowd. Everett's imposing frame was already disappearing into the throng.

"Everett! Wait!" She shoved through drunken patrons.

Everett had no intention of entertaining Rosalind's whims. Home beckoned.

As he exited the club, a gleaming Bentley blocked his path. Three black-suited enforcers formed a human barricade.

"Ms. Langley requests your company tonight, sir."

Some wealthy socialite had tracked him down. Everett's expression remained impassive. "Not interested."

The lead bodyguard smirked. "She mentioned paying your family a visit if you decline. We already have their address."

Everett went rigid.

The man continued, "Consider this an opportunity. Serve Ms. Langley well, and you'll never want for anything again." He gestured to the open car door. "After you."

A dangerous glint flashed in Everett's eyes, but he entered the vehicle.

The Bentley peeled away.

Rosalind witnessed the entire exchange from the shadows. She flagged down a taxi. "Follow that car! Don't lose them."

Thirty minutes later, Everett stood in the penthouse suite of The Grand Celeste, facing a meticulously preserved woman in her forties.

Penny Langley appraised him with predatory satisfaction. "I always wondered what hid behind that mask. You're even more striking than I imagined."
###Chapter 415
Everett Sinclair stared at Rosalind Fairchild with an impassive expression. "Did you need something?"

Rosalind sauntered closer, her manicured nails grazing his waist. "So firm," she murmured.

Everett's jaw tightened. "Remove your hand."

She barely flinched at his icy tone.

"You know why I invited you here, don't you? We're adults. From tonight onward, you'll be mine. Name your price—I'll spoil you rotten. No more grinding on stage for cash."

His brow arched. "That wedding ring says otherwise. Doesn't your husband mind?"

"Relax," Rosalind purred. "He's clueless. I've done this for years without a hitch."

A cold smile played on Everett's lips as he retrieved a voice recorder from his pocket.

"Pity. I've got every word on tape."

Rosalind's smirk vanished. The device glinted mockingly between them.

Her painted lips twisted. "You're throwing away gold. I'm wealthy, gorgeous—men beg for this chance. Yet here you are, playing hard to get."

Despite her polished allure, Everett remained unmoved.

He scoffed. "If they're so eager, go bother them. Touch my family, though, and I'll ruin you."

The lethal glint in his eyes silenced her.

As he turned to leave, a sudden heat surged through his veins. His skin prickled uncomfortably.

Everett whirled back. "What did you lace this room with?"

Rosalind gestured to the smoldering incense. "Powerful, isn't it?" Her fingers trailed his shoulder. "A virile man like you... surely you crave release?"

Her breath tickled his ear. "Stop fighting it. I'll make it worth your while."

Meanwhile, Arabella had traced him to the Silver Pines Hotel. She paced the hallway, calling out, "Everett? Where are you?"

Inside, Everett shoved Rosalind away and yanked the door open.

Arabella gasped. "What are you doing here?" She rushed to his side.

Spotting Rosalind, Arabella bristled. "Who's she?"

Rosalind assessed the younger woman—her dewy complexion, the way she clung to Everett. A perfect match.

Rosalind crossed her arms. "I should be asking you that."

Arabella gripped Everett's arm possessively. "He's mine! What are you doing with my boyfriend?"

Rosalind arched a brow. "Is that so?"

Everett tugged Arabella away without a word.

Behind them, Rosalind's stiletto cracked against marble. Men always fell at her feet—except this infuriating exception.
###Chapter 416

Rosalind and Everett were strolling down the corridor when Rosalind suddenly stopped him. "Who was that woman earlier? Why did she take you to a hotel suite?"

Everett jerked his arm away from her grip. "That's none of your business."

Rosalind reached up, pressing her palm against his forehead. "You're scorching hot! Are you running a fever?"

Her delicate fingers against his skin, combined with the subtle floral notes of her perfume, sent Everett's pulse racing.

He swatted her hand away roughly. "Don't touch me."

His tone was icy, laced with irritation that made Rosalind's blue eyes shimmer with unshed tears.

As a sheltered heiress accustomed to adoration, this rejection stung deeply. She searched his face, wondering if he truly despised her.

She hadn't done anything to deserve this.

Her wounded expression made Everett tense, but he remained silent. Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away.

Yet Rosalind trailed after him like a persistent shadow.

They entered the elevator together - Everett silent, Rosalind matching his quiet intensity.

The doors had just closed when the elevator lurched violently before plummeting downward at a terrifying speed. Rosalind screamed, her body thrown forward by the sudden drop.

Before she could crash into the wall, strong arms yanked her backward into a solid chest.

Everett held her firmly against him. "Malfunction. Stay calm."

Her panic subsided as his warmth enveloped her, sparking an unexpected comfort. Moments ago she'd believed he hated her, yet now she realized his indifference was just a facade. He was protecting her.

Rosalind tilted her head up. "You're burning up. Should we go to the hospital?"

Everett kept one arm secured around her, his voice gravelly. "Not necessary."

"But you're like a furnace!" Her hand drifted to his waist.

The instant her fingers brushed his sensitive skin, Everett's breath caught.

He wasn't normally like this - he'd never even had a girlfriend.

Penelope had been right about one thing - the potent aphrodisiac he'd inhaled was wreaking havoc on his self-control.

Without warning, Everett captured Rosalind's lips in a searing kiss.

Rosalind's eyes flew wide with shock.

Was he actually kissing her?

His mouth moved with desperate urgency, overwhelming her senses. Her knees buckled, but Everett caught her effortlessly, pulling her flush against him.

He broke the kiss, his breath ragged. "I've been drugged."

Rosalind's mind swam. "What?"

Everett searched her eyes. "Can I kiss you?"

Her body trembled with conflicting emotions. Sliding her arms around his neck, she rose on tiptoes to meet his lips again.

Neither was experienced, but their mouths moved together with surprising harmony, like two puzzle pieces finally connecting.

Rosalind's heart pounded wildly. This kiss confirmed what she'd been denying - her feelings for Everett ran deeper than she'd admitted. As the kiss intensified, Everett maneuvered her gently against the corner. His hands began exploring lower.

Blushing furiously, Rosalind buried her face in his chest, whispering breathlessly, "Everett..."
###Chapter 417

Everett Sinclair froze mid-step.

Rosalind Fairchild batted her long lashes at him. "Does this make me your girlfriend now?"

Everett went completely still.

She pressed closer, her voice dripping with innocence. "Only couples do what we just did. So... are we official?"

Her words hit like ice water, dousing the fire raging inside him. With deliberate slowness, he tried to pull away, straightening his posture.

Rosalind's arms snaked around his neck, yanking him back. Her plump lips formed a perfect pout. "What's this? You kiss me then act like nothing happened? Are you playing with me?"

Everett's throat worked as he fought the intoxicating scent of her skin. "I apologize."

The words struck Rosalind like a physical blow. Was he rejecting her?

Her eyes shimmered with hurt. "You don't feel anything for me?"

Silence.

Rosalind leaned in until their noses almost touched. "Tell me what's wrong with me. Not pretty enough? Not sweet enough? I'll change whatever you want."

Everett tried to pry her hands loose, but she clung tighter.

"Everett Sinclair, I'm crazy about you," she declared, voice trembling with sincerity.

His jaw clenched.

Her boldness was breathtaking - fearless in laying her heart bare. She wanted him, no games, no pretenses.

The dying embers inside Everett roared back to life. Just then, blinding light flooded the elevator as the doors screeched open.

A technician grinned at them. "All fixed! You kids can come out now."

Rosalind sprang back like she'd been burned.

Everett turned to leave.

Something soft brushed his palm. Rosalind's small hand slipped into his, fingers intertwining.

Everett stiffened.

The technician chuckled. "Young love, eh? You two make a cute couple."

"Damn right he's my boyfriend!" Rosalind chirped before Everett could react.

Speechless, he let her drag him out.

Outside the hotel, Everett hailed a cab. Rosalind climbed in after him.

He shot her a look. "I'm going home. Why are you following me?"

Her smile could power cities. "You said you were drugged. I can help."

His voice turned gravelly. "You know how to handle that?"

"I'm an excellent student," she purred, eyes sparkling with mischief and something purer. "Teach me."

The image of her engagement to Julian Blackwood flashed through his mind. The words tumbled out before he could stop them. "Didn't your ex teach you?"

Instant regret. Since when did he care about other people's pasts?

Rosalind didn't flinch. "Ugh, don't mention that creep! We never even held hands." She wrinkled her nose like she'd smelled something foul.

Everett turned to stare out the window.

Thirty minutes later, the cab pulled up to Everett's dilapidated neighborhood.

"Everett, you're back!" Margaret Sinclair called out.

Lillian Sinclair spotted Rosalind and squealed. "Rosalind! You came to visit!"


###Chapter 418

Rosalind smiled warmly as she entered. "Mrs. Sinclair, Lillian, hello."

Margaret's face lit up with surprise. "Everett, you should have told us Rosalind was coming. I would have prepared more dishes."

Everett opened his mouth to explain she wasn't staying for dinner, but Rosalind spoke first. "Mrs. Sinclair, I'm not picky. Whatever you have will be perfect."

Margaret chuckled. "Well, we certainly have enough for everyone."

The room filled with light laughter, creating a cheerful atmosphere.

Everett announced abruptly, "I need to shower."

He retreated to his bedroom, turning the faucet to cold. The icy water cascaded over his tense muscles.

The aphrodisiac Penelope had slipped him was stronger than he'd anticipated. Though experienced enough to recognize such tricks, the drug's effects still pulsed through his veins.

Water droplets ricocheted off his sculpted torso as he clenched his jaw, fighting for control.

The door creaked open. "Everett?" Rosalind's soft voice carried through the steam.

He didn't turn. "What?"

"Your mother asked me to bring fresh clothes."

"Leave them inside."

Rosalind stepped in cautiously. The frosted glass partition obscured her view, which she deliberately avoided. "Where should I put them?"

"Just hang them up."

"Alright."

She arranged the garments neatly on the hook.

Everett's gaze flickered through the misted glass. Her silhouette appeared delicate yet alluring - slender frame, graceful neckline, dark tresses cascading down her back with a faint floral scent.

She stretched on tiptoes to adjust the clothes, her profile revealing gentle curves in all the right places. Youthful. Tempting.

His pupils dilated, muscles tensing against the rising heat. His hand twitched with barely restrained impulse.

"Are you almost done? You've been in there forever." Her voice floated through the barrier.

Silence.

"Everett? Did you turn into a mermaid?" Playful teasing laced her words.

"Everett! Everett!"

Each call of his name through the glass sent electric currents down his spine - secretive yet charged with unspoken tension. Like fireworks detonating behind his eyes, blurring reality.

It felt like breathing in something intoxicating - foreign yet irresistible.

"Everett! Everett!"

Control snapped. "Enough!" His voice came out ragged. "Are you trying to destroy me?"

The other side fell silent.

Rosalind left. Everett shut off the water, toweling off roughly before dressing in the clothes she'd brought. He emerged to find Margaret finishing vegetable prep in the kitchen.

Lillian sat at the table, pencil flying across her notebook. Rosalind observed the girl's flawless handwriting - top of her class, just like her brother.

"You're amazing, Lillian. Which high school are you aiming for?" Rosalind asked.

Lillian grinned. "Willowridge High. Everett got in with perfect scores."

Rosalind nodded. "State champion that year, wasn't he?"

Pride shone in Lillian's eyes. "He's always been first - elementary through college. My impossible standard." She sighed. "I still have so far to go."

The Sinclair siblings' brilliance was undeniable. Though Rosalind had excelled academically, Everett's achievements existed on another plane.

She wandered into the kitchen where Everett stirred sizzling vegetables.

"Everett," she ventured, "is my B-average why you're not interested? Do you think I'm intellectually inferior?"
###Chapter 419
Everett remained silent.

Rosalind studied him closely. His short hair, still damp from the shower, glistened under the kitchen lights. The simple black tee and jeans he wore made him look younger, more approachable.

Cooking came naturally to him—a skill he'd mastered early. There was something undeniably attractive about a man who could handle a kitchen with such ease.

The longer Rosalind watched, the more she found herself drawn to him. "Everett, why won't you talk to me? If you keep ignoring me, I might just have to tickle you."

Without hesitation, she reached out, her fingers dancing lightly over his sides.

Her touch sent an unexpected jolt through him.

Everett reacted instantly, capturing both her wrists in one firm grip and pinning her against the wall. "What are you doing? Stop."

Rosalind squirmed, trying to free herself. "You're being mean!"

He didn't loosen his hold.

Seizing the opportunity, she rose onto her toes and pressed a quick kiss to his lips.

Everett went completely still.

Encouraged by his lack of resistance, Rosalind kissed him again, deeper this time.

The moment their lips met, Everett was overwhelmed. She smelled like expensive perfume—floral, intoxicating, nothing like the plain soap he used. His grip on her wrists finally slackened.

Rosalind wrapped her arms around his waist, coaxing his lips apart as she deepened the kiss.

He was always so distant, so controlled. But when she kissed him, his body burned with undeniable heat. She loved the way he responded to her, the way his breath hitched when she touched him.

Just as the kiss grew more heated, Margaret's voice called from the other room. "Something smells burnt."

Margaret hurried into the kitchen, her cane tapping lightly against the floor. "Everett, did you burn the food?"

Being blind, she hadn't knocked—this was her home, after all.

Rosalind startled, shoving Everett away, her cheeks flaming.

Everett, ever composed, calmly turned off the stove. "Forgot to lower the heat. It's fine."

Margaret chuckled. "Be more careful, dear."

Rosalind quickly added, "Mrs. Sinclair, we were just talking. He must’ve gotten distracted."

Margaret smiled knowingly. "Of course. I'll give you two some space."

Once she left, the air between them thickened with awkward tension. Rosalind glanced at Everett—and noticed the tips of his ears had turned pink.

He was blushing.

Rosalind gasped. "You're blushing!"

Everett denied it instantly. "No."

She grinned. "You totally are! Don't even try to lie."

He shot her a look. "Get out."

"Not a chance. I'm staying right here with you."

Rosalind wrapped her arms around him from behind, pressing herself against his back.

She was warm, soft—everything he wasn't. Everett stiffened. "Aren’t you embarrassed, throwing yourself at me like this?"

Rosalind laughed. "Why would I be?"

Everett arched a brow but said nothing.

She smirked. "You're my boyfriend, aren't you? Isn't this what couples do? Kiss, hug, spend time together? I'm not embarrassed at all!"

Everett scoffed. "Who said I'm your boyfriend?"

"You are!"

"I never agreed to that."

"Well, I kissed you, and you didn’t push me away. Not once! I keep kissing you, and you keep letting me. Face it—you like me too."

Everett smirked. "Maybe I'm just taking advantage of the situation. Ever think of that?"

Rosalind rolled her eyes. "So you're admitting you're a jerk? Fine. Be a jerk. Go ahead—do your worst."

She knew he wasn’t.

Everett had no comeback.

Just then, Reginald—Everett's ever-present shadow of a friend—walked in.

"Everett—whoa. Where did this goddess come from?"
###Chapter 420

Reginald arrived unannounced at Everett's place, completely unprepared to find Rosalind there. His eyebrows shot up when he spotted her.

Rosalind immediately stepped back from Everett, cheeks flushing pink. She offered Reginald a warm smile. "Hello, I'm Rosalind Fairchild."

Reginald's face broke into a grin. "Reginald Whitmore. Nice to meet you. Everett, you sly dog - since when did you get a girlfriend?"

Everett shook his head sharply. "She's not my girlfriend."

"I absolutely am!" Rosalind declared with a radiant smile that made Everett's jaw tighten.

Reginald burst out laughing. "Everett Sinclair, I had you pegged as a lifelong bachelor. All those girls throwing themselves at you in college and you never glanced twice. Now I understand - you were just waiting for someone like Rosalind here. She's in a completely different league."

Everett set down the cooking tongs with deliberate calm. "Outside. Now."

They moved into the backyard where Everett cut straight to the point. "What do you want?"

Reginald's expression darkened. "It's about Phantom - he's surfaced."

The name sent a chill down Everett's spine. The notorious drug lord who had executed his undercover agent father years ago. The man Everett had been hunting ever since.

A gust of wind whipped Everett's black tee against his torso as his eyes turned glacial. "Understood."

He turned to go back inside.

Reginald caught his arm. "She's gorgeous, by the way."

Everett's jaw clenched. "I told you, she's not my girlfriend."

"Cut the crap," Reginald scoffed. "We've been friends since basic training. You don't let women get that close unless you're interested. The only reason you'd push her away is because you think you don't deserve her. What is it - the rich girl thing?"

Everett's silence spoke volumes before he finally muttered, "She deserves better than what I can give."

Reginald rolled his eyes. "Beautiful, wealthy, clearly obsessed with you - and you're telling me you're not interested? That girl looks at you like you hung the damn moon."

Everett's expression remained unreadable. "Get lost."

Back inside, Rosalind looked up from setting the table. "Did Reginald leave already?"

Everett gave a curt nod. "Had things to do."

Margaret, who had been observing quietly, remarked, "That boy always brings gifts but never stays for meals."

Everett carried the dishes to the table. "Dinner's ready."

Rosalind didn't hesitate to take her seat. Everett had prepared braised ribs - Lillian's favorite. He carefully placed a piece in his sister's bowl first.

"Thank you, Everett," Lillian beamed.

As Everett withdrew his hand, he found Rosalind pushing her bowl toward him with hopeful eyes.

"Give Rosalind some too!" Lillian insisted immediately.

Under their dual expectant gazes, Everett served Rosalind a generous portion.

The first bite had Rosalind's eyes widening in delight. She'd watched Everett cook this dish before but never expected it to taste this incredible.

"This is amazing!" she exclaimed, unable to contain her pleasure.

Margaret smiled warmly. "You should visit more often and let Everett cook for you."

Rosalind locked eyes with Everett. "Count on it."

As they finished eating, a deafening thunderclap shook the windows, followed by the sudden drumming of torrential rain against the glass.

###Chapter 421

Rosalind gazed through the rain-streaked window. The storm showed no signs of letting up. How would she ever make it back to campus in this downpour?

"Rosalind," Lillian spoke softly, "it's too dangerous to travel in this weather. Stay with us tonight."

Margaret nodded in agreement. "Yes, dear. You can share Lillian's room."

Though Margaret adored Rosalind, she maintained clear boundaries. No way would she allow Rosalind to sleep anywhere near Everett.

Rosalind smiled gratefully. "Alright then. Looks like we're having a sleepover, Lillian!"

Lillian beamed and linked arms with her friend. "Come on! I'll show you my room."

Inside Lillian's cozy space, she pulled out a brand new nightgown. "Here, you can wear this."

"Thanks," Rosalind said, accepting the soft fabric.

"You should shower first," Lillian suggested.

The Sinclair home had three modest bedrooms - one for Margaret, one for Everett, and this one for Lillian. The bathroom was shared between them all.

Rosalind clutched the nightgown as she stepped into the hallway. "Be right back."

She nearly collided with Everett in the narrow corridor. "Just staying because of the storm. Don't worry - I'll behave."

Everett glanced at the torrential rain outside before meeting her gaze. "Where are you sleeping?"

Rosalind winked mischievously. "With you, of course."

Everett stiffened, his expression turning serious. "Rosalind!"

She laughed. "Kidding! I'm bunking with Lillian. Now, if you'll excuse me..."

She slipped into the bathroom, leaving Everett standing frozen in the hallway. He knew she was teasing, but didn't she realize how dangerous such jokes could be with a guy? Some things weren't funny.

He poured himself ice water, trying to cool his thoughts.

A deafening thunderclap shook the house. Simultaneously, Rosalind's terrified scream pierced through the walls. "Everett!"

He dropped the glass and sprinted to the bathroom. "Rosalind? What happened?"

Silence.

He twisted the knob and burst inside. "Are you—"

Everett froze. Rosalind sat on the tile floor, having slipped. Worse, her clothes were in disarray, revealing far too much smooth skin.

He swallowed hard.

Rosalind hastily covered herself, her voice shrill with panic. "A mouse! There's a mouse!"

Her greatest fear had materialized - the tiny creature had darted out, startling her into falling.

Everett averted his gaze. "Where?"

"There!" She pointed frantically. "Get rid of it!"

At that moment, the mouse scurried straight toward Rosalind.

She shrieked and launched herself at Everett. "Help me!"

Instinctively, he caught her. She clung to him like ivy, legs wrapped around his waist, arms locked around his neck.

"It's coming! Hurry!"

Dazed by her sudden closeness, Everett barely registered the mouse's escape. Her warmth pressed against him, making breathing difficult.

"It's gone," he rasped.

"Really?"

Rosalind peeked down. No mouse in sight.

Then realization struck - she was still wrapped around Everett in a scandalously intimate embrace.
###Chapter 422

Rosalind had done something even more daring - she'd removed her outer garments.

A soft gasp escaped her lips. "Oh-!"

She was about to cry out again when Everett swiftly covered her mouth with his palm, silencing her instantly.

"Quiet," he hissed urgently. "My mother and sister are home. Do you want them finding us like this?"

Rosalind blinked rapidly, her wide eyes filled with startled confusion as she stared at him. She pulled his hand away. "I'll be silent. Just let me down."

Everett released his grip, allowing Rosalind to carefully dismount from him.

As she moved, her fingers accidentally brushed against something unfamiliar. It wasn't their first accidental contact, but this time curiosity overpowered her better judgment. "What's this?"

"Rosalind, don't!" Everett tried to intercept her wandering hand, but she was too quick. He couldn't stop her in time.

His entire body tensed. A flush of arousal spread across his face, creeping up from his neck to his temples.

Rosalind suddenly understood what she'd touched. Her mind reeled as she stumbled backward several steps, eyes widening in shock. "Y-You..."

Seeing her innocent, bewildered expression, Everett immediately turned and strode quickly from the room.

Rosalind stood frozen in place.

What had she just done?

She pressed both hands to her burning cheeks, mortification washing over her. She couldn't possibly face him now.

Everett had already disappeared down the hall when Rosalind's voice called out from the bathroom doorway. "Everett!"

He stopped mid-step.

Her voice carried a new urgency. "I'm terrified that rodent might return. Could you just... stand guard while I finish? I'll be quick, I swear. Please?"

Refusal wasn't an option. "Fine."

Moments later, the sound of running water filled the small space as Rosalind resumed her shower.

Everett moved to the window, throwing it open to let in the crisp night air. Her delicate floral scent was intoxicating - dangerously so for any man's self-control, and Everett despised how easily it affected him.

Approximately ten minutes later, Rosalind emerged. "Done."

Everett turned, his gaze landing on her. Her dark tresses were damp, clinging to her shoulders, and she wore one of Lillian's delicate floral nightdresses.

The garment was modest but slightly too small. Lillian was still a growing girl, while Rosalind had fully matured. The fabric clung to her curves, accentuating every feminine swell - her bust and hips particularly pronounced.

Everett caught one fleeting glance before sharply looking away. "Good. I'm going to bed."

He started toward his room.

Then a small, determined hand caught his sleeve.

Everett paused, attempting to pull free.

But her grip was surprisingly strong, wrinkling the fabric as her fingers twisted into the material.

He turned to face her. "What now?"

Rosalind looked up at him, a mischievous smile playing at her lips. "Everett... do you like me?"

He opened his mouth to deny it.

But girls never really needed verbal confirmation - they always knew.

Rosalind's grin widened triumphantly. "I knew it! You're attracted to me!"

Everett scowled. "I'm not."

She laughed softly. "If not, then how do you explain your... reaction earlier? Doesn't matter. You want me!"

With that bold declaration, Rosalind slipped back into her room, leaving Everett speechless.

He stood rooted in place for several heartbeats before finally retreating to his own quarters. Sitting at his desk, he pulled out all his research on Phantom.

Just then, his phone buzzed with a message from Reginald.

Everett opened it to find a video attachment.

What could this be?

He tapped play...
###Chapter 423
It was explicit.

The moment the audio started playing, Everett immediately recognized the content and shut it off with lightning speed.

He texted Reginald two words: [You're dead.]

Reginald replied with laughing emojis. [You've got a girlfriend now. Time to educate yourself. Broaden your horizons.]

Everett fired back: [Shut your mouth!]

Reginald wisely stopped responding.

Everett returned to studying Phantom's case files. Before he knew it, thirty minutes had slipped by. He lay sprawled on the bed, one arm tucked behind his head, his thoughts tangled in an unfamiliar mess. His mind had always been disciplined—until Rosalind entered his life.

Something about her unsettled him.

Against his better judgment, his fingers found his phone again. The video played before he could stop himself.

Next door, Rosalind and Lillian were already in bed, chatting softly. "How's your mom been feeling lately?" Rosalind asked.

Lillian smiled. "Much better. That medicine you got her really helped. She has more energy now, and the pain isn't as bad."

Rosalind exhaled in quiet relief. The medication was imported, expensive—she'd asked Theodore to prescribe it to Margaret at a fraction of the cost. They didn't know the truth.

It was working, but it wasn't a cure.

"Lil, once you get into Willowridge High, you can stay with me. My place is right by campus."

Rosalind knew Margaret wouldn't last much longer. When she was gone, Lillian would have no choice but to live with Everett—and that wasn't ideal.

She wanted to take Lillian in as a sister. Alistair valued talent, and Lillian was bright. He'd approve.

Lillian chuckled. "I'll probably stay in the dorms. I like my independence."

Both Everett and Lillian were stubborn. Rosalind smiled. "Focus on your exams first. They're coming up soon, and you've got school tomorrow. Get some rest."

"Night, Rosalind."

Lillian drifted off quickly.

Rosalind, however, couldn't sleep. She tossed and turned before finally giving up and slipping out of bed. She needed to see Everett.

At his door, she raised her hand to knock—then noticed it was slightly ajar.

She pushed it open. "Everett!"

Everett, sprawled on his bed with his phone, startled violently. He shoved the device under his pillow. "What are you doing here?"

"Checking on you. Why so jumpy?"

Rosalind's sharp eyes zeroed in on his hidden phone. "What are you hiding?"

Everett scowled. "This is my room. Get out."

Rosalind strode to his bed. "Not happening. Why are you kicking me out? Show me your phone."

She reached for it.

Everett exhaled sharply. "Is breaking into people's rooms a hobby of yours?"

He tried to stop her, but Rosalind was faster. She snatched the phone and unlocked it.

"You're watching something?" She tapped the screen.

Everett didn't answer.

He flopped back, eyes closed. Fine. Let her see.

Rosalind's dark eyes widened. "You're watching this? You're disgusting!"
###Chapter 424

Everett yanked the blanket over his face. Silence.

First time doing something questionable, and she caught him. Unbelievable luck.

Rosalind tugged the blanket down. "Talk to me. Why are you watching this?"

Everett lay motionless, one long leg dangling off the bed. His posture was relaxed, but there was something untamed beneath the surface—wild, reckless.

Rosalind leaned over him, her soft body pressing into his.

Everett gave up pretending. "So what if I did?"

"You—" Rosalind was speechless at his shamelessness.

He studied her delicate face. "You can leave now."

"No."

"Then what do you want?"

"I want to watch too!"

Everett's eyes narrowed. He grabbed for the phone, but Rosalind dodged, clicking play.

"Rosalind!"

They tumbled onto the bed, Everett ending up behind her, his body flush against hers.

Rosalind grinned, eyes sparkling. "Let's watch together."

Everett said nothing, just watched her.

She hit play.

Everett exhaled, defeated. He'd wanted privacy, but now? This train had left the station.

Before he could react, Rosalind climbed onto him, her face flushed. Boldly, she kissed him.

Everett's large hands gripped her waist.

Rosalind wrapped her legs around him. "We shouldn't," Everett muttered, though his resolve was crumbling.

She met his gaze, voice soft. "I've never done this before. You're my first, Everett. I love you. I want you."

Her confession shattered his restraint.

A knock at the door froze them both.

"Everett? Are you asleep?"

Everett yanked the blanket over Rosalind. "In bed, Mom. What's wrong?"

Margaret's voice filtered through. "The storm's going all night. The roads will be slick tomorrow. Don't let Rosalind walk to school alone—take her."

"Got it."

Rosalind, hidden beneath the covers, pressed a kiss to his neck, trailing up to his ear.

Everett's throat tightened. "Rosalind," he warned.

Margaret continued, "At the school gates, go your separate ways. Protect her reputation."

Everett sighed. "Understood. Goodnight, Mom."

The moment the door closed, Everett flipped Rosalind beneath him, eyes blazing. "You'd better not regret this."
###Chapter 425

Nathaniel dragged Harrison out of The Velvet Lounge, his strides long and purposeful. Harrison stumbled behind him, struggling to match his pace.

"Let go of me, Nathaniel!" Harrison snapped, her brows furrowing.

Without a word, Nathaniel yanked open the door of his sleek black Bentley and shoved her into the passenger seat before sliding behind the wheel.

The car roared to life, cutting through the neon-lit streets of Willowbrook. The city lights reflected off the polished exterior, casting fleeting shadows across Nathaniel's sharp features.

Harrison crossed her arms. "Did the entertainment at dinner bore you already? Or did the dancers fail to hold your attention?"

She had spotted him earlier, watching a group of performers with that infuriatingly composed expression. His sudden appearance at the bar had caught her completely off guard.

His fingers, adorned with a platinum Rolex, tightened slightly on the steering wheel. A faint smirk played on his lips. "You saw me?"

"Hard to miss," Harrison retorted. "Your admirers are everywhere."

Nathaniel chuckled darkly. "Coming from you—who was just at a male revue bar. Enjoying the show? If I'd arrived any later, would I have found you buying private dances on my credit card?"

Harrison gaped at him, momentarily speechless. That man and his razor-sharp tongue!

Concern for Rosalind surged. She pulled out her phone and dialed, but the call rang endlessly. No answer.

Where was she?

Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the silence. "Is Rosalind with Everett?"

Harrison nodded. "Probably."

His expression remained unreadable. "Tell her to stay away from him."

Harrison shot him a look. "Don't underestimate Everett. He's got potential. There's more to him than you think."

Nathaniel's lips quirked. "I don't doubt his abilities. But he comes from a different world—one that doesn't align with Rosalind's. Or yours. Some things aren't meant to be."

Logically, Harrison knew he was right. But Everett reminded her of a wild stallion—untamed, unpredictable, destined for greatness in his own way.

She looked away. "You can't control who people fall for."

Hadn't she known from the start that she and Nathaniel had no future? Yet here they were.

Nathaniel didn't respond. Thirty minutes later, the Bentley pulled up to Emerald Heights.

Rain poured down in sheets. Without an umbrella, they sprinted to the building, both drenched by the time they reached the lobby.

Harrison scanned her fingerprint to unlock the penthouse door. "Thanks for the ride. Goodnight."

She stepped inside, ready to shut the door—but Nathaniel's tall frame blocked it. With one firm push, he forced it back open.

Harrison blinked. "What are you doing?"

"I forgot my key," he said smoothly. "Dominic's bringing it. Mind if I wait inside?"

"No—hey!"

Too late. Nathaniel strode past her as if he owned the place.

Harrison exhaled sharply. "This is trespassing."

Nathaniel surveyed the penthouse. Both their units boasted floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic ocean views.

But where his was all cool marble and monochrome, hers was warm—cream walls, plush furnishings, and a crystal chandelier that bathed the space in golden light.

It felt like home.
###Chapter 426

Nathaniel's gaze swept across the lavish living room. "This decor must have cost a fortune."

Harrison shrugged carelessly. "What's your point?"

"Did Oliver pay for all this?"

"Every last cent." Harrison crossed her arms. "The penthouse, the sports car, everything. I just packed my bags and moved in."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. His sharp eyes suddenly caught something on the glass coffee table.

"What's this?" He strode toward it.

Harrison looked up, her blue eyes widening in alarm. There, in plain view, lay a pregnancy test.

She lunged for it, but Nathaniel was quicker. His fingers closed around the plastic stick before she could react.

He examined it briefly before locking eyes with her. "Why do you have this?"

Harrison quickly scanned the test. Relief flooded her when she saw only one line - no indication of pregnancy.

Nathaniel had made his stance on children painfully clear. She couldn't risk telling him.

Would he demand she terminate the pregnancy? The thought made her stomach churn.

"Answer me." His voice turned icy. "Why is this here?"

Harrison swallowed hard. "Isn't it obvious what pregnancy tests are for?"

Nathaniel closed the distance between them in one predatory stride.

His imposing frame forced Harrison backward until her legs hit the sofa. She collapsed onto the cushions as he caged her in, one arm braced against the backrest.

His cold eyes bore into hers. "Whose baby were you testing for? Mine?" His grip tightened. "Or Oliver's?"

Harrison's breath hitched.

She shoved against his rock-hard chest. "None of your business."

Nathaniel caught her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "You're upset."

"Not at all!" Harrison snapped.

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Of course not. It's not like you and Oliver have been intimate yet."

The accusation struck like a physical blow. Harrison's temper flared. So this was why he'd barged in - to confirm his suspicions about her relationship with Oliver.

If he wanted the truth so badly...

A wicked smile curved her lips. She tilted her head, meeting his challenge. "You're absolutely right, Mr. Falcon. We've slept together many times."

Nathaniel's fingers traced her jawline, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Who's better? Him or me?"

Harrison's pulse raced.

"Or perhaps," he continued, voice dripping with sarcasm, "you prefer his touch?"

White-hot anger surged through her. Harrison swung her hand toward his face.

Nathaniel caught her wrist effortlessly. "Violent today, aren't we?"

He was insufferable. In one desperate move, Harrison leaned forward and sank her teeth into his lower lip.

The coppery taste of blood filled her mouth. She'd drawn blood.
###Chapter 427

Nathaniel hissed through clenched teeth. Harrison hadn't changed - still biting when angry.

Without warning, he shoved her backward, sinking her deep into the plush sofa cushions.

Harrison's petite frame disappeared into the upholstery. As she tried to rise, Nathaniel's muscular form pinned her down.

Her palms flattened against his broad chest. "Nathaniel, what are you--mmph!"

His lips crashed onto hers before she could finish. The sudden assault left her gasping.

Harrison's eyes flew open wide. The last time they'd been this close was in that remote village, when he'd taken what wasn't freely given. Years had passed since then.

Now his crisp cedar scent enveloped her again. His tongue forced its way past her lips, claiming her mouth with ruthless efficiency.

Her mind short-circuited.

"Nathaniel, stop this!"

She writhed beneath him, fingers tangling in his designer suit. A cold metal lapel pin bit into her palm, the sharp pain momentarily stunning her.

Her struggles only inflamed him further. Nathaniel's lips trailed fire down her neck to her earlobe.

"We're divorced! Have you lost your mind?" Harrison shouted.

His response was to start unbuttoning her blouse with practiced ease.

Then - salvation. A melodic ringtone shattered the tense silence.

Harrison fumbled for her phone. Oliver's name flashed on the screen.

"It's Oliver! If you don't stop right now, I'll answer!"

Nathaniel's grip tightened on her jaw. A dark chuckle rumbled through his chest. "Didn't know you enjoyed an audience."

"What?"

His gaze flicked to the caller ID. "Letting your new lover watch his woman with her ex? That's kinkier than I remember you being."

His words struck like a physical blow. Humiliation burned through her veins.

How could he be so vulgar?

Her blouse hung open, hair in disarray, while Nathaniel remained perfectly composed in his tailored suit.

"Answer it," he purred. "Let Oliver decide who pleasures you better."

Harrison saw red.

SMACK!

Her palm connected with his cheek in a sharp crack. This time, Nathaniel didn't dodge. The force snapped his head sideways.

He turned back slowly, eyes glacial. "One slap equals one round."

"What?"

"Hit me again, and we go twice tonight."

Harrison choked on her fury.

Nathaniel claimed her mouth again, his lips moving lower.

She bucked wildly beneath him, but his weight was immovable. Her fingers twisted in his close-cropped hair, yanking hard.

"Why me? If you're so desperate, go find Isabella! Or any of your countless admirers! That woman in silk earlier was practically begging for it!"

She genuinely couldn't comprehend his obsession. That stunning dancer would have gladly satisfied him - why torment her instead?

Nathaniel's fingers found the clasp of her bra.

Harrison bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. Oliver's call was still coming through. With trembling fingers, she finally declined it.
###Chapter 428

"I'm calling Isabella!"

Harrison decided if Nathaniel was going to be this arrogant after Oliver's call, she might as well involve Isabella directly. Let her see exactly what was happening.

Instantly, the man looming over her froze. Nathaniel's intense gaze locked onto hers.

A smirk curled Harrison's lips. That name still had power over him.

"Nathaniel, get out of my apartment right now! Or I'll tell Isabella how you're sexually harassing me tonight. She might not be able to do much, but trust me, she'll make sure you can't do anything either."

Desire burned in Nathaniel's eyes as his voice turned rough. "Harrison, what's wrong with you?"

Harrison blinked in confusion. Why was he asking about her when she was threatening to expose him?

What was wrong with her?

Nathaniel lowered his head, his lips brushing her sensitive earlobe. "Harrison, you're leaking."

Leaking?

The realization hit her like a truck. Since becoming pregnant, her body had undergone changes. Her chest had been feeling unusually full lately, and just last night, she'd noticed white droplets staining her nightgown.

Heat exploded across her face as she shoved at Nathaniel's chest. "Get off me!"

Nathaniel caught her chin, pulling her into another searing kiss.

His mouth moved with possessive hunger, devouring her before trailing lower.

Harrison's face burned crimson. She could feel every hard plane of his body pressed against hers, his arousal unmistakable.

Nathaniel, the powerful CEO, knew exactly what he was doing.

"Nathaniel, you're disgusting! Let me go! I swear I'm calling Isabella right now!"

Her fingers flew across her phone screen, initiating a video call to Isabella.

The ringing tone filled the room.

"I'm video calling her - stop this instant!"

As she spoke, the call connected. Isabella's delicate features appeared on screen.

Isabella was in the hospital, undergoing observation for her chronic heart condition.

Victoria sat beside her, both women discussing Harrison.

With deadly seriousness, Isabella declared, "Mother, I will get Harrison's heart - no matter what."

Her survival depended on it.

Victoria chuckled softly. "Don't worry, darling. Mr. Falcon adores you. He'll make it happen."

Just then, Harrison's video call came through.

Isabella's lips curled. "Why the video call? Has hell frozen over? What do you want now? Finally ready to donate your heart? Even if you hesitate, Nathaniel will make you agree. He'll save me!"

Victoria handed Isabella a peeled apple. "Harrison, smart girls know when to surrender. Just say yes and get it over with."

Harrison hadn't expected this barrage. She shouted, "Isabella, help me!"

Isabella froze. Only then did she notice Harrison's flushed face, her expression a mix of embarrassment and something else entirely.

Harrison's voice turned urgent. "Control your man! He broke in and is trying to - ah!"

Before she could finish, the camera angle shifted slightly. Isabella's body went rigid.

There, pinning Harrison to the sofa in his custom black suit, was Nathaniel.

Isabella's mind blanked. She couldn't process what she was seeing.

For the first time, she couldn't comprehend the dynamic between Nathaniel and Harrison.
###Chapter 429

Impossible!

Harrison's mind reeled in disbelief.

Rage exploded through her. "Isabella!" she shrieked. "What the hell are you doing with Nathaniel? You scheming little witch! You seduced him, didn't you? He's mine now! Have you no shame?"

She thrust the phone closer. "See for yourself, Isabella! It's your precious Nathaniel forcing himself on me!"

"You lying—"

Before she could finish, the call cut off abruptly.

Inside Rosewood Manor, Harrison remained pinned beneath Nathaniel. She had more venom to spew, but Nathaniel snatched the phone from her grip and ended the call.

His gaze burned with dark hunger. "Satisfied?"

Harrison scoffed. "Hardly. Isabella's probably having a meltdown right now. Serves her right."

Nathaniel tossed her phone onto the side table. "If you're done, we're picking up where we left off."

His mouth crashed onto hers before she could protest.

Then his phone buzzed in his pocket—undoubtedly Isabella calling back.

Harrison shoved at his chest. "Answer it! That's your girlfriend!"

Nathaniel ignored it. One hand tugged at her blouse while the other worked on his belt. His voice was rough. "Focus on me."

Helplessness washed over her. That night in the village had been about survival, but this? This was deliberate. They both knew exactly what was happening, yet Nathaniel had forced his way in.

They were over. She didn't want this.

And she was pregnant.

Early pregnancy meant no strenuous activity—certainly nothing like this.

Fear coiled in her stomach. "Nathaniel, stop! You're hurting me!"

He smirked, keeping her trapped beneath him. "Where's all that fire now? Suddenly so fragile?"

Harrison flushed. "I'm on my period. It's not a good time."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Prove it."

She jerked her head away. "It's true! Do you really want to risk it? It's disgusting. I could get an infection."

He hesitated, jaw clenched. "Then what do you suggest?"

Harrison seized the chance to push him off, scrambling to escape. "Go find someone else."

Nathaniel caught her wrist in an iron grip. "Not so fast."

His arms locked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. That slender waist had always been his weakness. He squeezed, pressing into her stomach.

Harrison winced. "I'm serious. I don't feel well. Let go."

Nathaniel studied her face. The discomfort was genuine. His expression softened slightly. "Where does it hurt? Here?"

His large hand settled over her lower abdomen, rubbing slow circles.

The warmth of his palm seeped through her clothes, the tenderness unsettling. When Nathaniel chose to be gentle, it was dangerously easy to forget everything.

Harrison batted his hand away. "What are you doing?"

Nathaniel lifted her effortlessly onto his lap. "If you won't let me have this, then we're finishing our earlier conversation."

Harrison exhaled sharply, defeated.

Nathaniel pulled her against him on the couch, his hand returning to her stomach.
###Chapter 430

"It's late. You should head home and rest," Harrison said, her tone steady but leaving no room for argument.

Nathaniel didn't move. His gaze lingered on her. "You're right. It's late. Goodnight."

Harrison stiffened.

Was he planning to stay?

"Mr. Falcon, hasn't Dominic brought the key yet?" she asked, fighting to keep her voice even.

"He won't deliver it until tomorrow. So tonight, I'm staying here," Nathaniel replied smoothly, as if discussing the weather.

"No," Harrison protested, her voice betraying a slight tremor.

Nathaniel turned, his eyes sharp as a blade. "This isn't a request. It's a statement."

Harrison opened her mouth to argue, but before she could speak, the world tilted. Nathaniel's lips crashed against hers, stealing her breath and silencing any protest.

In the hospital room, Isabella had been dialing Nathaniel's number relentlessly. No answer.

She tried Harrison next. Still nothing.

What were they doing together?

The images from the video call flashed in her mind, igniting a firestorm of rage. With a violent jerk, she hurled her phone across the room. It shattered against the wall.

"Harrison, you scheming little witch! You'll pay for this!" she screamed, fists clenched so tight her nails bit into her palms.

Victoria rushed forward, hands outstretched. "Calm down! You can't let your emotions control you. Think of your health!"

Isabella shoved her away. "Mother, if you love me, help me! Do you see what Harrison's doing? She's stealing Nathaniel from me. I never should have let her take my place in that marriage. They never should have met!"

Victoria's stomach twisted with regret. Harrison—the girl from the cave all those years ago—was back in Nathaniel's life. And though he'd despised her at first, his attention had shifted entirely.

"Don't worry. I have a plan," Victoria murmured, something dark flickering in her eyes.

Isabella leaned in, curiosity burning. "What plan?"

Victoria whispered into her ear, the words low and venomous.

Isabella's eyes lit up. She flashed a thumbs-up.

"Mother, you're brilliant!"

The next morning, Harrison jolted awake. She shifted, realizing she was still on the couch. The space beside her was empty—Nathaniel had gone.

Memories of the night flooded back. They'd fallen asleep together, Nathaniel's arms wrapped around her, his warmth a shield against the world. For the first time in years, she'd slept soundly.

Now, he was gone.

Harrison sat up slowly, reaching for her phone. Oliver had called multiple times.

She dialed him back immediately.

Oliver answered on the first ring. "Where were you last night? I've been trying to reach you!"

Harrison hesitated. "I went to bed early."

"Liar," Oliver teased. "You were with Mr. Falcon, weren't you?"

Harrison nearly choked.

Did he have spies watching her?

She changed the subject. "Why were you calling so urgently?"

"Mr. Falcon is looking for you. He's put out an industry-wide search. I can barely hold them off. What do you want to do?" Oliver's voice was heavy with concern.

Nathaniel was searching for her this aggressively?

Of course. Isabella's condition was deteriorating. With Nathaniel so desperate, it was only a matter of time before he found her.

Harrison smirked. "Don't worry. Contact him. Tell him I've arrived in Willowbrook. I'll arrange a meeting."

Oliver chuckled.

"If the Whitmores hear the real Dr. Sinclair is in Willowbrook, they'll lose their minds. Alright, I'll set it up. He's been hunting for you—it's time he sees who you really are."
###Chapter 431

Harrison knew the moment had come to reveal herself at last. The Whitmore family was responsible for her father's tragic death, and now the time had arrived to settle that score permanently.

Then there was Nathaniel. He'd been desperate to uncover Dr. Sinclair's true identity.

Well, she was finally prepared to tell him.

In the CEO's office at Falcon Enterprises, Nathaniel sat behind his imposing desk reviewing contracts. His fountain pen moved with swift precision as he signed each document with a decisive flourish.

The door opened silently as Dominic entered. "Mr. Falcon, we've received an update about Dr. Sinclair."

Nathaniel's hand stilled, the pen hovering above the paper. His piercing gaze lifted to meet Dominic's. "Continue."

"We've just been informed that Dr. Sinclair will attend tonight's dinner. The real doctor has arrived in Willowbrook and requested to meet with you there."

Nathaniel's expression darkened, his jaw tightening. After years of searching and dealing with that imposter, the genuine Dr. Sinclair had finally surfaced.

Tonight, he would finally confront this mysterious figure. A cold smile curved Nathaniel's lips. "Excellent. We'll meet tonight at the dinner."

Later that afternoon, Nathaniel arrived at the private hospital suite. Victoria had called earlier claiming Isabella's heart condition had worsened and she needed his presence.

Entering the room, he found Isabella seething with rage. "Nathaniel! What happened last night? Why were you with Harrison? I know she's scheming - buying that house across from yours was clearly deliberate!"

"Isabella," Nathaniel interrupted sharply.

She glared at him, barely containing her fury.

Nathaniel exhaled slowly before responding. "I went to see Harrison last night."

"What?!"

Isabella froze momentarily before covering her ears dramatically. "I don't want to hear this! I won't listen! Nathaniel, when I went abroad before, I allowed Harrison to take my place in the marriage. If you've slept with her, I'll forgive you, but don't let her manipulate you!"

"She may have degrees, but she's just been a housewife these years. You couldn't possibly fall for someone like that!"

"Fine, Harrison is beautiful and knows how to handle men. That must be why you noticed her. She satisfied you in bed, so now you're paying attention. She's just using her looks to get what she wants. You don't love her. You love me!"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. Part of Isabella's tirade held truth - Harrison did possess an uncanny ability to please him, particularly between the sheets.

His mind flashed to last night - the way Harrison's body had responded to his touch. Just the memory made his pulse quicken.

He'd spent the entire night holding her, an exquisite torture unlike anything he'd experienced. This inexplicable need to see her again consumed him.

He'd always valued educated, career-driven women who could challenge him intellectually. Harrison was brilliant, a prodigy, but as a housewife she lacked professional ambition - the opposite of his usual preference.

Yet with her, none of that mattered. He couldn't explain why.

Isabella's voice trembled. "I'm unwell. The doctors said I can't handle stress. Don't say anything that will upset me."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "Dr. Sinclair has arrived in Willowbrook."

Isabella froze, her eyes widening before filling with sudden joy. "Truly? The real Dr. Sinclair is here?"
###Chapter 432

Harrison, Victoria, and Penelope entered the hospital room simultaneously, their faces alight with excitement.

Margaret's eyes gleamed. "The actual Dr. Sinclair has come to Willowbrook?"

Nathaniel confirmed with a nod. "Indeed. Dr. Sinclair will be attending tonight's gala."

Heavens!

The Whitmore family buzzed with anticipation.

Penelope clasped her hands together, starry-eyed. "Dr. Sinclair is finally here! She's been my role model since medical school. I can't believe I'll actually meet her!"

Margaret added, "Dr. Sinclair is famously elusive. After that imposter last year, we'll finally see the real deal."

Victoria tilted her head curiously. "What do you think? Male or female?"

Isabella shrugged. "We'll find out tonight."

Margaret turned pleading eyes toward Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, might we accompany you this evening? We're all desperate to meet Dr. Sinclair."

"Of course," Nathaniel agreed.

Just then, a smooth voice interrupted. "What's all this excitement about?"

Nathaniel turned to see Harrison standing in the doorway, elegant as always.

Isabella smirked. "The real Dr. Sinclair has arrived in Willowbrook. Not that you'd understand her significance."

Margaret added with a mocking smile, "Dr. Sinclair represents everything you're not - accomplished, respected, brilliant."

Harrison's lips curved slightly. "So you're all meeting Dr. Sinclair tonight?"

Penelope grinned. "Yes. And you're not invited."

Harrison chuckled, raising an eyebrow. "Funny you should mention that. I happen to know Dr. Sinclair personally."

Margaret gasped. "You? Know Dr. Sinclair?"

Harrison tilted her head. "Have you forgotten who exposed the imposter last time?"

The memory made Penelope flush with anger. "You only succeeded because of Mr. Oliver!"

Harrison's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Believe what you will. The fact remains - I know Dr. Sinclair."

Isabella leaned forward. "If you know her, tell us - man or woman?"

Harrison smiled mysteriously. "A woman. And quite stunning."

She stepped closer to Isabella, voice dropping. "You should be careful, Isabella. When Nathaniel meets her... well, we'll see where his loyalties lie."

Isabella's grip tightened on Nathaniel's arm. "Nathaniel loves me. No one could take him from me."

Harrison's gaze slid to Nathaniel. "Is that so?"

Nathaniel studied Harrison for a long moment before grasping her wrist and pulling her into the hallway. Harrison yanked free immediately. "What are you doing?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "I should be asking you that. What's your game?"

Harrison straightened her sleeve. "Simply sharing information about Dr. Sinclair."

"You truly know her?"

"Absolutely." Harrison stepped closer, lips curving. "In fact... you've already met her."
###Chapter 434

Harrison revealed Nathaniel had encountered Dr. Sinclair.

Nathaniel was taken aback. His piercing gaze locked onto Harrison as he studied her. An unsettling suspicion gnawed at him—she was keeping secrets.

At that moment, Harrison's eyes shimmered with an almost unnatural brilliance. Nathaniel felt an odd flutter in his chest as he watched her.

Just then, Margaret and Victoria emerged from the room. "Harrison!" Margaret called sharply.

Harrison turned. "Did you need something?"

Margaret's expression darkened. "Did you retrieve your father's ashes and settle everything properly?"

A bitter laugh escaped Harrison's lips. "Since when do you care about my father's remains?"

"How dare you! Benjamin was my first son. I'm his mother!" Margaret snapped, her voice trembling with anger.

Harrison's smile turned venomous. "He's gone. Who are you pretending for? He wasn't even your real son. You adopted him."

Margaret and Victoria froze, their faces draining of color. They never expected Harrison to know this truth. Victoria's voice shook. "How... how did you find out?"

Harrison closed the distance between them, her confidence unshakable.

"You were desperate to secure your place in the Whitmore family. When you couldn't conceive, you took in my father. Then miraculously, you got pregnant—first with Theodore, then Frederick. Those two were always your golden boys."

"You played favorites. My father knew he wasn't truly yours, yet he endured everything. He considered you his mother. He built his empire from nothing, supported his brothers, gave you everything you have now. He repaid your so-called kindness tenfold!"

Her words struck like physical blows. Margaret and Victoria staggered back, stunned.

They never imagined Harrison knew their darkest secret—nor how she'd uncovered it.

Harrison turned her icy gaze to Victoria. "My father loved you. Married you. Cherished you. Never failed you. And look how you repaid him!"

Victoria's face twisted in fury. "What are you implying?"

"You know exactly what you did to him! How do you sleep at night, spending the fortune he left behind? Don't you ever wonder if his ghost watches you?"

"Enough of this madness!"

Face white with rage, Victoria raised her hand to strike—but Harrison caught her wrist mid-air.

Victoria gasped. "I'm your mother! How dare you—"

"Mother?" Harrison's voice dripped with contempt. "You forfeited that title long ago."

With a sharp shove, Harrison sent Victoria crashing into the wall. The older woman crumpled, her dignity shattered.

Margaret's hands trembled with outrage. "You've crossed every line! Do you think Oliver's protection makes you untouchable? Men tire of women like you. When he discards you, you'll be nothing!"
###Chapter 435

The moment Harrison appeared, Isabella froze. "What is she doing here?"

Nathaniel's intense gaze locked onto Harrison as she approached.

Oliver immediately wrapped an arm around Harrison's slender waist. "There you are."

Margaret, Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria quickly formed a circle around Harrison, who looked more radiant than ever.

Margaret spoke first with thinly veiled contempt. "Harrison, why are you here? Don't tell me you're also here to see Dr. Sinclair? The doctor is quite famous, but I didn't realize housewives followed medical celebrities."

Harrison arched one perfect eyebrow. "Actually, yes. I'm here to see Dr. Sinclair."

Penelope scoffed loudly. "Even if you meet Dr. Sinclair, someone of your status would never hold the doctor's attention."

Harrison turned her piercing gaze toward Penelope. "And you think you will?"

"Obviously!" Penelope preened. "I'm a medical student, after all."

"Harrison, today is a historic occasion - the real Dr. Sinclair is in Willowbrook," Victoria interjected sharply. "This isn't the time for your usual attention-seeking antics. Don't embarrass the Whitmore family."

Harrison merely smiled without responding.

Oliver observed the Whitmore family with quiet amusement. Soon they would realize their monumental mistake.

Nathaniel's cold eyes narrowed. "You're here for Dr. Sinclair?"

Harrison nodded. "That's right."

Oliver checked his watch. "It's almost time. Dr. Sinclair should be making an entrance soon."

With a mysterious smile, Harrison excused herself. "If you'll excuse me."

She turned and walked away gracefully.

The moment Harrison was out of earshot, Isabella clung to Nathaniel's arm. "Nathaniel, I can tell she's scheming again. She must know Dr. Sinclair could help me and wants to sabotage it."

Margaret nodded vigorously. "We must ensure Dr. Sinclair stays away from her."

Nathaniel remained silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

Oliver smirked. "When Dr. Sinclair appears, it's going to be quite the spectacle."

Harrison ascended to the second floor where she freshened up her makeup. Soon she would make her grand entrance as Dr. Sinclair.

She could already picture the shock on Margaret, Isabella, Penelope and Victoria's faces when they realized she wasn't just a simple housewife.

A waiter entered discreetly. "Ms. Whitmore, you may go out now."

Harrison stood gracefully. "Very well."

She moved toward the door, preparing for her dramatic reveal.

But as her hand touched the doorknob, she froze. Turning sharply to the waiter, her voice turned icy. "What did you just call me?"

He had addressed her as Ms. Whitmore, not Dr. Sinclair.

A dangerous glint flashed in Harrison's eyes as she advanced on the waiter. "Who sent you?"

Before she could finish, blinding pain exploded at the base of her skull. Darkness swallowed her vision as she collapsed.

"Get her out now," the waiter hissed.

Back in the grand hall, Nathaniel's group remained waiting. Isabella's phone chimed softly.

The message read simply: [Mission accomplished.]

A triumphant smile curled Isabella's lips.

"Nathaniel, I need to visit the ladies' room."

Nathaniel frowned. "Dr. Sinclair is about to appear. Why now?"

Though Dr. Sinclair was important, Isabella's secret plan took priority.

"I'm just nervous about meeting the doctor," Isabella lied smoothly. "I'll be quick. Don't worry - I'll return before the big moment!"
###Chapter 436

With that, Isabella turned on her heel and disappeared into the crowd.

Before leaving, she shot Victoria a fleeting glance—a silent exchange passing between them.

Nathaniel stood beside Oliver, who checked his watch. "Mr. Falcon, Dr. Sinclair should be arriving any moment now."

Nathaniel studied him. "How do you know Dr. Sinclair?"

Oliver didn't answer directly. Instead, he said, "You know her too."

Nathaniel's brows drew together. Harrison had told him the same thing—that he knew Dr. Sinclair. Now Oliver was echoing those words.

What was the meaning behind this?

Was Dr. Sinclair someone he had overlooked all this time?

Just then, the host's voice cut through the murmurs. "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. The moment we've all been waiting for has arrived—please welcome Dr. Sinclair!"

Every gaze snapped upward, anticipation thickening the air.

Nathaniel looked up.

Margaret, Penelope, and Victoria had pushed to the front. Margaret was practically bouncing on her toes. "Finally! Dr. Sinclair is here!"

The crowd held its breath.

But seconds ticked by. Nothing.

The silence stretched, heavy and unbroken.

Whispers erupted. "What's happening? Where is Dr. Sinclair?"

"Did the doctor even show up tonight?"

The host's smile faltered. This wasn't part of the plan.

"Please excuse me for a moment," the host said quickly. "I'll check upstairs. Dr. Sinclair will be with us shortly."

He hurried away.

Penelope frowned. "Is Dr. Sinclair backing out again? We came specifically for this."

Nathaniel turned to Oliver. "Mr. Oliver, your Dr. Sinclair enjoys playing games. Keeping us all in suspense."

Oliver was just as confused. Harrison had arrived—why wasn't she making her entrance? Had something gone wrong?

Without hesitation, Oliver bolted upstairs.

Nathaniel's curiosity burned. He had missed Dr. Sinclair multiple times now. Tonight, he would uncover the truth.

Then—his phone rang, the melody sharp against the tension.

He answered immediately.

Isabella's panicked voice tore through the line. "Nathaniel, help me—please!"

His grip tightened on the phone. "What's wrong? Talk to me. What happened?"

"Nathaniel, I—ahh!"

A scream. Then silence. The call cut off.

Victoria rushed forward, face pale. "That was Isabella?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Something's happened to her."

"But she just went to the restroom," Victoria said, voice shaking. "We need to find her—now!"

They sprinted to the ladies' room.

Inside—chaos. Signs of a struggle everywhere.

Isabella's phone lay shattered on the tiles.

Victoria picked up the broken pieces, hands trembling. "Nathaniel, look—it's hers. Do you think she's been taken?"

Margaret and Penelope arrived, both wide-eyed.

"Who would kidnap Isabella? Her heart can't handle this!" Margaret cried.

Penelope grabbed Nathaniel's arm. "Mr. Falcon, you have to do something!"

Nathaniel stared at the broken phone, his expression turning to ice.

Then—his phone rang again.
###Chapter 437

Nathaniel's finger hovered over the answer button before pressing it. A rough male voice crackled through the speaker.

"Hello, Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel's expression didn't flicker as he tightened his grip on the phone. "Identify yourself."

"Names don't matter. What matters is that I have what you're looking for," the voice taunted.

Victoria's panicked voice cut in. "He took Isabella! Mr. Falcon, you have to get her back!"

Nathaniel's tone turned glacial. "Is Isabella with you?"

"Smart man," the voice sneered. "Let her say hello."

Seconds later, Isabella's terrified voice filled the line. "Nathaniel, help me! I'm scared—please!"

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cold, humorless smile. "State your demands."

"One hundred million. Now."

A dry laugh escaped Nathaniel. "Kidnapping and extortion? That's a life sentence."

The man on the other end didn't sound fazed. "Spare me the threats. Think a hundred million's too much for one life? What about two?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Two?"

Oliver rushed in, breathless. "Mr. Falcon, Harrison is missing."

Earlier, when Dr. Sinclair hadn't arrived, Oliver had gone to check—only to find Harrison gone.

Nathaniel froze for half a second before his grip on the phone turned bone-white. "You have Harrison too?"

Meanwhile, in a derelict warehouse on the city's outskirts, Harrison stirred awake.

Her wrists and ankles were bound. Before her stood a scar-faced man flanked by black-clad figures.

Kidnapped.

Just her luck. She'd planned to reveal herself as Dr. Sinclair today—instead, she'd woken up here.

A familiar voice called out weakly. "Harrison? You're awake?"

Harrison turned her head. Isabella, bound and bruised, lay beside her.

Harrison's breath hitched. "Isabella? What are you doing here?"

Isabella thrashed against her restraints. "Let us go! I'm Nathaniel's girlfriend! If you hurt me, he'll hunt you down—this is his city! You won't escape!"

The scarred man, phone in hand, chuckled darkly. "Oh, I know exactly who you both are. His current flame and his ex-wife."

He stepped closer to Harrison. "Say hello to Mr. Falcon."

Harrison scanned the room, then suddenly shouted into the phone, "Nathaniel! Western outskirts warehouse—"

The man backhanded her before she could finish.

CRACK.

The force snapped Harrison's head to the side. A livid red mark bloomed across her cheek, swelling instantly.

Nathaniel heard the slap—and the sharp gasp that followed. His voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"Touch her again, and you won't live to see dawn."

Scarface laughed. "Aw, still soft for the ex? How sweet."

Nathaniel's reply was ice. "You'll get your hundred million. Send the address. I deliver the money—you hand them over."

"Deal," Scarface mocked. "But come alone."
###Chapter 438

Scarface gave Nathaniel the address and ended the call without ceremony.

Victoria spoke up immediately, her voice trembling. "Mr. Falcon, you must save Isabella! Her heart condition—she can't endure this kind of stress!"

Oliver shot Nathaniel a worried glance. "Harrison is with them too. You have to bring her back."

Nathaniel didn't reply. His expression darkened as he turned on his heel and strode out without another word.

Inside the warehouse, Scarface smirked at Harrison and Isabella.

"Tsk, tsk," he mused, circling them. "You can criticize the wealthy for many things, but never their taste. Mr. Falcon's ex-wife and his mistress—both stunning. Enough to make any man envious."

One of his men chuckled. "Boss, we've got time. Why not have some fun with them first?"

Scarface rolled up his sleeves and grabbed Harrison's chin, forcing her to look at him. "Let's start with the ex-wife. I wonder what kind of woman could hold Mr. Falcon's attention."

His fingers moved toward the collar of her blouse, ready to tear it open.

Harrison didn't flinch. Her voice was ice-cold. "Touch me, and you won't live to regret it."

Scarface froze.

Even with the angry red handprint marring her cheek, her gaze was steady, fearless. "If you're smart, you'll walk away with your hundred million. But if you lay a finger on me, you won't leave this warehouse alive."

Slowly, Scarface withdrew his hand.

Isabella shot Harrison a venomous glare. "Harrison, stop pretending! Do you really think Nathaniel came for you? He's here for me! If I weren't here, he wouldn't even spare you a glance!"

Even now, bound and helpless, Isabella couldn't resist her arrogance. Harrison gave her a look of pure disdain.

A voice called from outside. "Boss, Mr. Falcon is here."

Nathaniel had arrived—faster than expected.

The warehouse door burst open with a deafening crash, letting in a gust of frigid air. Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his presence alone enough to make the air turn heavy.

His black coat billowed behind him as he stepped inside, his every movement radiating lethal calm.

Scarface grinned and stepped forward. "Mr. Falcon, I'm impressed. You didn't keep me waiting."

Nathaniel's voice was a blade of ice. "Let me see them."

"Of course," Scarface said, gesturing. "Your ex-wife and your mistress—both unharmed."

Nathaniel's gaze swept over the two women tied up on the floor.

Isabella's face lit up. "Nathaniel! I knew you'd come for me! Please, get me out of here—I can't stand another second!"

Nathaniel barely glanced at her before his attention locked onto Harrison.

She sat silently, her eyes meeting his without fear.

His gaze immediately zeroed in on the swollen mark across her cheek.

Scarface stepped closer, still grinning. "The women are fine. Did you bring the money?"

Nathaniel turned to him, his voice dangerously soft. "Did you hit her?"

Scarface hesitated. "I—"

Nathaniel moved faster than thought. His palm cracked across Scarface's face with enough force to send him stumbling back.

Scarface clutched his cheek, stunned.

Nathaniel stood tall, his smirk razor-sharp.

"Who gave you the right to lay a hand on her?"
###Chapter 439

The tension in the room became palpable, thick enough to choke on. Dominic couldn't believe Nathaniel had actually struck him.

But Nathaniel was his golden goose now, so Dominic bit back his fury. He swallowed his pride like bitter medicine.

"Did you bring the cash?" Dominic asked, keeping his voice steady despite the storm brewing inside him.

Nathaniel's reply came ice-cold. "Every last cent. But I want an exchange - one for one."

Dominic smirked. "Fine, one for one. But you only get one person."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Explain."

"We agreed to an exchange, but never specified both. A hundred million buys one life," Dominic sneered, his grin twisting like a knife.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Name your price."

"Mr. Falcon, that's not how this works. Pick one - your ex-wife or your mistress. The other stays with us," Dominic taunted, his laughter devoid of warmth.

Harrison's face went pale. She hadn't anticipated this cruel twist - being forced to watch Nathaniel choose between her and Isabella.

Isabella immediately began pleading, her voice trembling. "Nathaniel, you'll choose me, won't you? My heart condition... I can't take much more of this. Please get me out of here."

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to Isabella before locking onto Harrison.

Harrison met his eyes, her voice quiet but firm. "Mr. Falcon, if I begged you... would you pick me?"

She wasn't stupid. Of course she wanted to leave. She carried Nathaniel's child now. Would that change anything? If she asked for his help, would he choose her over Isabella?

Nathaniel's brow furrowed, but he remained silent.

Dominic's voice cut through the heavy air. "Mr. Falcon, I'll count to three. Choose fast, or you get nothing. One... Two..."

Isabella cried out again, desperate. "Nathaniel! Remember your promise! You swore you'd take me with you! You vowed to always protect me!"

The countdown was nearly over.

Nathaniel's voice rang out, calm and final. "I choose Isabella."

He'd made his decision. Isabella.

Harrison wasn't entirely shocked. Nathaniel had never chosen her when it came down to it.

Still, hearing the words aloud felt like a knife to the heart.

Her hand instinctively moved to her stomach as she thought of their unborn child. Not even born yet, and already abandoned by its father.

He'd left them both behind.

Dominic barked out a laugh. "No hesitation at all! Take your precious Isabella and go."

With a sharp gesture, he signaled his men to untie Isabella.

The moment she was free, Isabella leapt up and rushed to Nathaniel. "I knew you'd pick me! My legs won't hold me - carry me!"

She batted her eyelashes dramatically.

Nathaniel scooped her up without hesitation.

Isabella beamed up at him. "Let's get out of this hellhole."

Nathaniel cast one last glance at Harrison before turning and walking out with Isabella in his arms.

He was leaving.

Leaving with Isabella.

Harrison's lips twisted into a bitter smile.

Dominic stepped forward, grabbing Harrison's chin roughly. "See that? You're the discarded one. Mr. Falcon doesn't want you anymore. Now you're ours to play with."

Harrison jerked her face away, breaking his grip.

Dominic chuckled darkly. "Still got some fight left? Let's see how long that lasts."

He lunged at her.

Outside, Nathaniel set Isabella down and turned back toward the building.
###Chapter 440

Isabella froze for a split second before grabbing Nathaniel's arm in a panic.

"Where do you think you're going?"

His voice was steel. "Back inside. Harrison is still in there."

"You're seriously going back for her?"

Nathaniel yanked his arm free. "I won't abandon her."

Without hesitation, he turned and strode away.

Isabella chased after him, desperation clawing at her throat. "Nathaniel, my chest hurts! I think I'm going to collapse!"

But no matter how loudly she cried out, Nathaniel didn't stop. His steps never faltered.

Inside the warehouse, Nathaniel found Scarface and his men sprawled across the floor, groaning in pain. Harrison was gone.

He hauled Scarface up by his collar. "Where is she?"

Scarface clutched his burning eyes. "She escaped! That witch must've freed herself—threw some kind of powder in our faces. Damn it, I can't see!"

The men writhed on the ground, completely incapacitated.

Nathaniel's gaze snapped to the open window. She must have climbed out.

He pulled out his phone, dialing with sharp movements. "Clean this up. And find Harrison—now."

At the hospital, Isabella was met by Victoria, Margaret, and Penelope.

Victoria clutched her daughter's hand. "Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine, Mother."

"And Harrison?"

Isabella gritted her teeth. "She got away."

What?

Victoria stiffened. This entire kidnapping had been their plan. They'd paid Scarface a fortune to stage it—force Nathaniel to choose, humiliate Harrison, and ultimately take her heart.

They'd even arranged for Scarface to have his way with her first.

Yet somehow, Harrison had slipped through their fingers.

Victoria's expression darkened. "She escaped? Where is she now?"

Isabella shook her head. "No idea. Nathaniel has people searching, but they haven't found her yet."

Outside, Nathaniel stood rigid in the hallway as Dominic approached quietly.

"Still no sign of Ms. Harrison. She didn't return to Rosewood Manor."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Where would she go? "Keep looking."

"Yes, sir."

Harrison had managed to flee alone. On her way back, she stumbled into Oliver, who had come searching for her.

Oliver's voice was laced with concern. "Are you alright?"

Harrison pressed a hand to her stomach, her face ghostly pale. "I'm fine."

"Why are you holding your stomach? What's wrong?"

She opened her mouth to answer—then her vision blurred, and she crumpled.

"Harrison!" Oliver caught her just in time, scooping her into his arms and carrying her back to his estate.

When Harrison woke, she was lying in a lavish bedroom. Oliver sat beside her.

"You're pregnant," he said softly. "And you went into shock. You need rest."

Harrison sat up slowly, her expression troubled. As a doctor, she knew exactly what had happened.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. The baby was still there.
Harrison sat up slowly. "I'm fine. Both the baby and I are okay."

She would never let any harm come to her unborn child. The kidnapping had merely shocked her system.

Oliver studied Harrison with concern. "You're carrying Nathaniel's child. He doesn't know?"

A bitter smile twisted Harrison's lips. "You saw what happened today. When forced to choose between me and Isabella, he didn't hesitate for even a second. What would telling him accomplish? I'll raise this child alone."

Oliver sighed, recognizing the deep hurt in Harrison's eyes. Though unspoken, Nathaniel's choice had clearly shattered her.

Just then, Gabrielle and Rosalind burst into the room. They rushed to Harrison's side, hands immediately going to her still-flat stomach.

"How's the little one? Everything alright?"

Harrison managed a small smile. "Perfectly fine."

Gabrielle's face darkened. "That bastard Nathaniel! Has he completely lost his mind? Choosing that scheming Isabella over his own child? Sweetheart, when this baby comes, we'll make sure they never acknowledge that worthless father of theirs!"

Rosalind's expression mirrored Gabrielle's fury. "This time Nathaniel has gone too far. I'm calling him right now to give him a piece of my mind."

Harrison grabbed her wrist. "Don't. Isabella's already gloating about being chosen over me. If you call to yell at him, it'll just humiliate me further."

Gabrielle and Rosalind exchanged frustrated glances but reluctantly agreed.

"Forget about him! That scumbag isn't worth your tears. You've got us - this baby will have the most amazing godmothers in the world."

Harrison nodded, a genuine smile finally appearing as she cradled her stomach. "Exactly. We don't need someone like him in our lives."

With her closest friends surrounding her, Harrison felt some of the weight lift from her shoulders. Their unwavering support worked like magic.

Oliver suddenly smirked. "I had someone investigate Scarface. Care to guess who he really is?"

Harrison's sharp gaze met Oliver's. "I don't know his identity, but I'm certain Isabella paid him handsomely."

Oliver raised an eyebrow. "How did you figure that out?"

A cold laugh escaped Harrison. "I know Isabella too well. If this had been a real kidnapping, she'd have been terrified. But she seemed almost... amused by the whole situation. And when Scarface forced Nathaniel to choose between us? That confirmed everything."

Oliver nodded. "Spot on. Scarface was Isabella's hired thug. The entire kidnapping was her little production."

Harrison's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Well, her show's over now. It's my turn. Oliver, contact Nathaniel. Tell him business kept me from dinner, but I'll be visiting Isabella at the hospital tomorrow."

Oliver grinned. "Consider it done. Tomorrow should be... interesting."

Yes, tomorrow would be very interesting indeed.
###Chapter 441

Evelyn sat up slowly. "I'm fine. Both the baby and I are okay."

She wouldn’t let anything happen to her child. The shock of the kidnapping had overwhelmed her, but now, she was steady again.

Nathaniel studied Evelyn with a serious gaze. "You're carrying Dominic's child. He doesn’t know?"

A bitter smile curved her lips. "You saw it yourself. He didn’t hesitate for a second when forced to choose between me and Sophia. What’s the point of telling him? I can raise this child alone."

Nathaniel exhaled, understanding the depth of Evelyn’s pain. Though she hadn’t voiced it, Dominic’s choice had cut deep.

Just then, Cassandra and Gabrielle rushed in, their hands immediately hovering over Evelyn’s stomach.

"How’s the baby? Is everything alright?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Everything’s fine."

Cassandra scowled. "Dominic’s lost his damn mind! Abandoning his own child for Sophia? When this baby’s born, they’ll never call him 'Dad.' Let him rot with Sophia in hell!"

Gabrielle’s expression darkened. "This time, he’s gone too far. I’m calling him right now—"

Evelyn grabbed her wrist. "Don’t. Sophia’s gloating because she won. If you call and scream at him, it’ll just humiliate me further."

Cassandra and Gabrielle exchanged glances before reluctantly nodding.

"Forget him! That bastard isn’t worth your tears. The baby will have two godmothers who adore them."

Evelyn’s fingers brushed her still-flat stomach, a genuine smile finally breaking through. "Exactly. We don’t need a man like him."

With her best friends beside her, the weight on her chest eased. Their support was the only comfort she needed.

Nathaniel smirked. "I had someone dig into Scarface. Want to guess who he is?"

Evelyn’s sharp gaze locked onto his. "I don’t know his name, but I’m certain Sophia paid him well."

Nathaniel raised a brow. "How’d you figure that out?"

A cold laugh escaped her. "I know Sophia. If she’d really been kidnapped, she’d have been hysterical. But she looked amused—like she was watching a show. And when Scarface forced Dominic to choose? That confirmed it."

Nathaniel nodded. "You’re right. Scarface was hired by Sophia. The whole kidnapping was her little performance."

Evelyn’s lips curled. "Her show’s over. Now it’s my turn. Nathaniel, contact Dominic. Tell him I had urgent business and couldn’t make dinner, but I’ll visit Sophia at the hospital tomorrow."

Nathaniel grinned. "Consider it done. Tomorrow’s going to be… interesting."

Oh, it would be.

Nathaniel hesitated. "By the way, Dominic’s been searching for you. Do you want to talk to him?"

Cassandra snapped, "No! Where was he when she needed him?"

Gabrielle crossed her arms. "Let him keep looking. He doesn’t deserve an answer."

Meanwhile, in the hospital room, Sophia clung to Dominic, whimpering about chest pains and begging him not to leave.

Just then, Michael entered, his expression grim. "Mr. Rossi, we still haven’t found Ms. Evelyn. No trace of her anywhere."

Dominic’s jaw tightened, frustration etching deep lines between his brows.

Where the hell had Evelyn gone?

###Chapter 442

Isabella scoffed. "Harrison must be aware you're searching for her, and she's intentionally avoiding you. What a calculating woman!"

Margaret added, "Mr. Falcon, don't trouble yourself about Harrison. She's perfectly safe."

Dominic observed the indifferent members of the Whitmore family and questioned whether Harrison truly shared their bloodline.

Dominic then announced, "Mr. Falcon, I have excellent news."

Nathaniel fixed his gaze on him. "What news?"

"Dr. Sinclair just reached out. The doctor couldn't attend last night's banquet due to an emergency but will visit the hospital first thing tomorrow morning to examine Ms. Isabella."

Isabella's eyes sparkled. "Truly? Dr. Sinclair is coming tomorrow to treat me?"

Margaret beamed. "This is extraordinary! I'm certain Dr. Sinclair can cure Isabella's heart condition."

Penelope chimed in, "I was devastated when the doctor missed the banquet. But now—"

"I can't believe Dr. Sinclair will be here tomorrow! This is miraculous!"

Victoria clutched Isabella's hand excitedly. Isabella's heart condition had long been her greatest concern, but with Dr. Sinclair's arrival, hope blossomed.

Mention of Dr. Sinclair made Nathaniel's jaw tighten. The doctor had stood him up repeatedly. If this appointment fell through, his patience would snap.

"Tomorrow morning," Nathaniel declared, "I'll finally uncover Dr. Sinclair's true identity!"

At dawn, Margaret, Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria were already dressed. Anticipation about Dr. Sinclair's visit had robbed them of sleep. Now they paced the hallway, eyes darting toward the elevators.

"Where is Dr. Sinclair? I can't wait any longer. Why the delay?"

Nathaniel stood motionless in the corridor when Dominic whispered, "Mr. Falcon, Dr. Sinclair has arrived."

A procession of white-coated senior physicians approached with commanding presence.

"Dr. Sinclair! Dr. Sinclair is here!"

Isabella, Penelope, and Victoria froze, breath caught in their throats as they stared at the advancing figures.

Then a slender silhouette emerged at the group's forefront, pristine lab coat fluttering as she led the procession toward Isabella.

Isabella's eyes bulged, her body locking in shock.

Margaret gasped, "Harrison?"

Penelope shrieked, "Why is Harrison here?"

Victoria's brows shot up. "What's Harrison doing with these doctors?"

Nathaniel stood equally stunned by Harrison's sudden appearance.

As Harrison neared, Isabella screeched, "Harrison, explain yourself!"

The hospital's deputy director immediately reprimanded, "Mind your tone! Do you realize who you're addressing?"

Harrison raised a palm, silencing the deputy.

Margaret looked bewildered. "What does he mean?"

Penelope narrowed her eyes. "Harrison, what game are you playing? We're waiting for Dr. Sinclair. Why are you here?"

Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "You've been waiting for Dr. Sinclair. Well, she's arrived."

Victoria frowned. "Explain yourself."

Harrison tapped her name badge meaningfully. "Read this."

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to the identification: Dr. Sinclair.

Harrison was Dr. Sinclair!
###Chapter 443

Isabella's eyes locked onto Harrison's name tag, which unmistakably displayed "Dr. Sinclair" in bold letters.

Her breath hitched audibly.

The shock rendered her speechless as she gaped at Harrison, her mind refusing to process what she saw.

"Dr. Sinclair? Harrison, you're... Dr. Sinclair?"

Margaret, Penelope, and Victoria all noticed it simultaneously. Their jaws dropped in perfect unison, staring at Harrison as if witnessing an impossible apparition.

"Harrison, who exactly are you?"

Harrison arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow, her composure unshaken. "Weren't you all desperately searching for Dr. Sinclair? Well, here I stand. Dr. Sinclair is me."

What?!

Harrison was Dr. Sinclair?!

Isabella, Penelope, Margaret, and Victoria stood frozen, their minds blank with disbelief. This revelation shattered every assumption they'd ever made about Harrison.

Isabella recovered first, her voice trembling. "This can't be real! You're lying! Harrison, you're impersonating Dr. Sinclair, aren't you?"

Penelope shook her head violently. "How could you possibly be Dr. Sinclair? The miracle doctor? You've been nothing but Nathaniel's housewife all these years!"

Victoria's frown deepened. "If you were truly Dr. Sinclair, you wouldn't have lived so obscurely. This has to be some kind of trick!"

Margaret remained silent, her world tilting on its axis. Could this overlooked granddaughter actually be the renowned physician she'd been seeking? If true, what did that say about Isabella and Penelope - the granddaughters she'd proudly paraded as the Whitmore family's crown jewels?

Compared to Harrison, they weren't just inferior - they were utterly insignificant.

Had she discarded a priceless diamond while clinging to worthless pebbles?

No!

Margaret refused to accept this.

The vice dean stepped forward from behind Harrison, his voice cutting through the tension.

"Enough! This is Dr. Sinclair! Ms. Isabella, she's the only physician capable of treating your cardiac condition. Isn't this what you've been begging for? Your miracle doctor stands before you, ready to save your life."

Isabella staggered backward, her mind reeling. Never in her wildest nightmares had she imagined Harrison could be Dr. Sinclair - the very person who held her survival in their hands.

The expressions on their faces were nothing short of priceless.

Harrison's piercing gaze swept across each stunned face before curving her lips into a serene smile.

"Isabella, you kept demanding my presence. Now that I'm here, you don't seem pleased. That's quite alright. If my services aren't wanted, you're welcome to find another physician."

"I... I..." Isabella stammered, her voice failing her.

Harrison didn't wait for her to respond. With measured steps, she approached Nathaniel, her voice steady.

"Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel stood imposingly in the corridor, his tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders. The dim lighting caught the sharp angles of his jawline. Harrison moved toward him with effortless grace, her white lab coat pristine against her dark hair pulled into a sleek ponytail. The delicate curve of her neck and the quiet confidence in her posture commanded attention.

Nathaniel's breath hitched. His mind went blank.

The Whitmore family wasn't the only one stunned—he was too.

Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined Dr. Sinclair would be Harrison.

The woman he'd been searching for relentlessly, the one who kept slipping through his fingers, had been right beside him all along.

It was Harrison. Always had been.

Dominic's voice broke the silence. "Ms. Harrison, I can't believe you're Dr. Sinclair!"

A knowing smile played on Harrison's lips. "Surprise."

She turned back to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon."

Harrison extended her hand.

Nathaniel hesitated before reaching out. Her fingers felt delicate in his, almost ethereal. The brief contact sent a jolt through him, but she withdrew before he could process it.

The loss of contact left him strangely disoriented.

Harrison continued, her tone professional. "We've collaborated before. You're offering a substantial fee for my expertise in treating Ms. Isabella, yet now that I'm here, she's questioning my credentials. Perhaps we should reconsider this arrangement."
###Chapter 444

The moment Harrison stopped speaking, Isabella stepped forward.

"That's not what I meant..."

Harrison's sharp gaze locked onto Isabella. "Then explain yourself. Do you expect me to treat you?"

Isabella went silent, words failing her.

A sly smile curled Harrison's lips. "I could help you. But you'll have to beg."

She was making Isabella grovel.

Isabella's face paled.

Harrison knew her too well. Isabella had always looked down on her, believing herself superior. The revelation that Harrison was Dr. Sinclair had shattered Isabella's pride.

Forcing her to lower her head and plead was worse than death—it was humiliation beyond measure.

The discomfort wasn't just Isabella's. Margaret, Victoria, and Penelope all shifted uneasily, their expressions darkening.

Harrison's eyes gleamed with amusement as she studied them. "You're the ones who need me now. Begging requires sincerity. Isn't that what you taught me?"

Victoria's face flushed with anger. "Harrison, watch your tone!"

Harrison tilted her head. "Or what? You could always let Isabella die."

"You're a doctor! You have a duty to save lives! How can you say such things?" Margaret cried.

A duty to save lives?

Harrison took two deliberate steps forward, stopping inches from Margaret. "Anyone else can say that to me. But you? You lost that right the day my father died."

Margaret's face drained of color. Her heart pounded. Did Harrison know?

Harrison savored the horror in Margaret's eyes. She wasn't in a hurry. This was just the beginning.

She had all the time in the world to play with them.

"You wanted to see me. Now you have. The offer stands, Isabella. Beg, and I'll treat you. Otherwise, I'm leaving."

With that, Harrison turned and walked away, her stride confident and effortless. Isabella's face twisted with fury.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella's voice was desperate as she turned to him.

Nathaniel didn't spare her a glance. He strode forward, catching up to Harrison in long, purposeful steps.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella stomped her foot in frustration.

Margaret groaned. "Is Harrison really Dr. Sinclair? My god! Harrison is Dr. Sinclair!"

Penelope stood frozen, shock gripping her. She had always been the proudest of the Whitmore family. Never had she imagined Harrison could be Dr. Sinclair.

Meanwhile, Victoria felt like she might choke on her own rage. Even after exiling Harrison to the countryside, she had still risen to greatness.

Her bloodline was terrifying—something beyond human control.

"Mother, what do we do now? We have to ask Harrison for help! And look—Nathaniel is following her!"

Before, Nathaniel had been like them, dismissing Harrison as nothing more than a housewife with a useless degree.

Now that her true identity as the miracle doctor was revealed, it was a brilliance that made any woman shine.

No man could resist a woman of extraordinary talent.

Isabella felt the danger creeping in. Nathaniel was slipping away—like sand through her fingers, no matter how tightly she tried to hold on.

Nathaniel finally reached Harrison. "Harrison."

She stopped and turned. "Yes?"

He hesitated. "We need to talk."

Harrison arched a delicate brow. "Sorry. I have a major surgery soon. No time. If you want to speak, book an appointment through my assistant."
###Chapter 445

Harrison told Nathaniel to schedule an appointment if he wanted to speak with her.

Nathaniel's striking features darkened instantly. No one had ever dared make him wait for an appointment. Harrison was the first.

"You'll have to excuse me."

With that, Harrison walked away with her entourage, leaving Nathaniel standing there, frozen.

He could only watch, his expression icy.

Dominic approached cautiously. "Mr. Falcon, perhaps I could arrange a meeting through Ms. Harrison's assistant?"

Nathaniel shot him a sharp glare.

Dominic held up his hands in defense. "Before, she was just Ms. Harrison. Now, she's Dr. Sinclair—the miracle doctor, a legend in medicine. Even the wealthiest have to wait for an audience. This isn't personal, Mr. Falcon."

The more Dominic explained, the worse Nathaniel's mood became.

"If you can't speak properly, don't speak at all," Nathaniel snapped.

Dominic fell silent.

Just then, Nathaniel's phone rang—Alistair calling.

He answered immediately. "Alistair, did you know about Harrison's identity from the start?"

Alistair chuckled. "So you finally figured it out! Why the accusation? Dr. Sinclair was your wife. You didn’t know, and now you're blaming me?"

Nathaniel had no response.

Alistair added, "Oh, right—she's not your wife anymore. You're divorced."

Nathaniel stood there, stunned. Had everyone turned against him today?

"I'm hosting a dinner for Dr. Sinclair tonight. You should come," Alistair continued.

Now that Harrison had revealed herself, Alistair, as her apprentice, had arranged the gathering.

Nathaniel exhaled. "Fine. I'll be there."

At the Whitmore residence, Nathaniel stood with Alistair, surrounded by towering figures from academia and medicine.

They smiled at Alistair. "Who would've guessed Dr. Sinclair is so young? Such achievements at her age—she must be extraordinary."

Alistair beamed. "Yes, I never imagined Harrison was my mentor. A Westfield genius with an innate gift for medicine."

He glanced at Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, you must be the most shocked here, hm?"

Nathaniel's mood was sour. He gave Alistair a cool look. "You seem thrilled."

Alistair grinned. "Of course! Dr. Sinclair is my mentor. If you were still her husband, I'd have to address you differently. That would complicate things, wouldn’t it?"

Nathaniel had no reply.

Alistair smirked. "Regretting it now?"

Was he? Nathaniel wasn’t sure.

A sudden stir erupted nearby. "Dr. Sinclair is here!"

Nathaniel looked up—and there she was.

Harrison.

Tonight, she wore a sleek black gown, her dark hair loosely tied with strands grazing her pale neck, ethereal and untouchable.

Beside her, Rosalind glowed in white, youthful and radiant.

Together, they commanded the room.

"Ms. Harrison." Alistair stepped forward to greet her.

Harrison and Rosalind approached, and Alistair introduced her to the guests.
###Chapter 446

Harrison offered a graceful nod.

Nathaniel watched, realization dawning. This was why she always called Alistair by his first name—he was her apprentice.

Harrison was Dr. Sinclair.

"Dr. Sinclair, after Westfield, you went to Santorina to develop a plague vaccine. Then you vanished. What happened?"

"Yes, you disappeared for three years. What were you doing?"

The crowd was fascinated.

Harrison smirked. "I got married."

"Married? To whom?"

Her piercing gaze briefly met Nathaniel's before she looked away. "At the time, he was a vegetable."

"A vegetable? You married a man in a coma?"

She smiled. "He's perfectly healthy now."

Nathaniel's chest tightened. She had saved him.

He had always wondered how he recovered when even doctors gave up on him. Isabella had left, but Harrison stayed—married to him for three years.

Now he knew. It was her.

"You must be very happy together," someone remarked.

Harrison laughed lightly. "Actually, we're divorced."

Shocked murmurs erupted. "Why? He must be insane!"

She shrugged. "It's in the past."

Rosalind linked arms with her. "Exactly. His loss."

She shot Nathaniel a pointed look.

The crowd buzzed. "That man had no idea how lucky he was."

Alistair chuckled. "Plenty of worthy men would be honored to have her attention. Right, Mr. Falcon?"

Nathaniel had nothing to say.

"Mr. Falcon, perhaps you could introduce her to someone suitable?" Rosalind teased.

Before he could answer, she added, "Just joking. Dr. Sinclair has suitors lined up from here to Francais. No help needed."

Nathaniel stood there, the target of their amusement.

As the crowd dispersed, he approached Harrison. "Thank you."

She arched a brow. "For curing your coma?"

He nodded.

Rosalind scoffed. "That's all? When you were a vegetable, Isabella ran, but Harrison stayed. Dr. Sinclair gave up her career for three years—for you."
###Chapter 447 

Nathaniel finally understood.

He gazed at Harrison, voice low. "Harrison—"

She cut him off, turning to Rosalind. "Let's go."

But Nathaniel caught her wrist—and she winced.

He frowned. "What's wrong?"

Rosalind yanked his hand away. "Remember the kidnapping? She was injured. Badly. But of course, you chose Isabella and left her behind."

Nathaniel stood silent.

Harrison met his eyes calmly. "It's fine. I'm used to it."

His chest ached.

"Between us, Isabella was always your choice," she said softly. "I was always left behind."

The pain in his chest sharpened.

"I'm sorry. Isabella once saved my life," he admitted.

Harrison blinked. That was new.

"So you repay her, but forget me?" She laughed bitterly. "I saved you too."

Nathaniel froze. "When?"

Her eyes narrowed. "Years ago. That forest. You were badly injured."

His breath caught. How did she know?

He stepped closer. "Did Isabella tell you?"

Harrison shook her head. "I was there."

What?

Before he could ask more—

"Nathaniel!"

Isabella approached, arm slipping possessively through his.

Behind her came Margaret, Penelope, and Victoria of the Whitmore family.

Harrison smirked at Isabella's territorial display.

Then Alistair strolled over. "Ah, Penelope. Meet Dr. Sinclair—my mentor. That makes her your grand-mentor."

Penelope's face drained of color.
###Chapter 448

The tension in the room was palpable as Harrison stood frozen, her heart pounding against her ribs.

Nathaniel's dark eyes bore into hers, unreadable as always.

Isabella smirked from her perch on the armchair, twirling a strand of her perfectly styled hair.

"You always were too naive, Harrison," she drawled, her voice dripping with condescension.

Harrison clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

The betrayal cut deeper than she could have imagined.

Nathaniel remained silent, his expression giving nothing away.

Gabrielle had warned her about this.

She should have listened.

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly, each second stretching into eternity.

Harrison took a shaky breath.

"Was any of it real?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, but he didn't answer.

Isabella laughed, the sound sharp and mocking.

"Of course not," she said, rolling her eyes. "Did you really think someone like him would ever love someone like you?"

Harrison flinched as if struck.

The truth was a knife twisting in her gut.

She had been a fool.

A pawn in their twisted game.

Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice cold and detached.

"It's over, Harrison."

Those three words shattered what was left of her heart.

She turned on her heel and fled, tears blurring her vision.

The grand doors of Rosewood Manor slammed shut behind her with finality.

Outside, the rain poured down in sheets, mirroring her devastation.

Harrison didn't look back.

She couldn't.

Not when every memory was now tainted with lies.

The sleek black car idling at the curb was her only escape.

Sebastian leaned against it, his expression grim.

"I tried to warn you," he said quietly as she approached.

Harrison didn't respond.

There was nothing left to say.

She slid into the passenger seat, her entire body numb.

As the car pulled away, she caught one last glimpse of Nathaniel through the rain-streaked window.

He was still standing there, watching her leave.

And for the briefest moment, she thought she saw something flicker in his eyes.

Regret?

Pain?

Or was that just another illusion?

Harrison closed her eyes, letting the darkness swallow her whole.

The game was over.

But the war had just begun.
Harrison's lips curved into a subtle smile as she addressed Alistair. "I've been told for some time that Penelope is one of your most promising students."

With effortless grace, Harrison settled into the plush chair, her piercing gaze locking onto Penelope. "By academic hierarchy, Penelope should technically be my grand-apprentice. Therefore, I'd like her to serve me wine."

She sat regally at the center of attention, her expression a perfect balance of amusement and challenge as she observed Penelope's reaction. The younger woman felt her carefully constructed pride crumbling under Harrison's calculated words.

"Very well. Bring the wine," Alistair commanded.

A maid appeared moments later with an ornate decanter. Alistair turned to his student. "Penelope, serve Dr. Sinclair her wine. And address her properly as 'Grand-mentor'."

Penelope stood frozen, her limbs refusing to cooperate.

Harrison's smile turned predatory. "Why the hesitation? Come here."

A guest nearby chuckled. "Penelope, having Dr. Sinclair as your grand-mentor is an extraordinary honor. Don't keep her waiting."

Margaret and Victoria stood silently behind Penelope, their faces drained of color, clearly too intimidated to intervene.

With visible reluctance, Penelope accepted the crystal glass and approached Harrison. "Dr. Sinclair, your wine."

Her voice wavered dangerously, barely containing her humiliation.

Harrison recalled Penelope's previous arrogance and cruelty. Instead of accepting the glass, she tilted her head. "Is this how you show respect? When that imposter pretended to be me, I tried warning you, but you wouldn't listen. At minimum, you should bow while offering the wine."

She commanded the gesture with icy precision.

Penelope's vision blurred with unshed tears, the sting of public humiliation cutting deeper than any physical wound. The prestigious image she'd cultivated for years disintegrated under Harrison's quiet dominance. She'd become nothing more than a cautionary tale.

Why was fate so cruel?

Her lips trembled as she slowly lowered herself, her pride in tatters. Forcing her spine to bend, she bowed before Harrison.

The glass shook in her hands as she raised it. "Grand-master, your wine."

Margaret, Isabella, and Victoria watched in stunned silence, their complexions matching the white tablecloths. Harrison's gaze remained frosty yet controlled.

"As physicians, we must practice humility alongside our skills. Arrogance inevitably leads to downfall. Remember - there will always be someone more capable, and excessive pride invites correction. Let this be your lesson."

Each word struck like a scalpel's edge. Penelope's tears fell freely now, each droplet marking another piece of her shattered dignity.

Twenty years of cultivated superiority evaporated under Harrison's merciless scrutiny.

She was no longer the accomplished professional - just a humiliated spectacle.

Why? Why her?

Penelope's whisper cracked. "I understand."

Finally, Harrison accepted the glass, taking a measured sip. "You may go."

Penelope straightened mechanically and retreated to the periphery.

A guest suddenly noticed Margaret. "Mrs. Whitmore! Isn't Dr. Sinclair your granddaughter? You must be so proud to have such an exceptional physician in the family."

Margaret could only manage a strained smile, her silence more telling than any response.

For years, she'd considered Isabella and Penelope the Whitmore family's crowning achievements. Yet standing beside Harrison, they appeared utterly insignificant by comparison.

Yes, Harrison was remarkable - but she wasn't truly a Whitmore.

Another guest recognized Victoria.

"Mrs. Whitmore! This makes Dr. Sinclair your daughter. How did you manage to raise someone so extraordinary?"

"Mrs. Whitmore, your genetics must be exceptional! Share your secrets with us!"
###Chapter 449

The elite crowd gathered around Margaret and Victoria, their eyes filled with admiration for raising such an extraordinary woman like Harrison.

Tonight's gala was packed with high society's finest - exactly the kind of attention Margaret had always craved. She lived for these moments, basking in the spotlight, surrounded by envy and admiration.

For years, Margaret had pinned her hopes on Isabella and Penelope. She'd dreamed of Isabella marrying Nathaniel and Penelope wedding Dr. Sinclair, believing these alliances would elevate her status.

But now, what her favored granddaughters failed to achieve, Harrison accomplished effortlessly.

Margaret stood as the object of everyone's envy.

Yet the victory tasted bitter.

Her forced smile barely masked her discomfort.

Beside her, Victoria clenched her fists, her smile more painful than tears.

Harrison's gaze locked onto them, lips curling into a knowing smirk.

"Don't bother asking them for advice. I've severed all ties with the Whitmore family."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Why would you cut ties with your own family?"

Harrison rose gracefully, the chandelier's glow illuminating her elegant figure as she approached Margaret and Victoria.

"As you may know, I grew up in a remote village. The Whitmores didn't raise me - peasants did."

Whispers erupted. "That's right, she was exiled to the countryside as a child. By her own mother, no less."

"What kind of mother does that?"

"Mrs. Victoria remarried her late husband's brother, becoming Isabella's stepmother. Disgusting, isn't it?"

Victoria's face burned with humiliation. Nothing stung more than having her past dragged into the light.

Harrison knew exactly where to strike.

"Everyone knows Mrs. Whitmore is my biological mother. Yet she married my uncle, bringing his daughter Isabella into our home. There was no place left for me."

She paused dramatically.

"Of course, every woman deserves love. But how many would abandon their own child to dote on another woman's daughter?"

Rosalind Fairchild chuckled, turning to Victoria. "Mrs. Whitmore, you're in your forties, yes? Who knew middle-aged women could simp so hard?"

Laughter erupted. The crowd's stares turned venomous.

"What kind of monster abandons her child for a man?"

"Harrison became Dr. Sinclair despite her mother. The irony!"

Victoria became the night's spectacle, her face ashen with rage.

Isabella glared daggers at Harrison. First Penelope's humiliation, now this public shaming.

She couldn't stay silent.

"Harrison, you've always resented Mother. But she invested everything in me!"

Isabella clung to Nathaniel's arm, flaunting her prize.

"Isn't that right, darling?"

All eyes turned not to Isabella, but to the powerful man beside her.
###Chapter 450

Nathaniel, the most powerful man in Willowbrook, could make the world bend to his will with just a snap of his fingers. With him standing beside her, Isabella felt invincible - certain no one would dare speak against her now.

The whispers in the room died instantly.

Victoria smirked at Harrison. "Harrison, I know you hate me, but surely you wouldn't let Isabella die, would you?"

Isabella immediately played along. "Harrison, you know about my heart condition. Nathaniel paid you a fortune to treat me, yet you refused. You wanted to watch me suffer, didn't you? How heartless can you be?"

Their well-rehearsed performance was flawless, perfectly framing Harrison as the villain.

Harrison had seen through their scheme the moment they walked in.

Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "Isabella, do you really not know why I refused?"

Isabella's face twisted into fake innocence. "What did I ever do wrong? I was just a child back then! Why punish me for Victoria's mistakes? I'm completely innocent in all this."

"Innocent?" Harrison's voice cut like ice. "You hired those kidnappers to kill me, didn't you?"

Isabella froze.

How did Harrison know?

A mocking smile played on Harrison's lips as she glanced between Victoria and Isabella. "You thought I wouldn't find out? You orchestrated the whole kidnapping. You wanted me dead!"

Gasps filled the room.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he turned his piercing gaze to Isabella. "Isabella, is this true?"

Isabella shook her head frantically. "She's lying! Don't believe her! Harrison, you can't just make up accusations! Where's your proof?"

Victoria immediately jumped to her daughter's defense. "Harrison, I understand you're angry, but don't make baseless accusations! Isabella would never do something so terrible!"

Just then, Oliver entered dramatically. "Bravo! What an Oscar-worthy performance!"

The crowd parted as Oliver strode confidently to Harrison's side.

He addressed Nathaniel directly. "Mr. Falcon, have you ever wondered why those kidnappers took both Harrison and Isabella? Why make you choose between them? Doesn't that seem suspicious to you?"

Nathaniel's steel-gray eyes locked onto Isabella, sending chills through the room.

Isabella shivered under his intense scrutiny.

Oliver produced a USB drive. "This contains bank records between Isabella and the lead kidnapper. The truth is all here."

As Oliver handed the drive to Nathaniel, Isabella snatched it away. "You can't see that!"

Nathaniel's voice turned deadly calm. "Why not? This is your last chance to confess. The consequences will be far worse if I discover the truth myself."

Fear coiled in Isabella's chest. She'd been so certain their plan was foolproof, that Harrison would die in that warehouse and take their secrets to the grave.

Why was Harrison still alive?

Harrison met Isabella's panicked gaze with icy certainty. "The truth always comes out, Isabella. You're the mastermind behind everything!"
###Chapter 451

Isabella's face drained of color, her hands trembling visibly.

She shot a desperate glance at Victoria.

Without missing a beat, Victoria moved forward. "It wasn't Isabella! I did it! I was the one who contacted that scar-faced man and orchestrated the entire kidnapping!"

Harrison stared at her mother in disbelief. This desperate attempt to shield Isabella revealed everything.

Victoria had willingly thrown herself into the fire to protect her favorite.

A bitter laugh escaped Harrison's lips. Was this twisted devotion what passed for maternal love?

Why?

Harrison was Victoria's flesh and blood, yet she'd always treated Isabella like royalty. What had Harrison done to deserve such betrayal?

The sting of maternal rejection never lessened, no matter how many times it happened.

Gasps filled the room as all eyes turned to Victoria.

"You?"

Rosalind's voice shook with rage. "Mrs. Whitmore, Harrison is your actual daughter! You hired criminals to abduct her and wanted her dead? Have you lost your mind?"

Victoria hadn't anticipated the truth surfacing. Isabella's involvement couldn't be exposed - it would ruin her reputation and destroy any chance with Nathaniel. Sacrificing herself was the only option.

"Harrison," Victoria pleaded, "I'm still your mother. Please let this go."

"Mother?" Harrison's voice dripped with venom. "You and Margaret disowned me long ago. Staying your daughter would've gotten me killed!"

"Harrison considered you family, and you wanted her dead. What kind of monsters are you?" Rosalind added.

The murmurs grew louder.

"What kind of mother does this? Hiring thugs to kidnap her own child while spoiling another woman's daughter?"

"Blinded by obsession... It's sickening."

Victoria's stomach churned with fury, but she maintained her composure. The game was over, and she'd lost everything.

Harrison turned to Isabella. "You really think that flash drive has evidence?"

Isabella froze, fingers tightening around the stolen device. "What do you mean?"

Oliver smirked. "Isabella, Mrs. Whitmore, you've been played. That drive's empty. There's nothing on it."

What?

Isabella and Victoria gasped in unison, their faces draining of color.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Oliver. "Mr. Falcon took the kidnapper. I'm certain he's already interrogated him thoroughly but found nothing. Yet when I brought up the flash drive, Mr. Falcon, you didn't call my bluff. We owe you thanks for playing along with our little charade."

Isabella staggered back, her wide eyes fixed on Nathaniel. "Is this true? You knew the flash drive was empty all along?"

Nathaniel met her shocked expression with calm certainty. "Yes, I knew."

When Nathaniel had arranged for Scarface's capture, he'd left no stone unturned. Every bank account, every transaction had been scrutinized.

So when Oliver mentioned transaction records on the flash drive, Nathaniel instantly recognized the lie. Oliver had been bluffing, using a fake flash drive to trap Isabella and Victoria.

This time, they'd covered their tracks meticulously. But they'd underestimated opponents like Oliver and Nathaniel. The moment they made their move, both men had seen through them.

Isabella's composure shattered. She whirled on Nathaniel. "Whose side are you on? Why are you conspiring with outsiders against me?"

Harrison let out a derisive laugh. "Conspiring? Mrs. Whitmore claimed she did this for you. Why are you so defensive now?"

"Exactly, Isabella!" Rosalind chimed in. "If you were truly innocent, why didn't you immediately condemn Mrs. Whitmore for hiring thugs to kidnap Harrison? Instead, you attacked Mr. Falcon. That speaks volumes. Your claims of ignorance aren't convincing anyone!"
###Chapter 452

All gazes locked onto Isabella.

"It's clear that Mrs. Whitmore and Ms. Isabella conspired to murder Dr. Harrison!"

"Thankfully, Dr. Harrison is the renowned physician Dr. Sinclair. Otherwise, she would've been dead ten times over by now."

"Honestly, Isabella has no shame. She stole someone else's mother, family, and home... What more does she want? Why does she still insist on harming Dr. Sinclair?"

"Some people are just rotten to the core."

The words cut deep. Isabella's stomach twisted. She realized tonight, Harrison had masterfully trapped her in a web of deception.

Nathaniel's disappointed stare bore into her, crushing her under its weight. "Why would you do this? You've truly let me down."

He barely recognized the woman before him. Was this the same girl who had once cared for him in that cave?

Isabella opened her mouth to explain. "I—"

But Harrison stepped forward, silencing her. "Now you understand why I refused to treat you. I'm no saint. Why should I save someone who wants me dead?"

Isabella stood frozen, speechless.

Harrison turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, now that you know Isabella tried to kill me, do you still expect me to save her?"

Panic surged through Isabella. She couldn't let this chance slip away. She grabbed Nathaniel's arm, desperation in her voice. "Nathaniel, please! Save me!"

His lips pressed into a thin line, his expression icy.

Harrison smirked, her tone dripping with mockery. "Isabella, if you want me to save you, then beg. I want you on your knees."

Penelope had already bowed. Now, Harrison demanded Isabella grovel. This would be far more entertaining.

Victoria's face paled with fury. "You expect Isabella to kneel? You—"

"Oh, how touching," Harrison sneered. "You really do love her, don't you?"

Victoria fell silent.

Harrison's sharp gaze pinned Isabella in place. "This is your only chance. Kneel and beg, or walk away."

Isabella would never kneel. To her, Harrison was nothing. Why should she lower herself?

Desperate, she turned to Nathaniel. "I won't beg! She's gone too far. Nathaniel, help me!"

He was her last hope.

Victoria and Margaret rushed to Nathaniel's side, pleading. "Mr. Falcon, Isabella is your fiancée! Are you really going to let her humiliate herself in front of all of Willowbrook's elite? Think of your reputation!"

Nathaniel remained silent, his face unreadable.

Isabella's panic spiked. She couldn't decipher his thoughts. The pressure was suffocating.

She couldn't do it. She wouldn't.

"Nathaniel," she pleaded, clutching his sleeve. "You promised. You swore you'd protect me. You haven't forgotten, have you?"

His gaze softened slightly, but his voice was cold. "I've allowed too much. Look what you've become. If I keep enabling you, who knows what you'll do next? I won't let you destroy yourself."

Isabella's breath hitched. "Nathaniel... are you saying—?"

He turned to Harrison, his tone final. "If Dr. Sinclair wants you to kneel, then kneel."

###Chapter 453

Isabella gasped, certain she'd misheard.

Nathaniel had just ordered her to grovel before Harrison!

She staggered back, nearly collapsing, but Victoria caught her.

"Mr. Falcon!" Victoria cried, voice trembling. "How could you do this? You're letting Harrison humiliate her!"

Nathaniel's icy glare silenced her. "And you? Isn't Harrison your own daughter? Explain your actions."

Victoria flinched, speechless.

Harrison's piercing eyes locked onto Isabella. "Well? I don't have all night."

Rosalind smirked. "If you don't kneel now, next time, you'll have to beg just for the chance."

Isabella's face drained of color.

Harrison didn't wait. "Seems you've made your choice. Let's go, Rosalind."

They turned to leave.

Isabella's fists clenched. "Fine!" she shouted. "Harrison, I'll kneel!"

Harrison paused, turning back.

And then, in front of Willowbrook's elite, Isabella dropped to her knees.

Tears burned in her eyes, humiliation searing through her. This was her greatest shame. "Harrison... please. Save me."

She had begged.

Victoria's heart shattered. Her hatred for Harrison reached its peak.

Margaret wailed, "Our family is ruined! Completely ruined!"

She had prided herself on raising two shining stars—only for Harrison to destroy them both.

Harrison looked down at Isabella, a cruel smile curling her lips. "I never said I'd save you."

Isabella froze. "You—!"

"I told you to kneel," Harrison said coolly. "I never promised anything in return."

Victoria yanked Isabella up. "Harrison, you monster!"

Harrison's chilling gaze swept over Margaret, Victoria, Isabella, and Penelope.

"Who killed my father?" Her voice was steel.

The question struck like a blade.

"In three days," Harrison continued, "at his grave, I want every person responsible to confess. Kneel before him. Turn yourselves in."

Margaret and Victoria paled. In Harrison's eyes, they saw death.

"You think tonight was the end?" Harrison's voice dropped to a whisper. "No. This is just the beginning. You've trampled on my father's grave for years, living in luxury. Now—you'll pay for it."

With that, she turned and walked away, her silhouette vanishing into the night.

Margaret and Victoria knew the truth.

Harrison had declared war.

The dinner ended. Nathaniel stepped outside—only for Margaret, Victoria, and Isabella to rush to him.

"Mr. Falcon!" Margaret cried. "Will you really let Harrison destroy us?"
###Chapter 454

Isabella stared at Nathaniel with wounded eyes, unshed tears glistening in them, silently begging for his comfort.

Nathaniel remained stone-faced. His voice was icy when he spoke. "How did Benjamin really die? Which one of you in the Whitmore family is responsible?"

Victoria and Margaret exchanged uneasy glances, their expressions darkening.

Nathaniel didn't wait for an answer.

Dominic pulled up in a sleek black Bentley. Nathaniel stepped inside, and the car sped away.

Back at the Whitmore estate, an oppressive silence filled the grand halls. Margaret sat rigidly on the sofa, surrounded by shattered remnants of her prized antique vases.

The maids stood frozen in the corners, not daring to breathe too loudly.

The entire Whitmore family had gathered—every branch, every relative. None dared miss this meeting.

Margaret's rage still simmered. "Useless. Every single one of you. None of you can compare to Harrison."

"She grew up in the countryside, yet she's a genius from Westfield. She's Dr. Sinclair. If she had been my granddaughter, our family would have ruled Willowbrook by now!"

"Now she's trampling over us, and we can't fight back. Because you're all incompetent!"

Theodore and Frederick had rushed back from the office, still reeling from the revelation—Harrison was the renowned Dr. Sinclair.

Frederick hesitated. "Harrison is Dr. Sinclair?"

Theodore exhaled sharply. "Apparently so."

The memory of groveling before that imposter made their stomachs churn. Harrison must have been laughing at them the entire time.

Margaret's scowl deepened. "What now? Harrison is coming for us. She wants the truth about Benjamin's death. She wants the killer to confess."

Penelope, anxious, turned to her grandmother. "Who really killed Uncle Benjamin?"

Neither Isabella nor Penelope had known the truth.

Margaret scoffed. Benjamin had been nothing but an adopted son. Theodore and Frederick were her blood.

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "The poison that killed Benjamin was delivered by Victoria herself. He fought back, but Theodore and Frederick held him down. Victoria forced his mouth open, and I poured it in. We all played our part."

"What?!"

Isabella and Penelope recoiled in horror.

Margaret's tone softened slightly as she recalled that night. "It was storming. Benjamin struggled until his last breath. Even as the poison took hold, he was calling Harrison's name. His eyes never closed."

Even now, Theodore, Frederick, and Victoria couldn't escape the nightmares.

Harrison had asked if they'd ever been haunted by Benjamin's ghost.

The answer was yes.

Frederick's voice was thick with guilt. "Benjamin loved Harrison more than anything. We thought sending her away would bury the past. But she came back for revenge."

Theodore sighed. "If Harrison succeeds, our family is finished. There's no way out of this."

###Chapter 455

Isabella and Penelope were paralyzed, struggling to process the horrifying truth.

This wasn't grief for Benjamin—they'd never cared for him.

This was fear.

Penelope's hands trembled. "You killed him! What do we do now? Harrison is demanding justice. Our family is doomed!"

Isabella collapsed onto the couch, dizzy. "How did this happen? She's coming for us, and you're the murderers! Do you think she'll stop until we're all destroyed?"

Penelope shook her head. "Harrison isn't the same anymore. She's Dr. Sinclair now. She's untouchable."

Isabella clutched her chest, panic rising. "What do we do? My condition is worsening. If Harrison refuses to treat me, I'm as good as dead!"

For them, survival was the only concern.

The Whitmore family was in shambles. No one had expected Harrison to become this powerful.

Why did she have to be Dr. Sinclair?

Margaret turned to Isabella sharply. "We need Nathaniel's help. You must convince him."

The mention of Nathaniel made Isabella's jaw tighten. "Grandmother, you saw how he treats me. He won't help us."

Margaret's frustration boiled over. "What happened to the Whitmore family's pride? You're all worthless compared to Harrison! I should have kept her by my side years ago."

Isabella's eyes burned with tears, crushed under the weight of her grandmother's scorn.

Theodore and Victoria took her home. The moment she sat down, she broke into sobs.

"Mom, Dad, what do I do? Nathaniel's heart belongs to Harrison now. I'm losing him—and my health is failing. I can't lose everything!"

Once, Isabella had been Nathaniel's golden girl, the prima ballerina who stood above all. She'd looked down on Harrison, but now the tables had turned. Harrison was unstoppable, and Isabella was powerless.

Victoria pulled her into a tight embrace. "Don't be afraid, Isabella. You still have me."

She turned to Theodore desperately. "Say something! Look at her—she's falling apart! You have to help her!"

Isabella looked up with swollen eyes. "Mom, do you really think Dad can fix this?"

Victoria nodded firmly. "If he wants to, he can."

Isabella grabbed Theodore's arm. "Dad, please! I'm your real daughter. I can't lose everything. Help me!"

Theodore's heart ached. He would do anything for Isabella—she was his world.

He placed a hand on her shoulder. "No one loves you more than I do. I'll help you. Just give me time to think."

###Chapter 456

Isabella nodded, desperation lacing her voice. "Okay, Dad. Please hurry."

"Don't worry. Get some rest. I'll handle everything," Theodore reassured her.

With that, Isabella retreated to her room.

Theodore and Victoria returned to theirs. After a quick shower, Victoria climbed into bed. Theodore joined her moments later.

Victoria turned to him, serious. "Theodore, you have to help her."

Theodore sighed. "How?"

Victoria's voice turned urgent. "Contact that man from the Capital. Once he steps in, Harrison is nothing. Compared to him, she's just an ant waiting to be crushed."

Theodore hesitated. "But her birth mother didn't want her past revealed. She didn't want Isabella going back."

Victoria grew frantic. "She's in danger now! Without the Capital's power, we're finished. Besides, what's so bad about going back? She could be one of the most powerful women there!"

Theodore needed time. He hadn't forgotten Isabella's biological mother's dying wish, but Harrison had backed them into a corner.

He glared at Victoria. "Look what you've done! How did Harrison become this strong? It's like she could destroy us with a snap of her fingers!"

Victoria flinched but stayed silent.

"Do you really hate her that much?" she asked.

"Of course I do! Anyone who threatens Isabella is my enemy!"

Victoria smiled slyly. This was exactly what she wanted.

If Theodore knew the truth—that Harrison was the one he was supposed to protect—she couldn't imagine his reaction.

Victoria had obsessed over Theodore for years. In her eyes, no one else mattered.

She leaned in, pressing against him. "Honey, it's been so long since we've been close. Don't you miss it?"

Her fingers trailed under his shirt.

Theodore pulled away sharply. "Not now. Too much is happening. Let's just sleep."

He turned his back to her.

Victoria lay there, fists clenched.

Not in the mood?

She knew about the women he kept around—especially that secretary with eyes like hers.

Victoria hated that woman.

Just like she hated Harrison.

She wanted them all gone.

Especially Harrison.

She wanted her dead.

Nathaniel returned to Rosewood Manor but didn't enter his apartment. Instead, he stood outside Harrison's door, his expression unreadable.

Since discovering she was Dr. Sinclair, he hadn't spoken to her properly.

He raised his hand and pressed the doorbell.
###Chapter 457

Nathaniel pressed the doorbell.

The apartment door opened swiftly, revealing Harrison's elegant silhouette. "Who is it—Mr. Falcon?"

Her eyes locked with Nathaniel's. She'd changed into a flowing home dress, her earlier glamorous makeup now washed away. Her natural beauty shone through—dewy skin glowing in the soft evening light.

She looked completely different from the dazzling woman at the dinner party.

"Got a minute?" Nathaniel asked.

Harrison's fingers twitched nervously. "What do you need? Just say it."

Before Nathaniel could respond, a familiar voice called from inside. "Who's there, Harrison?"

Nathaniel's gaze lifted to see Oliver standing in the apartment.

Oliver stood casually in slippers, crunching into an apple. "Mr. Falcon, what brings you here?"

Nathaniel's words stuck in his throat. He hadn't expected Oliver to be here.

Harrison's expression shifted slightly. "Well? If there's nothing else, I'm going back inside."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he glanced past her. "Just you and Oliver in there?"

"Is that so strange?" Harrison countered sharply.

The air grew thick with tension. Nathaniel's aristocratic features turned icy.

Just then, Rosalind poked her head out from the kitchen. "Harrison! The food's about to burn!"

Gabrielle's voice joined in. "Hurry up!"

Nathaniel remained stone-faced as he processed the voices. It wasn't just Oliver—Rosalind and Gabrielle were there too.

Yet this realization didn't ease the tension. Seeing Oliver so comfortable with Harrison's closest friends suggested they spent time together often.

Oliver offered a polite smile. "Mr. Falcon, we're cooking dinner. Have you eaten? You're welcome to join us."

Nathaniel, who'd rushed back hungry to find Harrison, opened his mouth to accept.

Harrison cut him off. "No, he won't be joining us." She turned to Nathaniel, voice firm. "We're having dinner now. Goodbye."

With that, she shut the door firmly in his face.

Nathaniel stood frozen for a moment. Then a self-deprecating smile touched his lips before he turned toward his own apartment.

His empty apartment echoed with silence, illuminated only by the soft glow of city lights through floor-to-ceiling windows. Tall and lean, he stood staring at the urban landscape.

He pulled out his phone and opened Rosalind's social media. A new post appeared:

[Harrison cooked for us! So many amazing dishes! Wish I had three stomachs!]

The accompanying photo showed a lavish spread of mouthwatering dishes. Harrison, Oliver, Rosalind and Gabrielle were clinking glasses, all smiles.

Nathaniel studied the photo intently, his fingers tightening around the phone.

A cold draft swept through the room, accentuating the quiet night. It only deepened the mysterious aura around his handsome features.

Suddenly, he remembered how long it had been since he'd tasted Harrison's cooking.

She was an exceptional chef—something Nathaniel knew well. After waking from his three-year coma, he'd needed extensive rehabilitation.

Throughout that time, Harrison had prepared his meals daily, patiently waiting for his return home each evening.
###Chapter 458

Nathaniel could never forget the night Harrison first mentioned divorce. It had been his birthday, and she'd prepared an extravagant dinner, waiting patiently for his return.

Things he'd once taken for granted had vanished, leaving behind an emptiness that gnawed at him, accompanied by a dull ache.

Perhaps this was the regret that only surfaces when you lose what truly mattered.

He raised his glass, taking slow sips of the warm water. The liquid spread its comforting heat through his mouth before sliding lazily down his throat.

Before, he never knew Harrison was Dr. Sinclair. If she was such a renowned physician, why had she entered his life?

She'd taken that photo with him at Westfield.

After his accident left him comatose, she'd disappeared from public view, withdrawing from the world to marry him - even cooking for him daily. How deep must her love have been?

Nathaniel combed through his memories, searching for any encounter before that photo was taken. Nothing came to mind. They'd never met before.

So...when had she developed feelings for him? What had sparked that devotion?

He desperately wanted to ask her.

There was an unshakable feeling that some significant event connected them, something from long ago that had slipped his mind.

His tall, striking figure carried an air of solitude now, his sharp features softened by melancholy.

Harrison was having dinner when Oliver asked, "What did Mr. Falcon want with you earlier?"

She took a bite of lobster, her expression unreadable. "No idea."

Gabrielle chimed in, "Mr. Oliver, don't waste your breath on that man. Besides Isabella, women flock to him everywhere he goes. He snaps his fingers and they come running. Harrison should stay far away." Rosalind, firmly on Harrison's side, added, "Exactly! Harrison's Dr. Sinclair - people would kill just to meet her! Yet she cared for him for three years. He was the luckiest man alive and didn't even appreciate it!"

Harrison lifted her glass. "Let's not discuss him. Right now, I only care about avenging my father. A toast."

"To justice!" they chorused.

"Harrison, that's definitely milk you're drinking, right? You're pregnant - no alcohol," Gabrielle reminded.

Harrison smiled softly. "Don't worry. I wouldn't."

Her hand rested gently on her still-flat stomach, tracing slow circles. She cherished this child more than anything.

This was her baby, and she would pour all her love into it.

After nearly an hour by the floor-to-ceiling windows, Nathaniel spotted Rosalind and Gabrielle leaving Harrison's apartment building.

His brow furrowed. Oliver was missing.

Why wasn't Oliver coming down?

If Rosalind and Gabrielle had left, did that mean Oliver was staying the night with Harrison?

Nathaniel immediately dialed Rosalind's number.

Downstairs, she answered. "Hello?"

His voice was icy. "Why just you two? Where's Oliver?"

Rosalind arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Oliver? He's not coming down. He's staying with Harrison tonight."

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the phone.

Rosalind continued, "Why so surprised? They're a couple now. Isn't it normal for them to stay together?" Then she added pointedly, "You could always go find Isabella. After all, you made your choice clear - picking her over Harrison, abandoning both her and the baby!"

The word "baby" struck Nathaniel like a physical blow, triggering an instinctive reaction.

"What baby?" he demanded, his voice strained.
###Chapter 459

Rosalind's stomach dropped as she stood downstairs.

Oh no. She'd definitely said too much.

Anger had clouded her judgment earlier. She'd wanted to defend Harrison, especially feeling protective of the unborn child. In her fury, the words had spilled out unchecked.

"You must have misheard!" she blurted into the phone. "I never mentioned a baby."

Nathaniel's grip on his phone tightened. "You specifically said I abandoned Harrison and our baby. Rosalind, what aren't you telling me?"

Guilt prickled at her. Thank goodness this was a phone call - Nathaniel would see right through her terrible poker face. "I told you, you misheard. No baby talk here. Why? Suddenly interested in children?"

The question caught Nathaniel off guard, silencing him.

"Exactly. You hate kids. I've got things to do. Bye." Rosalind ended the call abruptly.

Standing alone in his penthouse, Nathaniel stared at the disconnected line, brow furrowed. He knew what he'd heard.

Could it be true? Was Harrison pregnant?

A memory surfaced - Harrison once asking if he liked children.

His watch showed midnight. Oliver was staying at her place tonight. What were they doing right now?

Nathaniel turned on his heel and stormed out, heading straight back to Harrison's apartment.

The doorbell rang.

Oliver answered, looking annoyingly handsome and relaxed. "Mr. Falcon," he said without surprise. "Back so soon? Looking for Harrison?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Where is she?"

"Showering," Oliver replied casually.

Nathaniel's hands clenched into fists. "It's late. Why are you still here?"

Oliver smirked. "Late for you to be visiting your ex-wife, don't you think? I'm her boyfriend now - my presence makes sense. Yours? Not so much."

A cold smile twisted Nathaniel's lips. "She may be your girlfriend now, but she was my wife first. I'll visit whenever I damn well please."

Oliver countered, "You'll be interrupting our private time if you stay."

Nathaniel shot back, "I know every inch of Harrison's body. Nothing you do will be new to her."

Their verbal duel escalated, each barb sharper than the last.

Finally Oliver said, "Exactly. Ex-wife. Past tense. Over."

Nathaniel snapped, "Our relationship status is none of your concern. Don't you have your own life to meddle in?"

A soft voice interrupted. "Who's there?"

Nathaniel looked up to see Harrison freshly showered, wrapped in a champagne silk robe. Steam had pinkened her delicate cheeks, her skin glowing. She looked heartbreakingly beautiful.

Her eyes widened at the sight of him. "What are you doing here?"

"Excellent question," Oliver chimed in.

Harrison crossed her arms. "If you need something, say it now."

Nathaniel pushed past Oliver and grabbed Harrison's wrist firmly.

"We need to talk. Now."
###Chapter 460

Nathaniel pulled Harrison along with brutal force.

She stumbled over her own feet, panic lacing her voice. "Let me go! Where are you taking me? I refuse to go with you!"

He gave no response, just dragged her out of the penthouse and shoved her into the waiting elevator.

Oliver stood frozen in shock, watching Nathaniel's domineering display. "Hey! What the hell—"

The elevator doors slid shut before he could finish, cutting off his protest.

Left standing alone, Oliver could only stare at the closed metal doors.

Nathaniel hauled Harrison down to the underground garage, forcing her into his Bentley.

She fought like a wildcat, nails scratching at his arms. "Have you lost your mind? Where are we going? I said I'm not coming!"

He yanked open the passenger door, his piercing gaze dropping to her midsection. "What aren't you telling me?"

Harrison froze. "I don't know what you're talking about."

His eyes burned into her flat stomach. "Are you carrying my child?"

Her breath hitched. How did he find out?

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Is it mine?"

Her mind raced. He'd discovered her plan to keep the baby without him.

What would he do? Force her to terminate the pregnancy?

The child shared his DNA after all.

She couldn't let him know. Shaking her head violently, she lied, "I'm not pregnant."

Nathaniel studied her face, his gaze razor-sharp. "Is that so?"

"Of course!" She forced confidence into her voice. "We ended things months ago. There's no way I'd be pregnant with your child. Now let me go."

She turned to leave.

Nathaniel grabbed her wrist, spinning her around and shoving her into the leather seat. "I don't believe you. We're going to the hospital. I want a doctor to confirm it."

Her pulse skyrocketed.

As Nathaniel slid behind the wheel, Harrison pleaded, "I swear I'm not pregnant! Just believe me!"

His cold smirk sent chills down her spine. "If I find out you stole my DNA to have my child behind my back, you'll regret it."

She blinked rapidly. "I'm telling the truth!"

A sudden sneeze escaped her.

The garage was freezing, and she wore only a silk nightdress. Harrison shivered violently. "I'm freezing. Can't this wait until tomorrow?"

Without a word, Nathaniel shrugged off his tailored jacket and threw it at her face.

The expensive fabric smelled of his signature cologne, still warm from his body heat. She yanked it off her head, glaring daggers at him.

"You're unbelievable. Do you really think I'd want anything of yours?"

###Chapter 461

Harrison fired back with a razor-sharp retort.

Nathaniel started the engine, the luxury car gliding effortlessly onto the road. His powerful hands gripped the steering wheel as he turned slightly, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips.

"How would I know you weren’t trying to steal them? Plenty of women would kill to have my children. I can’t take chances with you."

Harrison was speechless.

The man was insufferably arrogant.

But then again, Nathaniel had the kind of arrogance that was backed by undeniable power.

Shivering from the cold, Harrison knew she couldn’t risk getting sick while pregnant. Reluctantly, she slipped into his black suit jacket.

The jacket swallowed her petite frame. "Your genes might be impressive, but mine aren’t exactly lacking. Others might want yours, but I certainly don’t."

Nathaniel’s thoughts flickered. Of course, her genes were just as exceptional. She was Westfield University’s prodigy, the renowned Dr. Sinclair—her genetic potential was on par with his, if not superior.

For a fleeting second, he wondered what their child might be like.

But he dismissed the thought just as quickly.

"We’ll find out at the hospital."

Clearly, he wasn’t backing down. Harrison realized arguing was pointless. She stopped resisting and let him take her to the hospital.

Half an hour later, the Rolls-Royce pulled up in front of Vitalis Health. Harrison glanced at the building, surprised he’d chosen this place.

"Let’s go," he commanded.

"Mr. Falcon, why here?"

Nathaniel arched a brow, his expression unreadable. "I know the director. I don’t trust other hospitals—especially with you being Dr. Sinclair. I wouldn’t put it past you to fake the results."

He’d thought of everything.

Harrison laughed. "What makes you think I can’t fake them here too?"

"Vitalis Health is a massive, publicly traded corporation. It spans healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment. You can’t manipulate it—the owner is just as powerful as I am."

Harrison smirked, mischief glinting in her eyes. "Do you know the owner?"

Nathaniel’s mind flashed to the striking woman he’d seen in Willow Heights, Americana. Her poised elegance had left an indelible mark.

"I’ve met her once."

Only once?

Harrison blinked. "Where?"

Nathaniel shrugged. "Willow Heights. When Vitalis went public. She rang the opening bell at midnight. I saw her from behind, but she didn’t see me."

Ah. That explained why she didn’t remember. He’d been there that night.

Fate had a strange sense of humor.

Harrison stepped closer, her face inches from his. "Are you in love with the owner of Vitalis?"

Nathaniel froze. "What?"

"Why else would you still remember her after all these years? One glimpse of her back, and she’s stuck in your head? Then again, there aren’t many women in business who could stand beside you."

Nathaniel studied her. Teasing, playful, her eyes sparkling with mischief—she reminded him of that unforgettable woman from Vitalis. For a moment, the two images blurred together.

He reached out, pinching her soft cheek. "Are you jealous?"

Harrison didn’t understand why he kept doing that.

Slap!

She swatted his hand away. "Don’t pinch me."

Nathaniel smirked. "Don’t pinch you where?"
###Chapter 462
Harrison froze for a heartbeat before realizing Nathaniel had just made an inappropriate joke. The unexpected remark caught her completely off guard.

Her cheeks burned crimson. "You're absolutely vile!"

Nathaniel strode ahead with his long legs, casually entering Vitalis Health while muttering, "What exactly was vile about that? Seems like your mind's always in the gutter."

Harrison was rendered speechless.

This man appeared so refined and put-together, yet beneath that polished exterior lurked the most shameless person she'd ever met.

Refusing to continue this embarrassing conversation, Harrison followed him inside. Almost immediately, Lawrence Pembroke, the director of Vitalis Health, came rushing over, clearly startled. "Mr. Falcon, what brings you here at this hour?"

Lawrence wasn't on duty tonight. He'd been summoned by Nathaniel's call and had rushed over from home.

Nathaniel replied smoothly, "I brought someone for a pregnancy test."

Lawrence's eyebrows shot up. "Who might that be?"

Nathaniel stepped aside slightly, allowing Harrison to come forward. "Her."

Lawrence's eyes widened dramatically, his pupils dilating as he sucked in a sharp breath. "Y-You..."

Nathaniel's gaze turned sharp. "You know Harrison?"

Lawrence stammered, "I-I..."

While Lawrence was visibly flustered, Harrison remained perfectly composed. "No, we've never met." Beads of sweat formed on Lawrence's forehead as his mind raced. Both Harrison and Nathaniel appearing at Vitalis Health simultaneously without warning? He'd been caught completely unprepared.

Nathaniel spoke again, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Dr. Pembroke, prepare the pregnancy test forms immediately."

Lawrence snapped to attention. "Right away, sir. Please follow me to my office."

Nathaniel led the way into the director's office. When he turned, he noticed Lawrence hovering around Harrison like an anxious shadow, his deferential manner suggesting he feared she might somehow injure herself.

"Ms. Whitmore, please, right this way."

Nathaniel, receiving no such attention, frowned deeply.

The world was becoming increasingly bizarre—one he no longer recognized. Why was Lawrence treating Harrison with such reverence?

Harrison walked ahead calmly. "Dr. Pembroke, just give Mr. Falcon the forms as he requested. I'm only here for the pregnancy test."

Lawrence nodded eagerly. "Of course, right away."

He quickly prepared the necessary documents.

Nathaniel reached for them, but Lawrence had already moved to Harrison's side. "Ms. Whitmore, the blood draw station is this way. Allow me to escort you."

Without a second thought, Lawrence began guiding Harrison away, seemingly having forgotten Nathaniel entirely, leaving him standing there.

Only when Harrison turned back did she remember Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, aren't you coming?"

Noticing Nathaniel standing silently, Lawrence slapped his forehead. "Right! Mr. Falcon, this way please."

Nathaniel's irritation grew.

The entire situation felt unsettlingly peculiar.

Harrison finally spoke up. "Dr. Pembroke, just give the forms to Mr. Falcon. He'll accompany me personally—that's the only way he'll be satisfied."

"Of course." Lawrence handed the documents to Nathaniel with both hands.

Nathaniel took them, then turned to Harrison. "Let's go."

As they walked away, Lawrence wiped his brow, his mind spinning. The big boss was here—with Nathaniel Falcon no less—for a pregnancy test?

Could Harrison Whitmore actually be pregnant?

If so, he couldn't begin to imagine what kind of extraordinary child the union of these two powerhouses might produce.

Whoever was born into that family would undoubtedly be a force to be reckoned with.
###Chapter 463

Harrison sat stiffly in the clinic chair, glaring at Nathaniel.

"I refuse this blood test."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto hers. His voice held an edge of steel. "The choice is yours. But if you decline, I demand honesty. Are you carrying my child or not? Deception in this matter won't be tolerated."

Her chin lifted defiantly. "I'm not pregnant."

A muscle twitched in his jaw. "Very well. Proceed with the blood draw."

Harrison's nails dug into her palms. "I've told you the truth, yet you still insist? What exactly do you want to hear? Should I fabricate a pregnancy to satisfy you?"

Nathaniel ignored her outburst. He turned to the flustered nurse. "Draw the blood now."

The young nurse's cheeks pinkened under his attention. "Sir, could you help your wife roll up her sleeve?"

"Wife?" Harrison scoffed. "We're not married."

The nurse blinked in confusion. "But... this is a pregnancy test?"

Harrison's mouth snapped shut. She had no rebuttal.

Before she could react, Nathaniel's long fingers brushed against her arm, rolling up her sleeve with clinical precision. "Begin," he ordered.

Harrison turned her face away, jaw clenched.

Nathaniel studied her pale profile. "Needle phobia?" When she remained silent, his lips quirked. "Odd for a physician to fear bloodwork."

She refused to dignify that with a response.

Suddenly, his large hand cradled the back of her head, guiding her face against his chest. His heartbeat thundered beneath her cheek.

"Close your eyes," his deep voice rumbled.

She stiffened, but his grip tightened. "Don't move."

Trapped, Harrison inhaled his expensive cologne - sandalwood and something uniquely Nathaniel. The scent enveloped her as the needle pierced her skin.

Later, in the sterile hallway, Harrison perched on a bench while Nathaniel loomed over her like a storm cloud.

She met his gaze head-on. "Mr. Falcon, this entire farce was unnecessary. I told you - no pregnancy."

His expression remained unreadable. "I'll believe the results."

Just then, Lawrence hurried over, clutching a lab report. "Ms. Whitmore's results are ready."

Nathaniel snatched the paper.

"Negative," Lawrence confirmed.

The document clearly stated Harrison wasn't pregnant. She rose gracefully, a sardonic smile playing on her lips. "Satisfied?"

As Dr. Sinclair's protégé, Harrison had taken precautions before arriving. A carefully administered injection ensured the test would read negative.

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the report. Relief? Disappointment? He couldn't decipher the strange void in his chest.

This was the desired outcome. Children complicated everything. So why did this confirmation leave him... unsettled?

"Are we done here?" Harrison's voice sliced through his thoughts.

Nathaniel's mask slipped back into place. "Yes."

Lawrence bowed deeply. "Safe travels, Mr. Falcon, Ms. Whitmore."

Back in the Rolls-Royce, Harrison stared out the tinted window. "Take me home."

Nathaniel's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel as the car surged forward toward Rosewood Manor. "Is Oliver staying with you tonight?"

Her smile was razor-sharp. "He bought the apartment. As my boyfriend, that's his privilege, isn't it?"
###Chapter 464

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tense silence. "So, are you two planning to share a bed tonight?"

Harrison stiffened, her fingers tightening around her purse. "I could ask you the same thing. Are you and Isabella sleeping together tonight?"

The question hung in the air, unanswered.

Her eyes flickered to his hands as he shrugged off his tailored jacket. The crisp white shirt beneath hugged his broad shoulders, the business vest emphasizing his lean frame. His steel watch glinted under the streetlights, a silent testament to his ruthless elegance.

"We're divorced now. My personal life is none of your concern."

Tires screeched as Nathaniel suddenly swerved the car onto the shoulder. The abrupt movement threw Harrison forward before the seatbelt snapped her back.

"What the hell—"

Her protest died as Nathaniel moved with predatory grace. In one fluid motion, he caged her against the seat, his hands framing her face. Then his mouth crashed down on hers.

The kiss was brutal. Possessive.

Harrison gasped against his lips, shoving at his chest. "Get off me!"

Nathaniel pulled back just enough to hover over her, their breaths mingling. Her floral perfume filled his senses. "Do you love Oliver?"

"Obviously!" The answer came too fast.

"As much as you loved me?" His voice dropped to a dangerous purr.

Harrison's lashes fluttered.

Nathaniel's smirk deepened. "You're brilliant—Dr. Sinclair herself. Yet you married me when I was comatose." His thumb traced her lower lip. "Just how desperate were you?"

The words stung like a slap.

Harrison met his gaze head-on. "I don't love you anymore."

"Really?" Skepticism laced his tone.

She opened her mouth to retort, but Nathaniel claimed her lips again. This kiss was different—all heat and demand. His tongue swept past her defenses, igniting a fire she couldn't deny.

Her fists pounded against his shoulders, but his body pinned her effortlessly. Nathaniel kissed her like a man starved—lips, teeth, tongue devouring. When his mouth trailed down her neck, Harrison gasped.

His hand slid beneath her silk dress.

Heat flooded her cheeks. "Nathaniel, stop!" She grabbed his wrist. "Get your hands off me, you bastard!"

He nipped her earlobe, his voice rough. "Your body betrays you, Harrison. Every. Single. Time."

White-hot fury surged through her veins.

Fine. If he wanted to play dirty...

Harrison fisted his hair and yanked him into a searing kiss. The sudden aggression made Nathaniel freeze—just long enough for her to take control. Her tongue tangled with his, her hands roaming his sculpted chest.

Nathaniel groaned as her nails scraped his abs.

"Tell me," she breathed against his lips. "Do you still want me?"

His pupils dilated.

Harrison smirked, parroting his earlier words. "Mr. Falcon, your body's reacting quite... noticeably."

Nathaniel chuckled darkly, tongue pressing against his cheek.

She held his gaze, unflinching. "What's so funny? You haven't answered me." Her fingers traced his jaw. "Do you still crave me or not?"
###Chapter 465

Harrison repeated her question, her voice trembling slightly as she asked Nathaniel if he had feelings for her.

Nathaniel remained silent. His large hands cradled her face gently before he leaned in to capture her lips once more.

She turned her face away sharply. "Don't!"

His grip tightened as he forced her to meet his gaze. "We're already this far, and you want to stop? Don't you want to experience what it's like in the backseat?"

The city lights illuminated Nathaniel's striking features - the perfect blend of power, wealth, and raw masculinity. His bold proposition sent heat rushing through her veins.

Harrison clenched her jaw. "I do want to try it in a car," she admitted.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with desire as he moved closer again.

But before their lips could meet, Harrison added, "Just not with you. I meant with my boyfriend, Oliver!"

Nathaniel froze. This woman knew exactly how to infuriate him.

"Harrison!" His voice turned dangerous.

She pressed her palms against his solid chest. "Why don't you go find Isabella? I'm sure she'd be thrilled to have car sex with you!"

Nathaniel's mouth formed a hard line. Despite Isabella's countless advances and attempts to stay overnight, he'd never slept with her. She held no appeal for him.

The delicate face before him was the only one he truly wanted.

"Why were you so in love with me? You said we'd met before."

This was why Nathaniel had come tonight - to uncover the truth behind Harrison's mysterious claim.

Her clear eyes met his steadily. "Yes, we've met."

"Where?"

"I already told you. Over ten years ago, when you were injured in the forest." Nathaniel's cold eyes narrowed sharply at her words.

That was where he'd first encountered Isabella.

But how did Harrison know about this?

His gaze intensified. "And then?"

"I saved you."

Nathaniel went completely still.

Harrison claimed she'd saved him? That couldn't be right.

Isabella was the one who had rescued him.

"Where exactly did you save me?" he demanded.

Harrison hadn't expected Nathaniel to have no memory of that moment. She'd revealed so much, yet he still didn't remember.

"In a cave," she answered quietly.

Nathaniel's pupils contracted violently. Could the girl from the cave actually have been Harrison?

No.

It had to be Isabella. Why would it be Harrison?

One of them was lying - either Harrison or Isabella.

But which one?

Who was truly his savior?

Harrison suddenly shoved against his chest with surprising strength. "I saved you back then, but I don't expect anything from you now. We're divorced. I just want to move on with my life. Please stay away from me. It's late - just take me home."

Her disappointment cut deep. She wasn't the type to use past favors as leverage. Since he didn't remember, she would let it go.

Nathaniel's world tilted. For years, he'd believed Isabella was the girl from the cave.

For years, he'd kept her close, showering her with privileges.

Now Harrison claimed that role. The revelation left him reeling.

He needed answers.

Nathaniel gripped the steering wheel tightly, accelerating toward Rosewood Manor.

Harrison had been unusually tired lately due to her pregnancy. She didn't speak another word, quickly falling asleep against the plush leather seat.

When the Rolls-Royce arrived at Rosewood Manor, Nathaniel noticed Harrison still slept peacefully.
###Chapter 466

Harrison's petite frame was swallowed by Nathaniel's tailored suit, her cheeks flushed with sleep's warm glow.

Nathaniel didn't disturb her. He exited the car with careful movements, gathering her into his arms like precious cargo.

As he carried Harrison toward his penthouse, Oliver emerged from the elevator. "You brought her home. Is she asleep? Let me take her."

Oliver extended his arms expectantly.

Nathaniel sidestepped him without hesitation, tightening his grip on Harrison as he strode toward his apartment door.

"Mr. Falcon," Oliver called sharply behind him.

Nathaniel paused mid-step.

Oliver's voice carried a warning. "We're grown men. If you love her, commit fully. If not, walk away. This back-and-forth between Harrison and Isabella helps no one. It's cruel."

Nathaniel remained silent.

Oliver pressed further. "Who is it - Harrison or Isabella? Answer that question. Because if you don't choose soon, I won't let you keep stringing Harrison along."

The door clicked shut behind Nathaniel without response.

Inside the master suite, Nathaniel lowered Harrison onto the king-sized bed with featherlight care.

She didn't stir, only curling instinctively into the plush bedding with a contented sigh.

Nathaniel brushed his thumb across her cheekbone, murmuring with quiet amusement, "Out cold, aren't you? Like a baby sloth."

Though asleep, Harrison wrinkled her nose at the touch, batting weakly at his hand with a drowsy protest that sounded suspiciously like "Stop."

That sleepy whimper sent heat coiling through Nathaniel's abdomen. He exhaled sharply through his nose, forcing himself to retreat to the en suite for an icy shower.

Five minutes later, Nathaniel emerged in a black silk robe, damp hair dripping onto his collarbones.

His typically austere bedroom - all monochrome angles and cold modernity - seemed transformed by Harrison's presence. The way she burrowed into his sheets softened the space, made it feel lived-in.

Something in Nathaniel's chest tightened. He slid beneath the duvet beside her.

Harrison shifted in her sleep, rolling instinctively into the curve of his body.

Nathaniel's breath caught. The familiarity of her weight against him brought back a flood of memories. Different, yet the same. She still fit against him perfectly.

He pressed his lips to her forehead. "Goodnight, Harrison."

Morning light filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows when Harrison finally blinked awake. The unfamiliar crystal chandelier overhead made her bolt upright.

This wasn't her apartment. This was Nathaniel's penthouse.

How had she gotten here?

Glancing down, she noted the oversized t-shirt she wore - clean, untouched. Nothing had happened between them.

The penthouse stood silent when she ventured out. No sign of Nathaniel.

He'd always been an early riser. Probably at Falcon Enterprises already.

Harrison exhaled in frustration. Divorced, yet still ending up in his bed. Some things never changed.
###Chapter 467

Harrison stepped into her penthouse. The moment she kicked off her heels, her phone buzzed violently.

Oliver's name flashed on the screen.

She swiped to answer. "Oliver?"

"Harrison! You're finally awake!" His voice dripped with mischief. "How was your little sleepover at Mr. Falcon's place?"

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "What do you mean Nathaniel's place?"

"He carried you there last night. Straight to his penthouse. I tried to intervene, but let's be real - I wouldn't stand a chance against him in a fight."

Harrison's breath hitched.

She must have passed out in Nathaniel's car. But why take her to his home? They weren't together anymore.

"Something brewing between you two?" Oliver probed.

"We're divorced." Her voice turned to steel. "That chapter is closed."

No more blurred lines. No more accidental closeness. Nathaniel Falcon belonged in her past.

"Fair enough. Meet me at The Velvet Lounge tonight? I've invited Dr. Pembroke. Your little surprise visit to Vitalis Health yesterday gave him quite the scare."

"See you there." She ended the call.

Across town, Nathaniel's office at Falcon Enterprises hummed with tension. Dominic stood at attention, delivering his report. "We've hit a wall, sir. That mountain cave from years ago? Completely off-grid. Only two leads remain - Ms. Harrison and Ms. Isabella."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Expected. If evidence existed, he'd have found it years ago. That's why he'd never questioned Isabella's story.

Until now.

Now, everything felt unstable.

He rose, his silhouette stark against the floor-to-ceiling windows. "Contact Isabella. Dinner tonight at The Velvet Lounge. My treat."

Dominic nodded. "Smart move. She's been calling nonstop. This will make her week."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "No warnings. No hints. I want to see who's been playing me. And when I find out..." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "There will be consequences."

Dominic hesitated. "If you had to choose... who would you want that girl to be? Harrison or Isabella?"

Nathaniel froze. The question hung between them.

Truthfully? He didn't know.

Right now, only the truth mattered.

That evening, Isabella arrived at the restaurant like a vision. Her white couture gown clung to every curve, her makeup flawless. This dinner meant everything - Nathaniel had been distant lately. This was her chance to reclaim his attention.

The maître d' seated them at a prime window table. Crystal glasses caught the candlelight as Isabella beamed across the linen. "To what do I owe this wonderful surprise?"

Nathaniel's expression softened expertly. "I've been... distracted lately. Tonight's about making that up to you."

He knew exactly how to wield his charm. Isabella melted instantly, reaching for his hand. "Just hearing you say that... I thought you'd stopped loving me."

Nathaniel enclosed her fingers in his. "Never."
###Chapter 468

Isabella's lips curved into a coy smile, her cheeks tinged pink with bashfulness.

The entrance to The Velvet Lounge swung open abruptly. Harrison and Oliver stepped inside.

Oliver's voice cut through the air. "Dr. Pembroke is expecting us. We should proceed."

Harrison moved toward the dining area but froze mid-step. Her eyes locked onto two unmistakable figures.

Following her line of sight, Oliver spotted Nathaniel and Isabella.

Their hands were intertwined, gazes locked in such tender affection it could make even the most cynical believe in love stories.

Oliver's mouth twisted into a smirk. "Quite the busy man, Mr. Falcon. Last night he carried you home, tonight he's dining with Isabella. Juggling two women - impressive skills."

He shook his head with a dry chuckle. "Didn't peg him for that type."

Harrison stared at the couple before speaking firmly. "You're wrong. He's not like that."

Oliver raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Harrison continued, "He's always loved Isabella. Always favored her. This isn't playing games."

Oliver sighed. "If you say so. Let's go in."

Harrison nodded, wrenching her gaze away, and followed Oliver into the restaurant.

Nathaniel and Isabella remained oblivious. Nathaniel released Isabella's hand, picking up his silverware with practiced elegance. As he sliced into his steak, he asked casually, "Remember our first meeting in that cave?"

Isabella's knife hovered mid-air. She looked up, startled. "Why bring that up now?"

Nathaniel's voice softened but held an edge. "Our first encounter. I've never forgotten. Have you?"

A flicker of unease crossed Isabella's eyes before she glanced away. "Of course I remember."

Nathaniel leaned forward slightly, his tone deceptively gentle.

"That remote forest. You said your parents took you hiking, but you got separated. Found me injured and dragged me to shelter."

"You tended my wounds, but vanished by morning. Your parents found you, correct?"

Isabella nodded slowly. "Yes, exactly."

What Nathaniel didn't know: Isabella had been there for darker reasons. It was right after her birthday when Harrison had called Victoria, begging for help.

Harrison had been trapped in that rural nightmare, haunted by her foster father's abuse. That call revealed Harrison's suffering - and Isabella had insisted on witnessing it firsthand.

They'd gone together. Isabella saw everything - Harrison's encounter with Nathaniel, every heartbreaking detail.

She knew it all.

The fabricated story sounded flawless. For years, Nathaniel never questioned it.

Nathaniel set down his utensils, his gaze turning piercing. "Speaking of which... whatever happened to that crystal pendant I gave you?"

Isabella's blood ran cold. This was the question she'd dreaded - her Achilles' heel. She never possessed that pendant.

It had always been with Harrison.

Isabella stammered, "_"

Nathaniel interrupted, his voice calm yet razor-sharp.

"I've asked to see it for years. Always met with excuses. Could it be... you don't have it?"

His tone remained light, but the words cut deep.

"No pendant means no proof you're the girl who saved me that day."

Isabella's mind raced. Was he doubting her now?

That pendant was her lifeline. If Nathaniel discovered the truth, she'd lose everything.
###Chapter 469

"Nathaniel, please," Isabella begged, her hands shaking as she reached for him.

His icy stare stopped her mid-motion. "Not another word. Just tell me where the pendant is."

That cruel smirk twisted his perfect lips.

"Would you dare lie to me now?"

Her breath hitched. "Lie? What are you implying?"

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "What if the girl who pulled me from that cave wasn't you? What if you've been pretending all these years?"

The chill in his gaze made her blood run cold. He'd never looked at her like this before.

Had he discovered the truth? Did he know she wasn't the one who saved him that day?

The silence stretched between them, thick with tension. She couldn't tell how much he knew.

Admitting anything wasn't an option. Her entire privileged existence depended on this lie.

"I don't understand these accusations," she said, forcing tears into her eyes. "I was the one who found you in that cave. You promised to take care of me. Don't you remember your own words?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "If it's truly you, then good. I've wasted twelve years on you. But if not..." His voice turned deadly. "You know what happens to liars."

Dominic had once asked Nathaniel who he hoped that mysterious girl might be.

The truth was, Nathaniel didn't know.

All he felt was a growing sense of dread.

He'd invested everything in Isabella. If she wasn't the one, it would prove him a fool.

And if that girl turned out to be Harrison...

His stomach twisted at the thought. He couldn't bear remembering how he'd treated Harrison.

The possibility was too painful to consider.

Isabella lifted her chin defiantly. "I swear I'm telling the truth."

"Then show me the crystal pendant. Today. That pendant is the only proof that matters."

She knew she was cornered. "Fine," she said quickly. "I have it."

Something flickered in Nathaniel's cold eyes. "Prove it."

Isabella's voice dropped to a whisper, her fingers nervously playing with the silver pendant around her neck. "I can show you, but... It's our special keepsake. Tonight, I want to see your place."

Nathaniel hesitated, his expression unreadable.

"Don't you want to see it?" she pressed, her eyes pleading.

He exhaled slowly. "Fine. Tonight. My apartment."

A relieved smile curved her lips. "Perfect."

As they stepped out of the restaurant, the evening air wrapped around them. Then, Nathaniel froze.

There, standing near the valet, was Harrison—talking to Lawrence Pembroke from Vitalis Health.

How did those two even know each other?

Isabella's sharp gasp cut through the silence. "Why is Harrison with Dr. Pembroke? Don't tell me she's after him now too?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

She scoffed, venom dripping from her words. "He's married. And wasn't she just seeing Oliver? She really has no boundaries."

Without waiting for a response, Isabella strode forward, heels clicking against the pavement. "Harrison!"

Harrison turned, her smile fading as she spotted Nathaniel and Isabella approaching.

###Chapter 470

Evelyn arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "Mr. Falcon, Cassandra. What an unexpected encounter."

Cassandra's lips curled into a sneer. "I bet you weren't hoping to see us. Afraid we'll expose whatever shady business you're up to?"

As the CEO of Crimson Bistro, Evelyn wielded considerable influence. When Benjamin heard the insult directed at her, he immediately stepped forward. "Ms. Cassandra, must you be so crude?"

"Dr. Reeves, why the protective act? Does your wife know you're dining with her?"

Benjamin stiffened, but before he could retort, Evelyn raised a hand, signaling him to stand down.

He obeyed without hesitation.

Evelyn studied Cassandra with amusement glinting in her eyes. "Sounds like you're insinuating something. Care to elaborate? Are you accusing me of misconduct with Dr. Reeves?"

Cassandra let out a derisive laugh. "Everyone knows Crimson Bistro is the leading name in the industry. Dr. Reeves, as its director, must be quite the catch. I suppose it makes sense you'd use your... charms to sway him."

Benjamin could only stare, his expression a mix of disbelief and irritation.

Cassandra pressed on, her voice sharp. "But he's married, Evelyn. Where's your self-respect? Isn't Dominic enough for you? Why go after someone else's husband?"

Evelyn wasn't surprised by the misunderstanding. A teasing smile played on her lips. "Funny how some people see filth everywhere. Says more about them than anyone else."

Cassandra's fists clenched. "You—"

Before she could finish, Alexander stepped between them, his voice cutting through the tension. "Enough."

Cassandra shot him a pleading look. "Did you hear that? She has no shame!"

Alexander's gaze locked onto Evelyn. "You had dinner with Dr. Reeves?"

Evelyn didn't flinch. "Yes. Is that a crime?"

A strange unease settled in Alexander's chest. Something felt off. "What did you discuss?"

Benjamin started to answer, but Evelyn smoothly interrupted. "Mr. Falcon, I'm a renowned surgeon. Dr. Reeves oversees Crimson Bistro. Naturally, we talked medicine."

Benjamin nodded. "Exactly. I've long admired Dr. Carter's work. Tonight was purely professional."

He turned to Cassandra with a smirk. "I'd watch that temper if I were you, Ms. Cassandra. Your heart condition is deteriorating. Without Dr. Carter's intervention, no one else can help you. Maybe you should be trying to win her favor instead of insulting her."

The words struck like a slap. Cassandra paled instantly.

Evelyn observed her coldly. Not an ounce of pity stirred in her.

The Chambers family had dug their own grave. They deserved no sympathy.
Sophia knew she couldn't count on Isabella's mercy. Her only option was to cling to Alexander's protection.

She couldn't afford to lose Alexander. Not now. Not ever.

With Alexander by her side, she'd ensure Isabella never recovered from this humiliation.

A cruel smirk twisted Sophia's lips as she suddenly announced, "Alexander, let's leave this place. Take me home."

She wrapped her slender arm possessively around Alexander's muscular one, her voice laced with triumph. "Isabella, you'll be delighted to know I'm spending the night at Alexander's penthouse."

Her words hung in the air like a poisoned dagger, aimed straight at Isabella's heart. The gleam in Sophia's eyes promised this was only the beginning of her revenge.

###Chapter 471

Harrison's pulse quickened. Tonight, Nathaniel was taking Isabella home—did that mean they'd be sharing a bed?

Isabella shot Harrison a triumphant smirk, savoring every second. "We should get going. You and Dr. Pembroke can chat as long as you like."

She turned to Nathaniel. "Let's go."

Nathaniel held Harrison's gaze for a long, silent moment before wordlessly leading Isabella away.

Lawrence watched them leave, disbelief etched across his face. "How can Mr. Falcon be so blind? Choosing someone like Isabella over you?"

Harrison smiled faintly but stayed silent. Love was complicated—Isabella might be foolish, but Nathaniel clearly still cared for her. True love, indeed.

Lawrence spoke again. "Boss, just imagine Isabella's face when she finds out you're the real CEO of Vitalis Health, the largest publicly traded healthcare corporation in the country. She'll be speechless."

Harrison could already picture it—Isabella's shock would be priceless.

"Not yet. My identity stays hidden for now."

"Understood, boss."

"I'm heading home."

"Safe trip."

Back at Emerald Heights, fate intervened—Harrison ran straight into Nathaniel and Isabella again. They had just arrived at the building.

Isabella practically glowed with satisfaction. "Spending the night alone?"

Harrison didn’t answer.

"You should wish Nathaniel and me a wonderful night," Isabella purred, her voice dripping with innuendo.

Harrison wasn’t fazed. A playful glint lit her eyes. "How amusing. I slept in his bed last night."

Isabella paled. "Y-You slept with Nathaniel?"

Harrison shrugged. "Didn’t he tell you? His bed was quite comfortable. If that bothers you, maybe you shouldn’t use it tonight."

Isabella’s temper flared. "Watch your mouth!"

Harrison smiled sweetly. "Oh, but you don’t mind, do you? You’ve always loved taking my leftovers."

Isabella’s rage burned hotter. Harrison always knew exactly how to cut deep.

She whirled toward Nathaniel. "She’s insulting me!"

Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto Harrison. Her eyes were sharp, unyielding, daring him to react.

"Mr. Falcon, you should get checked regularly. Sleeping with different women every night—you might catch something," she said lightly, though her words stung.

Nathaniel’s lips thinned in displeasure.

Isabella snapped. She lunged, hand raised to slap Harrison. "How dare you insult Nathaniel! You’ll regret this!"

But the blow never landed.

Nathaniel caught her wrist mid-air, his grip ironclad.

Isabella gaped at him. "She humiliated you! Why are you protecting her?"

Nathaniel’s expression was unreadable, his thoughts hidden behind dark eyes. He tightened his hold. "Drop it, Isabella. Don’t hurt your hand."

A smug grin spread across Isabella’s face as she turned to Harrison. "Hear that? He’s worried about me."

Harrison gave Nathaniel a dismissive glance before smirking at Isabella.

"I don’t know if he’s worried about your hand, but Isabella… as a woman, you’re a complete failure."

###Chapter 472

Isabella froze. "What do you mean?"

Harrison’s smile turned razor-sharp. "You can’t satisfy him. He’s been restless lately. Every time I even touch him, he reacts."

Isabella gasped.

Harrison didn’t wait for a response. She turned, unlocked her door, and stepped inside, slamming it shut behind her.

Left standing in the cold hallway, Isabella spun toward Nathaniel, frustration boiling over. "What happened between you two?"

Nathaniel wasn’t in the mood. He opened his apartment door. "Inside."

Isabella followed, eyes widening at the luxurious space. This was her first time here, and the opulence left her breathless.

Nathaniel’s voice cut through the silence. "You wanted to come here. Now show me the crystal pendant."

Isabella smirked, prepared. "Patience. Let me shower first. Then I’ll show you."

She disappeared into the bedroom.

Nathaniel waited, patience thinning. But he wouldn’t rush—he needed to see that pendant.

A sudden scream shattered the quiet.

Nathaniel strode to the bedroom, flinging the door open. "What happened?"

Isabella stood there, freshly showered, wearing nothing but his white dress shirt.

Her dancer’s curves were impossible to ignore, the oversized shirt only emphasizing her allure.

Nathaniel frowned. "Done? Show me the pendant."

Isabella stepped closer, barefoot on the plush carpet. "Is the pendant all you care about? Don’t I look beautiful?"

With a teasing smile, she undid the buttons. The shirt slid off, pooling at her feet.

She pressed against him, fingers trailing his chest. "Harrison said you’ve been restless. Why haven’t you come to me?"

Her body molded against his, warm and inviting.

"How did you do it with her?" she whispered, lips brushing his ear.

Nathaniel’s breath hitched.

Isabella rose on her toes, breath hot against his skin. "Did Harrison please you last night? If she won’t play, I will."

Nathaniel’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

Isabella gasped. "Nathaniel, you’re hurting me!"

He didn’t loosen his hold. In one swift motion, he threw her onto the bed.

Isabella’s vision spun as he climbed over her, knee pressing into the mattress.

Her heart raced. Tonight, she would finally have him.

Once they were together, nothing else would matter—not even the pendant.

She wrapped her arms around his neck. "Did you and Harrison sleep here last night? Tonight, it’s my turn."
###Chapter 473

Nathaniel gazed down at the alluring Isabella beneath him, his stern expression softening as he leaned closer.

Meanwhile, Harrison had returned to her penthouse. She soaked in a steaming bubble bath before changing into a silk nightdress. Just as she settled onto the plush sofa, her phone chimed with a notification.

It was a WhatsApp message from Isabella. A voice note.

Harrison tapped play. Isabella's breathy moans immediately filled the room.

"Nathaniel...not so rough...ah!"

Harrison's porcelain face remained impassive as the recording played. She hadn't expected Isabella to send such...vivid evidence of their encounter.

Apparently, Nathaniel and Isabella had already crossed that line. And Isabella wanted her to know.

Without reacting, Harrison set her phone aside and resumed reading.

Hours later, the doorbell rang.

Who could be visiting at this hour?

Harrison opened the door to find Isabella standing there, still wearing Nathaniel's dress shirt.

"Did you enjoy my little gift?" Isabella purred, leaning against the doorframe.

Harrison arched an eyebrow. "Your acting skills need work."

Isabella's smirk faltered. This wasn't the reaction she'd anticipated. "If that's all, I have things to do," Harrison said, starting to close the door.

But Isabella shoved past her, striding into the penthouse without invitation. "This is trespassing," Harrison stated coldly.

Isabella ignored her, marveling at the lavish decor. Nathaniel's penthouse had impressed her, but Harrison's was equally opulent.

"How can someone like you afford this?" Isabella spat, jealousy dripping from every word.

Harrison's glacial stare didn't waver. "Easily. Unlike you."

Isabella's face flushed crimson. "You—"

"Last warning," Harrison interrupted calmly. "Leave now, or I'll call security. Again."

The memory of being dragged out by building security with Victoria and Penelope still burned in Isabella's mind.

"Fine! I'm going!" she snapped.

As she turned, something on the side table caught her eye. Her breath hitched. There it was—the very thing she needed.

"Open the door!" Isabella demanded.

Harrison obliged, unlocking the entrance.

In one fluid motion, Isabella snatched the object from the table and slipped it into her pocket.

Harrison held the door open. "Don't come back."

Isabella sauntered out, and Harrison slammed the door behind her.

Far from upset, Isabella felt triumphant as she returned to Nathaniel's penthouse.

Nathaniel had just emerged from an ice-cold shower. He'd only pushed Isabella onto the bed before regaining control. Nothing had happened.

Frustrated by his rejection, Isabella had fabricated the voice note to make Harrison believe otherwise.

Nathaniel's patience had worn thin. "Enough games. Show me the crystal pendant."

Isabella flashed a coy smile. "So eager. Don't you trust me? Don't you believe I'm your savior?"
###Chapter 474

"Nathaniel, I've noticed something different about you lately. You've become so distant with me. Why were you with Harrison last night?"

"I tried to get close to you earlier, and you pushed me away. You want Harrison but won't even touch me. Am I really not as attractive as she is?"

The dim lighting cast shadows across Nathaniel's chiseled features, making his expression unreadable. "My patience isn't endless. If you don't show me the crystal pendant soon, I—"

"Here!"

Isabella produced the pendant with a dramatic flourish.

Nathaniel froze. There was no mistaking it - the distinctive Falcon family heirloom, one of a kind.

This was his pendant.

The girl who had saved him all those years ago... It had been Isabella all along.

Her voice trembled with hurt. "I've kept this all these years. It kills me to see how you've changed. How could you doubt me? Did Harrison say something? Did she claim she was your savior?"

"That scheming little— I pitied her and let her stay with us. When I told Mother about saving you, she must have overheard. She stole my story."

"If not for this pendant proving the truth, would you have believed her lies? A few words from her made you question everything between us?"

The revelation hit Nathaniel like a physical blow. The girl was Isabella.

Holding the pendant, Nathaniel couldn't identify the emotions churning inside him. Disappointment. Loss.

Somewhere deep, he'd hoped Harrison was the one.

His heart had already begun choosing Harrison.

And in doing so, he'd wounded Isabella.

She thrust the pendant into his hands, eyes blazing. "We're through."

Nathaniel blinked. "Isabella—"

"I loved you with everything I had, but you've broken my heart too many times. It's over! My life isn't tied to yours anymore. Go be with Harrison. Pretend I never saved you."

She dressed quickly and stormed out.

Nathaniel stood motionless, watching her disappear down the hall. Then he moved, chasing after her.

He caught her on the staircase, gripping her arm. "Isabella, listen."

She covered her ears. "No! I won't hear it! You've shattered me, Nathaniel. All your promises—forgotten."

Torn, he gently turned her to face him. "I'm sorry."

Her tear-filled eyes searched his face. "Do you still want us?"

Memories flooded him—vows made, oaths sworn. Isabella was his girl.

Nathaniel nodded. "Yes."

Tears spilled down Isabella's cheeks as relief washed over her. She threw herself against his chest. "I knew you still loved me."

Nathaniel's expression remained conflicted, emotions warring beneath the surface.

She whispered urgently, "But you can't keep wavering between us. You must choose, or we all get hurt. You've chosen me now. You won't change your mind?"

Several heartbeats passed before Nathaniel gave a firm nod. "I won't."

"Good." Hope colored her voice. "Then we'll be together forever."

In that moment, Nathaniel knew the triangle had to end. No more distractions from Harrison. Isabella deserved his full devotion.

Slowly, deliberately, he wrapped his arms around her.

The choice was made.
###Chapter 475

Nathaniel had made his choice - Isabella.

The front door swung open with a sharp creak. Harrison stood frozen in the doorway.

Their heated argument had carried through the halls. Now she witnessed Nathaniel clutching Isabella in a passionate embrace.

Harrison's breath hitched.

Nathaniel turned at the sound, reluctantly breaking contact. Their eyes locked across the threshold.

An unexpected pain lanced through Nathaniel's chest. Releasing Harrison felt more agonizing than anticipated.

Isabella's lips curled in victory. She released a theatrical gasp. "Oh!"

Nathaniel's attention snapped back to her. "What happened?"

"My leg," Isabella whimpered, batting her lashes. "It's completely numb. Carry me inside."

Without hesitation, Nathaniel swept her into his arms.

He strode past Harrison, acutely aware of her piercing stare. Isabella smirked over his shoulder, savoring her rival's defeat.

The door clicked shut behind them.

Harrison remained motionless in the hallway, her expression carefully blank. She absently touched her flat stomach before turning away.

Inside, Nathaniel deposited Isabella onto the plush bedding.

"You can't abandon me now," she purred, tracing his jawline. "My condition worsens daily. Harrison must treat me - she owes us that much."

The real challenge lay ahead - forcing Harrison to heal the woman who destroyed her family.

By choosing Isabella, Nathaniel had aligned himself with the Whitmores. Harrison would now see him as the enemy.

"I'll handle it," Nathaniel stated firmly. "She'll save you, willing or not."

Isabella's eyes glittered with triumph. No matter how brilliant Dr. Sinclair might be, Nathaniel's influence would bend her to their will.

She wrapped her arms around his neck. "You're perfect. Tonight, I'll show my gratitude."

Isabella leaned in for a kiss.

Nathaniel turned his face away.

"What's wrong?" she pouted. "Don't you want me?"

Gently removing her hands, he murmured, "Let's save that for our wedding night."

Isabella's face lit up. "Yes! Once I'm healed, we'll marry immediately. I'll give you so many children - enough for our own football team!"

Nathaniel smiled indulgently. "Rest now. I have documents to review."

As he exited, Isabella reclined against the pillows, basking in her victory. That stolen crystal pendant had been her masterstroke.

Now Nathaniel would never doubt she was his childhood savior. As long as she held that truth, his loyalty would remain unshakable.
###Chapter 476

A gentle chime broke the silence. Harrison's phone lit up with an incoming call.

It was Victoria.

Isabella swiped to answer. Victoria's frantic voice crackled through the speaker. "Isabella, any updates with Nathaniel?" A small smile played on Isabella's lips. "Relax, Mother. Everything's under control."

Victoria's voice trembled with excitement. "Truly?"

"Absolutely," Isabella affirmed. "Tell Father and Beatrice to stop worrying. No matter how much Harrison pressures him, Nathaniel will shield us. He'll ensure Harrison treats my heart condition, then sever all ties with her completely!"

Victoria nearly squealed. "Brilliant! If Mr. Falcon cuts Harrison off, the fallout will be spectacular. You're a genius!"

Isabella's smile widened, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes.

Three days later. At dawn's first light, Harrison stood before Benjamin's grave.

She'd given the Whitmore family three days to act. Today was reckoning day.

Harrison traced her father's smiling photograph on the headstone. His kind eyes seemed to watch over her.

"Dad," she whispered. "They're coming. Every last one of them will answer for what they did."

Her phone's melodic ringtone shattered the quiet. Oliver's name flashed on screen.

She answered immediately.

"At the cemetery yet?" Oliver's voice was warm.

"Already here," Harrison confirmed.

"Good. I'll join you shortly."

"I can manage alone. Stay home."

"Not happening." His tone turned protective. "You're carrying our child. I won't let you face the Whitmores alone. I've got you."

Harrison's heart swelled. Abandoned as a child, she'd found more love than she'd ever dreamed possible.

"Where are you now?"

"Almost there. I—"

A deafening crash cut him off. The line filled with static.

Harrison's breath hitched. "Oliver? Oliver!"

Two sharp beeps. Then silence.

Her stomach twisted. Oliver never dropped calls. Never.

She redialed. A robotic female voice responded: "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

Ice flooded her veins. Why would Oliver's phone be off?

Luxury cars crunched on gravel. Margaret led the procession—Theodore, Victoria, and the third branch members: Penelope, Frederick, and Cassandra. The entire Whitmore clan had arrived.

Harrison's lips curled. In all these years, had any Whitmore visited her father's grave?

Not once.

Their sudden appearance today was almost comical.

She pocketed her phone, pushing aside her growing unease. Margaret approached with a chilly smile.

"Harrison." She glanced at the headstone. "Since we're here, we'll pay our respects."
###Chapter 477

Margaret spoke first, her voice trembling with feigned grief. "The Whitmore family wishes to pay our respects at Benjamin's grave."

Harrison didn't stop them. She watched coldly as Margaret led the procession, each member bowing their heads in solemn silence for exactly sixty seconds.

"Hello, Benjamin. It's your mother," Margaret whispered, her fingers clutching the bouquet too tightly.

Theodore and Frederick joined in the charade. "We've come to see you, brother."

When the performance concluded, Margaret turned to Harrison with crocodile tears. "Blood binds us. Though Benjamin was adopted, he called me 'Mother'. Family shouldn't fight. Standing here before his resting place, can't we let bygones be bygones?"

Harrison's lips curled into a mirthless smile. "How touching. My father called you 'Mother', yet you poisoned your own child. You murdered him in cold blood, and now you dare ask for peace at his grave?"

Her piercing gaze swept across Theodore, Victoria, Frederick, and Cassandra one by one.

"Answer me honestly - if I weren't Dr. Sinclair, would any of you filthy vultures have bothered visiting my father's grave?"

The silence spoke volumes. These Whitmores hadn't suddenly grown consciences. They only came crawling because of her medical reputation.

Theodore cleared his throat awkwardly. "Must you be so hostile? Benjamin raised an exceptional daughter - Westfield's prodigy, the brilliant Dr. Sinclair. But must you point daggers at your own kin?"

Frederick chimed in with false warmth. "Show some family loyalty. You're still a Whitmore at heart."

Harrison's bitter laugh cut through the cemetery air. "I recall you disowning me quite publicly. If not for Father, I'd have discarded this cursed surname years ago!"

Margaret's face turned ashen with rage. "How dare you speak to us this way!"

Isabella chose that moment to intervene, her voice dripping with venom. "We've extended an olive branch, yet you spit on our kindness."

Harrison's eyes turned glacial. "Your 'kindness' reeks of hypocrisy."

Penelope's tone grew menacing. "Then consider us enemies from this moment forward."

Harrison's gaze sharpened like honed steel. "Remember this - Isabella's heart condition still requires my expertise. I can wait for justice to claim each of you, but how long can Isabella wait?"

Isabella smirked, a cat playing with its prey. "So certain of your leverage? What if I told you we've found a way to... persuade your cooperation?"

Harrison crossed her arms. "Do enlighten me."

Victoria stepped forward with a conspiratorial smile. "The power doesn't lie with Isabella or us. There's a far greater force behind our actions."

Harrison's brow furrowed slightly as the pieces clicked into place.

Victoria lowered her voice to a whisper. "You've already guessed, haven't you? It's Mr. Falcon."

As if summoned, a black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a halt. Dominic opened the rear door with practiced precision, and Nathaniel emerged - his towering frame and aristocratic bearing commanding immediate attention.

Nathaniel had arrived.

Isabella practically tripped over herself rushing forward. "Nathaniel, darling!"

But Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Harrison, his voice a velvet-wrapped command. "You no longer have a choice regarding Isabella's treatment. It's no longer a request - it's a mandate."

Harrison met his stare unflinchingly.

"Explain yourself."
###Chapter 478

Nathaniel abruptly shifted gears.

"Have you managed to contact Oliver yet?"

At the mention of Oliver's name, Harrison's pulse quickened.

Nathaniel stood imposingly in his tailored black suit, radiating aristocratic refinement. His piercing gaze held no warmth—only the ruthless authority of a man accustomed to power.

He had chosen Isabella. To him now, Harrison was merely a stranger.

His eyes showed no lingering affection—just the cold determination of someone who'd made his choice.

Nathaniel's lips parted slightly. "You couldn't reach Oliver, could you? Or more accurately, your call with him was suddenly disconnected?"

Harrison's mind raced as realization dawned. She stared at Nathaniel in shock. "What did you do to him?"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Try calling him again. See if he answers."

Without hesitation, Harrison pulled out her phone and redialed Oliver's number.

Only the endless ringing tone greeted her. No answer.

Oliver never ignored her calls. She should have realized sooner—with Oliver's status and connections, no one would dare touch him. Except Nathaniel.

Willowbrook was Nathaniel's domain. If he wanted to act against Oliver, it would be effortless.

Harrison's voice shook as she confronted Nathaniel. "Where is Oliver? What have you done to him?"

Isabella smirked victoriously, tightening her grip on Nathaniel's arm. "Haven't you witnessed Nathaniel's methods before? If you refuse to cooperate, Mr. Oliver will experience them personally!"

Harrison's hands trembled with barely contained rage. "What do you want?"

Nathaniel's tone remained clinical. "My demand is simple—treat Isabella's heart condition. Once she recovers, Oliver will be unharmed."

Isabella added with cruel delight, "To put it bluntly—if anything happens to me, Mr. Oliver dies with me. And Harrison, the blood will be on your hands. He's completely innocent, after all."

Margaret laughed mockingly. "We tried being reasonable, but you remained obstinate. Did you think we lacked powerful allies? Falcon Enterprises stands with us!"

"Harrison, you'd better start treating Isabella immediately. Her life is invaluable. If she suffers, everyone you care about will pay the price," Victoria added venomously.

Harrison studied the Whitmore family's smug expressions—their true ugliness revealed. They only dared act this way because Nathaniel backed them.

But Nathaniel's betrayal cut deepest.

Her hands turned ice-cold as she turned her devastated gaze toward him.

"You know who murdered my father. These people—my father's supposed mother, brothers, and wife. They conspired to kill him! They're all murderers! And now you're protecting them?"

Harrison pointed at Benjamin's gravestone, her voice breaking with grief and fury.

"You were difficult before, but at least I believed you had principles. Now, standing before my father's grave, you're siding with his killers?"

Nathaniel's fingers twitched almost imperceptibly at his side. He knew. He'd already deduced the Whitmores killed Benjamin.

Meeting Harrison's shattered gaze, something flickered in his eyes.

Isabella immediately pressed closer, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Nathaniel darling, you're not having second thoughts now, are you?"
###Chapter 479
Nathaniel gave a firm nod.

His resolve was absolute now.

He would save Isabella, no matter the cost.

His piercing gaze locked onto Harrison. "Just agree to treat Isabella's heart condition. I don't want this to get ugly."

Harrison's heart shattered completely. Nathaniel had truly chosen Isabella and those murderers over her.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Let's see if you can actually make me!"

"You're all talk," Margaret sneered. "Sure, you're Dr. Sinclair, but you're no match for someone like Mr. Falcon! He's a titan in the business world. One word from him, and your reputation will be in ruins."

"Harrison, we're offering you a way out," Victoria interjected. "Take it before it's too late. This feud benefits no one. I'm only saying this because I care about you."

Isabella cut in sharply, "Do it for Oliver. You can't let him die because of your stubbornness!"

Harrison's icy stare bore into Isabella. "I'll handle his situation. You should worry about yourselves. I won't rest until my father's killer is brought to justice. Every single one of you will pay!"

Margaret's face twisted in anger. "How dare you—"

Before she could finish, Harrison turned on her heel and strode away.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure and quickly caught up, grabbing her arm to stop her.

"We need to talk."

Harrison yanked her arm free with force, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "There's nothing left to say."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "I can't abandon Isabella. Don't force my hand."

Harrison arched a brow. "Should I applaud your undying devotion to her? What if I decide to make things difficult for you?"

Nathaniel fell silent for a beat before responding in a low, dangerous voice, "Oliver is just the start. If you push me, everyone you care about will suffer."

So he was willing to hurt her loved ones to get what he wanted?

Harrison didn't hesitate. Her palm struck Nathaniel's face with a sharp crack, snapping his head to the side.

She stared at him, her eyes brimming with disappointment. "I misjudged you completely."

Isabella rushed over, gasping. "Nathaniel! Are you okay?"

She whirled on Harrison, her voice dripping with accusation. "Have you lost your mind? How dare you hit him! What's wrong with you?"

Harrison shot her a glacial look before turning to leave.

"Stop fighting, Harrison. It's pointless!" Isabella called after her. "I heard you have a surgery scheduled at Vitalis Health. The moment Nathaniel gives the order, it'll be canceled. Even as Dr. Sinclair, he can destroy you with a snap of his fingers."

Harrison turned back, her expression unflinching. "If you're so powerful, then do it. Let's see if I care."

Isabella's face contorted with rage. "You little—"

Harrison walked away, but after a few steps, a sharp pain lanced through her lower abdomen. She doubled over, clutching her stomach.

Nathaniel noticed immediately. In three long strides, he was at her side. "What's wrong?"

Harrison pressed a hand to her abdomen, sweat beading on her forehead.

"Is it your stomach? Let me take you to the hospital," Nathaniel insisted, reaching for her.

"No! Don't!"

Isabella rushed forward, clinging to Nathaniel's arm. "You're my boyfriend now, and Harrison is our enemy. I won't let you help her, even if she's dying!"
###Chapter 480

Nathaniel's perfect features twisted into a frown.

Isabella smirked victoriously at Harrison, her lips curling into a cruel smile. "Does it hurt that much? Then why don't you get on your knees and beg? Maybe I'll convince Nathaniel to take you to the hospital."

Harrison clenched her jaw against the pain, shooting Isabella an icy glare. "We'll see who's begging by the end of this."

Without another word, Harrison turned and walked away.

Back in her apartment, Harrison immediately called Evelyn, her other senior colleague. "Evelyn, listen. Nathaniel has taken Oliver. You need to send a rescue team immediately."

Evelyn chuckled darkly at the news. "Well, that's new. Someone actually dared to kidnap Oliver? Did you and Nathaniel have another fight?"

Harrison pressed a hand to her throbbing abdomen, her pale face drawn with pain. "Don't even say his name to me. I wish I'd never met that man. What was I thinking loving someone like him?"

Evelyn's tone softened. "Oliver will be fine, I'll handle it. But you don't sound good. Are you sick?"

Hearing his reassurance eased some of Harrison's tension. If anything happened to Oliver because of her, she'd never forgive herself.

"I'm fine. Just need to rest."

"Then get some sleep. Take care."

The call ended, but the dull ache in Harrison's abdomen persisted. Nathaniel's cruelty today had pushed her too far - she worried it might affect her pregnancy.

She needed to prepare some herbal medicine to stabilize her condition, but two key ingredients were missing.

Harrison quickly dialed her assistant. "Bring me Lideran and Cerrosbi immediately."

Meanwhile, Nathaniel had left for work, and Isabella arrived at Emerald Heights with one goal - to confront Harrison.

She wanted to rub salt in Harrison's wounds and pressure her into treating her heart condition sooner.

As the elevator doors opened, Harrison's assistant rushed forward. "Hold the door, please!"

Isabella didn't recognize the assistant, but they entered the elevator together.

Inside, the assistant pulled out her phone. "Dr. Sinclair, I'm in the elevator now with your order."

Isabella's ears perked up at the name. So this was Harrison's assistant. What could she be delivering?

"Yes, I have both Lideran and Cerrosbi with me."

Lideran and Cerrosbi?

Why would Harrison need those specific herbs?

Though not a medical professional, Isabella sensed something significant about this request. The elevator reached its destination, but Isabella stayed behind, canceling her original plan.

She needed to find out what these herbs meant. If they represented some weakness of Harrison's, she could use that to her advantage.

Isabella quickly dialed the Whitmore family's private physician. "Dr. Kinsman, I need information. What are Lideran and Cerrosbi used for?"

The doctor's voice came through clearly. "Of course, Miss Whitmore. How may I assist you?"
###Chapter 481

"Do you mean Lideran and Cerrosbi together?" the private physician inquired, studying Isabella's tense expression.

"Yes," she confirmed, her fingers tightening around her phone.

"Are you expecting?"

Expecting?

The question struck Isabella like a physical blow, rooting her to the spot. Her breath hitched as she managed to whisper, "Dr. Sinclair, what exactly are you implying?"

"Both Lideran and Cerrosbi are herbal remedies used to prevent miscarriage."

Prevent miscarriage?

Harrison was taking these? Was she pregnant?

Isabella's mind reeled. The possibility had never crossed her mind. She knew Harrison and Nathaniel had been intimate, but Nathaniel despised children. He wasn't the type to let such a complication arise - not with the Falcon legacy hanging in the balance.

Yet... Harrison was pregnant.

Isabella stumbled backward, her shoulder hitting the wall as she struggled to steady her breathing. Could the child be Nathaniel's?

Wait... It might also be Oliver's.

But feminine intuition rarely lied, and Isabella's gut screamed that this was Nathaniel's offspring.

What now?

Panic surged through her veins.

Isabella raced home, her movements frantic.

Victoria noticed her daughter's ashen complexion immediately. "Darling, you're shaking!" She grasped Isabella's ice-cold hands. "What's happened?"

"Mother... we have a problem."

"Isn't everything settled with Mr. Falcon? He's made his choice, hasn't he?"

Isabella's grip turned vice-like. "Harrison's pregnant... with Nathaniel's child!"

Victoria blanched, her voice rising an octave. "What? Harrison's pregnant? Are you certain? How could she possibly be carrying Mr. Falcon's child?"

The news seemed impossible.

"I'm absolutely sure. What do we do? If Nathaniel discovers this, will he keep it? He may hate children, but this would be his firstborn! His heir!"

Nathaniel would become a father.

Victoria's expression hardened. She understood the significance of a man's first child. Even if Nathaniel rejected the baby initially, his feelings toward Harrison would inevitably shift.

Guilt could transform into something far more dangerous in a man's heart. A clever woman could weaponize that guilt indefinitely.

Victoria composed herself swiftly. "Breathe. We'll handle this."

"How can I breathe? I just stole Harrison's pendant to secure Nathaniel, and now this! I won't lose everything - I can't!"

Victoria seized her daughter's shoulders. "Does anyone else know?"

Isabella shook her head violently. "I doubt she's told a soul."

A calculating gleam entered Victoria's eyes. "Then we have nothing to worry about. That child in Harrison's womb belongs to Oliver."

"But my instincts-"

"No," Victoria cut in sharply. "That child is Oliver's. It doesn't matter whose seed actually planted it. As long as Mr. Falcon believes it's Oliver's, our problem disappears."

Understanding dawned in Isabella's eyes, a wicked smile curling her lips. "Mother, you're absolutely brilliant!"
###Chapter 482

Victoria's eyes gleamed with calculated mischief as she turned to Isabella. "You should inform Nathaniel about Harrison's condition. This could be our chance to eliminate the baby - through his own actions."

The frown that had darkened Isabella's face disappeared instantly. She grasped her mother's scheme immediately, flashing an approving smile.

Victoria's tone turned serious. "But before approaching him, you'll need evidence. Everyone must believe the child belongs to Oliver."

Isabella nodded eagerly. "Consider it done. I'll take care of everything."

At Falcon Enterprises, Nathaniel had just returned to his office. He sat behind his polished mahogany desk, reviewing contracts with a gold-plated pen.

Dominic's voice interrupted the silence. "Mr. Falcon, Ms. Harrison still refuses to undergo the heart surgery for Ms. Isabella. How should we proceed?"

Nathaniel's pen stilled mid-signature.

Dominic hesitated before adding, "After our actions against Mr. Oliver, Ms. Harrison's resentment toward you has... intensified."

Nathaniel's expression hardened into an unreadable mask. He had no choice - his loyalty lay with Isabella.

An image of Harrison's delicate features flashed through his mind - that stubborn set of her jaw, those defiant eyes.

He wished she wouldn't force his hand like this.

A gentle knock sounded at the door.

"Nathaniel." Isabella's voice carried through the wood.

"Enter," he responded evenly.

Isabella stepped inside, her fingers twisting nervously. "I hope this isn't a bad time."

Nathaniel didn't look up from his documents. "I'm swamped today. Can this wait?"

She offered a coy smile. "I wouldn't disturb you unless it was urgent."

"Tomorrow?" His tone suggested he'd rather not deal with this now.

"It's about Harrison," she murmured.

Nathaniel's head snapped up, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "What about her?"

"Don't misunderstand," Isabella said softly. "Harrison's fine. I just... discovered something about her. After careful consideration, I felt you should know."

Nathaniel leaned forward, his full attention captured. "Explain."

"Nathaniel, brace yourself. This is serious - Harrison is pregnant."

The pen clattered loudly against the marble floor. Nathaniel shot to his feet, shock rippling across his features. "What did you say? Repeat that!"

Isabella maintained steady eye contact. "I caught her purchasing miscarriage prevention herbs. My investigation confirmed it - she's expecting."

So it was true.

Nathaniel had suspected before, but Vitalis Health's examination had claimed otherwise.

She'd lied to him.

Harrison was carrying his child.

His mind reeled. "Why would Harrison hide this from me? That baby is mine!"

He mentally cataloged their intimate moments, the times protection had been forgotten. The withdrawal method wasn't foolproof.

Harrison had conceived his heir.

A storm of emotions churned within him. Fatherhood wasn't part of his plans.

Isabella studied his reaction carefully before delivering her next blow with chilling calm. "You're mistaken. The child isn't yours."

"What?"

Nathaniel froze, his brain struggling to process her words.

"You and Harrison have been divorced for months," Isabella pressed. "She's involved with Oliver now. That baby in her womb? It's his. Not yours."
###Chapter 483

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Harrison, his head shaking in vehement denial. "Impossible! That child can't be Oliver's! It's mine!"

Harrison's fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms. The tension in her jaw threatened to crack teeth.

Why was Nathaniel reacting this way? What made him so certain the baby was his?

"Nathaniel," Harrison's voice trembled with frustration, "since when do you care about children? Do you actually want Harrison to keep this baby? Is that what this is about?"

Dark emotions flickered in Nathaniel's usually composed eyes. He couldn't explain the visceral certainty coursing through him, but he knew - he just knew - that baby was his.

He needed it to be his.

Harrison reached into her designer bag, producing a document. "Here's the pregnancy report. Clear as day - two weeks and three days. Do the math yourself."

Nathaniel snatched the paper from her manicured fingers.

Harrison's name stared back at him from the medical form. The dates confirmed everything: two weeks and three days pregnant.

Two weeks. The timeline didn't add up.

Their last encounter had been over a month ago. The time before that, two months. In the past month, Harrison had been with Oliver exclusively.

The truth hit him like a freight train. That child belonged to Oliver.

Harrison had conceived with Oliver.

White-hot rage surged through Nathaniel's veins. Now her deception at Vitalis Health made perfect sense - she hadn't been pregnant then because the baby wasn't his to begin with.

He'd been a fool.

With one violent motion, Nathaniel shredded the document. Paper snowflakes fluttered to the marble floor.

His broad chest heaved, muscles taut with barely contained fury.

Isabella moved to embrace him. "Now that Harrison's with Oliver, of course she'd carry his child. No wonder she reacted so violently when we took him. He's the father, after all."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a bloodless line, offering no response.

Isabella continued, her voice dripping with false sympathy, "This isn't our concern anymore. That baby belongs to Harrison and her lover. We should wash our hands of it."

Before she could finish, Nathaniel shoved her away.

He grabbed his tailored jacket and stormed toward the exit.

Isabella stood frozen, stunned by his abrupt departure. "Nathaniel!" she called after him. "You said you had meetings!"

"I'm going to see Harrison," he threw over his shoulder without breaking stride.

His imposing frame disappeared down the hallway.

Nathaniel was going to Harrison!

Isabella's heel struck the floor with enough force to crack tile. Why couldn't he let Harrison go? Did he still have feelings for her?

Then a wicked smile curled her lips. Let them stay trapped in this misunderstanding forever. Let it tear them apart permanently!

Harrison sat alone in her Rosewood Manor penthouse when her assistant delivered the prenatal medications before hastily departing.

Grimacing, Harrison forced down the bitter herbal concoction meant to stabilize her pregnancy. The acrid taste burned her throat.

Her emotional turmoil had taken its toll. She could feel the fragile life inside her becoming more precarious with each passing day.

The sharp chime of the doorbell shattered the silence.

Who could it be at this hour?

Harrison padded to the door and opened it.

Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his towering presence as commanding as ever.

She had no desire to see him. Not now. Not ever again. Without a word, Harrison moved to slam the door.

Nathaniel's hand shot out, stopping the door with effortless strength.

"Let me in!"
###Chapter 484

Harrison crossed her arms, her eyes flashing with defiance. "This is my home. You have no right to be here!"

Nathaniel ignored her protest. With one forceful shove, he pushed past her, his tall frame easily clearing the doorway.

A sharp irritation prickled at Harrison's skin. Nathaniel and Isabella were truly made for each other - both believing they could invade private spaces without consequence.

"I'm calling security if you don't leave now!" Her voice carried unmistakable authority.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto her. "What secrets are you keeping from me?"

Harrison stiffened. "Excuse me?"

His eyes dropped lower, zeroing in on her abdomen.

Instinctively, Harrison's hands flew to protect her stomach. "What are you staring at?"

Her defensive posture spoke volumes - she was shielding Oliver's child from potential harm.

Nathaniel's chest constricted painfully. The realization stung - she actually believed him capable of harming her and their baby.

"That night at Vitalis Health. You tampered with the results, didn't you?"

Harrison's breath hitched. The jig was up.

When Nathaniel had declared his dislike for children and warned her not to complicate his life, she'd made her decision. The truth wasn't meant for him.

Yet some part of her had known this moment would come. Just not so soon.

"Why the silence?" Nathaniel's voice cut like ice. "Always so quick with words. Tell me plainly - are you carrying my child?"

Harrison met his gaze steadily. "Yes. I'm pregnant."

A bitter smirk twisted Nathaniel's lips. Whether he mocked her or himself remained unclear.

His expression unsettled Harrison. "This is my private matter. It doesn't concern you. Just... don't hurt my baby."

Each word stabbed deeper than the last. She could've spared him this pain, but chose otherwise.

Was this her revenge?

Rage ignited in Nathaniel's veins. He advanced with deliberate steps.

His imposing shadow made Harrison retreat instinctively. Something in his demeanor tonight felt dangerously unpredictable.

"Running away? What are you afraid of?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

Harrison's back hit the wall, leaving her nowhere to go.

Her jaw tightened. "I said leave!"

Nathaniel closed the distance, his hand clamping her shoulder. A humorless laugh escaped him. "Answer me - what frightens you? That I'd harm you? Hurt the baby? Is that your opinion of me?"

"Yes!" Harrison didn't hesitate.

Nathaniel froze, stunned by her bluntness.

She held his gaze unflinchingly. "The moment you chose Isabella, you showed your true colors. You took Oliver from me too. Make no mistake - if anything happens to him, I'll never forgive you."

Mentioning Oliver struck deeper than she intended.

"Is he really that important?" Nathaniel sneered.

Harrison nodded firmly. "Absolutely."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Of course. How could I forget? You're carrying his child. He must mean everything now."
###Chapter 485

Harrison froze, her eyes locking with Nathaniel's.

"What did you say? Who's the baby's father?"

Nathaniel smirked, his voice dripping with mockery. "Do I really need to spell it out for you? You should know better than anyone. It's Oliver!"

Harrison's heart skipped a beat. Though she hadn't wanted Nathaniel to discover her pregnancy, now that he had, she couldn't let him falsely accuse the child of belonging to someone else.

"Nathaniel, listen carefully," she said, her voice steady. "This child isn't Oliver's. It's yours!"

She spoke with absolute conviction.

Nathaniel paused, a flicker of surprise crossing his features before he began laughing darkly.

"Why are you laughing?" she demanded, frustration rising. "I'm serious. This baby is yours. I—"

"Enough!" Nathaniel cut her off sharply, gripping her chin with bruising force. "How dare you claim this child is mine when it's clearly Oliver's? Do you take me for a fool? Or are you lying out of pity?"

Harrison's breath hitched.

"Listen well. I couldn't care less about the bastard in your belly. I don't care whose it is!"

Ice settled in Harrison's chest. The words died in her throat.

What was the point? If he didn't care, explanations were meaningless.

With sudden defiance, she shoved against his chest. "Then let go of me and leave."

Nathaniel studied her cold expression, something primal snapping inside him. That detached look—she'd given it to him at the cemetery too, and it was unbearable.

"Is Oliver really that important to you?"

"Yes!" Harrison answered without hesitation, voice ringing clear. "No matter how many times you ask, Oliver will always mean more to me than you!"

There. She'd said it.

Nathaniel laughed bitterly, tongue pressing against his cheek. "I see. Well, he's in my hands now. Don't you think it's time to... negotiate his release?"

"What do you mean?"

His voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Start by begging me to let him go."

"Beg you? Would you actually release him if I did?"

"Try me," Nathaniel taunted, shrugging with feigned indifference.

Harrison's expression hardened. "Fine. I'm begging you. Please, release Oliver."

Nathaniel's cruel laughter filled the room. "Harrison, that's the most half-hearted begging I've ever witnessed. Where's the passion? You used to beg so beautifully for me. Have you forgotten?"

Her eyes narrowed to slits. She shoved him away with all her strength. "Keep dreaming. I won't degrade myself for you!"

Nathaniel tapped her cheek mockingly, fingers lingering. "Playing the innocent now? You insisted on protection with me, but let Oliver have you raw? Interesting double standard."

Harrison was done. "Get out of my house!"

Without warning, Nathaniel crushed his lips against hers.

Harrison froze, shocked. Even now, he dared to kiss her?

Hadn't Isabella satisfied him last night?

She struggled violently, but Nathaniel's body was an immovable wall, pressing her relentlessly against the counter.

Desperate, Harrison bit his lip hard.

Nathaniel only deepened the kiss, invading her mouth with brutal possession.

The metallic tang of blood filled their mouths.

Finally breaking the kiss, Nathaniel gripped her waist and dragged her toward the sofa.
###Chapter 486

Nathaniel's grip tightened around Harrison's waist, pressing painfully against her abdomen. The discomfort made her push against him immediately.

"Get off me! You're hurting me!"

At her words, Nathaniel froze for a split second before adjusting his hold, moving his arm higher. Then, without warning, he shoved her down onto the plush couch cushions.

Harrison scrambled to rise, but Nathaniel pinned her beneath him, his fingers tearing at her collar with brutal force.

The fabric ripped with a sharp sound, exposing her shoulder to the cold air. She gasped, shock coursing through her.

In an instant, Nathaniel buried his face against her neck, his lips hot against her skin. "Why does Oliver get to have you, but I don't? Why are you doing this to me?"

Harrison wanted to scream the same question back at him. Why was he doing this?

He could be with Isabella, yet she wasn't allowed to be with Oliver? What kind of twisted logic was that?

Who did he think he was—standing by Isabella's side while forcing himself on her like this?

What did he take her for?

Harrison thrashed, her voice breaking. "Let me go! Don't touch me!"

Nathaniel ignored her, tearing at her clothes while unbuckling his belt. "I want you. You want to save Oliver, don't you? Then prove it—sleep with me, and I'll ease his suffering."

He forced her legs apart.

Humiliation and pain burned through her. Her stomach ached fiercely.

"It hurts... Nathaniel, stop! Don't make me regret ever loving you!"

Those words froze him. His movements halted abruptly.

He looked down at Harrison—tears streaming down her face, her delicate features blotchy, her clothes torn, her hair tangled. She looked shattered.

A wave of confusion crashed over him. He had lost control, but now, reality seeped back in.

When had he sunk so low?

He opened his mouth, but his voice came out rough. Unsure.

Nathaniel lifted a hand, as if to wipe her tears away.

Smack!

Harrison slapped his hand aside with surprising force. "Don't touch me!"

His hand hovered in the air before he slowly released her and stood. Without a word, he turned and walked out.

Nathaniel was gone.

The slam of the apartment door echoed in the silence. Harrison's tense body finally relaxed. The emotions she had held back surged forward, and she curled into herself, sobbing quietly.

Nathaniel was a monster.

She swore to herself—she would never love him again.

Her small hand rested gently on her stomach.

"Sweetheart," she whispered to the baby, "that man was your father."

A pause.

"Let's not keep him, okay?"

Outside, Nathaniel leaned against the cold wall, eyes closed.

Defeat weighed on him.

Harrison had thrown his emotions into chaos.

He didn’t know what to do with her anymore.

Meanwhile, hidden in the shadows, Isabella watched. She had followed Nathaniel here.

Seeing him emerge with reddened eyes—clearly after a fight with Harrison—her lips curled into a smug smile.

Anyone in her way would regret it.

Harrison's pregnancy was both a blessing and a curse.

And she was just getting started.
###Chapter 487
Harrison's fury flared, and her stomach twisted in pain again.

She gave herself a quick injection to ease it, then decided to rest.

Just then, her phone rang.

Gabrielle.

Harrison answered immediately. "Hello?"

Gabrielle's panicked voice came through. "Harrison, something's wrong!"

Harrison's pulse spiked. "What happened?"

"I just got home from work, but a group of men broke in. I hid in my room, but—"

"What? Who are they? Did you call the police?"

"I did, but they're searching everywhere. They keep saying anyone who crosses Mr. Falcon won’t get away with it."

Nathaniel?

Harrison's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. First Oliver, now her best friend?

Nathaniel knew exactly who mattered to her.

"What did you do to anger him? They keep saying Willowbrook is his territory, that we should obey—"

"I'm coming right now—"

Before she could finish, Gabrielle shrieked. "Ahh!!"

Harrison's face paled. "Gabrielle? Gabrielle!"

The line filled with chaos—then went dead.

Her stomach dropped. Something terrible had happened.

She threw on clothes and bolted out the door.

At Nathaniel's apartment, she hammered on the doorbell.

The door swung open.

Harrison clenched her fists. "Nathaniel, have you lost your mind? If you hurt Gabrielle, I swear—"

"Harrison."

Isabella stood there, smirking.

Harrison froze.

Isabella leaned against the doorframe, her smile mocking. "He's in the shower. What do you want?"

The implication was clear.

Harrison narrowed her eyes. "I need to see him."

Isabella scoffed. "Just because you want to doesn’t mean you can. Nathaniel is the CEO of Falcon Enterprises. Do you think he has time for you?"

She gave Harrison a once-over. "Did something happen to your little friend?"

Harrison's jaw tightened. "You know about this?"

"Of course." Isabella smiled. "Nathaniel warned you. If you don’t treat my condition, he’ll escalate. Everyone you care about will suffer."

Harrison's hands shook with rage.

Isabella stepped closer, triumphant. "Look at you—losing to me again. You’ll never win."

Harrison felt the weight of defeat. She had no hope left for Nathaniel.

With one last cold glare, she turned and walked away.

As Harrison disappeared, Isabella chuckled. She pulled out her phone and dialed.

"Mother," she purred. "Everything’s going perfectly. Time for the next step."

Victoria’s voice was smooth. "Don’t worry, darling. That baby won’t be a problem for long."

Isabella smiled. "Thank you, Mother."
###Chapter 488

The phone clicked shut in Isabella's hand.

Nathaniel's rich baritone voice suddenly filled the space behind her. "Why are you lingering by the door?"

She turned to see him emerging from the study, documents in hand, with Dominic trailing close behind.

Isabella forced a bright smile. "Just thought I heard something. Don't let me interrupt your work."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze studied her face.

Her pulse quickened. That razor-sharp intuition of his could unravel her plans in an instant.

Dominic stepped forward with another file. "Mr. Falcon, there are still unresolved issues with this contract."

Nathaniel finally broke eye contact. "We'll continue in the study."

As the two men retreated into the study to handle urgent business, Isabella exhaled in relief. A sly smile curled her lips. Her part was done. Now she just had to wait.

By tonight, Harrison's pregnancy would be terminated. No more threats to her position.

Meanwhile, Harrison was speeding toward Gabrielle's apartment when her phone rang. It was Rosalind. "I've been trying to reach Gabrielle but she's not answering."

Rosalind remained unaware of the unfolding crisis.

"Listen carefully - Gabrielle's been kidnapped!" Harrison's voice trembled with urgency.

"What?" Rosalind gasped. "By whom?"

"Nathaniel!"

Rosalind sucked in a sharp breath. "Mr. Falcon? Why would he take Gabrielle?"

"He's forcing me to treat Isabella. He's completely under her spell now. There's nothing he won't do." Harrison's words came out in a rush.

Silence stretched on the other end as Rosalind processed the shocking revelation.

"I'm warning you so you can protect yourself. You might be next!"

Rosalind hesitated. "Actually, Mr. Falcon and I-"

"No time to talk. I'm at Gabrielle's place now." Harrison abruptly ended the call and sprinted into the building.

Having stayed at Gabrielle's before, Harrison had a key. The unlocked door revealed a scene of chaos - clear signs of a violent struggle. The apartment stood eerily silent.

"Gabrielle? Gabrielle!" Her voice echoed through the empty space.

No response.

Harrison pushed open another door to find another empty room.

Then - a faint sound.

She burst into the bathroom and froze at the sight before her.

Gabrielle was being restrained by a black-clad man, his hand muffling her screams.

Harrison's body moved before her mind could process. "Let her go!"

Gabrielle frantically shook her head, eyes wide with warning. Then she sank her teeth into the man's hand. He yelped in pain, loosening his grip.

"Run, Harrison! It's a trap! Behind you!" Gabrielle shrieked.

Harrison whirled around just as another assailant swung a club at her head.

White-hot pain exploded at the base of her skull.

Darkness swallowed her vision as her knees buckled.

In her fading consciousness, she heard Gabrielle's desperate screams. "Harrison! Who are you people? Where are you taking her? Harrison!"
###Chapter 489

Harrison's eyelids fluttered open as consciousness slowly returned. Blinding surgical lights assaulted her vision, forcing her to squint against the harsh glare.

Her medical training instantly identified her surroundings. The cold metal beneath her, the antiseptic smell - she was on an operating table.

White-coated figures moved around her in practiced efficiency. The sharp sound of glass vials being uncapped echoed through the sterile room.

"Prepare the anesthesia," a detached male voice ordered. "We'll begin the termination procedure immediately."

Termination?

The attack at Gabrielle's apartment flashed through her mind. They'd been waiting for her. Hunting her. All to get to the life growing inside her.

She tried to move but her limbs felt like lead. The blow to her neck had left her weak, helpless.

"Shouldn't the family be present for this?" a nurse asked hesitantly.

The lead doctor's voice remained clinical. "Mr. Falcon personally ordered this procedure. He won't be attending."

Another physician leaned closer, pity in his eyes. "You should have known better than to cross Nathaniel and Isabella. Everyone knows how devoted he is to her. This entire operation was his doing - the ambush at your friend's place, this hospital room. All arranged by Mr. Falcon himself."

Harrison felt the world drop away beneath her. Nathaniel - how could you?

She'd known his obsession with Isabella ran deep. But this...

This was beyond cruelty. Just when she thought she understood the depths of his darkness, he proved her wrong again.

Her fingers trembled against her still-flat abdomen. Her baby. Their baby.

She wouldn't let them take this from her.

Couldn't.

"Administer the sedative," the doctor commanded. "Mr. Falcon expects confirmation."

A gloved hand approached with a long needle, its sharp point glinting under the lights.

Every cell in Harrison's body screamed in protest.

Not my child!

With a surge of adrenaline, she twisted away. Her bare feet hit the cold floor as she lunged for the door.

Just a few more steps. If she could reach the hallway, find help...

Her fingers closed around the metal handle.

A strong arm yanked her backward, breaking her grip. She fought wildly, nails scraping against latex gloves.

"Let me go! You can't do this!" Her voice cracked with desperation.

They overpowered her easily, pinning her back onto the table.

"Don't blame us," one doctor muttered as straps secured her wrists. "We're just following Mr. Falcon's orders. He's the one who wants this done."

Tears burned tracks down Harrison's cheeks. The salt stung her chapped lips.

Why? Why would he do this?

In that moment, she hated Nathaniel Falcon with every shattered piece of her heart.

Meanwhile, at Rosewood Manor...
###Chapter 490

Nathaniel sat in his study, surrounded by stacks of documents. His fingers tapped impatiently against the mahogany desk before he abruptly shut the file in front of him.

Dominic, standing nearby, immediately noticed the shift in his demeanor. "Mr. Falcon, is everything alright?"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed, his piercing gaze sharpening.

"I don't know what's wrong," he admitted, his voice tight. "But my chest feels... heavy."

The man was known for his relentless work ethic, but today, concentration eluded him. His mind refused to settle on the papers before him.

This wasn't just physical discomfort. Something deeper gnawed at him—an unease he couldn't shake.

He pressed a hand against his chest, feeling the dull throb beneath his ribs. "Should I call a doctor?" Dominic asked, concern lacing his tone.

Nathaniel shook his head. "No."

A moment of silence stretched before he spoke again, his voice low. "Where is Harrison right now?"

Dominic hesitated. "She lives across from you. I can check on her if you'd like."

Nathaniel didn't respond, his expression distant.

Then, a knock interrupted the quiet.

Isabella's voice floated through the door. "I brought you coffee."

"Come in," Nathaniel called.

She entered, carefully placing the cup beside him. "You've been working too hard. Drink this—I made it just for you."

Nathaniel exhaled, lifting the cup to his lips. The moment the liquid touched his tongue, his face twisted in displeasure.

"What's wrong?" Isabella asked, her smile faltering.

Dominic, attuned to Nathaniel's moods, understood instantly. "Mr. Falcon, is the coffee not to your liking?"

It wasn't.

Before the divorce, Harrison had always prepared his coffee. She had perfected every detail of his routine, her presence ingrained in his daily life.

Nathaniel set the cup down, his fingers lingering on the rim.

Isabella's jaw tightened. She couldn't even make coffee as well as Harrison?

Dominic broke the silence. "Should I fetch Ms. Harrison?"

Isabella's stomach dropped. Nathaniel wanted to see her?

No. Absolutely not.

This was the critical moment of their plan. She couldn't risk him figuring things out.

She moved closer, her voice soft and coaxing. "Do you really want to see her? After everything? She's carrying Oliver's child now. She hates you. Why would she welcome you?"

Nathaniel's mind flashed to the icy words Harrison had thrown at him in her apartment—and the undeniable truth of her pregnancy. His lips thinned into a hard line.

Isabella leaned in, her voice a whisper. "We should stay away from her. Once she cures my heart condition, we'll be married."

Her fingers brushed his temple, massaging gently. "You're exhausted. Let me help. Dominic, it's late. You can go."

A subtle dismissal.

Dominic hesitated but finally turned to leave.

As the door clicked shut, Isabella allowed herself a small, victorious smile.

Harrison was alone on that operating table now—helpless.

She deserved this for crossing her.

Just as the satisfaction settled in, Nathaniel's voice cut through the silence.

"Dominic, wait."

The command froze Dominic in his tracks.
###Chapter 491

Nathaniel spun around to find Dominic standing in the doorway.

"Mr. Falcon, do you require anything further?" Dominic inquired.

A gnawing unease twisted in Nathaniel's gut. His instincts screamed that danger loomed nearby.

He clenched his jaw before murmuring, "Go check on Harrison and—"

Isabella's piercing scream cut through his words.

Nathaniel shot to his feet. "Isabella! What's wrong?"

"My chest... It's burning," she gasped.

Her body went slack without warning, collapsing against Nathaniel's chest.

Dominic rushed forward. "Sir—"

But Isabella clung to Nathaniel, her fingers digging into his neck.

"The pain... It's unbearable," she whimpered between ragged breaths. "Hospital... Now."

Her hand clutched at her heart, each inhale shallower than the last. "Can't... breathe... Nathaniel, please!"

His expression darkened with alarm. Without hesitation, he swept her into his arms. "Hang on. We're leaving now."

He stormed out, cradling her trembling form.

Meanwhile, Rosalind burst into Gabrielle's apartment. The door swung open before she could knock.

Panting from her sprint, Rosalind called out, "Harrison? Gabrielle? Where are you?"

Silence answered her. The disarrayed apartment showed signs of struggle—but no occupants.

Dread coiled in Rosalind's stomach. Harrison should have arrived first. Both women had vanished.

She flung open a bedroom door. Gabrielle lay motionless on the hardwood floor.

Rosalind dropped to her knees, shaking Gabrielle's shoulders. "Wake up! What happened?"

Gabrielle's eyelids fluttered. "Help... Harrison..."

"Where is she?" Rosalind demanded, voice shaking.

"They took her... The baby... They want the baby..." Gabrielle slurred before losing consciousness again.

Rosalind's blood ran cold. "Who? Where?"

But Gabrielle had slipped back into oblivion.

Hands trembling, Rosalind yanked out her phone and dialed Nathaniel.

The line rang endlessly. Before the call connected, she screamed into the receiver, "Nathaniel! Answer me! Harrison's in trouble! Your child—your baby's in danger! Pick up, damn it!"

The robotic voicemail greeting mocked her panic. "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

Nathaniel wasn't responding.

Rage and terror warred in Rosalind's chest. How could he ignore this? His own flesh and blood at risk?

She redialed, voice cracking. "That's your baby, Nathaniel! If anything happens to Harrison or your child, you'll never forgive yourself! Answer your goddamn phone!"

Again, only the cold automated message responded.

Desperation clawed at Rosalind's throat. Nathaniel had abandoned them when they needed him most.

With shaking fingers, she called the only person left who could help.

Alistair answered immediately. "Rosalind?"

"Dad! Send help now! Harrison's been taken!" she sobbed.

"What? Dr. Sinclair?" Alarm sharpened Alistair's tone.

"I don't know details, but she's pregnant! We can't lose her or the baby!" Rosalind choked out between gasps.
###Chapter 492

The phone was suddenly wrenched from Nathaniel's grasp. Eleanor's sharp voice pierced through the line.

"Rosalind, what did you just say? Harrison's pregnant?"

Eleanor had been with Alistair when they overheard Rosalind's panicked call.

Rosalind had sworn to keep Harrison's pregnancy a secret, but with lives at stake, promises no longer mattered. Only Harrison and the baby's safety did.

"Yes, Mrs. Eleanor. Harrison's carrying Nathaniel's child. Your first great-grandchild." Rosalind's voice shook with urgency.

Shock, joy, terror—Eleanor's emotions collided. "How could you hide this from me? Breathe, child. We're coming immediately. Have you reached Nathaniel? He's the father!"

"I can't get through. His phone just rings and rings."

Eleanor's cane cracked against the floor. "That worthless boy! His woman and child are in danger, and he's nowhere to be found? Just wait till I get my hands on him!"

The call ended abruptly. Time was slipping away. Both the Falcon and Whitmore families were mobilizing.

But Rosalind's hands wouldn't stop trembling. Thirty minutes had already passed since Harrison was taken. Then—a spark of hope. She dialed with shaking fingers.

The line connected to a voice like winter steel. "Speak."

"Everett," she choked out, "I need you."

A beat of silence. Then: "Location."

She rattled off the address.

"Close by. Be there in five."

As she hung up, Rosalind summoned an ambulance for Gabrielle.

The door burst open before she could pocket her phone. Cold air rushed in with the man who strode through it.

"Details." Everett's tone was clipped, efficient.

Rosalind looked up.

Black coat draped over one arm, military-short hair emphasizing his razor-sharp jawline—Everett Sinclair looked every inch the lethal protector. His speed stunned her.

"My best friend Harrison—she's been taken. And she's pregnant."

Everett's gaze swept the ransacked apartment.

"If they want the baby, they'll need a hospital. Not one of Willowbrook's reputable ones." He pulled out his phone. "Three underground clinics handle this sort of thing."

His calm analysis cut through Rosalind's panic like a scalpel. She nodded frantically. "You're right. We should've—"

"Save the hindsight." Everett crouched, retrieving a splintered wooden shard with partial engraving. He stood, examining it. "I know where they've taken her. Move now, we might intercept."

Hope flared in Rosalind's chest. "You're certain?"

The wail of approaching sirens cut her off. Paramedics loaded Gabrielle onto a stretcher.

Everett jerked his chin toward the street. A black motorcycle idled at the curb. He tossed her a helmet.

"Ride or die time, Fairchild."
###Chapter 493

Rosalind stared at the sleek motorcycle, her eyes wide with fascination.

Everett misinterpreted her hesitation. "It's the fastest way. No traffic jams to slow us down."

A mischievous grin spread across Rosalind's face. "This is incredible! I've always wanted to ride one."

He'd assumed a privileged girl like Rosalind would turn up her nose at motorcycles. Clearly, he'd underestimated her.

Snapping his helmet into place, he gestured impatiently. "Get on. Now."

Rosalind secured her helmet with quick fingers. Every second counted if they were going to save Harrison.

"Ready?" Everett's voice was clipped.

She nodded. In one fluid motion, Everett swung his muscular frame onto the bike, shrugging out of his leather jacket and tossing it to her. "Put this on. Wind chill's brutal."

Her heart fluttered as she caught the still-warm jacket. The scent of his cologne clung to the fabric as she slipped it on and climbed behind him.

The engine roared to life beneath them, vibrating through her body as they shot forward.

Clutching Everett's waist, Rosalind pressed herself against his broad back like a limpet. The unfamiliar sensation of speed made her grip tighten.

"How did you know which hospital?" she shouted over the wind, her lips nearly brushing his ear.

"Recognized the club's make," Everett called back. "Santorin craftsmanship. Whoever hired these thugs has deep pockets. Of Willowbrook's three underground hospitals, this one's the most high-end."

Rosalind's admiration swelled. The man missed nothing.

"You're brilliant," she breathed, nestling closer.

Everett felt her soft curves mold against him and stiffened. He inched forward on the seat, creating precious millimeters of space.

But Rosalind simply closed the gap, arms locking around him like steel bands. "Don't move," she pleaded. "I feel safer like this."

He froze, jaw clenched.

Their motorcycle became a streak of black through Willowbrook's neon-lit streets, turning heads at every intersection.

When they screeched to a halt outside the unmarked hospital, Everett dismounted in one smooth motion. "Let's move."

Rosalind fumbled with her helmet strap. The bike's height made dismounting awkward. She stretched her arms toward him. "Help me down!"

Everett's hands closed around her waist, lifting her effortlessly. The brief contact sent electricity up his arms. "Hurry," he muttered, avoiding her gaze.

"I'm right behind you," Rosalind promised, her small hand slipping into his.

Everett stiffened at the unexpected contact but didn't pull away when her fingers interlaced with his. There was no time to argue.

Outside the operating room, four hulking men in black suits stood guard. Their heads snapped up in unison.

"Identify yourselves," the largest one growled.

Rosalind's grip on Everett's hand tightened. "We've found them! Harrison must be in there."

One guard smirked. "Walk away now, and you might live to see tomorrow."
###Chapter 494

Everett's expression remained unreadable. "What if I refuse to back down?"

One of the masked men lunged at him. "You're digging your own grave!"

Everett swiftly released Rosalind's hand, his voice cutting through the tension. "Stay in the corner and don't move!"

Rosalind knew she was useless in a fight. All she could do was pray that Alistair and Eleanor would arrive soon. She nodded. "Be careful!"

As the attacker charged, Everett's leg shot out in a sharp kick, sending the man crashing to the ground.

The remaining four men exchanged glances, then rushed at him with furious snarls.

Rosalind watched from the sidelines as Everett effortlessly took them on. His movements were fluid, precise—every strike calculated.

His fighting skills were extraordinary. The power in his lean frame was undeniable, every punch making the veins in his arms stand out. His sharp features and close-cropped hair gave him an intimidating presence, the kind that made enemies hesitate.

One by one, the masked men fell. Soon, only one remained standing.

Rosalind's gaze flicked to the operating room door. She couldn't wait any longer. Without hesitation, she bolted forward and shoved it open.

Inside, Harrison lay unconscious on the cold table. A doctor in a white coat stood over her, a syringe in hand, ready to administer anesthesia.

Rosalind's heart lurched. She sprinted toward him, slamming into his side.

The doctor staggered back, hitting the wall. The syringe clattered to the floor.

Tears welled in Rosalind's eyes as she gripped Harrison's limp hand. "Harrison, I'm here!"

Harrison stirred weakly, her fingers tightening around Rosalind's. "Rosalind... save my baby," she whispered.

Rosalind nodded fiercely. "I won't let anything happen to either of you. I promise."

Suddenly, Harrison gasped. "Rosalind—!"

Rosalind spun around just in time to see the doctor lunging at her, syringe raised.

The needle was inches from her skin when a strong hand seized the doctor's wrist, stopping him dead.

She looked up—Everett stood beside her, breathing hard from the fight. His eyes burned with cold fury.

The doctor trembled. "Do you have any idea who you're messing with? Mr. Falcon owns Willowbrook! Cross him, and you're dead!"

Everett didn't flinch. With a sharp twist, he snapped the doctor's wrist, sending the syringe clattering away.

He stepped in front of Rosalind and Harrison, his imposing figure casting a shadow over the room.

The doctor and the remaining men clutched their injuries, their threats hollow. "You're finished! Mr. Falcon will make sure of it!"

A voice, icy and commanding, cut through the air. "Is that so? Anyone who harms my granddaughter-in-law or my great-grandchild will answer to me."

A group of black-suited bodyguards stormed in, forming a protective line. Eleanor and Alistair had arrived.
###Chapter 495
Eleanor and Alistair had finally arrived!

Rosalind was overwhelmed with emotion, tears streaming down her cheeks. She had been terrified beyond belief. One second later, and the precious life inside Harrison would have been lost. The mere thought made her legs tremble violently.

"Mrs. Eleanor! Dad!"

Eleanor rushed straight into the operating room. The moment she saw Harrison, she grasped her cold hand, voice thick with urgency.

"Harrison, I'm here now!"

Harrison's face was ghostly pale, her lips cracked and dry. She had been clinging to consciousness by sheer willpower, but the moment she saw Eleanor, her body finally surrendered. Her tear-streaked eyes fluttered shut as she whispered weakly, "Grandma..."

Eleanor tightened her grip. "It's alright. You're safe now. No one will harm you or my great-grandchild."

Harrison gave the faintest nod before slipping into unconsciousness.

Alistair checked her pulse, exhaling in relief. "Thank heavens. Dr. Sinclair confirmed both mother and child are stable."

Eleanor's gaze turned icy as she took in the unconscious men in black and the trembling doctor on the floor. Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Take them away. I want answers. If they refuse to talk, they won't need their tongues anymore."

Though Eleanor had retired from Falcon Enterprises years ago, her authority remained absolute. The men shuddered under her glare.

"W-We were just following orders—" one stammered.

Before he could finish, they were dragged out. There would be time for interrogations later.

Harrison was moved to a private suite, her exhausted body sinking into deep, undisturbed sleep.

Eleanor kept vigil by her bedside.

The door burst open moments later, Dominic rushing in, breathless.

"Mrs. Eleanor," he panted.

Eleanor's sharp eyes pinned him in place. "Where the hell is Nathaniel? His wife is lying here fighting for her life, and you're the only one who bothered to show up?"

Dominic wiped sweat from his brow, visibly nervous. "Mrs. Eleanor, Mr. Falcon—he's—"

Rosalind cut in, voice trembling with fury. "Mrs. Eleanor, Nathaniel's gone missing! I called him a hundred times—not a single answer! He wasn't here when Harrison and the baby needed him most. This is unforgivable!"

Eleanor's eyes narrowed. "Speak. Now. Where is my grandson?"

Dominic swallowed hard, realizing evasion was pointless. "Mr. Falcon... is with Ms. Isabella."

Eleanor shot to her feet, face contorting in disbelief. "What did you just say? Nathaniel is with Isabella?"

"Yes, Mrs. Eleanor," Dominic confirmed. "Ms. Isabella suddenly complained of chest pains. Mr. Falcon rushed her to the hospital. And... they're in this very building."

Rosalind's hands clenched into fists. "No wonder he ignored all my calls! He was too busy playing knight in shining armor for that woman!"

Eleanor trembled with rage. "That foolish boy—still entangled with Isabella after everything? I'll drag him back myself!"

She stormed out like a hurricane.

Meanwhile, in another VIP suite, Isabella clung to Nathaniel, her grip unyielding. "Nathaniel, stay with me tonight."

Victoria, who had just arrived, exchanged a knowing glance with Isabella. Given the timing, they assumed Harrison had lost the baby—but to be certain, they needed to keep Nathaniel occupied just a little longer.
###Chapter 496

"Mr. Falcon, Isabella becomes extremely dependent when her heart condition flares up. Please stay with her." Victoria pleaded.

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line. An unsettling feeling had been gnawing at him since they arrived at the hospital, growing heavier with each passing minute.

He reached for his phone instinctively, only to find his pocket empty. Realization struck—he'd left it behind in his haste to bring Isabella here.

Not even a single device on him.

Nathaniel turned to Isabella, softening his voice. "Your mother can stay with you. I have urgent documents to review, but I'll return first thing tomorrow."

"No!" Isabella immediately threw herself against him, arms locking around his waist. "I don't want her. I need you, Nathaniel! Stay!"

His hand lifted, poised to gently disentangle himself—

"Disgraceful brat!"

A sharp voice sliced through the room.

Nathaniel spun toward the door, stunned to see his grandmother standing there.

"Eleanor? What are you doing here?"

Both Isabella and Victoria blinked in shock. "Mrs. Eleanor?"

Eleanor stood rigid in the doorway, fury burning in her gaze as she took in the intimate embrace. Without hesitation, she stormed forward, cane raised high—

Thwack!

The first strike landed hard across Nathaniel's back.

"So this is where you've been—entangled with this shameless harlot!"

He didn't flinch, absorbing the blow.

Thwack! Thwack!

Two more strikes followed in quick succession. Isabella and Victoria stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief.

Dominic rushed in, seizing Eleanor's arm. "Mrs. Eleanor, please—control yourself!"

Nathaniel met her gaze. "Grandmother, what is this about? What have I done?"

"What have you done?" Eleanor seethed. "Must I spell it out? You—"

Isabella's trembling voice cut in. "Mrs. Eleanor, stop! He's your grandson!"

Eleanor's glare snapped to her. "Who are you to interrupt family matters? Where are your manners?"

"I—"

"First, you seduce your sister's husband—that's your first sin!" Eleanor's cane whipped through the air again, this time striking Isabella.

Crack!

Isabella shrieked. "Ah! Mrs. Eleanor, why are you—stop!"

But Eleanor wasn't finished. The cane rose and fell with each accusation.

"You fake heart pains to cling to Nathaniel—yet here you stand, alive and scheming! That's your second lie! Your entire family is poison, tormenting Harrison at every turn—that's your third crime! Today, you will answer for it all!"

Isabella paled, writhing in pain. "It hurts! Nathaniel, help me!"

Nathaniel moved to intervene—

Dominic yanked him back. "Sir, you're in no position to protect anyone right now!"

Nathaniel stood paralyzed, speechless.

Victoria finally snapped out of her shock, lunging forward to shield her daughter. "Eleanor, have you lost your mind? Stop this instant!"
###Chapter 497

Eleanor's voice cut through the air like a whip as she turned on Victoria. "How dare you speak to me! You seduced your late husband's brother and betrayed your own daughter! You and Isabella are two of a kind. Today, I'll settle this with both of you!" Her cane struck Victoria with a sharp crack.

The blows rained down mercilessly, each one like a thunderclap. Victoria and Isabella writhed in pain, their cries filling the room. Neither could hold back their tears.

Rosalind stood nearby, watching the scene unfold. She nearly clapped.

Eleanor truly was something else—she knew exactly how to handle things with force.

Exhausted from her outburst, Eleanor finally paused and turned to Nathaniel. "Do you realize what you've done?"

Nathaniel's voice was ice. "Grandmother, if you want to hit me, just say so. No need for excuses."

Eleanor was speechless.

Rosalind stepped forward, pressing Nathaniel. "Do you know what happened to Harrison?"

Harrison?

Nathaniel's tall frame stiffened instantly. "What could have happened? We saw her earlier. She was fine."

She had been fine.

She'd yelled at him, scolded him—full of fire and life.

How could anything be wrong now?

Eleanor's words sliced through the air. "She's in the hospital!"

Nathaniel's voice sharpened. "The hospital? Which ward? What happened?"

Eleanor's eyes burned with disbelief. "She's pregnant. Did you know that?"

The word pregnant hit Nathaniel like a punch to the gut. His hands, hanging at his sides, slowly clenched into fists.

"I know," he muttered.

"You knew she was pregnant, and you're still here with this shameless woman?" Eleanor's voice rose in fury. "Do you have no conscience? Harrison is carrying a child—she's not alone anymore! She needs someone to care for her!"

She couldn't believe Nathaniel could be so cold.

Nathaniel's lips curled into a bitter smile. "If she needs care, she can find someone else to provide it."

Eleanor's finger trembled as she pointed at him. "What are you saying? That child is yours! Is this how you plan to act as a father?"

Nathaniel met her gaze, his own dark and unreadable. "Did she tell you the child was mine?"

"She's unconscious—she hasn't said anything. But that's not the point! What is wrong with you? Do you honestly believe that baby isn't yours? Who else could the father be?" Eleanor snapped.

Nathaniel said nothing, his expression shuttered.

Rosalind narrowed her eyes. "Are you implying you don't think it's yours?"

Eleanor gasped, horrified. "Is that what you think? You actually suspect Harrison is carrying another man's child?"

Nathaniel looked away, silent.

Then—crack!

The sound of a slap echoed through the room.

Eleanor had struck Nathaniel across the face, the force snapping his head to the side.

The room fell into heavy silence.

Victoria and Isabella exchanged uneasy glances, their thoughts unspoken but loud.

Dominic, frozen in fear, didn't make a sound. Eleanor and Nathaniel had always been close—this was the first time he'd ever seen her strike him.

Eleanor pointed at Nathaniel, her voice shaking with rage. "You ungrateful boy! How dare you think that? That child is yours!"

Nathaniel slowly turned his face back, his expression colder than ever. He had always been composed, refined—a man of control.

He was certain the child wasn't his. But he hadn't said it outright.

Not yet.
###Chapter 498

Nathaniel's eyes locked onto Eleanor, his voice trembling. "Grandmother..."

Rosalind spun toward Nathaniel, her gaze piercing. "Nathaniel, who's been poisoning your mind? Was it her?"

Her finger jabbed accusingly at Isabella.

Isabella paled, her words stumbling. "I-"

Rosalind's expression darkened with realization. "Of course! Isabella must have planted doubts in your mind about Harrison's baby, didn't she?"

Eleanor started to speak, but Rosalind urgently pulled her aside. "Mrs. Eleanor, we need to leave."

"But..." Eleanor hesitated.

"Trust me on this. Now!" Rosalind insisted, guiding her toward the exit.

At the threshold, Rosalind turned back to Nathaniel, her voice icy. "Harrison was kidnapped. They took her to an operating room to forcibly terminate her pregnancy!"

Nathaniel went rigid, shock rippling through him. "What did you say?"

Rosalind's laugh held no humor. "We don't know who ordered it yet, but..."

Her gaze swept over Isabella and Victoria with deliberate meaning. "We've apprehended the perpetrators. Soon we'll know exactly who wanted to harm Harrison and her child."

With that, Rosalind ushered Eleanor out.

Nathaniel turned to Dominic, his voice strained. "Is this true?"

Dominic nodded grimly. "Every word, Mr. Falcon. Ms. Harrison endured something horrific tonight. Kidnapped, taken to surgery for a forced abortion. Mrs. Eleanor and Professor Alistair both intervened. One minute later, and Ms. Harrison and the baby would have been lost."

Nathaniel stepped forward, urgency tightening his features. "Her condition? Is she injured?"

Dominic shifted uncomfortably. "Unknown, sir. Mrs. Eleanor had me removed from the room. If you're concerned about Ms. Harrison, perhaps you should-"

Nathaniel was already striding toward the door before Dominic finished speaking.

Isabella's sharp cry cut through the air. "Nathaniel! Stop! You promised to sever ties with her! You can't go!"

Her words found no purchase. Nathaniel didn't so much as glance back as he stormed out.

Dominic followed silently.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella's voice cracked with fury, her fists clenching at her sides.

Victoria's face twisted with worry. "This is disastrous. The termination failed. No wonder those kidnappers and doctors stopped answering my calls."

Isabella's mind raced, the implications crashing over her. Harrison had been saved. That dangerous life still grew inside her.

"Why? Why couldn't they finish it? That child is a catastrophe waiting to happen. If Nathaniel learns the truth... We're losing control of this situation!"

Isabella clutched Victoria's arm, her voice shaking with terror.

"Mother, what now? What if those men talk? Eleanor and Professor Whitmore are involved. Nathaniel's gone to Harrison. If they discover our role in this... Eleanor will destroy us!"

Isabella winced, phantom pains from Eleanor's cane still fresh. The mere thought of Eleanor's wrath made her blood run cold.
###Chapter 499

Victoria's face was stern, but she gave Isabella's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Don't worry. I promise the kidnappers and the doctor won't double-cross us."

Nathaniel's heart raced as he approached Harrison's private hospital room. His fingers trembled as he reached for the doorknob, desperate to see her, but Rosalind blocked his path before he could enter.

She planted herself firmly in his way. "Stop right there!"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed in frustration. "Move aside. I need to see her."

Rosalind's piercing gaze never wavered. "Why bother now? You weren't there when she needed you most. Harrison wouldn't want to see you anyway."

His jaw clenched in silence.

Rosalind's voice softened slightly, but her words cut deep. "I'll never understand what hold Isabella has over you. How could you choose her over Harrison? You've broken her heart completely this time."

Nathaniel's voice cracked with emotion. "Rosalind, you don't understand the whole story."

"That's exactly the problem," she shot back. "You never explain anything! Just answer me this - do you truly love Isabella that much?"

She needed the truth from him. She couldn't believe Nathaniel had completely abandoned Harrison.

Nathaniel's hands balled into tight fists. "It's more complicated than love. Isabella is my responsibility."

"Responsibility?" Rosalind's confusion deepened. "What does that even mean?"

Nathaniel avoided explaining further. "Please, just let me see her."

"Not until you tell me everything," Rosalind stood her ground. "No explanations, no access. You won't get past me."

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he hesitated. "Isabella once saved my life."

"What?" Rosalind froze, disbelief flashing across her face. Isabella? The woman who had abandoned Nathaniel when he was at his lowest? That was impossible.

Her brows knitted in suspicion. "When? How?"

Nathaniel took a deep breath. "Years ago, I was badly injured in the wilderness. Isabella found me unconscious in the forest. She hid me in a cave and nursed me back to health. I made a promise then - to always protect her. That's why I can't abandon her now. As for Harrison..."

His gaze drifted toward the closed hospital door. There could be no future between them now. Not with Isabella in the picture.

Yet when he'd heard about Harrison's kidnapping, an unexpected pang of concern had struck him.

Even knowing the child wasn't his, he still cared deeply for her.

Rosalind stood speechless, struggling to process his words. She didn't believe a word of it.

The idea of Isabella performing such a selfless act was laughable. There had to be more to the story.

Sometimes those too close to a situation couldn't see the truth clearly. While Nathaniel remained blind, Rosalind sensed something was off.

She resolved to tell Harrison everything once she woke up. Harrison was clever - she'd figure out the truth.

With obvious reluctance, Rosalind stepped aside. "Fine. You can see her. But keep quiet - she's extremely weak."

"Thank you," Nathaniel murmured gratefully.

His hand trembled as he turned the doorknob and stepped inside.

The sight that greeted him made his breath catch.

Harrison lay motionless in the hospital bed.

Her porcelain face was deathly pale, long lashes resting against colorless cheeks. She slept deeply, exhausted from her ordeal.

Eleanor had been keeping vigil at Harrison's bedside. The moment she spotted Nathaniel, her eyes flashed with fury.

"Who let you in here?" she hissed through clenched teeth.
###Chapter 500

Nathaniel stood frozen, feeling like prey surrounded by predators.

No one wanted him there anymore.

"Grandmother, I just need to see Harrison," he murmured.

Eleanor exhaled sharply, her patience frayed. "Fine. One look. That's it."

Nathaniel perched on the edge of the bed, his eyes locked on Harrison's delicate features. Without realizing, his fingers twitched toward her.

Eleanor slapped his hand away with a sharp crack. "I said look, not touch!"

Nathaniel clenched his jaw and withdrew. "What did the doctor say? The baby—is it okay?"

Eleanor leveled him with a glare. "They're both fine. Not that you deserve to know."

His lips pressed into a thin line. Silence stretched between them.

Then Eleanor's voice softened, though her words cut deep. "Harrison's carrying your child. Don't you want to be a father?" The question hung in the air, barely audible under the dim hospital lights.

Nathaniel hesitated. "I never considered it."

A slow smile curved Eleanor's lips. "Then start now. Picture it—a little boy or girl with your eyes or Harrison's smile, calling you 'Daddy,' begging to be held." Her expression warmed at the thought of finally cradling her great-grandchild.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "You still believe that baby is mine? You really think you're getting a great-grandchild?"

Eleanor blinked, startled.

"I've told you," Nathaniel said, frustration simmering beneath his calm tone. "That child isn't mine. Wake up."

He was doing her a favor. The higher she let her hopes climb, the harder the fall would be.

Eleanor's hand shot out, smacking the back of his head. "How did our family end up with someone like you?"

Nathaniel rubbed the spot, fighting a smirk. "Hit me again, and I might hit back."

That was the last straw. "Out! I never should've let you stay! Get out!"

Two seconds later, Nathaniel found himself in the hallway, the door slamming behind him.

Thud.

He exhaled sharply, irritation coiling tighter.

Rosalind leaned against the wall, smirking. "That was fast. Grandma kick you out?"

Nathaniel shot her a flat look. "Where are the kidnappers and the doctor? Have they talked?"

Just then, Alistair approached, his expression grim.

"Nathaniel," he greeted.

Nathaniel nodded. "Uncle Alistair."

Alistair ran a hand through his hair. "We have them in custody, but they're not talking. Whoever's behind this—they're protected."

The door creaked open. Eleanor stepped out, determination etched into every line of her face.

She turned to Nathaniel, her gaze piercing. "Answer me this—if we find who did this, will you let them walk away?"

Nathaniel frowned. "No."

Eleanor's eyes narrowed. "Then answer this—what if it's Isabella?"

"Isabella?" Nathaniel stared at her, disbelief flashing in his eyes. "You're telling me Isabella orchestrated this?"

Eleanor and Rosalind exchanged a loaded glance.

"Yes," Eleanor said. "We think she sent those men to kidnap Harrison—to get rid of the baby."

Rosalind crossed her arms. "So, Nathaniel—if it's Isabella, will you protect her?"
###Chapter 501

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he shook his head in disbelief. "It can't be Isabella."

Eleanor let out a derisive snort. "Do you really have that much faith in her?"

"This isn't about faith," Nathaniel countered sharply, his tone unyielding. "It's about motive. The child Harrison is carrying belongs to Oliver. Isabella has no quarrel with Oliver. Why would she go to such lengths to eliminate his child? Does that make any sense to you?"

Eleanor's gaze sharpened, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. "True, Isabella wouldn't have a reason to harm Oliver's child—unless, of course, the child Harrison is carrying isn't actually Oliver's, right?"

Nathaniel stiffened, the implication sinking in. His eyes flickered between Eleanor and Rosalind, confusion darkening his expression.

"What exactly are you implying?"

Both women were well aware of Nathaniel's misconception regarding the child. He had always believed it wasn't his.

Now, they decided it was time for him to uncover the truth on his own.

"We're not implying anything," Eleanor replied smoothly, her voice laced with quiet certainty. "The truth speaks for itself. Question the kidnappers and the doctor. Find out who's truly orchestrating this. If it turns out to be Isabella, you might want to reconsider who the father of that child really is."

With that, Eleanor and Rosalind stepped into the hospital room, leaving Nathaniel rooted in place.

A sharp realization struck him. He wasn't a fool—he understood the unspoken suggestion that the child was his.

But how?

He had seen the pregnancy report. The timeline didn't add up.

Alistair cast him a sidelong glance. "You're an intelligent man. How did emotion cloud your judgment so thoroughly?"

Nathaniel didn't answer. Instead, his voice turned icy as he muttered, "I'm going to find out who's really behind this."

Nathaniel strode into the dimly lit interrogation room where the kidnappers and the doctor were bound, crouched on the floor. The moment they saw him, fear flashed in their eyes.

Everyone knew Nathaniel—the most powerful man in Willowbrook. His reputation was unshakable.

Dominic pulled out a chair for him. Nathaniel sat, his piercing gaze sweeping over the prisoners like a blade.

"So," he began, voice dangerously calm, "who's the mastermind? I hear none of you are willing to talk."

Silence.

Dominic handed him several manila envelopes. Nathaniel took one, casually flipping it open and extracting the first file.

"Ethan Blackwood, from Pinecrest. You have an eight-year-old daughter, just started first grade, correct?"

Ethan's face paled, panic lacing his voice. "M-Mr. Hawk, please—she's just a child! Don't involve her! I beg you, don't hurt her!"

Nathaniel opened another envelope, this time pulling out a document on Dr. Julian Whitmore.

"Dr. Whitmore, a medical doctor with a PhD. Former chief physician at a prestigious hospital. But you've been accepting bribes, performing illegal procedures. If this gets out, your career is over."

Julian trembled, immediately dropping to his knees. "Mr. Hawk, forgive me! I made a terrible mistake! I never meant to cross you—I swear, if I'd known you were involved, I wouldn't have dared!"

Nathaniel's cold gaze swept over them, his expression unreadable. A faint, chilling smile touched his lips—one that barely qualified as amusement.

"I have everything on you—your weaknesses, your secrets. I'm not here to offer mercy. If you were bold enough to commit a crime, you should be prepared to face the consequences." His voice dropped lower, laced with steel. "But I'll give you one chance. The first one to tell me who's behind this walks free."

A beat of silence.

Then, his tone turned lethal. "Remember—only one of you gets that privilege."
###Chapter 502

The kidnappers exchanged panicked glances with Dr. Julian Whitmore. Their carefully maintained facade of calm shattered instantly.

"I'll talk, Mr. Falcon!" Julian blurted out, his voice trembling.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a cold, knowing smile. "Excellent. Start talking. Who hired you? Who orchestrated this entire scheme?"

Julian swallowed hard, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "Mr. Falcon, someone offered an exorbitant sum to purchase the child in Harrison's womb. That person is—"

Before he could utter the name, a violent cough wracked his body, blood spraying from his lips.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Medics! Now!"

A team of doctors rushed in, but it was too late. One by one, the other kidnappers collapsed, crimson staining their lips as they convulsed on the floor.

The lead physician straightened, his face grim. "Mr. Falcon, they've been poisoned. There's nothing we can do."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his piercing gaze burning with fury.

Dominic stepped closer, voice low. "The mastermind moved faster than we anticipated. They eliminated loose ends. Whoever did this is ruthless."

Nathaniel had underestimated their enemy's audacity—to strike right under his nose.

Now, every lead had vanished.

He turned on his heel and strode out.

Eleanor and Rosalind were waiting anxiously in the hall.

"Did you get answers? Who's responsible?" Eleanor demanded.

Nathaniel shook his head.

Dominic quickly recounted the events inside.

Eleanor's cane struck the marble floor with a sharp crack. "Vicious tactics. I never imagined she'd go this far!"

Rosalind clenched her fists. "All traces are gone. We're back to square one."

They had been so close—only to have the truth slip through their fingers.

At that moment, Alistair approached. "Dr. Sinclair is awake!"

Eleanor and Rosalind brightened immediately. "Harrison's awake? Thank heavens! Let's go!"

They hurried toward the hospital room.

Nathaniel froze for a heartbeat. Harrison was conscious?

Then he moved, following swiftly behind them.

Inside the ward, Harrison was propped up against the pillows. Eleanor and Rosalind flanked her bedside, their expressions a mix of relief and lingering worry.

"Harrison, darling! You gave us such a fright," Eleanor murmured, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.

Harrison managed a weak smile. "I'm alright. And Gabrielle...?"

Rosalind squeezed her hand reassuringly. "She's fine. Just next door. The doctors said she inhaled a sedative—she'll wake up by morning."

Harrison exhaled in relief. The thought of endangering her closest friend had haunted her.

Her fingers drifted to her stomach. She had checked her pulse earlier—her baby was safe.

They had survived.

Eleanor's tone shifted slightly. "Harrison."

Harrison met her gaze.

"Why didn't you tell me about the pregnancy? I had to find out from someone else."

She knew how desperately Eleanor wanted a great-grandchild. But with tensions between her and Nathaniel, revealing the truth would have complicated everything.

"I'm sorry, Grandmother..." Harrison whispered.

Eleanor's stern expression softened. She reached out, gently touching Harrison's abdomen. "My dear girl, I should be thanking you. You're carrying the future of the Falcon family."

Just then, Rosalind noticed the tall figure lingering in the doorway. "Mr. Falcon, are you just going to stand there?"

Harrison looked up.

Nathaniel.

He stood motionless, his broad frame filling the doorway, those intense eyes locked onto hers.

Their gazes held—neither willing to look away first.


###Chapter 503

Nathaniel stood rigid in the doorway, his piercing gaze locked onto Harrison. Every muscle in his body was taut, as if fighting the urge to cross the threshold.

Harrison couldn't bear the intensity of his stare. She turned her face away abruptly, breaking their connection.

Nathaniel didn't move.

The tense silence was shattered by Victoria's shrill voice echoing down the hall. "Mr. Falcon! Isabella's having another heart episode! She's asking for you—hurry!"

Victoria had come to fetch Nathaniel yet again with news of Isabella's latest medical crisis.

Eleanor and Rosalind exchanged glances. Eleanor scoffed. "There she goes again. Why don't you run along to your precious Isabella?"

Rosalind muttered under her breath, "That heart condition's been acting up for years, yet she's still breathing just fine. Some miracle."

Nathaniel remained motionless, his eyes never leaving Harrison's profile.

Harrison kept her gaze lowered as Rosalind handed her a glass of warm water. She took slow, deliberate sips, her delicate features illuminated by the soft lamplight. The golden glow made her appear almost translucent.

Victoria's voice grew more insistent. "Mr. Falcon! Are you listening? Isabella needs you now!"

With one last lingering look at Harrison, Nathaniel turned on his heel and left.

He was really going to her.

Eleanor's lips pressed into a thin line. "He actually went. Good riddance!"

Harrison reached for Eleanor's hand, her touch gentle. "It's alright. Don't upset yourself. Your health comes first."

Eleanor sighed deeply. "I should have sent that girl abroad when I had the chance. None of this would be happening if not for her."

A faint, bittersweet smile touched Harrison's lips. "It's not that simple, Eleanor. Love isn't something you can control. Nathaniel's heart belongs to Isabella. Even if you'd sent her away, he would have followed."

"But how could he possibly love someone like her?" Eleanor wondered aloud.

Rosalind suddenly spoke up. "Harrison, did you know Isabella once saved Nathaniel's life?"

"What?" Eleanor looked stunned. "That scheming girl? Impossible!"

Harrison shook her head slowly. "No... I didn't know that."

Rosalind settled on the edge of the bed. "He told me today, right outside this door. He said the only reason he tolerates Isabella is because she rescued him years ago. He feels indebted to her."

Harrison's brow furrowed. Isabella saved Nathaniel?

She had always believed she was the one who'd saved him. Had Isabella done the same?

Just how many times had Nathaniel nearly died?

Her mind raced. "When did this happen? Where?"

"Years ago, apparently. He was badly wounded and stumbled into some woods. Isabella found him there, took him to a cave, and nursed him back to health. He promised her that day he'd take her home and never abandon her."

As Rosalind finished speaking, Harrison's eyes widened in shock. Isabella had saved Nathaniel in a cave?

That couldn't be.

That was her story—her memory. Not Isabella's!

"Harrison? Are you alright?" Eleanor asked, concern lacing her voice.

Harrison blinked, coming back to herself. "Rosalind... he really said that?"

Rosalind nodded firmly. "Word for word, right outside this room. He said his relationship with Isabella wasn't just about love. That she was his responsibility—that he couldn't walk away."

Suddenly, Harrison let out a soft, broken laugh. Even as the sound escaped her lips, her clear eyes filled with tears. Within moments, they spilled over, tracing silent paths down her pale cheeks.
###Chapter 504

"Harrison, why are those tears falling? You shouldn't be putting yourself through this." Eleanor swiftly pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed at her cheeks.

Harrison let out a bitter laugh. The pieces finally clicked into place. Isabella had been impersonating her all along!

For years, Isabella had stolen her identity, pretending to be the one who had rescued Nathaniel in that cave. Nathaniel had always believed it was Isabella who saved him.

Her fingers brushed against her bare neck. The crystal pendant Nathaniel had given her—the token of their bond—was missing.

She hadn’t worn it in weeks, but she distinctly remembered leaving it in her apartment.

"Harrison, what’s happening? You're scaring me," Rosalind said, gripping her arm.

The realization hit Harrison like a tidal wave, but she steadied herself. "I'm fine. Isabella is a fraud!"

Rosalind frowned. "What do you mean?"

Harrison straightened, her voice firm. "Isabella didn’t save Nathaniel in that cave. I did."

Rosalind shot to her feet, eyes wide. "Are you saying she stole your identity? That’s despicable! What a shameless liar!"

Eleanor smacked her palm against the table. "I knew it! Someone as selfish as Isabella would’ve run at the first sign of danger. Nathaniel’s been fooled all these years!"

Rosalind clenched her fists. "We have to expose her—now!"

Harrison nodded. "I have proof. The crystal pendant Nathaniel gave me—it’s in my apartment. Once he sees it, he’ll know the truth."

Rosalind hesitated. "You should rest first. We can go later."

Harrison shook her head.

She couldn’t wait another second. Isabella had stolen everything—her identity, her past, her love. She had to end this now.

"I’m fine. I’m a doctor—I know my limits. The baby’s safe. I need to go."

Eleanor sighed. "Fine. I’ll call the car. The sooner we deal with that viper, the better."

Thirty minutes later, Harrison stood in The Regal Residences, searching frantically for the pendant.

But it was gone.

Rosalind frowned. "You’re sure you left it here?"

Harrison’s stomach twisted. "It was right here. I never misplace things."

She tore through drawers, but the pendant had vanished.

Eleanor’s eyes narrowed. "Do you think someone took it?"

Harrison froze.

Isabella had been here days ago—standing right where the pendant had been.

If Isabella knew about the pendant, she would’ve stolen it.

Harrison let out a hollow laugh. Not only had Isabella stolen her identity, but she’d taken the one piece of evidence that could prove it.

Rosalind gripped her shoulder. "Did you find it?"

Harrison stood, her voice icy. "We can stop looking. Isabella took it."
###Chapter 505
"Isabella stole the crystal pendant?"

"That conniving little snake! She has no shame!"
Eleanor and Rosalind seethed, their tones laced with venom.

Harrison allowed a cold smirk to play on her lips. "Does she truly believe that trinket will protect her? The truth has a way of surfacing, no matter how deep you bury it. Let's return to the hospital."

"Agreed."

In the sterile hospital room, Isabella clung to Victoria's hand with desperate intensity. "Mother, you did send for Nathaniel, didn't you?"

Victoria patted her daughter's wrist reassuringly. "Of course, darling. He's speaking with Dominic in the hallway. He'll be here momentarily."

Isabella exhaled sharply. "Good. As long as he still believes I'm his savior, he'll never leave me."

Her gaze turned sharp as she studied Victoria. "And the kidnappers? The doctor?"

A self-satisfied smile curled Victoria's lips. "Handled. They were sedated before the operation even began. Even if apprehended, they'll never speak. No traces lead back to us this time."

After past failures, Victoria had invested heavily in ensuring this operation was airtight. Yet Isabella still fidgeted anxiously. "Everything went perfectly, yet Harrison escaped unharmed—with the child still intact. And with Eleanor here... What if Nathaniel discovers the baby is his?"

Victoria's expression hardened. "Compose yourself, Isabella. Maintain control. His heart belongs to you—that's all that matters."

Isabella gave a tight nod just as the door swung open.

Nathaniel entered, his chiseled features unreadable.

Instantly, Isabella transformed—her posture wilting, her voice trembling. "Where were you? Did you go see her?"

Nathaniel sat stiffly on the bed's edge, his silence louder than words.

Isabella's lower lip quivered dramatically. "My chest hurts terribly. Promise you won't leave me again. I can't bear to be—"

She abruptly threw herself against him, her arms locking around his torso like steel bands.

Nathaniel stiffened, his mind flooded with unbidden images—Harrison's luminous eyes, her fragile strength when she'd faced him earlier.

He'd pledged his loyalty to Isabella, yet his traitorous heart refused to obey.

Gently, he tried to disentangle himself. "You should rest if you're unwell."

"I need you to hold me," Isabella whined, clinging tighter.

A sharp gasp sliced through the moment. Victoria's voice dripped false concern. "Harrison? What are you doing here?"

Nathaniel's head snapped toward the doorway. His breath caught.

Harrison stood framed in the threshold, her presence like a lightning strike.

Rosalind's icy voice cut through the tension. "Spare us the theatrics. Harrison wants nothing from your pitiful displays!"

Victoria's eyes flashed with barely contained rage. "Mind your tongue!"

How she loathed this meddling girl. If not for Rosalind's interference, Harrison would still be trapped.

Forcing a saccharine smile, Victoria purred, "Harrison dear, are you here to check on Isabella? As you can see, Mr. Falcon is... otherwise occupied."

Harrison's piercing gaze locked onto Nathaniel, who remained frozen on the bed with Isabella's arms possessively wrapped around him. The air thickened with unspoken accusations.
###Chapter 506
Nathaniel attempted to gently disentangle himself from Isabella's grasp, but her fingers only tightened around him. She arched her neck, flashing Harrison a dazzling, victorious smile as she nestled against his chest.

It was a deliberate provocation, dripping with arrogant satisfaction.

Harrison's face remained impassive, revealing nothing.

Isabella kept her eyes locked on Harrison, her voice laced with playful malice. "Did you come here for me?"

Harrison didn't answer. Instead, her gaze slid to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, we need to talk."

Nathaniel hadn't anticipated Harrison confronting him so bluntly. He shifted to rise from the bed.

But Isabella clung to him, refusing to release him. "Nathaniel, don't go! My heart still hurts..."

Rosalind, losing patience, snapped, "Enough with the act!"

Still, Isabella held on. "You promised you'd stay with me. I can't bear you leaving."

Nathaniel's brows furrowed in irritation. "Let go. I'll be back shortly."

"No," she whined petulantly. "I won't."

Isabella shot Harrison a defiant glare.

Harrison's piercing, crystalline eyes met hers with glacial composure. She looked down at Isabella with an expression laced with quiet derision.

So this was the extent of her schemes?

The stolen identity, the pilfered heirloom pendant—Harrison had unraveled every deceit.

She regarded Isabella like a trivial nuisance before turning to Nathaniel with an icy smile. "I'll be waiting outside."

Without another word, Harrison strode out.

Rosalind shot Nathaniel a pointed look. "You'd better follow her. What she has to say is important—ignore it, and you'll regret it forever."

Then she hurried after Harrison.

Nathaniel's gaze hardened as it landed on Isabella. "Isabella. Release me."

His tone brooked no argument.

Reluctantly, Isabella loosened her grip. Nathaniel stood, his long strides carrying him swiftly toward the door.

Victoria, watching him leave, frowned. "What could Harrison possibly need to discuss with Mr. Falcon?"

Isabella's eyes gleamed with certainty. "What could she possibly know? She has no proof I took her place or orchestrated any of this. She's just shamelessly clinging to Nathaniel, trying to manipulate him!"

Her fists clenched, jealousy seeping into her voice.

"Harrison, why won't you just vanish?"

Harrison had returned to her private hospital suite. Moments later, Nathaniel arrived.

Eleanor and Rosalind, sensing the tension, discreetly exited to give them privacy. Nathaniel stepped inside to find Harrison standing by the window, her dark hair cascading like silk over her shoulders. The pale sunlight caught its strands, casting an almost otherworldly glow around her.

She wore a hospital gown, but a white coat draped over her shoulders lent her a fragile elegance. Nathaniel approached, the silence between them thick with unspoken tension.

He was the first to speak. "You wanted to talk?"

Harrison turned slowly, her luminous eyes locking onto his. "Yes. I have a question for you."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "And that is?"

Her gaze never wavered. "Tell me about you and Isabella."

Nathaniel stiffened, caught off guard. He knew Harrison wasn't one for idle gossip—she'd never before asked about his relationship with Isabella. Cautiously, he replied, "What do you want to know?"

Harrison met his eyes steadily. "I heard Isabella once saved your life. Is that true?"

Nathaniel's tall frame tensed. "Did Rosalind tell you that?"

Harrison nodded. "Yes. She mentioned that years ago, when you were injured, Isabella rescued you in a cave."


###Chapter 507

At the recollection of those distant memories, Nathaniel's typically stern expression softened visibly.

"Indeed, it was decades ago. I was gravely wounded and stumbled into those woods. Isabella was the one who rescued me. Without her intervention, I wouldn't be standing here today. She granted me a second life."

Harrison let out a hollow laugh, the sound laced with decades of unshed tears. Her chest constricted with an indescribable ache—sharp as shattered glass yet tingling like frostbite.

All these years, she'd believed he'd forgotten.
She'd convinced herself she meant nothing to him.

Yet the truth was far more cruel.
He'd remembered all along.
Carried her in his heart through the passing years.

To discover their love had been mutual—it should have been beautiful. If only he hadn't mistaken another for her.

Tilting her chin up, Harrison met his gaze with glistening eyes. "Do you recall what you promised in that cave?"

Nathaniel nodded solemnly. "I vowed to take her with me. To build her a home. Swore I'd never abandon her." His intense stare burned into her.

"All these years, I've kept that oath. I found Isabella. Brought her into my world. Watched her blossom beside me." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Sometimes it felt like tending the rarest orchid—showering her with every affection, every indulgence in my power."

His hand came to rest gently on Harrison's shoulder.

"Now do you understand? I've no wish to be your adversary. But I cannot forsake Isabella. She may be flawed—capricious, even manipulative at times—but she's mine."

Mine.

The word shattered something in Harrison. Her pale eyelids flushed crimson as twin diamonds formed at her lash line. Through the watery haze, she studied the man before her.

He'd kept every promise.
Never abandoned her.
Nurtured her from afar.

The resentment bled from Harrison's heart like ink in water. The bitter truth? He'd brought her home long ago.

Only... he'd brought the wrong woman.

Now it was far too late.
A lifetime of missed chances stretched between them.

Nathaniel froze as crystalline drops traced paths down Harrison's cheeks. Bewilderment creased his brow. What could possibly wound her so deeply now?

His thumb brushed away a tear, calloused skin catching on silk. "Harrison, I'm sorry," he rasped, "but my heart belongs to Isabella."

Belonged to Isabella.

Through the blur, Harrison managed a ghost of a smile. "Very well. I'll treat Isabella's cardiac condition."

Nathaniel recoiled as if struck. After her earlier refusal, this sudden acquiescence made no sense. "Why the change—"

"Where's Oliver?" Harrison interrupted. "I need to hear his voice. Need confirmation he's unharmed."

Oliver's name doused whatever warmth had flickered between them. Reality crashed back—Harrison carried another man's child now.

Nathaniel's grip slackened. "He's safe." Retrieving his phone, he dialed with sharp jabs. "Put Oliver on."

Within moments, that familiar teasing baritone crackled through the speaker. "Well well, Mr. Falcon. Planning to release your hostage anytime soon?"

Silently, Nathaniel passed the device.

Harrison clutched it like a lifeline. "Oliver!"

"Harrison!" The sheer joy in his voice could have powered cities.
###Chapter 508

"Are you alright, Oliver? Have they been feeding you properly? Is anyone giving you trouble?" Harrison's voice trembled with concern as she gripped the phone.

Nathaniel observed the genuine worry etched across Harrison's face. The way her fingers tightened around the receiver, the slight tremble in her lower lip - every detail screamed authentic distress.

He turned his back abruptly, unable to bear the sight any longer.

"I'm perfectly fine. Stop fretting." Oliver's cheerful tone carried through the line, laced with his usual playful humor. "Mr. Falcon has been surprisingly hospitable since my arrival. I might need to start watching my waistline."

Harrison knew he was putting on a brave front. A small, bittersweet smile curved her lips. "Just hold on a little longer. I've consented to perform Isabella's surgery. Once it's over, you'll be released."

Silence stretched between them. Oliver never questioned her decisions - his loyalty was absolute. "Understood. Don't waste your energy worrying about me. I'm managing splendidly."

Harrison stared at the glittering skyline beyond the window, her reflection ghostly against the city lights. "After the operation... let's leave Willowbrook. I don't want to stay here anymore."

Nathaniel's broad shoulders tensed at her words, his entire body going rigid. She wanted to escape.

Why this sudden reversal? You rejected my offer to leave before—

Oliver's voice interrupted his thoughts.

Harrison studied her pale reflection, her whisper barely audible. "Because I'll have settled all unfinished business. It's time for me to move on."

"Very well," Oliver agreed instantly. "I'll personally escort you wherever you wish to go."

The call ended. Harrison returned the phone to Nathaniel with a quiet "Thank you."

His fingers brushed against hers as he took it back.

Harrison straightened her spine, her tone turning businesslike. "I'll operate on Isabella, but first, you must release Oliver. I need to see him safe before I proceed."

Nathaniel gave a single nod. "Agreed."

She rose from her seat, her dismissal clear. "You may leave now. We've nothing further to discuss."

But Nathaniel remained rooted in place, his stormy gaze fixed on her. "Are you truly leaving?"

Harrison didn't look up. "Yes."

His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Where will you go?"

When she finally met his eyes, her gaze was glacial. "That's no concern of yours."

Nathaniel's hand clenched around the phone until his knuckles turned white.

Harrison arched a brow. "Was there something else?"

He opened his mouth, then hesitated. Seeing the defensive wall in her posture, remembering their current circumstances and Isabella's looming presence, the words died unspoken.

Nathaniel turned on his heel and strode away.

The moment the door closed, Rosalind slipped inside. "Did you tell Mr. Falcon the truth? About being his savior all those years ago? Do you think he'd believe you now?"

Harrison's lips curved in a humorless smile. "No."

Rosalind's eyes widened. "Why not, Harrison? This is your chance!"

"It's not the right moment," Harrison explained calmly. "Isabella still possesses the crystal pendant. Premature revelation might alert her. I've already agreed to the surgery."

Understanding dawned in Rosalind's sharp gaze. "You have a plan."

Harrison's eyes turned to ice, her voice razor-sharp. "When I saved Nathaniel years ago, there was a witness. I've dispatched someone to locate him. On the day of Isabella's operation, that witness will appear. Her deception will be exposed."

Rosalind's grin turned predatory. "Perfect! She's stolen your identity, your rightful place all these years. It's time she paid for everything she's taken."

Harrison's expression darkened, a dangerous glint in her eyes. "Do you know how to truly destroy someone? Lift them to the highest peak, let them believe they've won everything... then rip it all away. Watch them shatter when they hit the ground. That's the price Isabella will pay for impersonating me."


###Chapter 509
Rosalind's heart raced with anticipation. She knew Harrison possessed the perfect strategy to expose Isabella, the deceitful pretender.

The mere thought of Isabella impersonating Harrison and flaunting false authority made Rosalind's blood boil. The moment Harrison revealed Isabella's true nature would be absolutely breathtaking.

Yet...

Rosalind studied Harrison's face, her expression turning solemn. "What about Nathaniel? What are your plans regarding him?"

Nathaniel remained oblivious that Harrison was the one who had saved him years ago. How would he react upon discovering the truth? What would Harrison do when that day arrived?

Harrison's voice was barely above a whisper. "I'm exhausted."

She wanted to escape.

Loving Nathaniel all these years had drained her.

This world had never truly been her home, but Nathaniel's presence had anchored her. Now, she was ready to let go.

"But he's been manipulated by Isabella all this time. He's blind to reality, yet he's also a victim. He doesn't know it's you," Rosalind argued, defending Nathaniel. She still clung to hope that Harrison and Nathaniel could reconcile.

Harrison shook her head. "Let's not discuss this further."

Rosalind exhaled in resignation. "Fine. You should rest. Lie down."

Harrison settled onto the bed, closing her eyes.

Meanwhile, in Isabella's hospital room, Nathaniel had returned.

Isabella immediately pounced. "What did Harrison say to you?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

"Did she slander me again? Try to seduce you? She's vile. You must stay away from her!" Isabella's words tumbled out, defensive and frantic.

Victoria chimed in, "Harrison is cunning and vindictive. She manipulates people effortlessly. Don't be fooled by her innocent facade."

Nathaniel lifted his gaze, his icy stare sweeping over them. "Harrison has agreed to perform the heart surgery."

What?

Both women gasped, their faces lighting up with glee. "Really? She'll do it?"

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Yes."

Victoria beamed. "Marvelous! You're saved, Isabella! Harrison finally agreed."

Isabella sighed in relief. "I'll be healthy again! Free from this wretched condition."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Minutes ago, you were vilifying her."

Isabella froze, recalling their harsh words. She forced a laugh. "Nathaniel—"

He cut her off. "Rest. I'm leaving."

Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel.

"Wait!" Isabella cried desperately. "You promised to stay! Nathaniel? Nathaniel!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. Nathaniel vanished down the hallway.

He was gone.

Isabella's face fell. "Mother, what's wrong with him? Why is he so distant?"

Victoria, however, was euphoric. "Mr. Falcon adores you. Never doubt that. It's because of his pressure that Harrison agreed."

Isabella's mood brightened. "True. He loves me. Once I'm healed, no one will control me anymore!"

Victoria's eyes glittered. "Exactly! He promised to marry you once you're well. You'll bear his children and live as Mrs. Falcon—surrounded by unimaginable luxury!"
###Chapter 510

Isabella and Victoria were already lost in their dreams of what was to come.

Isabella's radiant smile could chase away any darkness.

"This is incredible! I'm counting down the days until Harrison performs my surgery," she gushed, her voice bubbling with enthusiasm.

Nathaniel lingered alone in the dimly lit hospital corridor, his broad shoulders outlined by the soft glow of the overhead lights. The shadows clung to him like a second skin.

Just then, Dominic approached. "Mr. Falcon, should we return to the office tonight or head to The Regal Residences?"

Nathaniel barely moved, his lips curving into a faint smirk. "You go ahead."

"Understood, sir," Dominic replied before turning on his heel and disappearing down the hall.

Nathaniel drifted toward the window, his mind replaying the phone call between Harrison and Oliver. Harrison had said she didn’t want to stay in Willowbrook anymore. She was leaving—Oliver would take her away.

She was carrying Oliver’s child. They would be happy together, wouldn’t they?

And he had Isabella. She was his responsibility now. One day, he would marry her.

It was the right thing to do. A clean break. Separate lives. It was better this way.

It had to be better this way.

Nathaniel told himself, with every ounce of logic he possessed, that this was the best outcome for both of them.

Yet, his chest ached. Something vital was slipping through his fingers, no matter how tightly he tried to hold on.

The loss was suffocating.

And there was nothing he could do to stop it.

Once Harrison had fallen asleep, Rosalind quietly slipped out of the room. As she walked down the corridor, she spotted Everett.

He hadn’t left. Dressed in all black, he sat on a bench, his sharp features barely softened by the muted lighting.

Rosalind hurried over. "Everett, thank you! If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have reached Harrison in time."

Everett stood, his expression as unreadable as ever. "Everything settled?"

Rosalind nodded. "Yes."

"Good. See you around," he said, turning to leave.

Rosalind quickly followed. As she caught up, her gaze dropped to his hand, hanging loosely at his side. Without thinking, she reached out and intertwined her fingers with his.

Her delicate hand slipped into his, and for a heartbeat, Everett hesitated. He turned to look at her. Her small, oval face tilted up, her eyes sparkling with a brightness that outshone the dim corridor.

She smiled at him.

Everett tried to pull away, but Rosalind anticipated it. She tightened her grip. "I’m heading home too. Mind giving me a ride?"

Everett opened his mouth to refuse, but Rosalind cut in. "It’s late, and it’s dangerous for a girl to walk alone. You wouldn’t want me getting into trouble, would you?"

Silence.

His silence was agreement enough. Rosalind’s heart fluttered with triumph. "Has anyone else ever ridden with you?"

She needed to know if she was the only one.

Everett nodded. "Yeah."

Rosalind’s smile faltered.

So, other girls had been on his bike?

Her voice dropped, disappointment curling in her chest. "Who?"

Everett glanced at her. "Which one? There’s been more than one."

Rosalind’s eyes narrowed. "Everett!"

Her fist clenched, and she playfully swatted his arm.


###Chapter 511
Rosalind was certain Everett grasped her implication. Yet he had the audacity to boast about taking multiple girls on his motorcycle!

Everett remained motionless as Rosalind's fist connected with his chest.

It felt like striking granite.

Rosalind winced, shaking her hand. "Are you made of steel? That hurt!"

Everett's gaze dropped to her delicate fingers, now tinged pink.

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "Why did you punch me?"

Rosalind glared. "You know exactly why."

"I don’t," he replied evenly.

"Stop playing dumb," she snapped. "Who were those girls you took on your bike?"

Everett's expression remained unreadable. "My mother and Lillian."

Rosalind's breath hitched. Her porcelain skin flushed crimson. She'd assumed he meant romantic interests, not his family.

Speechless, she bit her lip.

Amusement flickered in Everett's eyes as he watched her flustered reaction. A quiet chuckle escaped him.

Rosalind stomped her foot. "Are you laughing at me?"

"Not at all," he said, though his smirk betrayed him.

She surged forward, rising on her toes until their bodies nearly touched. Her fingers pressed against the corners of his mouth. "Liar! I saw you!"

Everett retreated until his back hit the wall, effectively trapped. Her petite hands framed his face while her wide, innocent eyes held his captive.

He averted his gaze.

That's when Rosalind noticed the wound near his collarbone. "What happened here?" Her voice softened with concern.

The injury, partially hidden by his T-shirt collar, appeared raw and inflamed. Rosalind gently tugged the fabric aside, her warm breath ghosting over the cut.

Everett tensed. The sensation wasn't painful—just unsettlingly intimate. He tried to push her away. "It's nothing."

Rosalind knew better. This was from his fight with the kidnappers when he'd rushed to Harrison's rescue, then silently waited at the hospital afterward.

A surge of tenderness overwhelmed her. Rising higher on her toes, she pressed a featherlight kiss to the wound.

Everett went rigid.

Her lips brushed just below his collarbone. When she pulled back slightly, Everett cupped her forehead to create distance. "What are you doing?"

Rosalind didn’t answer. Instead, she stretched upward and captured his lips.

Everett froze.

Encouraged by his lack of resistance, Rosalind wound her arms around his neck, deepening the kiss. Though Everett's body remained tense, the warmth of her mouth gradually melted his resolve.

This wasn't their first kiss, but Rosalind's boldness surprised him. Her tongue traced the seam of his lips before slipping inside, igniting a fire in his veins.

That familiar, overwhelming sensation returned—the same primal urge he'd fought when drugged with aphrodisiac incense. At his age, curiosity and hormones raged uncontrollably.

His hands twitched to push her away, yet they refused to obey. His eyelids fluttered shut as, against his better judgment, he began kissing her back.
###Chapter 512

Rosalind's knees trembled as her arms remained looped around Everett's neck, her petite frame melting against his broad chest.

Everett's grip tightened around her slender waist, lifting her effortlessly until their bodies aligned perfectly.

A deep blush spread across Rosalind's cheeks as she suddenly pushed against his shoulders.

Their lips parted with a soft sound, Everett's dark eyes drinking in her kiss-swollen mouth. "What is it?" he murmured, voice husky.

Rosalind's doe eyes darted downward nervously before flicking back up. "You're... you're..." Her gaze dropped tellingly to his slacks.

Everett went completely still.

To her astonishment, a faint pink tint appeared high on his cheekbones. The usually composed Everett Sinclair was actually blushing.

A mischievous grin curved her lips. "Are you embarrassed?"

"Don't be ridiculous," he muttered, turning his face away.

"Oh, you totally are!" Delighted, she reached up to touch his heated skin.

Everett caught her wrist. "Behave."

Rosalind rose on her toes, her breath warm against his ear. "Should I help you like I did last time?"

Everett's mind flashed to that night - tangled sheets, her curious fingers, the way she'd insisted on watching that educational video together before...

Now she was offering again?

He should refuse. He absolutely should. But then her long lashes fluttered up, revealing those sparkling amber eyes that held equal parts innocence and wickedness. Before he could answer, she pressed closer.

"Rosalind..." Her name came out strangled.

A thrill shot through her. Standing taller, she captured his lips in a teasing kiss. "Hmm?"

Her small hands trailed down his toned chest.

Rosalind adored this - seeing the normally controlled Everett Sinclair unravel beneath her touch, his breathing ragged, his usually perfect hair mussed from her fingers.

This power was intoxicating.

Only she got to see him like this. Each time sent warmth pooling low in her belly.

She was hopelessly in love with him.

"Do you have feelings for me?" The whispered question hung between them in the dim hallway.

Everett buried his face in her silken hair, his arms like steel bands around her.

She needed to hear it. "Yes or no?"

Her teasing voice was his undoing. With a growl, Everett crushed his mouth to hers in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

Outside, Alistair finished his meeting and began searching for Rosalind. After several fruitless minutes, he turned to his assistant.

"Have you seen my daughter?"

The man shook his head. "Not recently, sir."

Alistair frowned. "Rosalind? Rosalind!"

Only silence answered.

Concerned, he organized a search party.

Just then, a familiar voice called, "I'm here, Father."

Alistair turned to see Everett and Rosalind approaching.

Everett had regained his usual composed demeanor, though his eyes remained unusually bright.

Rosalind's cheeks still held a telltale flush, her lips slightly swollen.

"Where have you been?" Alistair demanded.

Rosalind bit her lip. "Just... talking with Everett."

Alistair's sharp gaze shifted to the young man. "Everett."



###Chapter 513

Everett stood frozen as Professor Whitmore approached. "Good evening, Professor," he managed to say, his voice steady despite the sudden tension in the air.

Alistair Whitmore was not just any professor—he was the dean of Willowridge University, and Everett had been his star pupil. Their history ran deep.

With a curt nod, Alistair extended his hand toward Rosalind. "Let's go home."

Rosalind hesitated, glancing at Everett. She had hoped he would be the one to walk her back tonight, but her father's unexpected appearance left no room for argument. Reluctantly, she stepped to Alistair's side.

Alistair studied Everett for a moment before offering, "It's late. Why don’t you ride with us? I can drop you off."

Everett shook his head politely. "Thank you, Professor, but I’ll manage."

Alistair didn’t press further. "Very well. Stay safe. And if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call."

With that, he guided Rosalind away. She turned back once, flashing Everett a small, wistful wave before disappearing into the night.

Everett remained rooted in place, watching until their figures melted into the darkness.

Inside the sleek black sedan, Rosalind sat stiffly beside her father as the city lights blurred past. The silence stretched until Alistair finally broke it.

"What exactly is going on between you and Everett?" His tone was measured, but his gaze was sharp. "Are you two involved?"

Rosalind’s cheeks warmed, but she lifted her chin. "I care about him."

Alistair’s frown deepened. "That’s absurd. He’s not right for you."

She stiffened. "You’re judging him without even knowing him!"

A heavy sigh escaped him. "It’s not about his background. The boy is brilliant—top of his class. I handpicked him for Willowridge myself. Do you really think I’d dismiss someone over something so shallow?"

Rosalind knew her father well enough to recognize the truth in his words. He valued talent above all else. "Then why are you against us?"

Alistair hesitated before asking, "Do you know what his father did for a living?"

The question caught her off guard. "I’ve heard rumors… that he was involved in illegal activities. But I don’t believe them."

"Has Everett ever spoken to you about it?"

"No."

Alistair exhaled slowly. He had always admired Everett’s resilience, his drive. But some burdens were too heavy to ignore.

"I’m not forbidding you from seeing him," he said carefully. "But you should ask him—does he truly want this? If he hasn’t told you about his past, then he isn’t ready."

Rosalind’s pulse quickened. "Of course he does…"

The words faltered on her lips. She wasn’t entirely sure.

When she had asked Everett if he felt the same way, his answer had been evasive.

She was still chasing him, still waiting for him to commit.

Yet, the memory of their kiss lingered—the way his lips had claimed hers, the gentle nip of his teeth, the heat that still burned in her palms.

Alistair’s expression softened. "Rosalind, you’re old enough to make your own choices. I won’t stand in your way. But consider his feelings too."

He leaned back, his voice gentler now. "I don’t look down on him. In fact, I respect him deeply. I’ve heard he’s working multiple jobs—construction sites, bars. It’s a hard life."

A pause. Then, an offer.

"Here’s what I’ll do. I’ll hire him as your tutor. Later, he can take over Whitmore Holdings. I’ll even make him CEO."
###Chapter 514
Rosalind stood frozen, her emerald eyes widening in disbelief as she gazed at Alistair.

"You're not joking, are you?"

Alistair's lips curved into a faint smile. "Would I joke about something like this? But remember, the decision lies with Everett. He might refuse—either the tutoring position or the company management role."

Rosalind's delicate brows knitted together in confusion. "What exactly are you implying?"

Alistair exhaled softly. "Everett's life is one of unpredictability—always teetering on the edge, never settling. Stability might not be in his nature. Are you certain he can give you the future you envision?"

Years ago, Alistair had personally recruited Everett, recognizing his brilliance. But once enrolled at Willowridge University, Everett began skipping lectures. Alistair had reached out multiple times, hoping to steer him toward academia or business, where his intellect could shine.

Yet Everett had rejected every offer. That was when Alistair understood—Everett had chosen a different path.

Rosalind, on the other hand, was the Fairchild family's cherished gem, raised in luxury and comfort. Their worlds were fundamentally incompatible.

Rosalind shook her head stubbornly. "Father, don't stand in my way. My feelings for Everett are real."

Alistair's sigh was heavy with resignation. "And what of Julian?"

Rosalind's expression darkened. "Why bring him up? He's never shown interest in me. His heart still belongs to Arabella!"

Alistair chuckled lightly but said nothing. Perhaps Julian hadn't cared for Rosalind before, but things could change.

Rosalind looped her arm through her father's. "I know you worry, but this is my life. Right now, Everett is the one I want."

Alistair tapped her forehead gently. "Let's see if Everett feels the same way first."

Rosalind's smile faltered as reality sank in. They'd been discussing possibilities, but Everett's stance remained unknown.

She pulled out her phone and opened WhatsApp, typing rapidly. [Did you make it home?]

Everett was already speeding down the highway on his motorcycle when his phone buzzed. Glancing at the screen, he saw Rosalind's message.

Another notification followed. [Don't ride too fast. Stay safe.]

The corner of his mouth lifted, but he didn't reply.

Ding!

[Do you like me?]

[If you don't answer, I'll take that as a yes!]

[Let's be together.]

[I want to be your girlfriend.]

Rosalind's messages poured in—bold, unfiltered, brimming with passion.

Everett remained silent. His gaze flickered to the sleek luxury car ahead, its license plate unmistakably belonging to the Fairchild family. He'd been trailing them since leaving the hospital, keeping a careful distance.

She asked if he liked her.

Of course he did.

How could he not?

Rosalind was vibrant, pure, and relentless. Despite his resistance, she'd barged into his life like sunlight, warming corners he'd long kept dark. His mother and sister adored her.

What wasn't to love about a dazzling, kind-hearted heiress?

Yet he couldn't shake the gnawing doubt—what could he possibly offer her in return?

The truth was simple: he didn't deserve her.


###Chapter 515

Rosalind sat in the plush leather seat of the limousine, her fingers tapping impatiently against her phone screen. She had sent Everett three messages already—each one left on read.

Why was he ignoring her?

A cold knot twisted in her stomach.

Beside her, Alistair let out an amused chuckle. "Still no reply, I see?"

Rosalind shot him a venomous look. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"

Alistair threw his head back with a laugh. "I warned you—Everett isn't the type to be tamed. But if you ever figure out how to handle Julian Blackwood, you could have him eating out of your hand for life."

His usual philosophical nonsense.

Rosalind scowled. "I don't care about Julian. Why would I waste my time trying to control him? Just watch—I'll make Everett mine."

Alistair merely smirked and said nothing more.

The day of the surgery arrived.

Isabella's heart condition had always been a source of anxiety for the Whitmore family, so it was no surprise that the entire clan had gathered at the hospital.

Margaret, Theodore, Victoria, Frederick, Cassandra, and Penelope stood in solidarity around Isabella. Meanwhile, Harrison had agreed to perform the operation—a victory Margaret was determined to exploit.

Margaret smiled at Isabella. "Today is your day. We're all here for you."

Isabella basked in the attention, her lips curving into a sweet smile. "Thank you, Grandmother."

Penelope grinned. "Mr. Falcon is completely devoted to you. He's already cut ties with Harrison. Once this is over, you should marry him."

Margaret nodded. "Exactly! Soon, you'll be Mrs. Falcon."

Isabella's heart swelled with joy. She had fantasized about marrying Nathaniel countless times. Once her heart was fixed, her perfect life would finally begin.

Just then, Margaret glanced around. "Where is Harrison? Why hasn't she arrived yet?"

Victoria reassured her. "Don't worry. Oliver is still in Mr. Falcon's custody. She won't dare back out now."

A cool, melodic voice cut through the air. "Looking for me?"

All eyes turned to the doorway, where Harrison stood.

She had spent the last two days recovering, and the rest had done her well. Dressed in a crisp white lab coat, her dark hair pulled into a sleek low ponytail, she exuded calm authority.

Harrison had arrived.

Margaret's lips curled into a smug smile. "We gave you a chance to walk away, begging you to operate on Isabella, and you refused. Yet here you are, forced to comply in the end."

Penelope chimed in. "We told you—Mr. Falcon loves Isabella. Defying him was never going to end well for you. Look at you now—defeated."

They had rehearsed these taunts for days, waiting for this moment.

Isabella, clad in her hospital gown, radiated triumph. Her cheeks were flushed with excitement.

"I trust you'll do a good job. Not that I'm worried—Nathaniel will protect me."

Gabrielle, standing beside Harrison, rolled her eyes. "Some people are just born insufferable."

Rosalind smirked. "Don't celebrate too soon, Isabella. We'll see who has the last laugh."

What did she mean?

Isabella turned to Harrison—only to meet her piercing gaze.

Harrison's eyes were calm, composed, almost pitying. As if she were looking down from some unshakable height, seeing right through Isabella's fragile bravado.
###Chapter 516

Harrison and Gabrielle stood beside Penelope, their gazes sharp and calculating as they watched Isabella. Their silent message was clear: Enjoy your moment now. Your time will come.

Isabella frowned instantly.

Something about Penelope today felt... off.

The realization hit her like a wave. Penelope had agreed to perform her heart surgery so suddenly. Too suddenly.

Had she discovered something?

No, that couldn’t be. If Penelope had found out anything, she would have told Nathaniel. Yet, everything had been eerily quiet.

Isabella forced herself to calm down. She was overthinking. Soon, the surgery would be over, and her new life would begin.

At that moment, Margaret spoke up.

"Mr. Falcon."

Isabella turned to see Nathaniel standing there, tall and imposing. His presence commanded the room.

She moved toward him, slipping her arm through his with a practiced smile. "Nathaniel, you're here!"

His gaze flickered over her briefly before settling on Penelope.

Penelope met his eyes without hesitation. "Mr. Falcon, today is the day of our agreement. As promised, I need to see Oliver before the surgery. Where is he?"

Isabella let out a light laugh. "You two must be very close. You talk about him all the time."

She turned to Nathaniel with a teasing smile. "I’m sure Penelope misses him terribly. Why don’t you let him come out?"

Gabrielle shot Isabella a glare, barely concealing her irritation.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable as he answered Penelope. "I always keep my word."

With a slight gesture, Dominic appeared, escorting Oliver into the room.

Penelope’s face lit up. "Oliver!"

Dressed in a rich maple-colored coat, Oliver looked as handsome and composed as ever. The moment he saw Penelope, he grinned and opened his arms. "Hey, Harrison."

She rushed into his embrace, and he held her tightly.

"Are you okay?" she asked, voice laced with concern. "Did he hurt you?"

Oliver chuckled. "Not at all. Mr. Falcon has been nothing but hospitable."

Penelope exhaled in relief. "Good."

Nathaniel watched them, his jaw tightening imperceptibly. His hands clenched at his sides.

Oliver released Penelope and stepped forward, extending a hand toward Nathaniel. "Thank you for your hospitality. If you ever visit Florentia, I’ll return the favor."

The two men locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

Nathaniel’s expression remained cold. "I doubt you’ll get the chance."

Isabella, eager to move things along, interjected. "Harrison, you’ve seen Oliver. Now, it’s time for my surgery."

Penelope’s lips curved into a knowing smile. "Of course. Mr. Falcon kept his promise, so I’ll keep mine." She turned toward the operating room. "Let’s go. It’s time."

Finally.

Isabella’s heart raced with anticipation. This was the moment she had been waiting for.

Margaret squeezed her hand gently. "We’ll all be here, waiting for you to come back healthy."

###Chapter 517

Harrison and Nathaniel stood with palpable excitement.

"We'll be right outside waiting for you!" Theodore and Victoria chimed in unison.

Isabella gave a small nod. "Understood."

Nathaniel's sharp gaze shifted to Harrison. "I'm leaving Isabella in your hands. Don't even think about pulling anything."

Truthfully, Nathaniel was still unsettled by Harrison's sudden agreement to perform the surgery. The abrupt change in attitude was suspicious, putting him on edge.

Gabrielle immediately bristled, her voice laced with irritation. "Mr. Falcon, what exactly are you insinuating? Are you threatening Harrison over Isabella?"

Rosalind, equally annoyed, added coldly, "You'll regret this."

Nathaniel's brows knitted together, his expression darkening. He ignored Gabrielle and Rosalind, keeping his focus locked on Harrison.

Harrison remained unfazed, responding with icy composure. "Relax, Mr. Falcon. Isabella, let’s go. The surgery won’t wait."

Isabella, bolstered by Nathaniel’s presence, flashed him a radiant smile. "I'm heading in now. With you here, Harrison wouldn’t dare try anything!"

With Nathaniel backing her, Isabella felt invincible—untouchable.

Just as Harrison and Isabella reached the operating room doors, a voice called out, "Harrison?"

Harrison turned, her eyes lighting up at the sight of the person she'd been waiting for—Dr. Nathaniel Graves, the rural physician.

Dr. Graves approached, warmth softening his features. "Harrison, is that really you? Look how much you've grown!"

Years ago, when Harrison had been sent to the countryside, Dr. Graves had been one of the few who treated her with kindness. Gratitude swelled in her chest.

"Dr. Graves, it's been too long! How have you been?" Harrison greeted warmly.

"I'm doing well. Heard you're a doctor now—that's wonderful! Even back then, you had a natural gift for medicine. I always knew you'd do great things. Seems I was right!" He chuckled.

Isabella’s gaze raked over Dr. Graves, her lip curling slightly at his rustic appearance. Impatience dripped from her voice. "Harrison, enough catching up. The surgery can't wait."

Dr. Graves glanced at Isabella, not recognizing her, before his eyes landed on Nathaniel. His expression shifted to surprise.

"You?"

Nathaniel paused, studying him. The man seemed familiar, but he couldn’t place him. "Have we met?"

Dr. Graves grinned. "We have! Don’t you remember? Years ago, when you were badly injured in the woods, a young girl brought you to a cave. The next morning, she came to fetch me, and I gave you medicine."

Nathaniel’s eyes widened as the memory resurfaced—the cold night, the girl huddled beside him for warmth, the groggy morning when she returned with a country doctor who administered treatment.

His voice softened with realization. "I remember now. You saved my life that day. I never properly thanked you."

Dr. Graves waved him off. "No need. The one who truly saved you was that girl. I just did my part. You were in bad shape—without her, you wouldn’t have made it. You should be thanking her."

Nathaniel turned to Isabella, a faint smile touching his lips. "Yes, that girl was Isabella. I found her later."

Dr. Graves stared at Isabella in shock. "Her? You're saying she saved you?"

Nathaniel met his gaze steadily. "Am I wrong?"

Dead wrong.

Isabella’s face drained of color, her expression turning ghostly pale. She hadn’t expected the rural doctor to be the same one Harrison had summoned all those years ago—the key witness who knew the truth.

Her stomach plummeted. Why now? She was moments away from surgery—why did he have to appear now?

Forcing a weak smile, she clutched her side. "Nathaniel, I'm starting to feel unwell. Let’s just get this over with."
###Chapter 518

The tension in the room was suffocating. Isabella clutched Nathaniel's arm, her fingers trembling. "Please, we need to hurry," she urged, her voice barely above a whisper.

Rosalind's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Why the rush? Dr. Graves here is an old friend of yours, isn't he? Didn't you enlist his help to save Nathaniel all those years ago?"

Gabrielle's eyes widened in realization. "Wait a minute, Isabella! Why does it seem like you don’t even recognize Dr. Graves?"

Nathaniel stiffened. Something was off. Just moments ago, Isabella had treated Dr. Graves like a stranger, her disdain palpable.

His gaze hardened as he turned to her. "You don’t know him?"

Panic flickered across Isabella’s face. "I—I was so young back then. It took me a moment to remember. But I do now. It’s him." She pressed a hand to her chest. "Nathaniel, I’m not feeling well. The surgery—we need to proceed."

Victoria, sensing disaster, quickly intervened. "Mr. Hawk, the surgery is critical. They can discuss this later."

Margaret nodded in agreement. "Yes, Nathaniel. Isabella’s condition is delicate. We must act now."

Then, Harrison’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Isabella, how long do you plan to keep up this act?"

Rosalind smirked. "Pathetic, really. The truth always comes out."

Nathaniel turned to Harrison, his patience fraying. "What are you implying?"

Gabrielle stepped forward. "We’re not implying anything. We’re stating facts."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "What facts?"

Dr. Graves moved closer, his gaze unwavering. "How can you possibly believe Isabella saved you?"

The words struck Nathaniel like a physical blow.

Isabella wasn’t his savior.

She wasn’t the girl from the cave.

Though doubts had already crept into his mind, hearing it confirmed left him frozen. His thoughts scattered, his breath catching in his throat.

Nathaniel stared at Isabella, her features distorting in his vision, morphing into the face of the girl he’d met years ago.

The Whitmore family was in chaos, and Isabella was unraveling.

For years, she had been their trump card—the one who’d saved Nathaniel’s life. Now, that illusion was crumbling.

Isabella grabbed Nathaniel’s sleeve desperately. "Don’t listen to them! Dr. Graves is mistaken! It was me—I saved you! Don’t you remember the crystal pendant?"

Crystal pendant?

Nathaniel’s mind raced. Yes, she’d given it to him. But if she wasn’t the girl from that day, where had it come from?

He shoved her away, his voice icy. "Don’t touch me."

Turning to Dr. Graves, he demanded, "Could you be wrong? She has the pendant. She has to be the one."

Isabella nodded frantically. "It’s me! I swear it!"

Rosalind scoffed. "Nathaniel, you need to see this."

She pulled out her phone and played a video.

The footage showed Isabella slipping into Harrison’s living room. When no one was looking, she snatched the crystal pendant from the table.

Isabella gasped, her face draining of color. She hadn’t known Harrison had cameras installed.

Her theft had been captured in perfect clarity.


###Chapter 519

Rosalind reacted instantly, lunging toward Isabella.

"Stop it! Shut it off! Don't you dare play another second!"

She knocked the phone from Isabella's grip, sending it clattering across the marble floor.

Victoria moved to retrieve it, but a shadow was faster—Nathaniel's hand closed around the device before she could.

Isabella shrieked, "Nathaniel, don't! Don't look at that phone!"

The Whitmore women erupted into chaos. Victoria pleaded, "Mr. Falcon, destroy it! None of that footage is real—you can't trust what you see!"

Margaret chimed in, voice shrill, "We're wasting time! The surgery—we must focus on Isabella's heart condition!" Their agitation was palpable.

Nathaniel's icy gaze silenced them instantly. His voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Restrain them. I don't want a single one of them moving."

Dominic nodded sharply. "At once, sir."

With a single gesture, a team of security personnel in dark suits seized Isabella, Margaret, and the others.

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around the phone as he reopened the surveillance footage.

Isabella's face, once flushed with fury, had gone deathly pale. Her eyes brimmed with terror, but pinned in place, she could only sob, "Nathaniel, please! Don't watch it!"

The video played. Nathaniel zoomed in, his breath hitching as he watched Isabella—inside Harrison's apartment—steal the crystal pendant.

His pendant. The one he'd given her.

There was no denying it.

Gabrielle spoke up, voice steady. "See for yourself, Mr. Falcon. Isabella stole that pendant."

Nathaniel's head snapped up, his stare piercing. "Why?"

The question hung in the air, heavy with betrayal.

His world tilted.

For years, he'd believed Isabella was the girl who had saved him. Now, with the truth unraveling before his eyes, everything he'd clung to was crumbling.

Rosalind met his gaze. "Isn't it obvious? Isabella never owned that pendant because she wasn't the one who saved you. The real girl is someone else."

Nathaniel's voice turned razor-sharp. "Who?"

A faint smile touched Rosalind's lips. "You're a smart man. I think you already know."

The answer was undeniable. The footage proved it—Isabella had stolen the pendant from Harrison.

It had always been hers.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened, the realization hitting him like a tidal wave. He turned to Harrison, his expression raw with shock.

Harrison stood motionless in her white coat, composed and unreadable—a stark contrast to his turmoil.

Nathaniel closed the distance between them in three strides. His voice was rough, barely controlled. "Was it you?"

Silence.

He swallowed hard. "Harrison. Tell me. Were you the one who saved me all those years ago?"

Dr. Nathaniel Graves stepped forward, confirming quietly, "Yes. Harrison was your savior."
###Chapter 520

Gabrielle shook her head in disbelief. "Mr. Falcon, you've committed an unforgivable error! Harrison was the girl from all those years ago. How could you possibly confuse Isabella for Harrison?"

Victoria chimed in, her voice trembling with emotion. "It's true! You and Harrison were torn apart by fate. And in your blindness, you inflicted so much suffering upon her without ever realizing it."

The girl from that time had always been Harrison.

Never Isabella—only Harrison.

Nathaniel's fingers curled into tight fists, his knuckles turning white. How was this possible? The girl he had searched for, the one who had saved him, was Harrison.

All these years, he had been chasing the wrong shadow. He had lavished affection on the wrong woman.

Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze, her voice soft but steady. "Yes... it was me."

Nathaniel froze, his entire body rigid as if struck by lightning.

Harrison's pale eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her voice thick with emotion.

"I was the one who pulled you from that cave. Where did you disappear to afterward? Do you have any idea how long I waited for you? Years, Nathaniel. I waited for years. You promised you would take me with you. You swore you'd give me a home, that you'd never abandon me. I carried those words in my heart all this time."

Nathaniel couldn't speak. The weight of his mistake crushed him, stealing his voice. Before him, Harrison's delicate features finally aligned with the girl from his memories—the one he had failed to recognize.

He remembered every vow he had made to her.

Harrison's eyes, red-rimmed from unshed tears, glistened.

"I waited... but you never came. So I went searching for you."

She swallowed hard, her voice trembling.

"I followed your trail, crossed cities, endured hardships. I saw your photograph in a shop window in Westfield. That was how I learned your name. I studied everything about you."

A bitter smile touched her lips.

"Then I heard you were in a coma. The Whitmores wanted me to take Isabella's place in marrying you, so I agreed. Nathaniel, I journeyed through hell just to reach you."

Back then, Nathaniel hadn't been able to bring her home.

So she had come to him instead.

It had taken over a decade.

Harrison had walked an endless road, and finally, she stood before him.

Nathaniel listened in stunned silence, his mind reeling. He had abandoned her.

Left her alone in the world.

While he had kept Isabella by his side, Harrison had been left to fend for herself.

She had fought her way to him—only for him to fail to recognize her.

A sharp, unbearable pain lanced through Nathaniel's chest, twisting deeper with every breath.

He stepped forward, gripping Harrison's shoulders with desperate intensity. "Harrison, I'm sorry... I didn't know... I never meant to—"

Harrison gazed up at him, a fragile smile curving her lips despite the tears. "I used to hate you. I despised you for forgetting me. For being so cruel."

Nathaniel's eyes burned, his grip tightening as if he could erase the past through sheer will. "No—I never forgot you. Harrison, I made a mistake. I thought Isabella was you."

Isabella watched in silent horror as the truth unraveled before her. Her worst nightmare had come to pass.

What now? What could she possibly do?

Margaret, Victoria, Theodore, and Penelope stood frozen, their faces drained of color. They had arrived brimming with arrogance, believing Isabella's heart surgery would mark a new beginning.

Instead, it had become the first step into their ruin.

Nathaniel and Harrison had found their way back to each other.

No matter how desperately they tried to interfere, fate had already woven its design.

After years of separation, Nathaniel and Harrison were finally reunited.


###Chapter 521

Nathaniel stood motionless, his piercing gaze locked onto the ashen faces of the Whitmore family.

His finger shot out like a blade, pointing directly at Isabella. "Mr. Falcon, she's nothing but a deceitful snake!"

Gabrielle chimed in sharply, "Exactly! The only person who deserves your attention right now is her!"

Nathaniel slowly released his grip on Harrison and turned, his bloodshot eyes burning into Isabella.

Isabella's face went deathly pale. "Nathaniel, please—just let me explain—"

His stare was glacial, cutting through her like winter wind.

"Fine. One chance." His voice was dangerously low. "Tell me—why did you steal Harrison's identity? Why take her pendant? Why lie to me for years? Choose your words carefully. If your explanation disappoints me, the Whitmore family will cease to exist."

The Whitmores looked like ghosts, their faces drained of color.

Margaret's knees gave out, and she nearly collapsed. She couldn't let the family fall. Not like this.

Isabella lunged forward, clutching Nathaniel's sleeve. "I'm sorry! I was wrong—I impersonated Harrison, but only because I love you! I love you so much—"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel shoved her away violently. "Your feelings mean nothing!"

She crashed to the floor with a cry.

Victoria and Theodore rushed to her side. "Isabella! Are you hurt?"

Nathaniel looked down at her with pure revulsion.

"Do you honestly think I would've kept you around if I knew the truth? All these years, I believed you were Harrison. Because of you, I lost years with the woman I love. You made us strangers when we should've been together. Isabella, you sicken me."

Tears streamed down Isabella's cheeks.

"Please don't be angry! I never meant to hurt you—I just—I love you—"

Rosalind cut in with a venomous laugh. "Love? The only person you love is yourself! Four years ago, when Mr. Falcon was in a coma, you couldn't run fast enough. Now that he's awake, you crawl back like a parasite. You're selfish, manipulative, and cruel. All you care about is money and power!"

Gabrielle sneered. "If Harrison hadn't exposed you, we'd still be living in your lies. You would've spent your whole life pretending to be her, using her name for your own gain. You're the most despicable person I've ever met."

Isabella scrambled toward Nathaniel on her knees, reaching for him desperately. "Nathaniel, it's not what you think—please, just listen—"

His expression didn't waver. The fury in his eyes was scorching.

"Enough. I gave you your chance, and you wasted it. I don't want to hear another word from you."

It felt like being thrown into an abyss. Isabella's chest constricted violently, a sharp, unbearable pain shooting through her heart.

Clutching her chest, she gasped. "Nathaniel—my heart—it hurts—"

Victoria immediately cried out. "Mr. Falcon, the doctors said stress could kill her! She can't handle this!"

Theodore added urgently, "We need to operate now! Everything else can wait!"

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cruel smile. "Surgery? Let me make one thing clear—there will be no surgery."

No surgery.

The words struck Isabella like a death sentence.

She looked up at him, her eyes wild with panic.

"No! You can't do this! I need that surgery! The pain—it's unbearable—"
###Chapter 522

Isabella wasn't faking it this time. The pain in her chest was real, her forehead slick with icy sweat.

But Nathaniel didn't even glance her way. She felt like the girl who cried wolf—utterly abandoned, discarded without a second thought.

Harrison stepped forward, her gaze cold and disdainful as she looked down at Isabella. "Stop deluding yourself. There was never going to be any surgery."

Isabella's mind raced. "I see now! This was all part of your plan. You knew I was impersonating you. You pretended to agree to the surgery just to bring Dr. Nathaniel Graves here and expose me, didn't you?"

Harrison's lips curled into a cruel smirk. "Not entirely stupid, I see. Yes, today was my design. I wanted to rip off your mask and reveal the truth about what happened all those years ago."

Isabella's eyes widened. "You're ruthless! You're still a Whitmore! How could you do this to me?"

Harrison let out a sharp, venomous laugh. "Ruthless? A Whitmore? Now you care about family? What about everything you've done to me? You can hurt me, but I can't fight back?"

Margaret rushed forward, tears in her eyes. "Harrison, please, I'm your grandmother—"

"Enough," Harrison cut her off sharply. "I don't need a grandmother like you. You should stick to being Isabella's grandmother."

With a frigid glare, Harrison swept her sharp gaze over the faces of the Whitmore family, one by one.

"I've said it before: I want the people who killed my father to turn themselves in and spend the rest of their lives rotting in prison. Otherwise, I won't stop."

Her words landed like a hammer, draining the color from the Whitmores' faces.

Just then, Oliver stepped forward, his voice soft but firm. "Don't forget, you're pregnant. Don't get too worked up. Let me take you somewhere to rest."

Harrison nodded, though her expression remained tense. "Fine."

She turned and followed Oliver as they walked away.

Rosalind and Gabrielle exchanged glances before looking at Nathaniel.

"Well, you decide how to deal with them."

A chill shot through Isabella's heart. "Nathaniel, I know I was wrong! Please, don't be cruel. I'm begging you!"

Nathaniel glared at her with pure disgust. "I never want to see you again. Take her away!"

Two black-clad bodyguards immediately seized Isabella.

Victoria and Theodore panicked. "Mr. Falcon, don't take Isabella! Her condition is worse—she can't handle this!"

Nathaniel's lips curled into a sneer. "Her heart condition isn't my problem. If she dies, it's punishment for impersonating Harrison."

"N-Nathaniel..." Isabella whispered, her voice barely audible.

His tone was final. "Take. Her. Away."

As Isabella was dragged off, the pain in her chest flared. A suffocating dread filled her—death loomed over her like a shadow.

She knew Nathaniel wouldn't care if she lived or died now. Desperate, she turned pleading eyes to Victoria and Theodore. "Mom! Dad! Help me! My heart—it really hurts! I don't want to die! Please—ugh!"

Before she could finish, a bodyguard's rough hand clamped over her mouth. She stumbled as they hauled her away.

Victoria and Theodore lunged forward, but the guards blocked them. They could only watch helplessly as their daughter was taken.

"Isabella! Isabella!" they cried.

Nathaniel turned his cold gaze to the remaining Whitmores. "And as for the rest of you..."

Margaret stepped forward, trembling.

"Mr. Falcon, Isabella's actions have nothing to do with us! Don't take your anger out on us. We don't want to suffer for her mistakes!"
###Chapter 523

Victoria and Theodore stared at Margaret with utter disbelief.

"Mother, how could you turn your back on Isabella now? We're supposed to be family!"

Penelope, visibly distressed, spoke up in a rush, desperate to distance herself from Isabella's impending ruin.

"What are you implying? Isabella stole Harrison's identity! All these years, she's been profiting from Nathaniel's generosity while we received nothing. Now that the truth is out, why should we suffer for her crimes?"

Frederick and Cassandra quickly added their voices. "Exactly! We won't go down with her! Mr. Falcon, if you have grievances, they're with Isabella alone—not us."

Victoria felt bile rise in her throat, her hands trembling with fury. "You're all despicable!"

Rosalind and Gabrielle watched the spectacle unfold, their lips curling in quiet satisfaction. Seeing the Whitmore family tear itself apart was more entertaining than they'd anticipated.

Years ago, Victoria had abandoned Harrison in the countryside without a second thought. Now, karma had come full circle—she was finally experiencing the betrayal she'd once inflicted.

Rosalind smirked. "This is what you deserve. Reap what you sow."

Gabrielle crossed her arms, her voice dripping with disdain. "Mr. Falcon, these people murdered Harrison's father. If not for your protection, Harrison would have dealt with them long ago. Now that you've seen their true nature, it's time they faced justice."

Margaret fell to her knees, her voice breaking. "Please, Mr. Falcon, show us mercy! Don't do this!"

Nathaniel's expression remained icy, his gaze unreadable.

"You've all deceived me. Now, I'll settle every debt—old and new. Whoever killed Benjamin will go to his grave in three days and beg for forgiveness. That's your only chance. Don't force my hand further."

Without another word, Nathaniel turned and strode away.

Rosalind and Gabrielle cast one last mocking glance at the Whitmores.

"You brought this upon yourselves."

Then they, too, left.

Margaret collapsed onto the floor, her legs giving out beneath her. She struck her thigh in frustration.

"It's over! Everything is ruined! Today was supposed to be the Whitmore family's triumph, but instead, we've fallen into the abyss. Now that Nathaniel knows the truth, we have nothing left. What do we do?"

Penelope's voice rose in panic. "Grandmother, you must think of something! We can't die because of Isabella. Why should we pay for her mistakes?"

Victoria's face was ashen. Her nails dug into her palms, but she barely registered the pain.

Harrison... This was all Harrison's doing.

The surgery had been a ruse—her real plan was to destroy them.

Why hadn't Harrison died in that wretched village all those years ago?

Victoria's eyes darkened with venom. "Enough! Arguing won't save us now. Even without Isabella, we still killed Benjamin. Harrison won't spare any of us. She wants us all dead!"

Margaret and Penelope fell silent. Their feud with Harrison was beyond reconciliation. They were bound to Isabella's fate—sink or swim together.

Margaret looked up at Victoria, exhaustion lining her face. "Then what do we do? Isabella is still in Nathaniel's hands. Her heart condition won't wait much longer."

Victoria turned to Theodore, desperation creeping into her voice. "Darling, what should we do?"

Theodore remained silent, his expression unreadable.

Victoria's voice trembled. "Theodore, when Isabella said her heart was failing, I saw the pain in her eyes. She doesn't have time. Are you really going to let her die? You know you can save her!"
###Chapter 524

Penelope's brows furrowed in confusion. "Uncle Theodore can rescue Isabella? She's in Nathaniel's grasp now, with Harrison involved. What exactly can you do to save her?"

Theodore remained silent, his expression unreadable.

Penelope stepped forward urgently. "If you have a solution, tell us now! Why keep us waiting?"

After a prolonged silence, Theodore turned abruptly and walked away without explanation.

Victoria rushed after him, calling out desperately, "Darling!"

Penelope moved to follow but was stopped by Margaret's firm grip. "Don't."

"Why not?" Penelope looked between Margaret, Frederick, and Cassandra. "You all know something I don't. What are you hiding?"

Frederick's voice turned grave. "Penelope, some questions shouldn't be asked. This concerns Isabella's true lineage."

Penelope's eyes widened. "Lineage? What do you mean? Isn't Isabella Theodore and Victoria's daughter?"

Cassandra took Penelope's hand gently. "That's enough. The truth is, Isabella's safety net has vanished. Her fate now rests entirely on Theodore's decision. If he chooses correctly, the Whitmore family might finally rise to power."

Penelope shook her head in disbelief. "I don't understand any of this."

Margaret stood tall, her voice steady with conviction. "Understanding isn't necessary. Just know the Whitmore family won't fall. This trial may become our ascension."

Penelope stared, stunned into silence.

Meanwhile, Theodore and Victoria reached the corridor. Victoria clutched his arm, her voice trembling.

"Darling, where are you going? Isabella's life hangs by a thread in Nathaniel's hands! Aren't you concerned?"

"Of course I'm concerned," Theodore replied flatly. "No one worries more than I do."

"Worrying isn't enough!" Victoria insisted. "You must act! Find a way to save her!"

Theodore met her gaze. "How exactly would you have me save her?"

"Contact someone from Metropolia. Bring Isabella's biological father here. His arrival would solve everything."

Theodore fell silent again, his thoughts churning.

Victoria pressed on anxiously. "I know you promised Isabella's mother she'd never return to Metropolia or meet her real father. But circumstances have changed! If her mother were alive, would she let her daughter die? Would she stand by and watch?"

Theodore answered quietly, "Never. Isabella was her only child. Her only blood."

"Exactly! She would have contacted him immediately to save Isabella. Darling, if anything happens to her, how will you face her mother's memory?"

Theodore's expression darkened with conflict. For years, he'd honored his promise, raising Isabella in Willowbrook.

But everything had changed.

He couldn't remain passive while Isabella's life was at stake.

Her mother would have made this same choice.

Resolved, Theodore pulled out his phone. "Very well. I'll call him. After all these years of searching, he deserves to know."
###Chapter 525

Theodore's call sent waves of excitement through Victoria. A triumphant smile curved her lips.

Her daughter was about to reach unimaginable heights!

As Victoria stepped out of the room, Margaret, Penelope, Frederick, and Cassandra watched her intently, their gazes burning with anticipation.

Margaret's voice trembled. "Has Theodore made his choice?"

Victoria nodded. "He's on the phone right now."

Margaret slammed her cane against the floor, her wrinkled face alight with joy. "Excellent! This changes everything!"

Penelope frowned, still piecing things together. "Grandmother, who is Uncle Theodore contacting?"

"No need for details," Victoria interjected. "Just know that a powerful figure from Metropolia is coming to Willowbrook. We must prepare to receive him properly!"

Penelope studied their exhilarated expressions, her pulse quickening. Though she didn't know this mysterious man's identity, she sensed his arrival would alter the Whitmore family's destiny forever.

Even Nathaniel and Harrison paled in comparison.

"So... we're not rescuing Isabella?" Penelope asked.

Victoria waved a dismissive hand. "Leave it to the man from Metropolia. Our role is simply to welcome him."

Meanwhile, Harrison and Oliver returned to her penthouse. Oliver shook his head. "No wonder you came to Willowbrook for Mr. Falcon. I never realized you two shared such history. What a tragedy he spent all these years believing Isabella saved him."

Rosalind and Gabrielle had followed them inside.

Gabrielle's lips curled in disgust. "Mr. Falcon is utterly blind! After everything you endured—married to him while he pined for Isabella—how can you forgive him so easily?"

Rosalind nodded fiercely. "You nearly died on that operating table! Both you and your baby... He doesn't deserve your mercy."

Though Nathaniel was her cousin, she refused to defend his actions.

Suddenly, the doorbell pierced the tense silence.

Ding-dong!

The insistent ringing suggested urgency.

"I'll get it," Rosalind said, striding to the door. Her breath caught when she saw Nathaniel's imposing frame filling the doorway.

"Mr. Falcon?" She blinked in surprise. "What are you doing here?"

Nathaniel's gaze swept past her. "Where's Harrison? I need to speak with her!" He moved to enter.

Rosalind blocked him. "Why? Shouldn't you be tending to Isabella? Her delicate heart requires constant attention, doesn't it?"

Nathaniel flinched at her sarcasm but didn't argue. He deserved every barb. Right now, only Harrison mattered.

"Let me see her," he demanded.

Rosalind stood firm. "This is Harrison's home. If she wants to see you, she'll say so."

Nathaniel's fists clenched. "Then ask her."

With a curt nod, Rosalind shut the door and returned to the living room.

"Harrison," she announced, "Mr. Falcon is here. He's demanding to see you."
###Chapter 526

Gabrielle's lips curled into a frosty smile. "How ironic. Nathaniel couldn't be bothered before. Now he's practically breaking down the door to see her."

Yet she maintained utmost respect for Harrison.

"Harrison, this is your choice. Do you wish to see him?"

Harrison rested her palm lightly on her rounded belly, her eyes clouded with memories. "We've settled everything from the past. There's nothing left between us. I won't see him. Send him away."

Rosalind gave a firm nod. "Understood."

She strode to the entrance and swung the door open again. Meeting Nathaniel's desperate gaze, she stated coolly, "You need to leave. Harrison refuses to see you."

Nathaniel's voice cracked with emotion. "Did you tell her I have something important to say?"

"Every word," Rosalind confirmed. "She said your history is resolved and there's nothing more to discuss. It's finished."

Finished?

Nathaniel's hands clenched into fists. "It's not finished between us! Let me speak to her directly!"

"She's carrying your child and needs rest. Respect her wishes."

The door clicked shut with finality.

Rosalind returned to the sitting room. "I've relayed your message to Mr. Hawk."

Harrison gave a quiet nod. "Thank you."

At that moment, Harrison's phone chimed with Eleanor's distinctive video call ringtone. Having always regarded Eleanor as family, Harrison immediately answered.

Eleanor's warm, wrinkled face filled the screen. "Harrison darling! How are you feeling today? Is my great-grandchild treating you well?"

A soft smile touched Harrison's lips. "Perfectly. Though still tiny, this little one behaves wonderfully."

"Marvelous! Now look what I've gathered!" The camera panned to reveal piles of miniature garments - delicate booties, tiny onesies, and impossibly small socks.

Eleanor had transformed into a whirlwind of grandmotherly preparation since returning home, scouring every boutique for baby essentials.

"And since we don't know the gender yet," Eleanor continued excitedly, "I bought everything in every color - rose, lemon, sky blue. I simply couldn't resist! Boy or girl, this child will want for nothing."

"I've commissioned a sterling silver rattle and golden christening spoon. Oh! And I'm having the east garden redesigned as a playground for when they're older."

Eleanor's enthusiasm knew no bounds, her love overflowing in every carefully selected gift.

Harrison's heart swelled. Eleanor had always been the grandmother she never had, embracing both her and the unborn child unconditionally.

But with Nathaniel...

"Grandmother, it's still early days. Please don't overtire yourself with preparations."

Eleanor chuckled warmly. "Nonsense! Now, I know you haven't forgiven Nathaniel yet, and that's perfectly alright. Though I'm his grandmother, you needn't worry - toss him out if you must. Just keep me in your life. That's all I ask."

Harrison couldn't help but laugh. Eleanor understood her completely, never pressuring her about the fractured relationship.

What a blessing Eleanor was.

Harrison made a silent vow. Whatever transpired between her and Nathaniel, it wouldn't affect the bond between her child and this remarkable woman.

Her smile softened. "I know, Grandmother. Please rest now, and don't fret over me. I'll take excellent care of myself and your great-grandchild."

Eleanor nodded approvingly. "Very well."

As the call ended, Harrison's phone immediately chimed again.

A familiar melody filled the room.

Her breath caught.

The screen displayed a name that sent her pulse racing - Nathaniel.

Nathaniel was calling.
###Chapter 527

Why was Nathaniel calling?

Harrison hesitated for a brief moment before answering the call. Her fingers trembled slightly as they hovered over the screen.

"Hello, Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel's deep voice resonated through the phone, rough with emotion. "Harrison, why are you avoiding me? I need to speak with you urgently. Just five minutes of your time!"

Her breath hitched as she replied, "We settled everything at the hospital. There's nothing left to discuss between us. It's over."

A heavy silence stretched between them before Nathaniel spoke again, his tone softer now. "Please, just meet me-"

"No!" Harrison interrupted sharply, cutting off his plea.

The line went quiet.

Without hesitation, Harrison continued, "It's late. I need to rest now." She ended the call abruptly.

From across the living room, Rosalind spoke up. "Harrison, if you don't want to see him, that's your choice. But remember - Isabella is in his custody now. The Whitmores have three days before the truth comes out. The real killer won't escape justice."

Gabrielle nodded in agreement. "Absolutely! The Whitmore family is despicable! They deserve everything coming to them. Harrison, they'll pay for what they did to your father ten times over."

Oliver stood suddenly, his voice firm. "Have you decided? Once the Whitmore situation is resolved, you're leaving Willowbrook with me?"

Harrison met Oliver's gaze and nodded. "Yes, my decision is final. When this is over, we'll leave together."

A satisfied smile crossed Oliver's face. "Excellent. Grandfather and the others will be overjoyed when they hear you're returning with me!"

Gabrielle gently suggested, "You should get some rest now, Harrison. We'll take our leave."

"Alright."

As Rosalind and Gabrielle exited the apartment, they came face-to-face with Nathaniel waiting outside.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze met theirs. "She still refuses to see me?"

"Not just refuses," Rosalind replied icily, "she's made it clear that once the Whitmore matter is settled, she's leaving with Mr. Oliver."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with emotion. Days earlier, in the hospital room, he'd overheard Harrison telling Oliver about her plans to leave Willowbrook - to start anew with him.

And now, her decision remained unchanged.

Even after learning he'd mistaken Isabella for the girl who'd saved him all those years ago, Harrison hadn't given him a single chance to make amends.

Back in her bedroom, Harrison sipped a glass of warm milk before bed. As she stood by the window, her gaze drifted downward.

There, standing motionless beneath her apartment building, was Nathaniel's unmistakable silhouette.

How long had he been standing there? He remained perfectly still, as if waiting, hoping for just a glimpse of her.

As if sensing her presence, Nathaniel slowly lifted his head, their eyes locking through the darkness.

For one suspended moment, time seemed to stop between them.

Harrison jerked away from the window, yanking the curtains shut with trembling hands. She wanted nothing more to do with him.

Her phone vibrated with an incoming message.

Nathaniel: [I saw you at the window. You saw me too, didn't you?]

Harrison ignored it.

Another message followed immediately: [I have so much to tell you. If you won't see me, I'll wait here all night.]

Harrison stared at the screen for several heartbeats before typing a brief reply: [Come up.]

Exactly two minutes later, the doorbell rang.

Harrison opened the door to find Nathaniel standing there, breathless from rushing upstairs, his face alight with hope.

"Thank you for seeing me," he breathed. "I knew you wouldn't shut me out forever." 
###Chapter 528

Harrison moved aside, pushing the door wider.

"Come in," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nathaniel crossed the threshold. They stood frozen in the living room, the air thick with unspoken words and years of unresolved tension.

Harrison was the first to break the silence, her tone icy. "Mr. Falcon, what brings you here?"

The deliberate use of his surname erected an invisible wall between them, a clear boundary she refused to let him cross.

Nathaniel closed the distance between them in one determined stride. "Harrison, don't shut me out like this. All this time, I never realized it was you. I've spent years searching."

A slow, knowing nod. "I'm aware. I know everything now."

His hands lifted, settling gently on her shoulders. "Give me another chance. We've wasted too many years already—I can't lose you again."

She shoved him back, her voice steel.

"It's too late for chances! I gave you plenty—when we divorced, when Isabella and I were taken, even when I lay bleeding on that operating table after losing our child. Every single time I needed you, you chose her over me. Again and again, until I learned to survive without you. I don't need you anymore."

Nathaniel's chest constricted as if crushed by an iron vise, each word a blade twisting deeper. "Harrison, please... I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry—"

The apology spilled out, inadequate and hollow.

"I swore I'd give you a home, a life. Instead, I abandoned you in that village, left you alone for years. When I was in that coma, you came to me—and I didn't even recognize you. I hurt you, betrayed you, all for Isabella... I know what I've done."

His eyes burned, unshed tears glistening.

"Just imagining what you endured alone... It destroys me. The guilt is unbearable. I hate myself for it. I'll never forgive myself. This is all my fault. Every second of your pain—my fault."

Harrison trembled, lips pressed into a thin line, but she refused to speak.

"But Harrison, I... I mistook her for you. All these years, I believed Isabella was the girl I'd promised to protect. It wasn't deliberate, I swear. Can't you stop punishing me for an honest mistake?
"We don't have forever. I don't want to waste another day without you. Please. One more chance. I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you. A home, a future—anything you want. Just don't walk away."

He surged forward, crushing her against his chest.

His arms locked around her like iron, his face buried in her hair as if he could fuse their bodies together, erase every moment they'd spent apart.

He couldn't let go. Not again.

This embrace was decades overdue.

Tears streaked Harrison's cheeks. This man—the one she'd loved beyond reason—held her like she was his only salvation. And God help her, she'd ached for this. For him.

She knew the truth. He'd never forgotten her. Every kindness he'd shown Isabella was meant for her—a promise kept to the wrong woman.

But...

A tearful, broken smile curved her lips. "Nathaniel... it's too late. All of it."
###Chapter 529

Harrison's voice was quiet but final.
She looked Nathaniel straight in the eyes. "It's over. There's no going back now."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "That's not true! Just one more chance - I can make everything right again."

With a tired sigh, Harrison wiped her cheeks and gently pushed him away. "You've said enough. Please... just go."

"No, Harrison, listen to me—"

Her hand drifted to her stomach, fingers splaying protectively over the barely noticeable curve. "I'm exhausted. It's late. Leave."

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to her abdomen, his voice softening. "Is this about the baby? I know it's not mine biologically, but I swear I'll love this child as my own. I'll love you both."

Harrison remained silent, her expression unreadable.

He still believed the child wasn't his.

But she wouldn't correct him. Once she dealt with the Whitmore family, she'd be gone. Explanations were pointless now.

"Go."

Seeing the icy detachment in her eyes, Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Alright. Get some rest. I'll... I'll come by tomorrow."

He turned and walked out.

Standing outside her apartment building, Nathaniel froze. Every fiber of his being screamed to stay, to guard her door all night if necessary.

They'd lost so much time already. He couldn't bear the thought of losing her again - not when they'd just found their way back to each other.

His phone buzzed sharply. Dominic's name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Falcon, Ms. Isabella is demanding to see you immediately."

Isabella.

Just hearing her name made Nathaniel's blood run cold. He had no desire to face her, but some debts needed settling.

This ends tonight.

"On my way."

Dominic opened the door to a dimly lit room. "She's inside."

Nathaniel strode in, his polished shoes clicking against the concrete floor.

In the far corner, Isabella scrambled to her feet, her designer dress torn and hair disheveled. "Nathaniel! I knew you'd come! After everything we've shared, I knew you couldn't just abandon me!"

She lunged forward, only to be restrained by two broad-shouldered guards.

Dominic placed a chair behind Nathaniel. He sat, crossing one leg over the other as he looked down at her. "Speak."

Isabella swallowed hard. "I admit I pretended to be Harrison. But can you blame me? You're extraordinary - any woman would want you! I fell for you the moment we met. I just wanted to be her... to be loved by you!"

Nathaniel's lips curled into a humorless smile. "You speak of our time together? Those were years stolen from Harrison. Every touch, every word - they were meant for her. You were never anything more than a pale imitation. A shadow where there should have been light."

Isabella had always been a counterfeit version of the real woman he loved.
###Chapter 530

Nathaniel had always seen Isabella as nothing more than Harrison's pale imitation.

The bitter truth had gnawed at Isabella for years - yet she'd stubbornly refused to accept it.

"I'm the true jewel of the Whitmore family! Harrison's just some backwater nobody! She could never measure up to me!" she shrieked, her voice cracking with hysteria.

Nathaniel's gaze turned arctic. "Who permitted you to speak her name?"

A bodyguard moved with military precision, delivering a stinging backhand across Isabella's porcelain cheek.

Crack!

The impact snapped her head sideways violently.

But the punishment didn't stop there. The guard's palm connected again and again - each slap landing with brutal efficiency, painting her flawless skin with angry red welts. Within moments, her cheeks ballooned grotesquely, a thin trail of crimson leaking from her split lip.

"It burns!" Isabella whimpered, her aristocratic composure shattering.

Nathaniel raised a single finger, and the guards retreated like shadows melting into darkness.

Her knees buckled, sending her crumpling onto the cold marble floor.

Raised in gilded luxury, Isabella had never known physical pain. Now her skull throbbed, her vision swam, and she could taste copper where her teeth had cut into tender flesh.

Nathaniel regarded her with the detached interest one might show a particularly repulsive insect. "One more insult about Harrison, and this will seem merciful."

Through swollen eyelids, Isabella saw him lounging in his throne-like chair, the impeccable black suit clinging to his powerful frame. His very presence radiated lethal authority, making her bones vibrate with primal terror.

That glacial stare sent ice water flooding her veins. She trembled uncontrollably.

Scrambling forward on hands and knees, she clutched at his polished Oxfords. "Please! I can't lose you! Don't you understand how terrified I am?"

Nathaniel's laugh was colder than a winter grave. "Congratulations. You already have."

She shook her head violently, tears cutting tracks through the blood on her face. "No! I'll do anything!"

A sudden, stabbing pain lanced through her chest. She clawed at her designer blouse, her flawless complexion draining to corpse-white.

"Nathaniel! My heart - it's tearing apart! Call your physician! I'm too young to die!"

His expression remained impassive as he produced a small amber bottle. "These your little lifesavers?"

Isabella's eyes lit with desperate hope. "Yes! Please!"

With deliberate cruelty, Nathaniel tossed the pills over his shoulder to Dominic. "Let the pain teach you what your conscience couldn't. Maybe a slow, agonizing death will help you understand what you've stolen from Harrison and me."

He stood to leave.

Isabella lunged, fingers twisting in his trousers. "Don't go! I'll die without those!"

Nathaniel didn't bother looking back. His voice carried finality.

"The moment you impersonated Harrison to trap me, you signed your own sentence. This suffering is merely the first installment of your debt."

Hot tears scalded Isabella's ruined face as realization dawned - she was trapped in a nightmare of her own making, with Nathaniel as both judge and executioner.

"I beg you! It was a mistake! I'm sorry!"

His retort came like a guillotine's fall: "If apologies held power, prisons would be empty. You planted this poison, Isabella. Now choke on its fruit."

"They'll come for me!" she screamed hysterically. "My family won't abandon me!"

Nathaniel's smile could have frozen hell. "How touching. Rest assured, I'll personally ensure every Whitmore pays tenfold for your sins. None shall escape."

The heavy doors slammed shut with the finality of a tomb sealing.
###Chapter 531

Nathaniel stated coldly that Isabella was merely facing the consequences of her own actions, but she refused to accept this verdict.

Without sparing her another glance, Nathaniel strode away, his long legs carrying him swiftly toward the exit.

Isabella couldn't let him leave. Collapsing onto the cold floor, she unleashed a desperate scream.

"Nathaniel! Don't walk away! How could you treat me like this? Ever since you married Harrison, I've watched you transform. You fell for her long ago, didn't you? Now that you've discovered she was the girl from your past, you're discarding me without hesitation! You can't do this!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. Nathaniel didn't so much as glance back. Not even a second of his attention remained for her.

Dominic gazed down at the crumpled figure on the floor. "Ms. Isabella, Mr. Falcon is correct. You're facing the harvest of what you've sown."

Isabella's tear-filled eyes lifted to meet Dominic's. She knew perfectly well he'd long since aligned himself with Harrison. He'd always favored her.

Clenching her fists until her nails drew blood, she spat, "Why? Why does everyone adore Harrison? What makes me so inferior?"

Dominic's voice turned glacial. "The question isn't what you lack compared to her. The truth is, you possess nothing that could ever measure up to her worth."

The verbal blow struck deeper than any physical wound. As Dominic turned to leave, Isabella remained alone in the shadowed room.

Her cheek still burned from Nathaniel's slap, her lips stained crimson. Every inch of her body ached from the bodyguards' rough handling, as though her very bones might shatter.

Curled in the corner, she grappled with the unthinkable reality. Nathaniel, who had once cherished her above all others, had cast her aside without remorse.

Fear coiled in her stomach. She had no knowledge of her parents' or Margaret's current actions, but she clung to the certainty they would come for her. They would save her!

The three-day deadline loomed. This marked the Whitmore family's second countdown, and today they would be forced to confess their sins at Benjamin's gravesite.

Oliver, Rosalind, and Gabrielle arrived early at Harrison's apartment. "Harrison, are you prepared? We should depart for the cemetery now."

Harrison gave a firm nod. "I'm ready. Let's go."

As Rosalind opened the door, her breath caught at the imposing figure waiting outside. Nathaniel had been standing there for some time, his presence commanding the hallway.

"Mr. Falcon, what brings you here?" Oliver greeted with polite curiosity.

Nathaniel's intense gaze locked onto Harrison's delicate features. "I'm attending the cemetery as well. You'll ride with me."

Oliver arched an eyebrow. "That won't be necessary. I've brought my car. Harrison can accompany me."

Nathaniel didn't so much as blink, his focus remaining fixed on Harrison. "Isabella remains in my custody, and I have unfinished business with the Whitmores. Harrison rides with me."

After a brief consideration, Harrison turned to Oliver. "I'll go with Mr. Falcon."

Oliver's lips quirked in amusement as he regarded Nathaniel. "Very well, Mr. Falcon. You win this round."

Rosalind stepped forward. "Then I'll join Harrison in Mr. Falcon's car."

Gabrielle nodded in agreement. "I'll ride with Mr. Oliver. We shouldn't delay any longer—let's proceed to the cemetery."

Harrison gave a decisive nod. "Let's go."

The two luxury vehicles set off toward the cemetery. Nathaniel's large hands gripped the steering wheel with controlled intensity as Harrison and Rosalind occupied the backseat.

"Mr. Falcon, how has Isabella been faring these days?" Rosalind inquired.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a humorless smile, his voice distant. "Confined to a darkened room. By now, I imagine she's beginning to unravel at the seams."
###Chapter 532

Confinement in a pitch-black room, completely isolated from the outside world—the disorientation and dread could shatter even the strongest will.

Nathaniel understood the art of psychological torment.

Rosalind smirked, her lips curling with satisfaction. "Isabella had this coming. She stole Harrison's identity and lived like royalty for years. These three days are merely her paying the price for what she took."

Harrison's gaze was glacial, her heart consumed by vengeance for her father.

Just then, she turned toward the car window, her brow furrowing at the sight of multiple roadblocks.

"Why are they shutting down these streets?" she murmured, perplexed.

Rosalind frowned. "This is one of Willowbrook's busiest thoroughfares. I've never seen it closed off before. What’s happening?"

Nathaniel glanced outside, his expression unreadable. "I don’t know."

Rosalind blinked in disbelief. "Mr. Falcon, you’re the most powerful man in Willowbrook. How could you not know about this? This is unprecedented."

Nathaniel found it equally strange. He pulled out his phone. "I’ll make a call."

He dialed Dominic’s number.

Dominic answered immediately, his tone deferential. "Mr. Falcon."

"Why are there so many road closures in Willowbrook today?" Nathaniel demanded.

"I noticed that too. It’s not just the roads—the airport has also been shut down," Dominic replied.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Why?"

"Rumors say a high-profile figure from Metropolia is arriving in Willowbrook today."

A high-profile figure from Metropolia?

Nathaniel’s face remained impassive, but his mind raced. "Where are the Whitmore family members now?"

"They’re already at the cemetery, waiting for you."

The entire Whitmore family had gathered. Their eagerness was unusual—almost suspicious.

"Understood," Nathaniel said, ending the call.

Rosalind arched a brow. "Mr. Falcon, any idea who this Metropolian VIP could be? This is sudden. There were no whispers about it before."

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly. "Only a handful of people in Metropolia wield enough influence to cause this level of disruption."

Harrison’s sharp eyes locked onto Nathaniel’s face. "Who do you think it is?"

His voice was calm. "I don’t know."

Rosalind shrugged. "Whoever it is, it doesn’t concern us. Our focus today is making the Whitmores answer for their crimes."

Yet Harrison couldn’t shake the unease coiling in her chest. Something felt off. She had a sinking suspicion that today wouldn’t go as planned.

Her gaze lifted, meeting Nathaniel’s in the rearview mirror.

He was watching her.

Their eyes held, a silent exchange passing between them. His voice was steady, reassuring. "Don’t worry. I have everything under control."

Soon, the convoy of luxury cars pulled into the cemetery. Harrison stepped out, only to be met with a light drizzle.

Cold winter rain kissed her skin, sharp and biting.

Then, a black umbrella appeared above her. She looked up to see Nathaniel holding it, shielding her from the downpour.

The rain pattered softly against the fabric, droplets splashing onto the damp earth below.

Nathaniel stood beside her, tall and commanding. "They’re all here. Let’s go."

Harrison lifted her gaze—and there they were.

Margaret, Theodore, Victoria, Penelope, Frederick, and Cassandra.

Every last member of the Whitmore family had arrived.
###Chapter 533

Nathaniel shielded Harrison and Rosalind beneath his umbrella as they approached the gathering.

Theodore rushed forward, his expression etched with worry. "Mr. Falcon, where's Isabella? She's been locked up for three days. How is she?"

Victoria's voice wavered as she stepped closer. "You were once close to her. Please, don't be cruel."

Rosalind scoffed. "Always twisting the truth, aren't you? You're accusing Mr. Falcon and Harrison of cruelty, but what about Isabella's crimes? If she hadn't stolen Harrison's identity, would she even be in this mess? You're ignoring everything she's done. How convenient!"

Victoria's face flushed with fury. "Mind your words!"

Theodore turned to Harrison, desperation in his eyes. "Harrison, please let me see her. Just for a moment?"

Harrison studied him. They hadn't interacted much—Theodore had always doted on Isabella. Still, Harrison knew he was a devoted father.

But sometimes, love could be destructive.

Isabella's downfall was the result of Theodore's indulgence, and he bore responsibility for it.

Harrison glanced at Nathaniel. "Bring her out. Let them see."

Nathaniel gave a subtle signal, and Dominic, flanked by guards, escorted Isabella forward.

Oliver and Gabrielle arrived moments later.

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Mom! Dad! You're here!"

Theodore and Victoria nearly lunged forward, restrained only by the guards.

Victoria's heart shattered at the sight of her daughter—bruised cheeks, tangled hair, clothes in disarray. Once the radiant star of ballet, Nathaniel's beloved, now reduced to this.

Tears welled in her eyes. "Isabella, my poor girl! Don't be afraid. We're here now. We won’t let anything happen to you."

Isabella thrashed against the guards' grip. "Save me! I can't go back to that room—I'll lose my mind!"

Theodore's voice was frantic. "You won't. I swear it!"

Harrison's laugh was icy. "That isn't your decision to make. There's only one way to save her—confess. Whoever killed my father will pay."

Margaret stepped forward, her tone sharp. "Harrison, must you take this so far?"

Penelope chimed in, "You've already won. You're Dr. Sinclair. You have Nathaniel. What more do you want?"

Harrison's gaze hardened. Even now, the Whitmores showed no remorse.

There was no point in arguing.

"Justice isn't negotiable. A life for a life. Turn yourselves in."

Margaret sneered. "And if we refuse?"

Rosalind smirked. "You'd prefer the hard way?"

Nathaniel's chilling gaze swept over them. His voice was lethally calm. "Harrison's words are mine. This is your last chance. Otherwise, the Whitmore name will vanish from Willowbrook. Every trace of you—gone."

Margaret paled. Nathaniel Falcon controlled Willowbrook's wealth and power. Against him, the Whitmores were powerless.

He could erase them like ants.
###Chapter 534

Margaret met Nathaniel's gaze with unwavering confidence.

"Mr. Falcon, we never intended to make an enemy of you. But mark my words—you won't lay a finger on Isabella or any of us today. We're walking out of here unharmed."

Her voice was steel, leaving no room for doubt.

Rosalind scoffed. "Mrs. Whitmore, your arrogance knows no bounds. With both Mr. Falcon and Harrison present, do you honestly believe your family can escape unscathed?"

Gabrielle chimed in, her tone dripping with disdain. "Exactly! You once treated Mr. Falcon as your greatest ally. Now that he's turned against you, how dare you still act so bold?"

Margaret's lips curled into a cold smile. "Test me, if you dare."

Harrison studied the Whitmore family closely, her sharp eyes flickering with unease. She knew them too well—Margaret's confidence suggested she had an ace up her sleeve.

Nathaniel, observing the exchange, lifted his hand. "Take them down."

His bodyguards surged forward, moving to apprehend Margaret.

Panic flashed across her face as she turned to Theodore. "Theodore, where is he? He should be here by now!"

An important guest?

Harrison's eyes narrowed. Had the Whitmores called in someone powerful from Metropolia?

Theodore checked his watch. "Any moment now."

Victoria smirked at Harrison. "You thought you had everything under control, didn't you? But I bet you never saw this coming."

Harrison frowned. "What are you talking about?"

Before Victoria could answer, the roar of engines cut through the misty rain. A fleet of sleek, black limousines rolled to a stop, their polished exteriors gleaming under the dim streetlights.

The rain had softened to a drizzle, and as the doors opened, a line of black-suited bodyguards emerged, forming a disciplined path.

A butler stepped forward, holding an umbrella aloft. "Mr. Lancaster, we've arrived."

The car door swung open, and a tall, imposing figure stepped out.

The man was in his prime, dressed in a tailored black overcoat that accentuated his commanding presence. His chiseled features were sharp, his gaze piercing—an aura of power radiating from him like an emperor surveying his domain.

Nathaniel's voice was barely above a whisper. "Henry?"

Oliver moved to Harrison's side, his voice laced with shock. "It's Henry Lancaster—the wealthiest man in the world! No wonder they shut down the airport and blocked the roads. What in the world is he doing in Willowbrook?"

Harrison's clear eyes locked onto Henry. She had heard the legends surrounding this enigmatic figure, but seeing him in person was something else entirely.

Henry had vanished from the public eye years ago, becoming a ghost no media could capture.

Why was he here?

The butler held the umbrella steady as Henry strode forward, his steps measured and confident. His gaze swept over the gathered crowd, assessing them with an air of detached authority.

Margaret beamed, stepping forward eagerly. "Mr. Lancaster! You've arrived at last! Welcome to Willowbrook—we're honored by your presence."

Theodore inclined his head. "I'm the one who reached out to you."

Henry's piercing eyes shifted to him. "Where is my daughter?"

The question landed like a thunderclap, sending shockwaves through the tense silence.
###Chapter 535

Henry Lancaster's voice carried a quiet intensity as he inquired about his missing child.

The billionaire's decades-long disappearance from public life now made perfect sense. The world finally understood - he'd been searching relentlessly for his biological daughter.

Year after fruitless year had passed with no leads.

Now Henry stood in the Whitmore estate, demanding answers about his child's whereabouts.

Rosalind Fairchild gasped. "Dear God! Could his daughter actually be among us?"

Gabrielle's hands flew to her mouth. "The Lancaster heiress... here in this very room?"

Theodore Whitmore met Henry's gaze steadily. "Mr. Lancaster, your daughter stands before you."

Henry's breath hitched. "Where?"

Theodore extended his arm, pointing directly at Isabella. "Isabella is your flesh and blood."

Every head swiveled toward Isabella. She stood frozen, the revelation hitting her like a physical blow. No one had prepared her for this moment.

Henry turned slowly, his piercing gaze locking onto her.

Thud. Thud.

Isabella felt her heartbeat pounding in her ears, her pulse racing wildly. The room seemed to tilt around her.

Was this real? The daughter of the wealthiest man alive? The concept was staggering.

At that precise moment, the guards restraining her collapsed as Henry's security team neutralized them with military precision.

Isabella remained rooted to the spot, struggling to process the impossible situation. She turned to Theodore with wide, questioning eyes. "Father... what's happening?"

Theodore stepped forward, his expression solemn.

"Isabella, I've kept this from you too long. You're not my biological child. I brought you home from Metropolia years ago. Your true father is Henry Lancaster - the most powerful man in the world."

What?

The air left Isabella's lungs as the words struck her like a physical blow.

Victoria rushed forward, eyes shining. "Why are you hesitating? This is your real father standing before you!"

Isabella turned to meet Henry's gaze. Their eyes locked, and the world seemed to pause.

Henry addressed Theodore. "Do you have proof?"

Theodore nodded. "I do."

From his pocket, he produced an exquisite jeweled hairpin.

The diamond-encrusted piece glittered under the chandeliers, clearly worth a fortune.

Henry's usually composed face fractured with emotion at the sight.

"This belonged to Isabella's mother," Theodore explained. "She entrusted it to me when Isabella was born. I was told you'd recognize its significance."

With trembling hands, Henry accepted the precious heirloom.

The cool platinum felt foreign against his skin as he cradled it like the rarest treasure.

Isabella's voice wavered. "Is this... can this really be...?"

Margaret's joyful cry rang out. "Yes, my dear! You're the Lancaster heiress!"

Victoria beamed. "Our lost princess has finally been found."

It was as if fate had thrown open golden gates at the darkest hour of Isabella's life. Never in her wildest fantasies had she imagined such an extraordinary lineage.

Henry Lancaster - the billionaire tycoon - was her biological father.

A hysterical laugh bubbled up from her chest, equal parts disbelief and euphoria. She felt lightheaded with overwhelming joy.

Henry opened his arms wide.

"Come here, princess. Let your old man hold you."
###Chapter 536

Without a moment's hesitation, Isabella rushed forward and threw her arms around Henry. "Father! Where have you been all these years? Why did it take you so long to find me?"

Henry enveloped her in a crushing embrace, his voice thick with emotion. "Forgive me, my darling. I've scoured every continent, searched every major city—I never stopped looking for you."

A radiant smile lit up Isabella's face as she buried her head against his shoulder. "None of that matters now. Promise me we'll never be separated again."

Henry tenderly stroked her hair, his eyes glistening. "You have my word. I'll move heaven and earth to protect you."

As the poignant reunion unfolded, Harrison's brow furrowed. This revelation about Isabella's true parentage had come at the worst possible moment.

The spoiled socialite was actually the long-lost heiress to the Lancaster fortune—the wealthiest family in Metropolia!

Just as Henry began leading Isabella away, Harrison's crisp voice cut through the air. "Wait!"

Henry turned slowly, his piercing gaze landing on Harrison. For a fleeting moment, something about the young woman's delicate features struck a chord in his memory, though he couldn't place why.

Isabella smirked, tightening her grip on Henry's arm. "Harrison, meet my father—the most powerful man in the world. Aren't you happy for me?"

She nearly laughed aloud at the thought. With Henry Lancaster as her protector, no one—not Harrison, not Nathaniel—could touch her now.

Harrison's steady gaze never wavered from Henry's face.

"Mr. Lancaster, your daughter and I have unfinished business. She's not leaving until we settle this."

Instantly, Isabella's expression crumpled. "Father, this is Harrison Whitmore. She's been tormenting me for months!" She pointed dramatically to her bruised cheek. "Look what she did to me! She's vicious!"

Henry's eyes turned glacial as he examined the marks on Isabella's face. When his gaze returned to Harrison, it could have frozen molten lava.

"You dare lay hands on my daughter? And now you have the audacity to confront me directly?"

His lips curled into a dangerous smile.

"Nobody harms a Lancaster and lives to boast about it."

Harrison moved to step forward, but Nathaniel's imposing frame materialized between them like a human shield.

"Uncle Henry," Nathaniel greeted with respectful nod.

Henry's expression softened slightly. "Nathaniel. Your father mentioned you'd be returning to Metropolia soon."

The Lancaster and Hawk families had been allies for generations, both pillars of Metropolia's elite society.

"Not immediately," Nathaniel replied evenly.

Henry nodded thoughtfully. "Your father also reminded me of our families' longstanding arrangement."

"Arrangement?" Rosalind echoed, confused.

Henry's attention returned to Nathaniel. "The marriage pact between our houses. With Isabella finally found, it's time we honored our agreement."

The Hawks and Lancasters had sealed this alliance decades ago—their firstborn son and daughter destined to unite the two dynasties. As the Lancaster heiress and Hawk heir, Isabella and Nathaniel were bound by this ironclad contract.
###Chapter 537

The revelation struck Harrison like lightning. This was her first time hearing about the arranged marriage. Her wide eyes locked onto Nathaniel, realizing their fates had been intertwined since birth.

Rosalind had known about the agreement. But the world's most powerful man's precious daughter had vanished two decades ago. With no leads all these years, everyone assumed the Lancaster heiress had perished.

Never could she have imagined Isabella was that missing billionaire's daughter.

Gabrielle exhaled sharply. Today was supposed to bring justice for Benjamin's death. But Isabella's shocking lineage had turned everything upside down.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. His voice turned glacial. "Uncle Henry, that arrangement was between you and my father. But marriages today are about personal choice. That childhood engagement holds no weight."

Henry's expression remained unreadable. No flicker of anger or joy crossed his features. Just a calm smile. "So you're refusing to marry my daughter?"

Nathaniel's gaze briefly flickered to Isabella beside Henry. "Correct. I will never marry her."

Isabella's nails dug into her palms as she glared daggers at Harrison.

Her hatred wasn't for Nathaniel—it was all directed at Harrison.

If not for that woman, none of this would be happening!

Henry studied Harrison with quiet intensity. "If not my daughter, then who? That woman behind you?"

Nathaniel moved to shield Harrison, but she stepped forward, voice steady.

"Mr. Lancaster," she said, "we're not here to discuss family engagements. We're here about Isabella's crimes."

Henry's piercing gaze shifted fully to Harrison. She was Isabella's age—most girls would tremble under his scrutiny.

But Harrison met his eyes unflinchingly. There was something... different about her.

Henry couldn't shake the feeling he'd sensed since their first encounter.

His voice remained even. "Even knowing who her father is?"

Harrison didn't blink. "Yes. Being your daughter doesn't give her license for murder."

She took a deliberate step forward. "Let me properly introduce your long-lost daughter, Mr. Lancaster. Isabella is manipulative, deceitful, and willing to destroy anyone in her path. She has no conscience—only ambition."

Henry's brow furrowed as he turned to Isabella.

The color drained from Isabella's face. "Father! She's lying!"

Margaret chimed in hastily, "Mr. Lancaster, they've always been rivals! This is pure slander!"

Harrison scoffed. "Look at the entire Whitmore family. They're cut from the same cloth—climbing over corpses to reach the top."

Her eyes found Benjamin's tombstone. His smiling face etched in stone, that gentle expression forever memorialized.

"They murdered my father. Blood demands blood. None of them will walk free—not even your precious Isabella."

The air thickened with Henry's unspoken rage. His presence alone turned oppressive, a silent storm brewing.

Victoria rushed to intervene. "Mr. Lancaster, ignore her hysterics! She's clearly biased!"

Rosalind cut in sharply. "Still denying? You just found your daughter, Mr. Lancaster. Perhaps you should examine what kind of woman she's become."

The tension crackled like live wires as two powerful families stood at the brink of war.
###Chapter 538

The tension in the air was palpable.

Harrison's grip on Theodore's arm tightened as she pulled him back.

Nathaniel stepped forward, his voice a low, commanding growl. "Mr. Lancaster, Isabella has been separated from you for years. This isn't the time."

Henry Lancaster's expression softened as his gaze settled on Isabella. "Let's go home."

Isabella smiled, her tone light and carefree. "Of course."

With that, Henry led her away.

Harrison lunged forward. "You can't just—"

But Nathaniel's fingers closed around her wrist, firm yet gentle, stopping her in her tracks. His eyes warned her silently.

Oliver moved closer, his voice urgent. "Harrison, I know you're furious, but Isabella is the daughter of the wealthiest man alive. You can't act recklessly."

Gabrielle and Rosalind both stepped forward, frustration burning in their eyes. "Damn it! She slipped away again!"

Ahead, Isabella reached the sleek black limousine. The butler bowed deeply as he opened the door. "Welcome home, Ms. Lancaster."

The bodyguards, standing in the misty rain, echoed in unison. "Welcome back, Ms. Lancaster!"

The sheer authority in the moment was undeniable.

Isabella smirked, casting one last glance over her shoulder—a taunting, victorious smile directed straight at Harrison.

It was a challenge.

A dare.

After everything Harrison had done, Isabella was still untouchable.

And she wanted Harrison to know it.

Harrison's blood ran cold, her fingers curling into fists. She wanted to charge forward, to—

But Nathaniel's grip tightened. "Harrison!"

She was forced to stay put.

Isabella slid into the car, followed by Margaret and the others. The limousine pulled away smoothly.

As it disappeared down the road, Margaret rolled down the window, her eyes locking onto Harrison's. Theodore, Victoria, Penelope, Frederick, and Cassandra all wore identical smirks—triumphant, mocking—before the car vanished from sight.

Harrison's vision blurred with rage.

Rosalind snarled. "Unbelievable! The Whitmores escaped again! How dare they act so smug after everything they've done!"

Gabrielle clenched her fists. "I can't stand this! They have no shame!"

Harrison's fury burned like wildfire, but the bitter truth remained—Isabella was untouchable.

She yanked her arm free from Nathaniel and turned back to Benjamin's grave.

His photo stared back at her, his gentle smile frozen in time. Her fist trembled. "Dad... I'm sorry. I failed you. But I swear, no matter who Isabella's father is, no matter what she does—I will make her pay."

Benjamin's kind eyes offered no reply.

Nathaniel moved beside her. "Let's go."

Suddenly, Harrison's vision darkened. Her knees buckled.

Nathaniel's face paled. "Harrison!"

He caught her before she hit the ground, pulling her into his arms.

Oliver, Rosalind, and Gabrielle rushed forward. "Harrison! Are you okay?"

Without hesitation, Nathaniel lifted her. "We're leaving. Now."

When Harrison opened her eyes again, she was back in her apartment, lying in the soft embrace of her bed.

"You're awake."

She turned her head to see Nathaniel, who had been sitting vigil beside her.

His fingers wrapped around hers, warm and steady. His voice was rough with worry. "Don't ever scare me like that again."
###Chapter 539

Nathaniel confessed to Harrison that her fainting spell had terrified him.

Before Harrison entered his life, fear had been an alien concept to Nathaniel.

Everything changed after their paths crossed. Watching her collapse before Benjamin's grave had stolen his breath away.

Harrison appeared fragile, still in her first trimester. The emotional turmoil she'd endured left her visibly shaken.

"I'm fine. As a doctor, I know my body better than anyone," she insisted, slipping her delicate hand from his grasp.

But Nathaniel immediately recaptured it, cradling her fingers gently. "Let me stay with you."

Harrison met his gaze, her voice icy. "That's unnecessary. We're divorced—there's nothing between us anymore. Besides, you're engaged to Isabella. I understand how these high-society alliances work. You should honor your commitment."

"I won't marry Isabella," Nathaniel declared firmly.

"Your marital plans don't concern me," Harrison replied, her tone detached.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with unspoken emotions.

The door swung open, revealing Rosalind and Gabrielle.

"Harrison! You're awake!"

With others present, Nathaniel reluctantly released her hand.

Rosalind helped Harrison sit up while Gabrielle brought over a steaming bowl of chicken broth. "You need to regain your strength. Drink this while it's hot."

Gabrielle began spoon-feeding Harrison.

Oliver entered, his sharp gaze fixed on her. "What's your next move regarding the Whitmores?"

Harrison remained silent.

Oliver continued, "Henry Lancaster is the wealthiest man alive—a living legend who built an empire. Now that he's reunited with Isabella, she's untouchable."

Nathaniel watched Harrison with concern. "You're pregnant. You can't act recklessly. Henry is dangerously powerful and cunning. After decades apart, he'll spare no expense to compensate Isabella for lost time."

Rosalind clenched her fists in frustration. "So we just watch as Isabella becomes an overnight heiress and lives lavishly?"

Gabrielle shook her head. "The daughter of the richest man... How did she get so lucky?"

Harrison sipped her broth silently. The fire of vengeance burned within her. She'd been so close to avenging her father.

"I need to rest," she murmured.

"Of course," Rosalind said softly.

Harrison lay back, letting exhaustion claim her.

Nathaniel, Oliver, Rosalind, and Gabrielle retreated to the living room.

Rosalind eyed Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, I didn't realize you still had ties to Isabella. Childhood engagements are binding in elite circles, aren't they? Doesn't that make her your fiancée?"

Nathaniel shot her a brief glance. "Stay with Harrison. I'm leaving."

Back at his penthouse, Dominic greeted him quietly. "Mr. Falcon, your family called."

Nathaniel already knew. His phone had vibrated earlier—a call from the Falcons in Metropolia. He'd ignored it.

Now it rang again, the melodic chime signaling another call. His mother this time.

Nathaniel answered. "Hello, Mother."

Victoria Falcon's voice came through. "I heard Henry Lancaster is in Willowbrook. Did you meet him?"
###Chapter 540

Victoria's voice carried through the phone with calculated precision. "I heard Henry Lancaster finally located his missing daughter. Our families have that longstanding marriage alliance, Nathaniel. His daughter is your intended. Have you been introduced yet?"

Nathaniel stood motionless before the panoramic windows, his broad silhouette outlined against the twilight glow. "Mother, that arrangement was made between you and the Lancasters. I never consented to it."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. "Explain yourself," Victoria demanded, her tone turning glacial.

"I won't marry Henry Lancaster's daughter." Nathaniel's voice held finality.

A sharp intake of breath crackled through the speaker. "Are you suggesting we sever generations of alliance? The Lancaster and Hawk families have stood together for centuries! Marriage is the strongest bond between noble houses. As heir to Falcon Enterprises, surely you understand this!"

Nathaniel's chiseled profile remained impassive as marble.

Victoria's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Is there another woman?" The unspoken threat hung heavy between them. "Those... distractions you entertain, I've turned a blind eye. But remember your position. Temporary amusement, nothing more. Now that Henry has found his daughter, you'll end all other entanglements. The Lancaster heiress deserves your undivided attention."

She didn't wait for rebuttal.

"Cross this line, Nathaniel, and I'll intervene personally." The call terminated with surgical abruptness.

Dominic stepped forward from the shadows. "Sir, you know how Mrs. Victoria operates. If she discovers your connection with Ms. Harrison..."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened like storm-churned seas, his expression inscrutable. "Understood. Dismissed."

"Very good, Mr. Hawk."

Across the city, the Whitmore estate blazed with celebratory lights, welcoming their distinguished guest.

In the gilded parlor, Henry Lancaster reclined against plush velvet cushions while Margaret Whitmore personally served his tea. "Mr. Lancaster, your favorite blend."

Isabella clung to Henry's arm with possessive delight, marveling at her sudden fortune. Resentment simmered beneath her adoring gaze - why had Theodore and Victoria hidden her true heritage? She should have been raised in Metropolia's glittering circles, not this provincial estate.

Her eyes glittered as she gazed up at Henry. "Father, why did it take you so long to find me?"

Henry patted her hand absently. "I searched tirelessly, my dear."

"And my mother?" Isabella pressed. "Why didn't she come for me?"

Henry's smile faltered. Theodore interjected smoothly, "Your mother passed giving birth to you, Isabella."

Dead? Isabella barely concealed her indifference. What mattered was the living billionaire before her now.

She tightened her grip on Henry's sleeve. "Then you must love me twice as much to make up for it!"

Henry nodded indulgently. "Which is why I've come to bring you home to Metropolia."

Isabella's pulse quickened.

"A grand ball will announce your return," Henry continued. "All of high society will witness the Lancaster heiress reclaiming her rightful place." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "You'll want for nothing."
###Chapter 541

Henry Lancaster wanted the whole world to know his daughter had returned.

Isabella's heart raced with exhilaration. It felt surreal, like a dream she never wanted to wake from.

This was incredible. Absolutely breathtaking.

Isabella nodded eagerly. "Yes! I'd love to return to Metropolia with you! I want to go home!"

Just then, Margaret spoke up. "Mr. Lancaster, are you truly taking Isabella back so soon? All these years, she's been with us at the Whitmore estate. I've cherished her like a rare jewel, granting her every wish. Isn't that right, Isabella?"

Margaret glanced at Isabella, her expression now dripping with politeness—nothing like the sharp, scrutinizing looks she used to give. She was clearly trying to win Isabella's favor now.

Isabella couldn't help but smirk. Once, she had bent over backward to please Margaret. Now, the tables had turned. Margaret was the one seeking her approval.

Isabella knew exactly what Margaret was hinting at. The Whitmores had raised her, and now they expected something in return from Henry.

She was more than happy to grant a small favor. After all, she was the daughter of the wealthiest man alive.

She turned to Henry. "Father, the Whitmores raised me. They're like family."

Margaret nodded eagerly. "Exactly, Mr. Lancaster! Isabella is extraordinary, and we've poured everything into her upbringing."

Henry's gaze shifted to Margaret. "Mrs. Whitmore, if you want something, just say it."

Margaret beamed. "Mr. Lancaster, as you know, that young woman you met—Harrison—has a vendetta against our family. She wants to destroy us. We have one simple request: Just tell her she can’t touch us as long as you're involved."

In Henry's mind, Harrison's delicate, heart-shaped face flashed before him. After a brief silence, he replied, "Fine."

The Whitmore family erupted in celebration. Henry's word was law—no one would dare lay a finger on them now.

Margaret grinned. "Thank you, Mr. Lancaster!"

Henry turned to her again. "That girl's name is Harrison?"

Margaret hesitated, surprised by his sudden interest.

Isabella's stomach twisted. Why was he asking about her?

She couldn't let anyone steal his attention.

Margaret nodded. "Yes, her name is Harrison."

Henry arched a brow. "Who is her mother?"

Victoria hesitated, unsure of his intentions. She stepped forward. "Mr. Lancaster, Harrison is my daughter."

Henry studied Victoria, his gaze piercing. "She's your daughter? You don’t resemble each other at all."

Victoria stiffened. "Well—"

Isabella clung to Henry's arm, pouting. "Father, why are you asking about her? We just reunited, and now you're distracted by someone else! It hurts my feelings."

She feigned anger perfectly.

Henry immediately softened. "Forgive me, my dear. I was merely curious. If it upsets you, I won’t mention her again."

Victoria spoke gently. "Mr. Lancaster, Isabella has missed you all these years. She's bound to be sensitive. Please cherish her even more."

Henry pulled out a sleek black card and handed it to Isabella. "This is yours."

Isabella's eyes widened. A black, gold-embossed card—exclusive, global access, unlimited funds.

Henry smiled. "We'll leave for Metropolia soon, but before we go, take this and enjoy yourself."

Isabella clutched the card, grinning. "Thank you, Father! You're the best!"
###Chapter 542

Henry Lancaster gazed at Isabella with tender affection, his eyes shimmering with paternal pride.

Theodore observed the scene with a knowing smile, while Victoria Whitmore stood silently in the shadows, her lips curling into a satisfied smirk.

Every calculated move had led to this perfect moment.

As twilight painted the sky, Isabella retreated to her chambers. Within minutes, Victoria slipped in after her.

"Isabella," she murmured softly.

The response was glacial. "What do you want?"

"I simply wished to see you before your departure to Metropolia with Mr. Lancaster. The thought of your absence already pains me."

Though Victoria's sorrow was genuine, Isabella remained unmoved.

"I'm perfectly fine. You may leave now," came the dismissive reply.

"Isabella—" Victoria reached for her daughter's hand.

Isabella recoiled violently. "Don't touch me! Must you be so insufferable?"

Victoria staggered back as if struck. "How dare you speak to me this way? I'm your mother!"

"Mother?" Isabella's laugh was razor-sharp. "You're nothing of the sort. My real mother is dead. At best, you're my guardian."

The words froze Victoria's blood. She'd orchestrated the grandest deception—swapping Isabella with Harrison, securing her position as Lancaster heiress. Never had she imagined this betrayal.

For years, Victoria had poured her soul into Isabella. The girl had been her purpose, her legacy.

"Isabella, you're my daughter. I love you—" Victoria's voice cracked.

"Love?" Isabella scoffed. "What has your love ever given me? Now I'm the wealthiest heiress alive. My true father will provide everything. I've outgrown your pathetic affection. Leave."

Panic clawed at Victoria's throat. "You're casting me aside?"

Isabella crossed her arms, a statue of ice. "Let me be clear—you were never my mother. To avoid confusion, I'll address you as Mrs. Whitmore from now on."

Mrs. Whitmore?

The formal title struck like a slap. Victoria seized Isabella's wrist. "Listen to me—"

"Enough!" Isabella wrenched free. "The Whitmores raised me, but Father has promised to compensate you. Don't be greedy. Get out!"

Without ceremony, Isabella shoved Victoria into the corridor and slammed the door. The thunderous crash echoed through the manor.

Victoria stood paralyzed, her face ghostly pale.

Her own flesh and blood had exiled her. After sacrificing everything—her morals, her sanity—for Isabella's future, this was her reward.

So much remained unsaid. The dangerous truth about Isabella's lineage. The catastrophic consequences if Henry discovered the deception.

But Isabella was already drunk on power, deaf to reason.

"Isabella! Open this door! We must speak!" Victoria pounded on the oak.

Theodore appeared, disapproval darkening his features. "Victoria, what madness is this? It's late. Let the girl rest."

Victoria's mouth opened soundlessly. Fear strangled her words—fear Theodore might uncover the truth.

His gaze softened as he studied Isabella's door.

"She's reunited with her father, returning to Metropolia. Though I failed her mother, I can rest knowing she's with family."

A wistful smile touched his lips.

"Protecting Isabella remains my life's purpose."

The irony burned Victoria's tongue. If only Theodore knew—the girl he cherished wasn't Harrison at all.
###Chapter 543

Victoria's lips curled into a bitter smile as she studied Theodore's face.

Beneath her composed exterior, a storm of conflicting emotions raged. Love and hatred twisted together in her heart like thorned vines.

She had loved him once.

Victoria had always been a woman who craved romance. Born into poverty, she'd married Benjamin Lancaster for his wealth, though her heart remained untouched by his devotion.

Benjamin had adored her, showering her with every luxury, yet she'd remained unsatisfied.

Until Theodore entered her life.

Theodore was everything she'd ever dreamed of - an educated man with poetic sensibilities, freshly returned from university. For Victoria, it had been love at first sight.

But Theodore's heart belonged to another.

To him, Victoria was merely a convenient caretaker for Isabella. He'd married her solely to provide his beloved's daughter with a proper stepmother.

His entire life had been dedicated to protecting that woman's child.

Victoria knew this truth all too well.

Jealousy festered within her. Years ago, she'd conceived an audacious scheme - she'd switched Isabella with Harrison.

Now, watching Theodore, Victoria suppressed a dark chuckle. She'd succeeded in her revenge. The day Theodore discovered he'd been guarding the wrong person would be priceless.

Better still, she'd secured her own daughter's future as heir to the Lancaster fortune. The thought brought her perverse satisfaction.

Yet now, the consequences of her actions were becoming apparent. Isabella no longer acknowledged her as mother.

Theodore's sharp voice cut through her thoughts. "Why so quiet?"

His piercing gaze swept over her, suspicion darkening his eyes.

"Something's off. What are you hiding?"

Victoria's pulse quickened. "You're imagining things."

"I hope so," Theodore growled. "But don't even think about causing trouble. Mr. Lancaster is taking Isabella to Metropolia. Any foolish actions won't be tolerated."

Victoria forced a compliant nod, though bitterness churned within her. "I understand. Now, let's retire. Mr. Lancaster gave Isabella a credit card today. We're going shopping tomorrow."

Theodore gave a curt nod. "Very well."

The next morning found Isabella flanked by Victoria and Penelope at the most exclusive shopping center in Willowbrook.

Isabella moved through the designer boutiques like a queen holding court. She pointed imperiously at the displays. "That purse, that one, and those - wrap them all."

The sales associates' eyes gleamed with commission dreams. "Right away, Ms. Whitmore."

Isabella's smile turned predatory. "Actually, don't call me that anymore."

Confusion flickered across the clerks' faces. Penelope interjected smugly, "She's taking the Lancaster name now."

"Lancaster?" One associate gasped. "As in... Henry Lancaster?"

Another clerk whispered excitedly, "I heard the Lancaster heiress went missing years ago. They've been searching ever since."

"Some people are born lucky," murmured a third.

Isabella preened under their awed stares. "Well, it seems I'm that missing heiress."

The boutique erupted in shocked gasps. "Truly? You're the Lancaster heir?"
###Chapter 544

Isabella's lips curled into a triumphant smirk. "Absolutely genuine! Mr. Lancaster is currently at the Whitmore estate. He'll be taking me back to Metropolia soon."

Her manicured fingers produced the matte black card with gilded edges that Henry had given her.

"Use this," she instructed the salesgirl, whose eyes nearly bulged when she spotted the embossed surname - Lancaster - gleaming on the reverse side.

The boutique staff erupted in hushed excitement. "Oh my God, it's Mr. Lancaster's personal card! She really is the heiress!"

"Imagine - shopping with the wealthiest man's daughter! I'm absolutely posting this on my Insta. This moment will define my career!"

Isabella soaked up their fawning admiration like sunlight. Vanity had always been her weakness, and now she reveled in being the center of attention.

Then Penelope's voice cut through the chatter. "Harrison? What are you doing here?"

Isabella spun around to find Harrison standing near the entrance with Rosalind. Those piercing emerald eyes locked onto Isabella with unsettling intensity.

The sight only fueled Isabella's gloating. Her smile widened.

"What a coincidence! Daddy gave me his unlimited card last night. Since we're old acquaintances..." She waved a hand at the luxury displays. "Pick anything you like. Consider it my treat."

Penelope tittered. "Always so generous, Isabella!"

"Of course," Isabella purred. "Think of it as... philanthropy."

Victoria playfully swatted her arm. "Must you phrase it that way? You'll hurt Harrison's feelings!" She turned to Harrison with mock sympathy. "But really, darling, life's unfair isn't it? All those years studying at Westfield, becoming Dr. Sinclair... yet here you are, still working for money while Isabella inherits billions. Such is fate."

Her words dripped with venomous amusement.

Rosalind's fists clenched, but the undeniable truth remained - Isabella was now untouchable. "Your birthright saved you, Isabella. Without it..."

"Exactly!" Isabella chirped. "With Daddy's protection, no one dares cross me."

Penelope added smugly, "Oh Harrison, Mr. Lancaster personally assured Grandmother Margaret last night - the Whitmores are under his protection now. Any thoughts of avenging your father? Forget it."

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms.

Then Harrison spoke. "Rosalind."

Silence fell.

Harrison stepped forward, her gaze boring into Victoria. "How did my father really die?"

Victoria's crimson lips twisted into a cruel smile. "So persistent! Very well, since you insist..."

She leaned in, her whisper carrying the weight of a death sentence.

"Benjamin was poisoned. Edith - I mean Margaret, Theodore, Frederick, Cassandra and I were all there. We held him down together."

Harrison's hands trembled at her sides.

"He fought like a cornered animal. Then Margaret arrived... and she personally poured the poison down his throat."

Victoria's voice dropped to a theatrical whisper.

"Such devotion! Even as he died, his eyes stayed open, calling your name - 'Harrison... Harrison...' Over and over until the end."
###Chapter 545

The sharp sound of shattering glass pierced the air.

Harrison's fingers curled into fists so tight that her manicured nails drew blood from her palms.

Her almond-shaped eyes, usually so clear, now burned crimson with a volatile mix of emotions - shock, fury, grief, and an unbearable ache that threatened to consume her. It felt as though her heart had been torn from her chest, the pain so visceral she could barely breathe.

She'd long suspected Benjamin's death wasn't accidental, but hearing the brutal truth spoken aloud was like being crushed beneath an avalanche. The weight was unbearable.

The Whitmore family - the very people who had raised Benjamin - were his murderers.

His wife. His brothers. His sister-in-law. And Margaret. Though adopted, Benjamin had always considered Margaret his true mother.

When Margaret had entered the room that fateful day, Benjamin had stopped resisting.

It was Margaret who had personally forced the poison between his lips.

What unimaginable torment must he have endured in those final moments?

He'd called for Harrison repeatedly until his last breath...

Tears welled in Harrison's bloodshot eyes. She couldn't bear to imagine her father's final thoughts. She'd never gotten to say goodbye.

Her delicate hands trembled violently as fat tears splashed onto the marble floor.

Victoria watched Harrison's anguish with perverse satisfaction. This was the daughter of that woman - the one Theodore had sacrificed everything to protect. Seeing Harrison's pain, her helplessness - it filled Victoria with dark triumph.

A cruel smile twisted Victoria's lips. "Harrison, I'm telling you all this now because what could you possibly do about it?"

Harrison stumbled back, only to be steadied by Rosalind's firm grip.

Rosalind's voice trembled with concern. "Are you alright?"

Harrison shook her head mutely.

Rosalind turned blazing eyes on Victoria. "You monsters! Karma will destroy you!"

Victoria scoffed. "Karma? We've prospered all these years! The Whitmores thrive while Harrison here was abandoned in some backwater village. Isabella took her place as the girl who saved Nathaniel. Now she's the heiress to the Lancaster fortune. Where's this so-called karma? Just fairy tales for fools!"

Rosalind fell silent, stunned by such calculated cruelty.

Harrison wiped her tears with deliberate slowness. When she opened her eyes again, they glittered with icy resolve. A mocking smile curved her lips.

"Your reckoning is coming... The hour simply hasn't struck yet. Every one of you who murdered my father will pay."

Isabella stepped forward, arrogance dripping from every pore. "Enough! With my father's protection, what could you possibly do to us?"

Before Harrison could respond, a deep voice cut through the tension. "Isabella, what's happening here?"

Harrison turned to see Henry Lancaster approaching.

A phalanx of black-suited bodyguards parted as Henry strode forward in his cashmere overcoat, his butler trailing respectfully behind. The appearance of the world's wealthiest man caused an immediate stir; shoppers froze mid-step to gawk.

Isabella instantly transformed, rushing to link arms with her father, her face alight with practiced adoration. "Daddy! What are you doing here?"

Henry's expression softened with paternal affection. "Just checking on my precious girl."

Isabella beamed. "I'm perfect, Daddy. Don't worry about me."

Nearby sales associates whispered excitedly. "Is that Henry Lancaster? The billionaire?"

"My God, he's even more handsome in person!"

The starstruck staff practically swooned, their admiration palpable.

At just over forty, Henry Lancaster was in his prime - wealth, power, and influence at their zenith. To the young women present, he represented the ultimate fantasy - sophisticated, powerful, and devastatingly attractive.
###Chapter 546

Henry Lancaster's gaze softened as it lingered on Isabella before shifting to Harrison.

This was their second encounter.

Harrison met his stare with red-rimmed eyes, her vision clearer now after shedding tears. The intensity between them was palpable.

Penelope seized the moment to interject. "Mr. Lancaster, you arrived just in time! Harrison was bullying Isabella again."

Ever the picture of grace, Isabella stepped forward. "Father, it's alright. I understand. Now that I'm your daughter, Harrison must be struggling with jealousy. Let her vent."

Henry's expression hardened as he turned back to Harrison. "I don't know what vendetta you hold against my daughter, nor do I care. But mark my words—harass her again, and there will be consequences."

His warning hung heavy in the air.

Harrison's lips curled into a cool smile. "Mr. Lancaster, perhaps you should worry more about Isabella's weak heart. If you don't, you might lose her before you even get the chance to truly know her."

At the mention of her condition, Isabella clutched her chest dramatically. "Father, it hurts... Only Harrison can perform the surgery I need."

Henry's steel-gray eyes bore into Harrison. "Name your price. What do you want in exchange for saving my daughter?"

Harrison took a deliberate step forward. "You're a man of power, aren't you? You vowed to protect Isabella and the entire Whitmore family. So tell me—why can't you figure out how to cure her?"

With that, she turned on her heel.

Henry was momentarily stunned, then amused. People trembled in his presence—even Isabella, who adored him, treated him with reverence. But Harrison? She didn't fear him at all.

That girl... She had spine.

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

Harrison froze, then lifted her chin defiantly. "Let go, Mr. Lancaster."

Henry smirked. "I don't think so. If you're the only one who can save my daughter, you're coming with me."

Just then, a smooth, familiar voice cut through the tension. "Uncle Henry, I'm afraid you can't take her."

Harrison's breath hitched as Nathaniel stepped into view, his broad frame clad in a tailored black suit.

Rosalind exhaled in relief. Nathaniel had arrived.

She rushed to his side, whispering urgently, "Nathaniel, Mr. Lancaster wants to force Harrison to operate on Isabella. You can't let him—she's pregnant!"

Isabella's heart fluttered at the sight of Nathaniel. "Nathaniel..."

He didn't spare her a glance. His strides were purposeful as he closed the distance, seizing Harrison's other arm.

His voice was ice. "Let. Her. Go."

Now, Harrison stood trapped between the two most powerful men in Willowbrook.

Henry arched a brow, amused. "Nathaniel, technically, I'm your future father-in-law. Are you really challenging me over her?"

Nathaniel's grip tightened. "You misunderstand, Uncle Henry. You're the one interfering. Harrison belongs to me."

The declaration rang clear—Harrison was his.

Her gaze locked onto Nathaniel's sharp, aristocratic features.

Henry frowned. "Your woman? Then what does that make Isabella? You two have a marriage agreement."
###Chapter 547

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto Henry with unwavering determination. "Uncle Henry, let me make this perfectly clear—I will never marry Isabella. The only woman I love is Harrison."

Isabella's face twisted in anguish. "Nathaniel!"

With a swift motion, Nathaniel pulled Harrison free from Henry's grip, drawing her protectively against his chest.

Harrison stumbled slightly before melting into Nathaniel's embrace. His strong arm encircled her waist as he murmured, "Are you hurt?"

She shook her head. "I'm fine."

Nathaniel's voice was firm. "Let's leave."

"Alright."

Harrison attempted to step away, but Nathaniel effortlessly scooped her into his arms.

Her breath hitched in surprise, but he only tightened his hold. "Hold onto me."

Wrapping her arms around his neck, Harrison let him carry her away, leaving Henry and Isabella behind.

Rosalind turned to Isabella, sticking out her tongue playfully. "So what if you're the richest heiress? You still lost your fiancé!"

Isabella's face flushed crimson with fury. "How dare you—"

"Ah-ah," Rosalind interrupted, wagging a finger. "Careful, Isabella. Remember your heart condition. If you get too worked up, Harrison won't be able to treat you."

Isabella clenched her fists, speechless.

Rosalind giggled and dashed off before she could retaliate. "Mr. Falcon, wait for me!"

Already seething from the confrontation, Isabella trembled with rage. She clutched Henry's arm. "Father, look at her! She refuses to treat me. What am I supposed to do?"

Henry regarded her calmly. "Once we return to Metropolia, I'll arrange for the finest specialists to examine you. I'll bring in the world's top cardiologists. There are plenty of brilliant doctors—Harrison isn't the only one. I promise, you'll recover."

His words soothed her slightly. With Henry's influence, she knew he could secure a physician even more skilled than Harrison.

Then she wouldn't need Harrison at all.

Victoria, standing nearby, beamed. "That's wonderful, Mr. Lancaster! Isabella will finally get the care she deserves."

"But, Father," Isabella interjected, her expression darkening. "What about Nathaniel and me?"

Henry studied his daughter thoughtfully.

"I can see he has no affection for you. His heart belongs to Harrison. Love can't be forced, Isabella. Marriage is a lifelong commitment—it should be built on mutual devotion. Let Nathaniel go. I'll find you a worthy match. There are countless eligible heirs in Metropolia. You can choose any of them."

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "Are any of them as exceptional as Nathaniel?"

Henry sighed. "No. Nathaniel isn't just the Falcon family's most promising heir—he's one of the most formidable young businessmen today. In a decade, his achievements may even surpass mine."

Deep down, Isabella knew he was right. She'd met many men, but none compared to Nathaniel. His brilliance, his poise, his character—he was unparalleled.

"Father, I don't want anyone else! Only Nathaniel!" Her voice was steel.

Henry exhaled. "Isabella."

She clung to his arm, her tone sweet but desperate. "If you truly want my happiness, help me win him back! We already have a marriage agreement. Nathaniel was always meant to be mine!"

She refused to surrender him to Harrison. She could accept being the richest heiress, but she would never accept losing the title of Mrs. Falcon.

She wouldn't let herself be second to Harrison—not in Nathaniel's life, not in the business world. Never.

Victoria added softly, "Mr. Lancaster, you may not realize it, but Isabella and Mr. Falcon have known each other for years. Her love for him runs deep. No one could ever replace him."
###Chapter 548

Nathaniel studied Harrison's resolute gaze and exhaled deeply, his resistance crumbling at last.

"Fine. If this is truly your wish, then I'll stand by you. Rest assured—Nathaniel will marry you."

"Are you certain? He doesn't seem eager to take that step yet."

Henry Lancaster offered her a steadying smile. "The agreement between our families isn't something Nathaniel can disregard. The Falcon dynasty would never permit him to wed anyone else. The title of Mrs. Falcon is yours by right."

Harrison's eyes sparkled with triumph. "That's perfect! Thank you, Father!"

Victoria, ever the opportunist, chimed in smoothly. "Mr. Lancaster, it's obvious Mr. Falcon has developed feelings for Isabella. To secure our position, perhaps we should... intervene."

Henry paused, considering. "I'll contact Nathaniel's mother, Victoria. Once she learns about Isabella..."

He left the thought unfinished, but the implication was clear.

If Victoria Hawk discovered Isabella stood between her son and the Lancaster-Falcon union, she would ensure the girl vanished without a trace.

Harrison and Victoria exchanged knowing glances, lips curving in unison.

"Father," Harrison urged eagerly, "call Mrs. Victoria now."

Henry retrieved his phone. "Very well. I'll do it immediately."

Nathaniel carefully settled Isabella into the plush interior of his Rolls-Royce Shadow, with Rosalind slipping into the seat behind them.

Isabella turned to him, worry shadowing her features. "Mr. Falcon, you shouldn't risk straining relations with the Lancasters because of me."

His voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "I will never marry Harrison."

Isabella remained silent.

A melodic chime cut through the car—Victoria's name flashing across the screen. Nathaniel glanced at it, then let the call go unanswered.

Isabella caught the name. "Your mother?"

He nodded.

"Then why aren't you answering?"

Their eyes locked.

Hers were clear pools of quiet understanding. "It's alright. Take the call."

She already knew what was coming.

Nathaniel stepped out of the car and accepted the call.

Rosalind peered through the window at his retreating figure before turning to Isabella. "Have you heard much about Nathaniel's mother?"

Isabella shook her head.

Rosalind's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper.

"Victoria Hawk comes from old aristocracy. She married Nathaniel's father in a grand society wedding, but he never stopped loving another woman. The night she went into labor with Nathaniel, that woman called—and he abandoned Victoria at the hospital to find her."

Isabella's breath caught.

Rosalind continued, "Victoria hemorrhaged during childbirth. She nearly died bringing Nathaniel into the world. Though she survived, her legs never recovered. She's been wheelchair-bound ever since."

Isabella's fingers tightened around the seat leather. She'd known nothing of this.

"In her prime," Rosalind murmured, "she became a prisoner of that chair. Years passed. Her spirit turned inward. All her ambitions, all her dreams—she poured them into Nathaniel. Raised him with relentless discipline. Molded him into perfection."

A beat.

"And he's never once disobeyed her."

Isabella absorbed this quietly before turning to watch Nathaniel through the glass. His posture was rigid as Victoria's razor-sharp voice carried through the phone:

"Henry Lancaster just informed me you're with someone called Isabella."
###Chapter 549

The moment Nathaniel heard Harrison mention Victoria, his chest constricted painfully.

"Mother."

Victoria's tone was razor-sharp, leaving no room for argument. "I've warned you before—I tolerate your dalliances, but don't you dare let your heart get entangled. Now Henry Lancaster himself called, claiming you're willing to discard his daughter for Harrison. Is this true?"

Nathaniel didn't hesitate. "Yes. Harrison is the only woman I love. I won't marry anyone else."

"You fool!" Victoria's voice crackled with fury. "You're utterly bewitched by that woman! The marriage alliance between the Falcon and Lancaster families is non-negotiable. Now that Henry has found his daughter, you will honor the agreement and wed her immediately."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his expression darkening. "Mother—"

"I've arranged for the private jet. I'll be in Willowbrook tomorrow."

The line went dead with a sharp click.

Victoria was coming.

Nathaniel stood frozen outside the car for a long moment before finally sliding into the driver's seat. "I'll take you home," he murmured.

Harrison nodded. "Alright."

Rosalind twisted in the front passenger seat, her voice laced with concern. "Mr. Falcon, what did Mrs. Victoria say?"

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to the rearview mirror, locking with Harrison's searching eyes. They held each other's stare for a beat before he answered. "She's arriving in Willowbrook tomorrow."

He offered no further explanation.

Rosalind gasped. "She's coming here? After all these years confined to that wheelchair, refusing to leave the estate—she's actually traveling to Willowbrook?"

She hesitated, then added carefully, "You've been away from Metropolia for too long. Shouldn't you return soon?"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line, silent.

Harrison remained equally quiet in the backseat. Thirty minutes later, the Rolls-Royce Shadow glided to a stop outside The Regal Residences.

Nathaniel opened the door, and Harrison stepped out.

He hesitated, his gaze lingering on her. "Harrison, I—"

She cut him off, her voice steady but firm. "Mr. Falcon, I don’t know what you intend to say, but let me repeat myself—we’re divorced. There are no ties between us anymore. So don’t concern yourself with me. Handle your obligations. I refuse to be caught in the crossfire between the Falcon and Lancaster families. Do you understand?"

Nathaniel had so much to say, but her words rendered him speechless. He simply stood there, mute.

Just then, Oliver approached. "Hey, Harrison."

Harrison moved toward him.

Oliver draped an arm around her shoulders. "Tired?"

She shook her head. "I'm fine."

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed at the sight of Oliver’s arm around Harrison. His fingers curled into fists at his sides.

Harrison exhaled, leaning into Oliver’s chest. "Let’s just go home."

Oliver glanced at Nathaniel. "Thanks for bringing Harrison back, Mr. Falcon. See you around."

With that, he took Harrison’s hand, and they walked away.

Nathaniel stood rooted in place, his gaze burning into their retreating figures.

No matter what he did, no matter how hard he tried—Harrison was no longer his.

Rosalind sighed beside him. "You see it now, don’t you? You hurt her too deeply. She’s moved on."

Even as the distance grew, Harrison could feel Nathaniel’s eyes on her back, relentless and unyielding.
###Chapter 550

Oliver's lips curled into a knowing smirk.

"Harrison, what's this little performance about? Trying to put on a show for Mr. Falcon?"

Harrison lifted her head slowly from Oliver's chest, meeting his gaze with a wry smile. "You always see right through me, don't you?"

"So, what's the game between you two?"

"Isabella is Mr. Lancaster's daughter. The Falcon and Lancaster families have an arranged marriage. Nathaniel is supposed to marry Isabella, and his mother, Mrs. Victoria, is arriving in Willowbrook tomorrow. I assume she's here to push them together."

Oliver arched a brow. "So you're trying to make Mr. Falcon give up on you by cozying up to me?"

"Nathaniel and I are over. He doesn't need me complicating his life, and I don’t want to be dragged into this mess."

Oliver nodded thoughtfully. "I hope you truly mean that."

"Of course I do."

As she spoke, Harrison's fingers drifted to her abdomen, her touch feather-light.

Oliver's gaze lingered on her stomach. "So you're not planning to tell him about the baby? He still thinks it's mine. Seeing us together earlier, he probably assumed we were the perfect little family."

Harrison's lashes fluttered as she looked down. "He doesn’t need to know. This is better."

Oliver's lips twitched. "You used to insist he had the right to know—that the child deserved to know its father. But now, you're resolute. You don’t want to tell him. You're afraid it’ll tear him apart, aren’t you? Deep down, you still care."

Harrison shook her head. "I don’t—"

Oliver ruffled her hair affectionately. "It's fine, Harrison. Whether you admit it or not, you know the truth." Silence settled between them.

"So, what’s your next move? Isabella being the Lancaster heiress has thrown everything off course. And your belly’s starting to show."

Harrison considered it. No one had expected Isabella to be the wealthiest heiress in the world. Right now, she couldn’t touch her.

And with her pregnancy, things were too unstable. Her priority had to be herself and the baby.

"Let’s go back to Florentia. I’ll have the baby first. My revenge against the Whitmore family and Isabella can wait."

Relief washed over Oliver. He’d worried her anger would cloud her judgment, but she’d chosen the most rational path. The baby came first.

He nodded. "Good. Isabella’s returning to Metropolia, and I suspect Mr. Falcon will follow."

Harrison stroked her stomach, a faint smile playing on her lips. "That’s fine. I’ll find them in Metropolia later."

The next day...

Victoria arrived in Willowbrook as planned. Her private jet touched down smoothly. With Beatrice pushing her wheelchair, she entered the airport lobby.

Nathaniel stood waiting. He stepped forward. "Mother."

Victoria sat poised in her wheelchair, every inch the refined aristocrat. Her hair was immaculate, the pearls at her ears catching the light—remnants of the beauty she’d once been.

Yet life’s hardships had carved deep lines into her face. Her expression was stern, her eyes shadowed with severity, making her appear far older than her years.
###Chapter 551

Victoria studied Nathaniel with a questioning gaze. "Nathaniel, why are you standing here by yourself? Where's Isabella?"

She was inquiring about Isabella's whereabouts.

At that precise moment, Isabella came skipping toward them, her face radiant. "Mrs. Victoria! Hello! I'm right here!"

Having anticipated Victoria's arrival in Willowbrook today, Isabella had made sure to arrive well in advance.

Isabella was breathtakingly beautiful, like a crimson rose in full bloom. Standing beside Nathaniel, they appeared to be the perfect aristocratic couple.

Victoria's eyes softened as she regarded Isabella. "You must be Isabella, Henry's daughter? Just as exquisite as everyone described."

Blushing, Isabella took Victoria's hand. "Mrs. Victoria, you flatter me too much."

Victoria gave Isabella's hand an affectionate pat. "Our families are united by betrothal. Tell me truthfully - do you love Nathaniel?"

Isabella immediately turned her gaze toward Nathaniel. Taking in his aristocratic features and commanding presence, her heart fluttered wildly. Biting her lower lip, she confessed, "Of course I love Nathaniel, Mrs. Victoria."

"Excellent," Victoria smiled approvingly. "Once we return to Metropolia, our families will expedite the wedding arrangements so you two can marry without delay."

Isabella nodded eagerly. "I would be honored."

However, Nathaniel's expression remained impassive as he stated coldly, "Mother, I won't be marrying Isabella."

Isabella froze in shock.

"This betrothal isn't some trivial matter. No one but Isabella can become your wife. She's the daughter-in-law I've chosen," Victoria declared firmly.

Turning back to Isabella, she added reassuringly, "Don't worry, my dear. You have my full support. If Nathaniel gives you any trouble, you come straight to me."

Isabella's spirits soared. Just when she thought all hope with Nathaniel was lost, Victoria had become her staunchest ally. Nathaniel was known to be a dutiful son, and with Victoria's backing, Isabella was confident she would soon become Mrs. Hawk.

Harrison would remain exactly where she belonged - in the dust.

"I will, Mrs. Victoria," Isabella agreed sweetly.

At that moment, Henry approached them. "Victoria."

Victoria turned to him. "Congratulations on finding your daughter - who also happens to be my future daughter-in-law."

Henry smiled graciously. "I've reserved a private dining room at The Grand Celeste. We should all have dinner together."

Victoria nodded. "That sounds perfect."

The two families proceeded to the lavish private dining room of the six-star hotel. Victoria and Henry walked together while Nathaniel and Isabella were seated side by side.

Victoria inquired of Henry, "When do you plan to return to Metropolia?"

"In the next few days," Henry replied.

Turning to Nathaniel, Victoria said, "Nathaniel, Henry and Isabella will be returning to Metropolia soon. You should accompany me back as well."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line. "I can't leave just yet."

Victoria insisted, "You can delegate matters here to your subordinates. Your presence is required in Metropolia-"

Nathaniel abruptly stood. "There's urgent business at Falcon Enterprises that requires my attention. I'll go to the office now."

Without another word, Nathaniel strode out. As he departed, Victoria's expression darkened. Isabella looked crestfallen. "Mrs. Victoria... it seems Nathaniel doesn't care for me at all..."

"Nonsense," Victoria reassured her.

"You may not know this," Isabella said hesitantly, "but Nathaniel has become infatuated with a woman named Harrison. She's involved with another man and is even carrying his child, yet Nathaniel remains obsessed with her."

"What?!"

Victoria paled dramatically, nearly rising from her seat. She'd heard whispers about a woman named Harrison, but had no idea the woman was pregnant with another man's child.

"That woman leads such a scandalous life! How could Nathaniel possibly be interested in someone like her?"
###Chapter 552

"Mrs. Victoria, please don't blame Nathaniel. It's all Harrison's fault—she's a master at manipulating men. Because of her, Nathaniel refuses to honor our engagement now," Isabella said, her voice trembling with feigned distress.

Victoria turned to Henry, her expression apologetic. "I deeply regret this situation."

Henry arched a brow, his tone measured. "Our families have an agreement, but if Nathaniel no longer wishes to marry Isabella, we won't force him. However, my daughter loves him unconditionally. As her father, I only want her happiness."

His gaze softened as he looked at Isabella. He would move mountains for her, even if it meant defying the heavens themselves.

Victoria nodded. "I understand. The engagement will stand. I'll speak with Harrison personally."

Meanwhile, Harrison had just returned to her apartment at The Regal Residences. With her plans to leave for Florentia already in motion, she was tying up loose ends when the doorbell rang.

Who could that be?

She opened the door to find a group of black-suited bodyguards and Victoria's personal maid, Beatrice, standing outside.

Beatrice studied her with cool detachment. "Ms. Harrison Whitmore?"

Harrison nodded. "Yes. And you are?"

"Mrs. Victoria is in Willowbrook and wishes to see you."

Harrison glanced at the imposing figures behind Beatrice. "I assume refusal isn't an option?"

Beatrice smiled thinly. "You're as sharp as they say. I hear you're expecting. Please, come with us."

Harrison wasn't surprised. She had anticipated this confrontation. "Fine. Let's go."

Just then, Rosalind stormed in. "Where are you going? Who are these people?"

"It's alright," Harrison reassured her. "Nathaniel's mother wants to talk. I'll be back soon."

"This way," Beatrice interjected.

Harrison followed her out, leaving Rosalind standing helplessly in the doorway.

"Harrison!" Rosalind called after her, but it was too late. She immediately dialed Nathaniel.

At Falcon Enterprises, Nathaniel was reviewing contracts when his phone lit up with Rosalind's name. He answered instantly.

"Nathaniel, something's wrong! Harrison's been taken!" Rosalind's voice was frantic.

Nathaniel's pen stilled mid-air. "What?"

"Your mother—she sent people for her!"

His grip on the phone tightened. "Where are they now?"

"I don't know! They just took her!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. His mother had crossed a line.

"Understood. I'll handle it." Hanging up, he turned to Dominic. "Find out where my mother and Harrison are. Now."

Dominic nodded. "Right away, sir."

Harrison was escorted to a lavish hotel suite. Beatrice opened the door, revealing Victoria seated regally in her wheelchair.

Victoria's sharp eyes raked over Harrison, her expression dripping with icy disdain. "So. You're the infamous Harrison Whitmore."
###Chapter 553

Harrison stood composed before Victoria, giving a slight nod. "You're correct."

Victoria withdrew a check from her purse, extending it toward Harrison. "Name your price. Whatever amount will make you walk away from my son."

Harrison shook her head firmly. "I don't need it."

Victoria scoffed.

"I'm certain you're aware of the engagement between the Falcon and Lancaster families. Nathaniel is destined to marry Isabella Lancaster. She's the only suitable match for him."

"The intricacies of high society are complex. This is the path Nathaniel must take—the right one."

"I've also heard rumors about you being involved with another man, carrying his child. Do you truly intend to juggle two relationships? As long as I draw breath, you will never set foot in the Falcon family estate. Abandon that fantasy now."

"If you have any sense, you'll take this check and disappear—far, far away."

Harrison met Victoria's gaze. On her way here, she had braced herself for cruelty, but the words weren't as venomous as she'd anticipated.

Strangely, Harrison found it difficult to despise Victoria. Perhaps it was because she knew Victoria's past—the pain she had endured. There was no reason to make another woman's life harder.

A faint, knowing smile touched Harrison's lips. "You've misunderstood. I refuse the check because Nathaniel and I are already over."

Over?

Victoria froze.

She had encountered countless mistresses in her time, especially the one who had shattered her—the woman her husband had cherished above all. That woman had been a master manipulator, cold and calculating. It was why Victoria loathed them all.

Yet Harrison was different from the rest.

Victoria took a moment to compose herself.

"Then what do you want? I need you to leave my son—completely."

"I want nothing. I'll walk away, so you can rest easy."

Victoria didn't feel reassured at all. The more Harrison refused, the more uneasy she became. "Then why—"

Harrison interrupted gently. "When I was with Nathaniel, I never sought his wealth, his influence, or his status. I married him when he was in a vegetative state."

Victoria stiffened.

"I'm not saying this for sympathy," Harrison continued. "I just don’t want you to misunderstand. If you do, it will create a rift between you and Nathaniel. I understand a mother's love—the sacrifices, the impossible choices of a wealthy family. I lost my father, Benjamin. I know the value of family."

Harrison had lost Benjamin; she wouldn’t let Victoria lose her son too.

In this world, beyond romantic love, there was family.

Nathaniel was devoted to his mother. Harrison refused to force him to choose between love and family. He was the child Victoria had given everything for. After losing her husband, Nathaniel had been Victoria's only light. Harrison wouldn’t take that from her.

Victoria stood motionless, studying Harrison.

Dressed in a white coat, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders, Harrison looked ethereal. Her delicate face, free of makeup, glowed softly in the light—almost angelic.

She met Victoria’s gaze calmly and added, "On my way here, I counted the years. Nathaniel and I have been married for exactly four years. For the first three, he was bedridden—unconscious. All I wanted then was to see him recover."

"After he woke, we struggled to adjust, stumbling through misunderstandings. Looking back now, I realize we never truly had many happy moments together."

"So, as I said—no check is necessary. I’ll let him go."
###Chapter 554

Victoria was momentarily speechless. She had anticipated resistance from Harrison, prepared for arguments and pleas—but the composed woman standing before her shattered all expectations.

"Very well. I trust you'll keep your word. The Lancaster-Falcon union must proceed." Victoria's voice softened slightly. "My husband has an illegitimate son, which is precisely why Nathaniel must marry Henry's daughter."

The existence of Nathaniel's half-brother had always been a carefully guarded secret—yet Victoria had just revealed it to Harrison.

Harrison inclined her head. "I understand. I'll take my leave now. Perhaps our paths will cross again."

Without another word, she turned and walked away, her silhouette fading into the distance.

Beatrice stepped closer, murmuring, "Madam Victoria, I never imagined this conversation would go so smoothly. Ms. Harrison is... unlike what I expected. When I fetched her from The Regal Residences, she carried herself with such grace. She has a presence that commands attention."

Beatrice had served Victoria since childhood, her loyalty unwavering.

Victoria stared at the empty space where Harrison had stood, lost in thought. "No, she isn't what I expected either."

Just then, the door opened. A tall, imposing figure emerged from the adjoining room.

Victoria turned to see Henry Lancaster stepping forward.

He had arrived earlier and overheard every word exchanged between the two women.

Henry's gaze followed the path Harrison had taken. "She's gone?"

Victoria nodded. "Yes. She left without protest."

"Remarkable," Henry mused. "She’s no ordinary woman. Nathaniel has excellent taste."

"Some things simply aren’t meant to be," Victoria murmured.

Henry remained silent.

Harrison descended the grand staircase.

At that moment, a sleek black Shadow pulled up abruptly, its door swinging open to reveal Nathaniel’s striking figure. He had come for her.

He rushed forward, concern etched across his features. "What are you doing here? Did my mother pressure you? Did she say anything to hurt you?"

Harrison shook her head. "No. She was only protecting you. She offered me a check to walk away. I refused."

Nathaniel's eyes brightened, his hand settling on her shoulder. "That’s wonderful! I knew you wouldn’t leave me. Let’s—"

"Mr. Falcon, you misunderstand," Harrison interjected coolly. "I didn’t take the check because there was nothing to walk away from. I have no claim to it."

Nathaniel froze.

Harrison removed his hand from her shoulder with deliberate calm. "Tomorrow, Oliver and I are leaving Willowbrook. I won’t be returning."

"What?" Nathaniel’s voice was raw with disbelief. "You’re leaving tomorrow?"

Harrison nodded. "Yes. The pregnancy is advancing, and I need to focus on bringing this child into the world. Don’t follow me. I just want peace—for Oliver, the baby, and myself."

She turned to leave, but Nathaniel caught her from behind, pulling her into a crushing embrace.

His face buried in her hair, his voice rough with emotion. "I don’t believe you. Please... don’t go."

He held her as if trying to fuse her into his very being.

"After everything we’ve just discovered about each other—how can we part now? Don’t you remember? We promised always."
###Chapter 555
Harrison lowered her delicate lashes, casting shadows across her porcelain cheeks. "Of course I remember. You're the one who forgot."

Nathaniel froze.

She pushed against his chest, turning away sharply. "When I begged for your love, you rejected me. Now that I've moved on, you cling to me like a desperate child. Is this your twisted version of affection? I don't love you anymore."

The words sliced through him again—a blade honed by repetition.

Nathaniel's eyes burned crimson, his voice raw. "You're lying. I refuse to believe you've stopped loving me!"

Harrison met his gaze steadily, enunciating each syllable. "Let me make this painfully clear—I. Don't. Love. You. My heart belongs to Oliver now."

His knuckles whitened, tendons standing in stark relief. "Oliver Blackwell?"

"Yes." She placed a protective hand over her abdomen. "He treats me like a queen. I'm carrying his child. We're finished, Nathaniel. Your constant harassment is suffocating."

"Nathaniel—"

"The Lancasters and Hawks have an engagement contract. Your mother already confronted me. Can't you handle your family drama without dragging me into it? Do you want my baby to grow up fatherless because of your selfishness?"

The words strangled him. He opened his mouth, but no sound emerged—only the crushing weight of helplessness.

"I saved your life twice—first in those caves, then during your coma. I never asked for repayment. Now I'm begging you—stay away. If you ever truly loved me, let me go. Let me find happiness."

Had she remained silent, Nathaniel would have clung to her forever.

But these words? They were steel bars slamming between them.

His fists trembled, chest constricting as if ribs were splintering.

"This is our final conversation. Don't seek me out again. I won't have Oliver misunderstanding us." Her heels clicked against pavement as she walked away.

"Harrison—"

He lunged forward just as a silver Bentley purred to the curb. Oliver emerged, sweeping Harrison into an embrace. "Are you alright? Victoria came to see you?" His fingers traced her cheekbone, eyes dark with concern.

She shook her head. "I'm fine."

Oliver exhaled sharply before spearing Nathaniel with a glare. Without another word, he guided Harrison into the car.

Nathaniel stood paralyzed—a discarded toy in the rain. The realization struck like lightning: he'd lost her.

Truly lost her.

Across the street, a Rolls-Royce's tinted window lowered. Henry Lancaster observed everything—the breakup, the devastation—with hawk-like intensity.

"Mr. Lancaster," his butler murmured, "the investigation is complete."

Henry nodded. "Proceed."

"Miss Harrison did save Nathaniel's life as children, but... Isabella took credit. Later, when Nathaniel became comatose... Isabella fled abroad. Harrison married him in her place, becoming Mrs. Hawk."

The window slid up, sealing Henry's satisfied smirk in darkness.
###Chapter 556

Nathaniel's chiseled jawline was half-hidden in the dim office lighting, his expression unreadable.

The butler cleared his throat gently. "Sir, Ms. Isabella has spent years among ordinary people. It's possible she's developed some...unrefined habits. But once she returns to Metropolia, I'm certain she'll flourish under your guidance."

Since reuniting with Isabella, Nathaniel had ordered a thorough investigation into her past. Every detail, every misstep—he knew them all.

Yet she remained his blood, his flesh and bone.

His gaze flickered toward the door where Harrison had exited. "Let's go."

Nathaniel returned to his office but didn't touch his paperwork. Instead, he uncorked a bottle of aged whiskey and poured himself a glass. Then another.

The alcohol's burn was the only thing dulling the ache in his chest.

Dominic hovered nearby. "Mr. Falcon, perhaps you should slow down. This isn't good for you."

Nathaniel swirled the amber liquid, his smile bitter.

"After I woke from the coma, Harrison monitored everything—no cigarettes, no alcohol. She'd text reminders daily. Office meetings, business trips, it didn't matter. Those messages became part of my routine...and I never replied to a single one."

His grip tightened around the glass.

"Then she left. Vanished. Suddenly I was checking my phone constantly, waiting for those messages that never came. That's when I realized—I thought I held all the power, but she was the one giving everything. And when she walked away, she took half my soul with her."

Dominic's throat tightened. He'd always admired how perfectly Harrison complemented Nathaniel.

"Sir, it's not over. Ms. Harrison is hurt, but given time—"

"She's not coming back." Nathaniel drained his glass. "She has Oliver now. A family. What could I possibly offer her?"

"Mr. Falcon—"

"Leave me, Dominic." His voice cracked. "Just...leave."

Once alone, the silence pressed in. Without Harrison, the penthouse wasn't a home—just empty rooms filled with ghosts.

"Harrison...don't go..." The words slurred as he collapsed onto the desk.

Morning light revealed Nathaniel still slumped over, the air thick with liquor.

Dominic rushed forward. "Sir? You need to wake up."

Nathaniel lifted his head slowly, his eyes bloodshot. "What?"

Dominic hesitated. "We just received word. Ms. Harrison is leaving Willowbrook today."

Nathaniel froze.

Already? She couldn't be leaving already!

"She's en route to the airport with Mr. Oliver as we speak."

Harrison was leaving. With Oliver.

Nathaniel's chair clattered to the ground as he bolted upright. In seconds, he was sprinting for the door.

He couldn't let her go. Not like this.
###Chapter 557

The morning sun cast golden rays over Willowbrook International Airport, painting the terminal in warm light. Harrison and Oliver stood near the departure gates, their luggage waiting beside them. Gabrielle and Rosalind had come to bid their farewells.

Gabrielle's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she clutched Harrison's hands. "Do you really have to go?"

Harrison offered a soft smile. "It's only temporary. I'll be back before you know it."

Her fingers brushed lightly over Harrison's still-flat stomach. "Take care of yourself—and the little one. I'm holding you to that godmother promise."

Rosalind pulled Harrison into a fierce embrace. "You're really leaving like this? Nathaniel doesn't even know. He doesn’t know about the baby. Shouldn’t we at least—"

Despite her loyalty to Harrison, Rosalind couldn't shake the guilt. Nathaniel was still family. This ending felt wrong.

Harrison exhaled slowly. "Some things just aren't meant to be. Love can't be forced."

Rosalind tightened her grip before releasing her. "Then be safe."

Watching the emotional farewell, Oliver chuckled. "Come on, it's not like we're sailing across the ocean. A few hours on a plane, and you’ll see each other again. Harrison, we should head to the gate."

Harrison gave Gabrielle and Rosalind one last look. "I’ll call when I land."

"Bye, Harrison." Their voices wavered as they waved.

Oliver took the suitcase, guiding Harrison forward.

Though Willowbrook had been the stage for her deepest heartbreaks, leaving now felt like tearing away a piece of herself.

This city held the best years of her life—every memory with Nathaniel lived here.

Then, her phone buzzed.

She pulled it from her bag.

Nathaniel—his name flashed across the screen.

Harrison stared at it, her breath catching.

"You can answer if you want," Oliver murmured.

She shook her head. "There’s nothing left to say."

With that, she silenced the call and followed Oliver toward security.

Suddenly, a group of black-suited bodyguards materialized, blocking their path.

Oliver immediately stepped in front of Harrison, shielding her.

A familiar figure approached—Henry Lancaster’s butler.

He stopped before Harrison. "Ms. Harrison, I regret to inform you that you cannot leave Willowbrook."

Henry had sent men to stop her?

Harrison frowned. "What do you mean? I have every right to leave."

The butler remained composed. "After Ms. Isabella encountered you at the boutique, she fell gravely ill. She’s been unconscious since. The doctors suspect poisoning."

Harrison’s lips parted in shock. Poisoned?

A bitter laugh escaped her. "And Henry Lancaster thinks I did it?"

The butler didn’t flinch. "Mr. Lancaster requests your presence at the Whitmore estate to assist in her recovery. You may only depart once she is well."

Harrison had never imagined Henry and Isabella would go this far.

Was this some cruel twist of fate?

Oliver stepped forward, his smile icy. "Your employer is quite bold. What if Harrison refuses?"

The butler’s lips curved slightly. "Mr. Lancaster has ensured Ms. Harrison cannot board any flight. Unless, of course, she plans to grow wings and fly herself."
###Chapter 558

Oliver's fury was palpable. "Be careful!"

At that moment, Harrison grasped his arm and gave a subtle shake of her head. "It's alright. I'll just visit briefly."

Oliver lowered his voice, urgency lacing his words. "Isabella is absolutely setting a trap. If you go, you're walking straight into her hands."

Harrison's gaze flicked to the butler. "I trust Mr. Lancaster's integrity. He'll ensure my safety."

Oliver still resisted. "But—"

"I need to see what kind of poison Isabella has concocted this time," Harrison interrupted, her tone firm.

Meeting her steady, unwavering eyes, Oliver had no choice but to relent. "Just... be cautious."

Harrison nodded. "I will."

The butler gestured politely. "Ms. Harrison, right this way."

She followed him out without hesitation.

Rosalind and Gabrielle tried to step forward but were immediately blocked by the black-clad guards. Their voices rose in concern. "Harrison!"

She offered them a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. I'll be fine."

With that, she slipped into the sleek luxury car and vanished from sight.

Gabrielle wrung her hands. "What is Isabella planning now?"

Rosalind scowled. "She's been unbearable since reuniting with her father. Thinks she can do whatever she wants just because he's the richest man alive. How does someone like her get so lucky? How is she even his daughter?"

Frustration simmered between them.

Just then, a Rolls-Royce Shadow screeched to a halt nearby. Nathaniel had arrived.

He leaped out, urgency in every movement. "Where's Harrison? Did she leave already?"

Rosalind gave him a pointed look. "You're late."

"What?"

Nathaniel's gaze darted around, realization dawning—Harrison was gone. Again.

"Harrison—"

"She didn't leave. She was taken to the Whitmore estate by Mr. Lancaster."

Nathaniel stiffened. He turned to Rosalind, frustration boiling over. "Could you not drag it out next time?"

He had assumed she'd already departed.

"The Falcon and Lancaster families have a marriage alliance. Both Mr. Lancaster and Isabella are targeting Harrison. She could be in real danger at the Whitmore estate," Gabrielle explained quickly.

Nathaniel's fists clenched. "I'm going after her."

Without another word, he jumped back into his car and sped toward the Whitmore estate.

Harrison was led into the grand Whitmore estate, where Victoria stood abruptly, her anger barely contained. "What did you do to Isabella? What poison did you give her?"

Harrison met her gaze evenly. "How do you know I poisoned her?"

"Who else could it be?" Victoria snapped. "After she spoke with you at the boutique, she returned feeling ill. The doctor confirmed it was poison!"

Margaret jabbed an accusing finger at her. "How could you? You tried to kill Isabella? You're heartless!"

A faint, knowing smile curved Harrison's lips as her eyes swept over their faces.

"So, poisoning someone is heartless?" she mused coolly. "I wasn't sure you realized. When the two of you conspired to poison my father all those years ago, wasn't that evil? What right do you have to stand here and judge me?"

Margaret paled, fury twisting her features. "Harrison, how dare you speak to us like that!"

Victoria's eyes turned glacial. "You've crossed the line this time."

Without warning, her hand snapped up—aiming straight for Harrison's face.
###Chapter 559

Victoria's hand shot up, poised to strike Harrison across the face.

But the blow never landed. A strong, masculine hand intercepted her wrist mid-air, halting her momentum.

Victoria blinked in shock, finding Henry Lancaster standing protectively in front of Harrison, his grip unyielding.

Her expression darkened. She hadn’t anticipated Henry defending Harrison.

From what she knew, Henry and Harrison weren’t particularly close. With Isabella—Henry’s biological daughter—lying unconscious in bed, Victoria had assumed he would side with his own flesh and blood.

Why would he shield Harrison instead?

Frustration bubbled inside her. "Mr. Lancaster, Harrison poisoned Isabella, and she’s still unresponsive! She deserves to be punished!"

Margaret quickly added fuel to the fire. "That’s right! If we hadn’t discovered it in time, Isabella could have died. Harrison needs to pay for what she’s done!"

Harrison studied Henry’s broad back, his towering frame shielding her completely. His presence was commanding, exuding an unshakable strength that made her feel inexplicably safe.

For a fleeting moment, she thought of Benjamin—her late father. He had been just as imposing.

But he had been gone for years.

Lost in her thoughts, Harrison barely registered when Henry coldly released Victoria’s wrist, sending her stumbling back.

Both women looked bewildered.

"Aren’t you going to punish Harrison?"

Henry didn’t spare them a glance. Instead, he turned to Harrison, his voice low but firm. "Did you poison Isabella?"

Harrison stiffened.

She hadn’t expected him to ask her directly. She had braced for immediate accusations, just like the rest of the Whitmore family. But Henry—someone with no blood ties to her—had given her a chance to speak.

The irony wasn’t lost on her.

Meeting his gaze, Harrison shook her head. "No."

Henry remained silent, waiting.

Harrison continued, her voice steady. "Do you doubt my skills as a doctor? I’m Dr. Sinclair. If I wanted Isabella dead, she wouldn’t still be breathing."

Margaret faltered. "What—"

Harrison cut her off, her tone icy. "Isabella has made my life hell. If I wanted her gone, I wouldn’t have left her half-alive. I’d have made sure she never woke up. And I certainly wouldn’t have stayed here like a fool, waiting to be caught."

The truth was, poisoning Isabella would have been too simple. Death was too merciful for her.

Victoria had seen Harrison’s sharp tongue before, but this time, it left her momentarily speechless. "You’re just twisting the truth! Mr. Lancaster, don’t believe her lies!"

Margaret nodded frantically. "She’s manipulating you! Isabella is your daughter—you must stand up for her!"

Harrison watched Henry carefully, searching for any hint of his thoughts.

Henry’s gaze flickered to her briefly before settling on Victoria and Margaret. His voice was dangerously calm. "Isn’t Harrison your own flesh and blood? Why are you so cruel to her yet so invested in my daughter? Are you sure Isabella isn’t yours?"

The question struck like lightning.

Victoria and Margaret froze, their faces paling.

Henry’s piercing stare locked onto Victoria. "Harrison isn’t your biological daughter, is she?"

Victoria’s breath hitched. Panic flashed in her eyes. "Of course she is!"

But her voice wavered.

And Henry noticed.
###Chapter 560

The air crackled with tension as Henry Lancaster's voice sliced through the silence. "Is this how you treat your own flesh and blood?"

Victoria froze, her breath catching in her throat. "I—I..."

Her words faltered under the crushing weight of the world's most powerful man's presence. Every syllable risked exposing the truth she desperately wanted to hide.

Margaret stepped forward smoothly. "Isabella's father was adopted into our family. Over the years, Victoria has grown close to Isabella, treating her as her own."

Her explanation was delivered with practiced ease.

Henry didn't respond immediately. His piercing gaze shifted to Harrison. "For now, I'll take your word for it."

Harrison gave a slight nod. "Thank you."

"But you will cure Isabella."

Harrison arched an eyebrow. "You just said you believe me. If I didn't poison her, why should I be the one to cure her?"

"Mr. Lancaster is giving you a chance!" Victoria snapped, her nails digging into her palms. "Don't throw it away!"

"Mind your tone," Margaret added sharply. "No one speaks to Mr. Lancaster like that."

Harrison ignored them both, her cool gaze locked on Henry. "I have no obligation to help. Are you asking me for a favor?"

A spark of amusement flickered in Henry's eyes. This girl had nerve. No one dared challenge him—yet here she was, unflinching.

He inclined his head. "Yes. I'm asking. Please heal my daughter."

Victoria's face twisted with barely contained rage. How could Henry indulge this insolent girl? Was this the power of blood ties?

Harrison tilted her head, her voice like ice. "Is that how one properly requests a favor?"

Henry's lips quirked. "What would you have me do?"

Harrison considered. "I'll need a promise. When I decide what I want, you'll honor it."

Margaret and Victoria paled. A promise from Henry Lancaster? The implications were staggering.

Victoria interjected frantically, "Mr. Lancaster, you can't agree! What if her demand is outrageous?"

Margaret nodded vigorously. "Your word is law. Don't bind yourself to her whims."

Harrison shrugged. "No agreement, no cure. I'll be leaving then."

She turned toward the door.

Henry moved swiftly, blocking her path. "Very well. I agree."

The words sent shockwaves through the room.

Victoria and Margaret looked as if they might combust. "Mr. Lancaster!"

Harrison's lips curved into a triumphant smile, her eyes gleaming like a fox who'd outwitted the hunter. "Perfect."

Against all odds, Henry found himself mirroring her smile. There was something undeniably captivating about her cunning.

"Now, will you heal my daughter?"

Harrison nodded. "Lead the way."

Henry guided her to Isabella's bedside. The girl lay deathly still, her skin pallid, lips tinged blue—undeniable signs of poisoning.

Harrison examined her briefly. "She's been poisoned."

Victoria scoffed. "Obviously! The finest doctors couldn't help her. What makes you think you can?"

Henry's voice was grave. "Can you save her?"
###Chapter 561

Harrison nodded. "Yes, I can cure Isabella."

Henry's face brightened with relief. "That's wonderful!"

"However..." Harrison turned to face him. "I require a specific ingredient for the antidote."

"Name it. I'll have it procured immediately."

Harrison offered a faint smile. "I need the blood of Isabella's closest blood relative."

Blood from an immediate family member?

Victoria's expression shifted, her face paling.

Henry stepped forward without hesitation. "I'm her father. Take mine!"

"No!" Victoria suddenly shouted, panic lacing her voice. "You can't use Mr. Lancaster's blood!"

Harrison's sharp gaze locked onto Victoria. "Why not? Don't you want to save Isabella?"

The calculating glint in Harrison's eyes made Victoria realize she had overreacted. If Henry's blood was used, the truth about Isabella's parentage would be exposed.

She scrambled to redirect. "Mr. Lancaster, your health is too valuable to risk. Harrison, I question your medical judgment. Why insist on his blood? Are you trying to harm him—or Isabella?"

Harrison exhaled, her patience visibly thinning. "This is the only way. If you don't trust me, I'll leave."

Henry intervened, his voice firm. "I trust her. Use my blood."

"No, Mr. Lancaster! It can't be yours! Harrison, take mine instead!"

Harrison turned to Victoria, her tone edged with mockery. "Your blood is useless. Isabella isn't your daughter. I need her biological family's blood."

Victoria's eyes flickered, her lips pressing into a tight line. She had no rebuttal.

Henry remained resolute. "Proceed with mine."

Harrison nodded. "Very well, Mr. Lancaster. Roll up your sleeve. I'll prepare the syringe."

She stood, but a sudden wave of dizziness struck her. Her legs gave way, and she began to collapse.

"Harrison!"

Henry moved swiftly, catching her in his arms, his grip secure around her slender waist. His concerned gaze searched her face.

"Are you all right?"

Harrison, weakened from days of exhaustion, shook her head. "I'm fine."

Just then, a deep, commanding voice echoed from the doorway. "Harrison! Where are you?"

Nathaniel had arrived.

The butler rushed to intercept him. "Mr. Hawk, you can't enter—"

"What have you done to her? Move!" Nathaniel shoved past, his imposing frame storming into the room. "Harrison!"

He froze at the sight before him. Henry was holding Harrison in his arms, their proximity far too intimate for comfort.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened, his pulse spiking with a dangerous mix of fury and confusion. He had braced for hostility—given Isabella's connection to Henry, he feared Harrison might be in danger. But this? This was unexpected.

He strode forward, his long legs closing the distance in seconds. "What the hell is going on?"

His strong fingers wrapped around Harrison's wrist, attempting to pull her away.

But Henry's grip on her other arm held firm. Both men refused to let go, tension crackling between them.

Nathaniel's glare met Henry's, his voice low and dangerous. "Uncle Henry, release her."

Henry's lips curved in amusement. "And if I don't?"

Nathaniel's control snapped. "What are you playing at? Harrison is the same age as Isabella!"

Henry merely chuckled. "I'm aware. So?"
###Chapter 562

"So, don't you find it... disgraceful, the way you're clinging to Harrison like that?"

For the first time in his life, Henry Lancaster was called "disgraceful." He didn’t know how to react.

"Mr. Hawk, mind your tone," the butler interjected quietly. "Mr. Lancaster has always treated you with respect. You should extend the same courtesy to your elders."

Victoria stood frozen, her eyes wide with shock. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined witnessing the world’s richest man, Henry, and the rising business prodigy, Nathaniel, fighting over the same woman.

The two men were seconds away from throwing punches over Harrison.

Victoria finally understood. Nathaniel must have misunderstood—he thought Henry had feelings for Harrison. In reality, the age gap between Harrison and Isabella meant nothing. A man of Henry’s status and wealth could have women like Harrison and Isabella throwing themselves at him effortlessly.

But Henry was Harrison’s father.

Victoria felt like her entire world had flipped upside down.

Harrison, caught between them, felt even dizzier. Did these two ever stop to consider how she felt?

She struggled and snapped, "Let me go!"

Nathaniel glared at Henry. "Uncle Henry, did you hear that? Harrison wants you to let go."

Henry remained composed. "I believe she meant both of us."

Nathaniel scoffed. "What—"

Harrison cut in sharply, "I said, let go! Both of you!"

Reluctantly, Nathaniel shot Henry a look. "Fine. On three, we release her together."

Henry didn’t argue and nodded.

Nathaniel counted, "One... two... three..."

At the same moment, both men released Harrison.

She swayed, her legs buckling beneath her.

Nathaniel moved instantly, catching her in his arms. "Harrison, what’s wrong?"

"I’m dizzy," she murmured weakly.

Without hesitation, Nathaniel scooped her up. "I’m taking you somewhere to rest."

He carried her out of the room.

Henry, watching from behind, called out, "Harrison can’t leave."

The butler stepped forward. "Mr. Hawk, Ms. Harrison should rest in this room."

Nathaniel carried Harrison inside and gently laid her on the plush bed. "Let me get you some water."

He poured her a glass.

After a moment, Harrison sighed. "Thanks. I’m fine. It’s just the pregnancy dizziness."

Nathaniel studied her with concern. "What’s your relationship with Mr. Lancaster?"

Harrison blinked up at him in confusion. "What?"

"I saw him holding you earlier," Nathaniel said, his voice thick with jealousy.

Harrison was stunned. "What are you even thinking? I was dizzy, and he steadied me for a second!"

She genuinely didn’t understand why Nathaniel was jumping to conclusions.

But Nathaniel was tense. Harrison was constantly surrounded by men—one after another—and who knew what Henry’s true intentions were?

He couldn’t help voicing his suspicion. "He steadied you? Since when is Henry Lancaster the type to help anyone? He’s known for being cold and distant!"

Nathaniel knew Henry well. Even though Henry hadn’t interacted much with Harrison, Nathaniel sensed something different. The way Henry treated Harrison was... unusual.

Before Harrison could respond, a smooth voice came from the doorway.

"I’m standing right here. Were you badmouthing me?"

Henry had followed them into the room and now stood at the threshold.

Nathaniel shot him a dark look, his expression dripping with hostility. He stared at Henry like a rival.
###Chapter 563

Nathaniel was stunned into silence.

Harrison blinked in surprise. She had never realized her husband could be so possessive.

She turned to Nathaniel sharply. "You do remember Mr. Lancaster is your future father-in-law, don't you? You're not even married to his daughter yet, and you're already making enemies with him. Do you still want this wedding to happen?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "I don't."

Harrison smirked. "We'll see if you still feel that way later."

Before Nathaniel could retort, Harrison had already slipped out of bed. "Mr. Lancaster, I'll take your blood now."

Henry Lancaster stepped forward. "Of course."

The butler brought in the medical supplies. Henry rolled up his sleeve as Harrison prepared the syringe.

Nathaniel frowned. "Why are you taking his blood?"

"Isabella's been poisoned," Harrison explained, pressing the needle against Henry's skin. "We need a blood relative's sample to synthesize the antidote. Since Mr. Lancaster is her father, his is the only viable option."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "How did she get poisoned?"

Harrison sighed. "I wish I knew."

"I'll have my people look into it," Henry said calmly.

Outside the door, Victoria had been listening intently. When she saw Harrison drawing Henry's blood, panic surged through her.

This was bad.

If they used Henry's blood, the truth would come out. And if Isabella's real identity was exposed—everything would be ruined.

Just then, Theodore appeared. "What are you doing here?"

Victoria startled. "N-Nothing!"

Theodore narrowed his eyes. "I saw you lurking by the door."

He glanced inside. "Harrison is just collecting Mr. Lancaster's blood to help Isabella. What's so interesting about that?"

Victoria forced a smile. "I just don't trust her. What if she does something to hurt Isabella? I was keeping watch."

Theodore gave her a warning look. "Your concern is noted. Right now, saving Isabella is the priority. Don't interfere."

With that, he walked away.

Victoria watched Harrison through the crack in the door, her mind racing. She had to switch Henry's blood with hers—tonight.

She was Isabella's real mother. Only her blood could keep the secret buried.

Once Harrison finished, she began preparing the antidote.

She decided to stay at the Whitmore estate for now.

With both Henry and Nathaniel present, the Whitmores were at least civil to her.

As Harrison worked in the room, her phone buzzed. Rosalind was calling.

She stepped into the hallway. "Rosalind?"

"Harrison, how are things? Is anyone giving you trouble?"

Harrison leaned against the wall. "I'm fine. No one's bothering me."

"Good!"

"I need a favor," Harrison said suddenly.

"Name it."

"There's a red flower herb in my apartment. Can you bring it to me? I can't leave right now."

"Consider it done."

"Thanks."

Harrison hung up. She was about to return when a maid approached. "Ms. Whitmore, we've prepared chicken soup for you in the kitchen. Would you like some?"

Harrison shook her head. "No, thank you."

She moved to walk past, but the maid blocked her path.

Harrison raised an eyebrow. "Is there a problem?"

The maid's eyes darted nervously. "I—"
###Chapter 564

Nathaniel's voice came from behind. "Harrison."

She turned to face him.

"You haven't eaten all morning," he murmured, his fingers brushing her wrist. "The soup is still warm."

Harrison opened her mouth to protest, but Nathaniel's grip tightened. He guided her away before she could argue.

The maid exhaled sharply as they disappeared down the hall.

Then she froze.

Victoria stood before her, arms crossed.

"It's done," the maid whispered. "They're gone."

Victoria nodded. "Good. But if a single word of this gets out—"

"I understand!" The maid's hands trembled.

Satisfied, Victoria slipped into the room.

Her eyes locked onto the syringe resting on the counter—Henry Lancaster's blood, drawn by Harrison.

Perfect.

Victoria pulled a second syringe from her pocket. With practiced ease, she swapped the samples.

Isabella's secret was safe.

A smirk curled her lips as she turned to leave.

Then her blood ran cold.

Theodore stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

"Darling!" Her voice cracked. "What are you—"

"I could ask you the same." His gaze dropped to her hands. "This is Harrison's workspace. Why are you here?"

Victoria had accounted for everyone—except him.

Panic clawed at her throat. "I—I was checking on Harrison's progress! You know I don't trust her with Isabella's life!"

Theodore stepped closer, plucking the syringe from the counter. "Really? Because I've been watching you for weeks. And I just saw everything."

Victoria's breath hitched.

He held up the evidence. "This is your blood. You switched it with Henry Lancaster's." His voice turned lethal. "Why? Unless..." His eyes widened. "You're Isabella's immediate family. Her mother."

Victoria recoiled. "Theodore, please—"

"All these years," he whispered. "The way you treated Harrison like a stranger. How you doted on Isabella." His grip tightened. "You switched them, didn't you? Isabella is yours. Which means Harrison is Henry Lancaster's true heir."

The truth hung between them, sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 565

Victoria's perfect world shattered in an instant.

Theodore had uncovered everything! Her carefully crafted deception was exposed!

Panic surged through Victoria as she scrambled to salvage the situation.

She stepped forward, desperation twisting her features. "Darling, you've got it all wrong. Isabella is our biological daughter, and Harrison is Mr. Lancaster's child!"

Theodore's eyes darkened with a storm of emotions. His voice was raw as he pointed at her. "Do you know what my life's purpose has been? To protect the true heiress. That's why I never wanted children of my own. You know how sacred this duty is to me!"

"I know, my love. Please, don't be angry. Harrison is the one!" Victoria reached for his arm, her fingers trembling.

"Don't touch me!"

He shoved her away violently. Victoria staggered back, slamming into the wall. Theodore's voice cracked with fury. "I'm having a DNA test done immediately. I'll inform Mr. Lancaster and Harrison. Once Henry, Harrison, and Isabella are tested, the truth will be undeniable!"

Theodore was resolute. He would expose everything.

Terror froze Victoria's veins. She felt herself plunging into an abyss.

Everything had been going perfectly today. The blood swap was complete. Victory had been within her grasp.

Then Theodore arrived.

She never imagined he would be the one to unravel her lies first.

"Please, don't go!" Victoria collapsed to her knees, clutching at his legs. "Don't tell Mr. Lancaster! I'm begging you!"

Her voice broke. "You'll destroy Isabella! She's called you Father all these years. Have you no love for her at all?"

Theodore's fists clenched. "My loyalty has always been to the true heiress. If Isabella is a fraud, she deserves nothing from me! I'm telling Henry and Harrison now!"

He turned to leave.

His emotions raged. Protecting the heiress had been his life's mission—one he thought he had fulfilled.

For years, he had cherished Isabella, treating her like royalty.

Now, Harrison might be the real heiress. The revelation gutted him. What had he done all these years? How could he ever face Harrison's mother again?

He needed the truth. And he would get it.

Victoria shot to her feet, her voice sharp. "Theodore, stop! If you want the truth, I'll give it to you!"

He halted, turning slowly. "Then speak."

In that moment, Victoria shed all pretense. Years of jealousy and bitterness erupted. "Yes, Isabella is my daughter. Harrison is the real heiress. I switched them years ago!"

Theodore stared, stunned. "Why?"

"Revenge!" Victoria spat. "Revenge on you—and on that woman you loved! I poisoned Benjamin to be with you, yet you still pined for her. Every secretary, every mistress—they all reminded you of her! You made me waste my love on you, and it destroyed me!"

Her lips curled in triumph. "I knew Harrison was your obsession. So I swapped them. I made you adore my daughter like she was your life's purpose. Do you know how satisfying it was, watching you dote on her while remaining blind? No one humiliates me, Theodore. No one!"
###Chapter 566

Theodore lunged forward, his fingers closing around Victoria's throat like steel traps. "You vile creature!"

Victoria's breath caught instantly. The searing pain of suffocation turned her face crimson, yet she only laughed wildly. "I sent that precious girl you cherished to the countryside when she was just a child. She suffered through hell while you were oblivious. You failed! My daughter, Isabella, is the true heiress—not her!"

Disgust twisted Theodore's expression as fury consumed him. Right then, he wanted nothing more than to snap her neck. "You wretched witch, you've destroyed everything! I'll end you right here!"

His grip tightened. Darkness crept into Victoria's vision.

But she couldn't die.

Not yet.

With trembling hands, she fumbled blindly until her fingers closed around a heavy crystal ashtray. Summoning every ounce of strength, she swung it hard against Theodore's temple.

A sickening crack echoed.

Blood sprayed.

A crimson river streamed down Theodore's face as his grip slackened. His body crumpled to the floor like a puppet with severed strings.

Victoria clutched her throat, gasping. The terror of near-death left her shaking violently.

She stared down at Theodore, motionless in the spreading pool of blood. "Darling? Darling?"

But he was already unconscious.

"My love, I adored you once," she whispered hoarsely. "But you betrayed me. Now, Isabella is all I have left. I won't let anyone—not even you—stand in her way. You brought this upon yourself!"

Footsteps pounded outside. Nathaniel and Harrison had returned.

Victoria froze. They were here!

What now?

Outside, Nathaniel and Harrison ascended the stairs. Harrison had just been forced to drink a bowl of medicinal soup and was rushing back to finish the antidote.

"Mr. Lancaster, you don't need to stay," Harrison said.

Nathaniel's gaze was unwavering. "Harrison, I'm not leaving you alone. I won't rest unless I'm right beside you."

Just then, Henry Lancaster approached. "Ah, there you are."

Harrison turned. "Mr. Lancaster."

"How's the antidote progressing?" Henry asked.

"I'm still—"

A bloodcurdling scream cut her off. "Ah!"

Harrison jolted upright. "What was that?"

"Let's investigate," Henry said sharply.

The three of them burst into the room—only to find Theodore sprawled lifelessly on the floor.

Victoria knelt beside him, tears streaming. "Theodore! What happened? Wake up, please!"

Nathaniel stepped forward. "What's wrong with Mr. Whitmore?"

"I don't know!" Victoria sobbed. "I found him like this! He must have hit his head!"

Harrison moved to check his pulse, but Victoria blocked her. "No need! The doctor is coming!"

A white-coated physician rushed in. "Quick! Move Mr. Whitmore immediately! I'll handle resuscitation!"

Servants lifted Theodore's body as Victoria hurried after them.

Before leaving, she turned back to Harrison, her voice icy. "Finish that antidote for Isabella. My husband needs me now."
###Chapter 567

Victoria and the medical team hurried out with Theodore.

Harrison frowned. Why were Victoria and Theodore here? To monitor her while she prepared Isabella's antidote?

She knew Theodore had always treated Isabella like his most prized possession, so that explanation made sense.

Yet something about Victoria felt off. Harrison couldn't shake the suspicion that her mother was hiding something.

Henry turned to her. "Are you alright?"

Harrison opened her mouth to respond, but before she could speak, Nathaniel's tall frame blocked her view entirely.

He leveled a cool gaze at Henry. "She's fine."

Henry remained silent.

So did Harrison. She sank into a chair. "You two can leave. I need to focus on the antidote."

Nathaniel glanced at Henry. "Uncle Henry, Harrison asked you to go."

"She seems to be asking you as well," Henry countered.

Nathaniel nodded. "Fine. Let's go together."

"Agreed."

Henry strode out first, Nathaniel following and shutting the door firmly behind them.

Alone, Harrison exhaled and picked up the vial of blood she'd drawn from Henry earlier. She began mixing the antidote with practiced precision.

Meanwhile, Margaret had been asleep when the commotion startled her awake.

"What's happening?" she demanded of the maid.

The maid wrung her hands. "Madam, Mr. Theodore had an accident. He's unconscious at the hospital!"

Margaret froze. "What? Ready the car—I'm leaving now!"

Though she had two sons—Theodore and Frederick—Theodore was her favorite. The moment she heard of his condition, she rushed to the hospital.

Thirty minutes later, she burst into the hospital room to find Theodore motionless on the bed.

"Theodore! What happened? You were perfectly fine at dinner!"

Victoria stood beside the bed, her expression icy as she stared at Theodore's still form. Then, forcing tears, she choked out, "He hit his head. The doctors say the brain damage is severe... he might never wake up."

Margaret recoiled. "Never wake up? What are you saying?"

Victoria's voice trembled with feigned grief. "It means... he could remain in a vegetative state."

Margaret's knees buckled. Her beloved son—reduced to this?

"Don't distress yourself—" Victoria began.

Margaret's palm cracked across her face.

The slap snapped Victoria's head to the side, a red mark blooming on her cheek.

Margaret jabbed a finger at her, voice shaking with fury.

"Is this how you care for my son? How did he get injured?"

She leaned in, eyes blazing.

"Let me make one thing clear—with my son's status, he never should have married you! If Isabella hadn't favored you as a child and begged for you to be her mother, Theodore would never have chosen you, and I would never have allowed this farce of a marriage!"
###Chapter 568

"You've done well caring for Isabella all these years while restraining yourself. I've barely tolerated your presence, but now... After what happened to Theodore, I'm convinced this is entirely your fault!"

Margaret unleashed a torrent of harsh words, berating Victoria without mercy.

Victoria's face drained of color. So this was Margaret's true opinion—she'd always looked down on her!

Rage boiled in Victoria's veins. She despised Theodore, loathed Margaret, hated everyone who'd ever wronged her!

She'd once loved Theodore desperately, scheming her way into the Whitmore family in her obsession. Yet after decades, she'd never truly belonged. The bitter truth stung—they'd always seen her as beneath them.

Turning away, Victoria let tears fall as she choked out, "I failed to protect Theodore. This is all my fault. But rest assured, no matter his condition, I'll remain by his side."

Margaret scoffed. "That's the bare minimum! Isabella is the heiress of the Lancaster fortune. You're not even her birth mother. Without the Whitmores, you're nothing!"

With that final blow, Margaret stormed out.

As the door clicked shut, Victoria slowly rose. She wiped her tears with mechanical precision, her expression chillingly blank.

Her icy gaze fell upon Theodore's comatose form. It didn't matter now. With him vegetative, the power was hers to wield.

As for that meddling old woman... Victoria would handle Margaret soon enough.

The Whitmores remained blissfully unaware Isabella was her biological daughter. They'd never suspect how thoroughly she'd manipulated them all.

The entire family danced on her strings.

A satisfied smirk curled Victoria's lips as dark laughter bubbled up.

Outside the hospital room, Margaret's maid hesitated. "Madam, having seen Mr. Theodore, shall we return now?"

Margaret's cane struck the floor. "Have they secured a specialist? I refuse to accept my son will remain comatose!"

The maid lowered her voice. "Mrs. Victoria engaged a renowned neurologist, but the brain damage... The doctors say chances of recovery are slim."

"Nonsense!" Margaret's grip tightened on her cane. "Incompetent fools! They couldn't save my boy. There must be another way. I'll move heaven and earth to wake him!"

The maid hesitated. "Perhaps... we could approach Dr. Sinclair?"

Margaret froze. "Harrison?"

"Exactly. The miracle doctor. If anyone can help Mr. Theodore, it's her."

Hope flickered in Margaret's eyes. Of course—Harrison remained their best chance.

"But given our strained relations..."

"For Mr. Theodore's sake, wouldn't it be worth trying?"

Margaret squared her shoulders. She'd swallow her pride if it meant saving her son.

Yet unease prickled her instincts. Theodore's accident seemed... convenient. The timing too perfect.

She'd uncover the truth, no matter the cost.

"Prepare the car. We're leaving immediately to find Harrison."

"At once, madam."

Margaret's jaw set. Harrison represented Theodore's only hope.

But the pieces didn't fit. How had her robust son collapsed so abruptly? That head injury seemed... manufactured.

She'd peel back every layer until the truth shone clear.

"Have the driver ready. We depart for Harrison's clinic within the hour," Margaret commanded.

"Very good, madam."
###Chapter 569

Harrison sat at her desk, carefully measuring ingredients for the antidote. Her phone buzzed on the polished wood surface. She tapped the screen to read the message from Rosalind.

[Have you reached The Regal Residences yet?]

The reply came instantly. [Almost there. ETA five minutes.]

Harrison's fingers flew across the keyboard. [Change of plans. Don't worry about bringing the herbs tonight.] A pause. Then Rosalind's confused response: [But you said it was urgent yesterday?]

Leaning back in her chair, Harrison exhaled slowly. Yesterday's urgency had evaporated after the incident with Theodore. Now, time seemed irrelevant.

[Priorities shifted. Tomorrow is fine.]

[Understood.]

At that moment, Rosalind's car pulled into the underground garage of The Regal Residences. She'd rushed over immediately after Harrison's initial call, nearly speeding through three yellow lights.

Tucking her phone into her designer handbag, she stepped out of the car.

HONK!

A cherry-red Porsche 911 screeched past, its windows tinted black. The passenger window lowered to reveal two smirking faces - Julian Blackwood and Arabella.

Julian rested his arm casually on the steering wheel. "Fancy seeing you here, Rosalind."

Before she could answer, Arabella draped herself over Julian's shoulder, batting her eyelashes. "We've been driving along the coast all afternoon. Julian knows all the best spots."

Rosalind suppressed an eye roll. Was this pathetic display really necessary? Their breakup was ancient history, yet Arabella still acted like they were in some ridiculous love triangle.

A slow, knowing smile curved Rosalind's lips. "Julian, we haven't been together for years. Next time, do us both a favor and drive right past me."

Julian's grip tightened on the wheel. "You little—"

Turning to Arabella, Rosalind delivered the knockout punch. "And sweetheart? Nobody wants your leftovers. I'm happily taken now."

Without waiting for their reactions, she strode toward the elevators, her stilettos clicking decisively on the concrete.

Arabella's shriek echoed through the garage. "Did you hear how she talked to me?"

But Julian wasn't listening. His gaze followed Rosalind's retreating figure. This new version of her fascinated him - the birthmark gone, her confidence radiating like sunlight. When had his ex-fiancée become this magnetic?

"Who do you think she's dating?" Arabella sneered. "Probably that Everett Sinclair."

Julian's jaw clenched. The mere mention of Everett's name made his blood boil. That arrogant bastard with his perpetual smirk and designer suits.

"Shut up about Sinclair," he growled.

Arabella pouted, then slithered closer, tracing circles on his chest. "Forget about her. We have better things to do tonight." Her suggestive whisper carried promises. "Our usual suite at The Celestial?"

Julian's body responded automatically. Their chemistry was undeniable - two beautiful people who fit together perfectly between silk sheets. He knew exactly how to make Arabella scream his name.

But as he started the engine, his eyes flicked once more to where Rosalind had disappeared.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, a traitorous thought whispered: She's happier without you.
###Chapter 570

Rosalind's gaze lingered on Julian Blackwood's chiseled features, a smug satisfaction curling her lips. The Blackwood dynasty was among the most affluent in the city - Julian possessed not just breathtaking looks but staggering wealth and legendary bedroom skills. Just remembering their last encounter made her knees tremble.

Julian remained silent.

With a bold move, Arabella unbuckled her seatbelt and swung herself onto Julian's lap in one fluid motion. Her fingers traced his jawline as she purred, "Cat got your tongue? Or would you rather skip the talking and take me right here in this car?"

She captured his lips in a searing kiss.

A week had passed since Julian last touched Arabella. At twenty-eight, his body responded instantly to her practiced advances. His arms encircled her waist, pulling her flush against him as the kiss deepened. Arabella's manicured nails scraped down his chest...

Julian's hand suddenly clamped around her wrist, halting her progress.

Arabella froze mid-motion. "What's wrong?"

His handsome face twisted in visible frustration. "Not tonight."

Her confident expression faltered. His body clearly wanted her, yet he was rejecting her advances.

Rosalind's name flashed through her mind. Whenever that woman appeared, Julian became distant. Arabella let her dress strap slip off one shoulder, revealing creamy skin. "Look at me, Julian. I know you want this..."

But Julian remained unmoved. Their initial flirtation had thrilled him - the stolen glances, the electric tension. But since making their relationship official, the spark had faded inexplicably. He couldn't pinpoint when Arabella had stopped exciting him, only that something vital was missing.

Now, all he could think about was Rosalind. Even with Arabella grinding against him, Rosalind's face haunted him. Julian adjusted Arabella's strap with deliberate indifference. "Enough. I said not tonight."

Recognizing genuine disinterest, Arabella reluctantly slid off his lap.

Julian exited the car abruptly, needing air. He leaned against the hood, lighting a cigarette with unsteady hands.

His phone vibrated.

"Update on Everett Sinclair?" Julian demanded.

"He's been running with the Iron Serpents. Dangerous crowd."

Everett had joined a gang? Julian barked a humorless laugh. As if Rosalind would ever lower herself to associate with such trash.

At that moment, Rosalind emerged from the building, clutching a small satchel of medicinal herbs. She was heading home.

Spotting her, Julian stubbed out his cigarette and intercepted her path. "Rosalind."

She regarded him with glacial detachment. "What do you want now? Still lurking around like some pathetic stalker?" Her tone could freeze molten lava.

Julian's chest constricted painfully. He missed the Rosalind who used to light up at his presence. "Since when do you talk to me like this?"

"I'd prefer not talking at all," she said flatly. "Move. I'm going home."

She attempted to brush past him.

Julian caught her wrist, his grip firm but not painful. "Wait."

Rosalind tried to shake free. "Let go! Don't touch me!"

With a sardonic smirk, Julian countered, "Since when am I forbidden from touching you?"

Rosalind's gaze landed on the fresh love bite marring Julian's neck - Arabella's mark. Disgust twisted her features. "You're revolting."
###Chapter 571

Julian couldn't believe what Rosalind had just said. His grip on her wrist tightened, fury burning in his eyes. "Rosalind!"

She let out a mocking laugh. "What's wrong, Julian? Did I strike a nerve? It's perfectly normal for you to be all over Arabella—after all, she's your girlfriend now. But since you keep bothering me, I have every right to call you out!"

They were supposed to be over. Done. Yet here he was, standing in front of her, his fingers digging into her skin, the faint mark on his neck from Arabella's earlier affection still visible. The contact made her skin crawl.

She yanked her arm back. "Let go of me."

His jaw clenched. "No."

Just then, Arabella stepped out of the sleek sports car, her eyes narrowing at Rosalind like a viper ready to strike. "What do you think you're doing? Julian is mine now. Are you really this shameless?"

Rosalind scoffed. "Maybe you should get your eyes checked. Look again—who's holding onto whom?"

She lifted her hand, forcing Arabella to see the truth—Julian was the one refusing to let go.

Arabella's face darkened. A moment ago, Julian had been distant in the car, but now he was tangled up with Rosalind.

Rosalind shot Julian a cold glance. "Your girlfriend is right here. Let me go before she gets the wrong idea."

Julian didn’t even spare Arabella a look. His gaze remained locked on Rosalind’s defiant expression. "Are you still with Everett?"

"Yes," Rosalind answered without hesitation. "Everett is my boyfriend now."

Boyfriend.

The word hit Julian like a slap. He sneered. "Do you even know who he really is? What could you possibly see in him?"

Rosalind's bright eyes turned icy. "Stop looking down on people. There's nothing wrong with Everett. He's extraordinary, and I love him."

Julian's temper flared. "Extraordinary? Do you have any idea what Everett is doing right now?"

She arched a brow. "What are you implying? Last time you dragged me to that construction site, all it proved was how hardworking he is. He earns his living honestly—no stealing, no cheating. That’s what makes him admirable."

Julian fell silent.

Arabella seized the moment to loop her arm through his. "I think Rosalind is serious about Everett. You two are over, Julian. Just let her go!"

With a sharp jerk, Julian threw her off. "Get lost!"

Arabella stumbled back, her heel catching on the pavement. She crashed to the ground with a shriek. "Julian! You hurt me!"

He didn’t even glance at her. His furious gaze remained fixed on Rosalind. "Everett doesn’t steal or cheat? You’ve romanticized him. He’s not the saint you think he is!"

"Let go of me! And don’t you dare talk about Everett like that!" Rosalind wrenched her arm free.

She had no intention of continuing this conversation and turned to leave.

But Julian moved faster, grabbing her again. "You're coming with me!"

He dragged her toward his car.

Rosalind struggled. "What do you want from me? How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone?"

"Shut up!" Julian snapped, wrenching open the passenger door and shoving her inside.
###Chapter 572
Rosalind desperately wanted to escape the car.

Julian's palm slammed against the roof with finality. "I'm taking you to Everett. Don't you want to see your precious boyfriend?"

Rosalind's breath hitched.

Julian yanked the passenger door shut and slid into the driver's seat. The Porsche's engine growled like a caged beast as he floored the accelerator, leaving Arabella sprawled on the pavement like discarded trash.

"Julian! Where the hell are you going?" Arabella shrieked, her manicured nails digging into the concrete. "I'm your fiancée, damn it!"

Thirty minutes later, the sleek sports car screeched to a halt outside The Diamond Crown casino. Rosalind stepped onto the curb, her stomach churning. "Why are we here?"

Julian's lips curled into a predatory smile. "Recognize this place?"

"Of course I do." Rosalind crossed her arms. "It's a den of vice. I have no business here."

Amused, Julian leaned closer. "Oh, but your knight in shining armor does."

Rosalind's heart stuttered. "That's impossible! Everett would never—"

"Face it, Rosalind," Julian interrupted, his voice dripping with mock pity. "You don't know the real Everett Sinclair." He seized her wrist. "Let me show you who he truly is."

The casino's interior assaulted her senses—thick cigar smoke, the clatter of chips, and the frenzied laughter of men whose eyes gleamed with greed.

Rosalind recoiled. "This is a mistake. I'm leaving."

Julian jerked her forward. "Look."

Her gaze followed his pointed finger.

There stood Everett, clad in head-to-toe black, emerging from a private room. A cigarette dangled carelessly from his fingers as he took a long drag. The dim light carved shadows across his sharp jawline, his cropped hair making him look dangerously untamed.

"Boss, this deadbeat still hasn't paid up," one thug announced, shoving a trembling man to his knees before Everett.

"Please," the man sobbed, pressing his forehead to the floor. "My wife's dying in the hospital. I gambled my children's tuition—I have nothing left!"

Everett exhaled a slow stream of smoke before crouching to the man's level. He blew the acrid cloud directly into his face.

"Sell your house."

The man turned ashen. "I can't! It's my parents' legacy—"

Everett stood abruptly. A blade flashed.

The scream that followed sent ice through Rosalind's veins. Blood arced through the air, splattering across Everett's cheek. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, utterly unfazed.

This wasn't the gentle man who'd brought her roses. This was a predator.

And Rosalind realized with dawning horror—she'd never known him at all.
###Chapter 573
Rosalind stood rooted to the spot, her breath catching in her throat. The man before her bore no resemblance to the Everett she thought she knew.

Julian chuckled darkly. "See now, Rosalind? This is the real Everett Sinclair. Gambling dens, shady company—he's from a world you can't even imagine. He's beneath you."

Her hands clenched into fists as she turned to Julian, realization dawning. This had been his plan all along. He'd known Everett would be here.

"Whatever Everett is or isn't, that's not for you to decide," she spat. "You have no right to judge him!"

Julian arched a brow. "Still defending him? What spell has he cast on you?"

"That's none of your concern. I'm leaving." She spun on her heel, but Julian blocked her path.

"He's right there. Won't you at least greet him?"

"I said move!"

Rosalind didn't understand why Everett was here, but the tension in his posture told her everything. He didn't want her seeing him like this.

Julian's grip tightened around her wrist. "Oh no, darling. You're not running away."

"Let go of me!" She twisted violently, but his hold was ironclad.

Then she felt it—a gaze like winter steel slicing through her.

Everett stood across the room, his expression glacial. Their eyes locked, and Rosalind's pulse stuttered.

Julian smirked, yanking her against his chest. "Long time no see."

Rosalind shoved him away, her palm itching to strike that smug face.

Everett approached, flanked by men in black suits. They recognized Julian immediately. "Blackwood! Didn't expect you tonight." Their attention shifted to Rosalind. "And who's this lovely lady?"

"Not his—"

"My girlfriend," Julian interrupted.

Their overlapping declarations drew knowing grins. "Ah, so the infamous Julian Blackwood finally brings a date. Does she play?"

Rosalind's glare could have melted steel. This made no sense—Julian had betrayed her for Arabella. What game was he playing now?

Her eyes darted to Everett. "Everett, I—"

The men blinked. "You know Blackwood's girl?"

Before she could deny it again, Everett's voice cut through like a blade. "We've never met."

Rosalind recoiled as if struck. The icy dismissal hurt more than any physical blow.

Everett's gaze flickered over her once before he turned away. "I have business elsewhere."

Just like that, he was gone.

She stood frozen, the air punched from her lungs.

One of the men chuckled. "Don't take it personally. Sinclair's always been... detached."

"Noticed," Julian drawled.

"That man speaks less than a statue but gets shit done. The boss trusts him completely. Rumor is, this whole operation will be his soon."
###Chapter 574

Julian chuckled darkly. "Seems like he's in deep. Once you're in this world, there's no way out."

The suited men smirked. "Working for our boss is a golden opportunity. Everett wouldn't dream of leaving, trust us."

Julian had heard enough. He waved them off dismissively. "You're dismissed. We'll look around ourselves."

"Of course. Just call if you need anything."

"Mm."

As the men retreated, Julian turned to Rosalind. "Do you even know who runs this casino? Rumor has it he's a drug kingpin. And Everett's tangled up with him."

Rosalind's breath hitched. A drug lord?

Did Everett know?

She knew how brilliant he was—he had endless legitimate opportunities. Why choose this path?

Julian's lips curled. "See now? He's already in too deep. His world isn't yours. Cut him loose before it's too late."

Rosalind's fists clenched. "Stop wasting your time on me and go find Arabella. Whatever's between Everett and me is none of your concern!"

"Ungrateful. I'm trying to save you."

"Save me?" She laughed sharply. "I remember how you despised me, how you cheated with Arabella. Now you've done a complete turnaround. Why?"

Julian stiffened, caught off guard.

Rosalind's piercing gaze narrowed. "Have you developed feelings for me?"

What?

The accusation struck like lightning. He scoffed. "Delusional. I'd never fall for you."

"Good. Because if you did, I'd lose all respect for you."

Without another word, she spun on her heel and strode toward Everett.

"Rosalind!"

Julian stood frozen, fists clenched, watching her walk away.

Rosalind searched desperately, but the casino was a labyrinth. After several wrong turns, she nearly lost her way.

She had to find Everett. There were too many questions, too much left unsaid.

Rounding a dimly lit corridor, she spotted him ahead. Her pulse quickened as she moved forward.

Then—a flash of movement.

A girl in a sleek black ensemble—tank top hugging her curves, shorts showcasing toned legs—bounded up to Everett with a radiant smile. "Everett!"

Rosalind froze.

Since when did he know her?

The girl beamed. "Let's leave early today. I want to have some fun."

Everett's face was shadowed, expression unreadable. "I have work."

She giggled. "Daddy already approved it. Your only task now is to entertain me."

Rosalind's blood ran cold.

The girl was Genevieve Blackwood—the boss's daughter.

Everett shook his head. "Go enjoy yourself. I'm busy."

He turned to leave.

Genevieve grabbed his arm, pressing close. "Just a little while, please..."

Everett stilled—his eyes locking onto Rosalind's from across the hall.
###Chapter 575

Rosalind froze in place, her gaze locked with Everett's.

Everett went rigid, every muscle in his body tensing.

Genevieve, noticing Everett's stare, followed his line of sight. "Who is that?" she asked.

Everett remained silent.

Without a word, Rosalind turned on her heel and walked away. The air felt thick, suffocating—she didn't belong here.

In her haste, she collided with a middle-aged man.

Rosalind immediately apologized. "I'm so sorry!"

The man scowled. "Sorry doesn't fix anything. Damn it, I've already lost a fortune today, and now this—just my luck..."

When his eyes landed on Rosalind's face, he stopped mid-sentence. Her delicate, youthful features caught him off guard.

He looked her up and down, his expression shifting. "Didn't expect someone like you to be here."

Rosalind, fresh out of university, wore a cream-colored sweater with a pleated skirt, layered under a white puffer jacket. Her dark hair was pulled into a high ponytail, giving her an innocent, almost ethereal aura that starkly contrasted with the casino's gilded decadence.

The man's leer made her skin crawl. She frowned. "I said I was sorry."

She tried to sidestep him.

He blocked her path. "Leaving so soon? Why not stay and have some fun with me?"

Rosalind's voice turned icy. "Move. I'm going home."

The man chuckled. "Home? I can give you a better one."

Disgusted, Rosalind turned to leave again.

But the man grabbed her wrist, yanking her back. "Don't be like that. Stay."

"Let go!" She jerked her arm, but his grip tightened. "If you don't, I'll scream."

"Go ahead," he sneered. "No one here cares."

He tried to pull her closer—

A hand shot out, seizing the man's wrist and wrenching it away from her.

"Who the hell—?"

The man's curse died in his throat when he saw Everett.

His face paled. "E-Everett."

Everett's sharp features were carved from ice, his presence radiating danger. "What do you think you're doing?"

The man forced a laugh. "Just having a little fun with the girl."

Everett's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "She said no."

The man swallowed hard. "L-Let me go, alright? I won't bother her again."

With a brutal twist, Everett snapped the man's wrist.

A scream tore through the air.

Everett shoved him backward, sending him crashing into the wall.

"You bastard!" The man clutched his wrist, face contorted in pain. "You think you're untouchable just because the boss favors you? Because his daughter wants you? You're nothing but a glorified attack dog. One day, you'll end up dead in a ditch."

Rosalind's fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Everett didn't react. "Maybe. But you won't live to see it." He snapped his fingers.

Two men in black suits materialized. "Sir?"

Everett's command was glacial. "Get him out of my sight."
###Chapter 576
"Understood, sir."

The two security personnel swiftly escorted the middle-aged man out of sight.

Rosalind shot Everett a sideways glance before pivoting on her heel to leave.

Everett matched her stride effortlessly, his long legs keeping pace despite her hurried steps.

Rosalind increased her speed, weaving through the casino crowd in an attempt to shake him off. But Everett remained glued to her trail like a shadow.

"Stop tailing me!" she hissed through clenched teeth.

Bursting through the casino doors into the crisp night air, Rosalind's haste proved her undoing. Her ankle twisted sharply beneath her, sending her sprawling onto the pavement.

She cursed under her breath. Could this night get any worse?

As she sat rubbing her throbbing ankle, a deep velvety voice floated down. "You alright?"

Looking up, she found Everett looming over her. The height difference was ridiculous - her seated position forcing her to crane her neck while he stood there like some unshakable monolith.

His hand extended toward her. "Take it."

An offer of assistance.

Rosalind stubbornly tried to rise on her own.

Her ankle protested violently.

Before she could attempt again, Everett's fingers closed around her slender wrist. With shocking ease, he lifted her upright as if she weighed nothing.

Rosalind gaped at him. Her anger momentarily forgotten, replaced by stunned realization of his concealed strength.

Everett scanned the street. "This isn't your scene. Let me call you a cab."

He stepped to the curb, raising an arm. A yellow taxi immediately pulled over. Opening the rear door, he gestured. "Get in."

Rosalind remained rooted. "That's it? Nothing else to say?"

Everett's shoulders lifted in a half-shrug. "Like what?"

"Like what?" Rosalind echoed incredulously. "Seriously?"

Everett's lips parted slightly. "I've got nothing to say. I'm working. Don't come looking for me again. Just go home."

He turned to leave.

A small hand darted out, clutching his sleeve.

Everett froze. For several heartbeats, he remained statue-still, clearly willing himself to walk away.

But that stubborn grip held firm.

He exhaled sharply. "Let go."

Rosalind shook her head. "Not until you talk to me."

Everett turned slowly. "What's there to discuss?"

Rosalind's eyes burned with intensity. "Why here? Of all places? With your brains, you could've gone legit. Why choose this life?"

Her gaze held equal parts confusion and betrayal. She needed to understand.

Everett met her stare silently.

Rosalind pressed on. "I hate this place. Come with me instead. You want income? I'll hire you as my tutor. I'm terrible at studies anyway."

Everett gently detached her fingers. "Appreciate the offer. But no."

He turned again.

This time, Rosalind launched herself at his back, arms locking around his torso in a desperate embrace.

Everett went rigid, every muscle tensing at the unexpected contact. Rosalind pressed her cheek against his shoulder blades, voice thick with determination.

"My father gave his blessing. Said if we stay together, you could take over our family business. I know you'd hate that, so here's my counteroffer - I'll fund your own venture. E-commerce is exploding right now. With your mind, you'd dominate. This is where you belong."


###Chapter 577

Everett remained silent for a long moment before gently removing Rosalind's hand from his arm. His piercing gaze locked onto hers, icy and unreadable. "Is this some kind of pity charity?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. "No! That's not—I would never. I just know what you're capable of. I believe in you—"

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Oh, you believe in me?" His lips twisted into a mocking smile. "Listen to yourself. These are your dreams, Rosalind. Not mine. You're trying to mold me into your perfect little project."

Her eyes widened in shock. "That's not true—"

"Save it," he snapped, cutting her off. "You want to control every part of my life. But I get it. You're a rich girl slumming it with someone beneath you. You’ve never seen me as your equal."

Tears welled in Rosalind's pale eyes, her hands trembling at her sides. "How can you say that? After everything? Is that really what you think of me?"

All she had ever wanted was to see him thrive. He was meant for more than this—more than struggling in the shadows. But he refused to listen.

Was she really so selfish in his eyes?

Everett watched as the first tear slipped down her cheek, glistening in the dim light. She looked so fragile, so heartbreakingly beautiful. His fingers curled into fists at his sides.

"You should go. We don’t belong in the same world. You have Julian now, don’t you? I heard he’s turned his life around. Or if not him, there are a dozen better men waiting for you."

Rosalind’s shoulders shook as the dam broke, tears streaming freely. "Why do you keep pushing me away? If something’s wrong, we can fix it—together."

"Together?" He scoffed. "Who said we were ever together?"

She froze. "What… what about everything that happened between us?"

Everett shrugged, his gaze raking over her with deliberate cruelty. "It was just fun. Nothing more."

Her breath caught. "Fun?"

"Yeah. What did you expect? You came to me first. A pretty, privileged girl throwing herself at me—why would I say no?"

Rosalind staggered back as if struck. "Is that all I was to you?"

His smirk deepened. "What else would you be?"

The tears came faster now, unstoppable.

So that was the truth. To him, she was just… entertainment.

Everett stepped closer, towering over her. He reached out, brushing a tear away with his thumb, his touch deceptively gentle. "Why are you really here, Rosalind? Did you miss me?"

She slapped his hand away, her voice breaking. "I hate you!"

He stiffened, his expression unreadable.

Just then, Julian stormed forward. "Are you hurting her?"

Without warning, Julian grabbed Everett by the collar and slammed a fist into his face.

Everett didn’t even flinch as blood trickled from his lip. His grin was wild, dangerous.

Rosalind gasped, rushing forward. "Stop it!"

Julian shoved Everett back, his voice thick with fury. "She loves you, you bastard! And you treat her like this? You’re nothing but a worthless gutter rat dragging her down!"
###Chapter 578

"Enough, Julian!" Rosalind snapped.

Julian ignored her warning and lunged at Everett again, swinging another punch.

This time, he missed. Everett caught his fist mid-air and shoved him back with brutal force. Julian staggered, losing his footing before crashing onto the pavement.

Rosalind immediately stepped between them, her voice sharp. "Stop this!"

Everett's gaze was icy. "That was payback."

If Everett hadn’t allowed it, Julian wouldn’t have even gotten close. The realization made Rosalind freeze.

"Take him and leave," Everett said dismissively. "I don’t want to see either of you again."

Without another word, he turned to walk away.

"Everett!" Rosalind called after him.

He paused—just for a second—before continuing.

At that moment, Genevieve hurried over, slipping her arm through Everett’s. "What are you doing out here?"

She glanced at Rosalind and Julian, her brow arched. "Do you know them?"

Everett’s lips curved into a cold smirk. "No."

Genevieve beamed. "Good. Let’s go inside. Father was asking for you earlier."

Everett nodded. "Fine."

He walked away with her, leaving Rosalind standing there, stunned.

He was leaving with another woman.

Rosalind’s vision blurred as she watched Everett disappear, her chest aching.

Julian slowly pushed himself up, shaking his head. "See? That’s the man you love. He’s breaking your heart. He’s not worth it."

Rosalind turned to him, her voice quiet but firm. "If he’s not a good person, does that make you one?"

Julian hesitated. "I—"

She didn’t wait for an answer. She turned and walked away.

Julian grabbed her wrist. "It’s late. I’m not letting you wander alone. Get in the car. I’ll take you home."

"I don’t need your help," Rosalind said, trying to pull free.

But Julian didn’t listen. He forced her into his sports car and sped off.

Meanwhile, Everett had turned back. His expression was unreadable as he watched the car vanish into the night.

He had said those things deliberately. From the moment he stepped into that world, he knew there was no future for him and Rosalind.

She was like a rare gem—untouched, pure.

But he wasn’t.

There was no point in starting something doomed to end. He had to push her away.

Genevieve studied him curiously. "You love her, don’t you?"

Everett’s gaze remained distant. "No."

"You’re lying," she pressed. "I can see it in your eyes. You care about her."

Everett moved to leave, but she stopped him.

"Wait," she said. "Since you’re done with her, why not give me a chance? I like you."

Everett barely glanced at her. "Don’t waste your time. I’ll never feel the same."

With that, he walked away.

"Everett!"

Genevieve clenched her fists in frustration. She had fallen for him the moment they met, and she wasn’t giving up.

Back home, Rosalind buried herself under the covers, crying until exhaustion took over.

The memory of Everett’s words carved into her heart.

By morning, she was burning with fever.
###Chapter 579

Alistair extended a packet of fever medication toward Rosalind. "You need to take these."

Rosalind lay weakly against the pillows, her voice barely above a whisper. "I don't want them."

Alistair arched a brow. "What's the matter? Did Everett turn you down?"

Rosalind shot him a sharp glare. Of course he would bring that up now, when she was already drowning in misery.

A chuckle escaped him. "What did I tell you? You'll never win Everett over. Let it go. Move on."

Silence stretched between them as Rosalind fixed her gaze on the ceiling.

Alistair sighed. "There are plenty of other men out there. I know several promising young gentlemen. I could arrange introductions. They say the fastest way to heal a broken heart is to find someone new, isn't that right?"

Rosalind only pulled the blankets tighter around herself, refusing to answer.

Alistair set the medicine on the nightstand. "Take the pills. I'll leave you to rest."

With that, he strode out.

Rosalind sat up just long enough to swallow the medication before collapsing back onto the bed, shutting her eyes tightly.

Maybe she should listen to Alistair. Maybe she really needed to forget Everett.

After all, he had never truly cared for her. The cruel words he'd thrown at her still stung, and now there was another woman in his life.

But every time she closed her eyes, Everett's striking features burned behind her eyelids, refusing to fade.

She wanted to forget him—desperately—but her heart wouldn't cooperate.

With a shaky exhale, Rosalind grabbed her phone and opened WhatsApp.

Her fingers hovered before she typed: [I have a fever.]

Meanwhile, Everett stood across from Reginald Blackwood—Genevieve's father—a man whose influence stretched deep into the underworld. Reginald was heavyset, but his sharp eyes betrayed a cunning mind.

Everett handed over the week's financial reports. Reginald skimmed through them, satisfaction curling his lips. "I knew I made the right choice trusting you. What you've accomplished in a week would take my men half a year. You've got vision and nerve."

Genevieve, clinging to her father's arm, chimed in. "Dad, Everett has been working nonstop. Why don't you reward him with a day off?"

Reginald smirked at his daughter. "Hoping he'll spend it with you, are you?"

"Dad!" Genevieve flushed, stealing a glance at Everett.

Everett remained impassive, his expression unreadable.

Reginald stepped closer, clapping a hand on Everett's shoulder. "Everett, my daughter's feelings are obvious, and I hold you in high regard. I have no son, but if you marry her, we'll be family. Everything I have will be yours."

Everett flicked a glance at Genevieve before responding. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm not worthy of your daughter."

Genevieve stomped her foot. "Everett, are you rejecting me? Dad, I don't care—I love him!"

Reginald squeezed Everett's shoulder. "She's set on you, and I know you'll come to care for her too. Marry her, and you'll inherit everything. Let me tell you something—I have connections with powerful figures. I can introduce you."

Everett already knew who those "powerful figures" were. The mastermind behind it all was the infamous drug lord known as Shadow.

The only reason Everett was here was to use Reginald as a stepping stone to reach Shadow—the man who had murdered his father.

Now, Reginald was offering that introduction... but only if Everett agreed to marry Genevieve.

He had no interest in Genevieve, but it seemed he had no choice.

Reginald studied him expectantly. "Think it over. Let me know if you're willing to marry my daughter."


###Chapter 580

Genevieve moved closer to Everett. "I-"

But Reginald intercepted her. His grip tightened around his daughter's wrist. "We're leaving."

With no other option, Genevieve followed her father out of the casino.

Everett remained motionless for several heartbeats before finally exiting onto the neon-lit streets.

Buzz.

His phone vibrated. Rosalind's message flashed on the screen.

[I have a fever.]

Everett kept one hand in his pocket, ignoring the notification.

Another buzz followed immediately.

[My head is pounding. Please come see me?]

[I know you didn't mean those words. There must be a reason you said them.]

[If you come now, all is forgiven. We can still have our happy ending.]

The notifications kept coming, each buzz vibrating through his palm.

He could vividly imagine Rosalind's expression - that adorable pout, the slight crease between her brows, the way her lips would tremble when upset.

Everett kept walking, phone clutched tightly. Every logical thought screamed at him to stay away.

He was nothing. A nobody. Yet fate had given him the one girl he'd give his life to protect. The irony burned.

Just as he turned toward home, another notification chimed.

[I miss you.]

Three simple words that shattered his resolve.

Everett froze mid-step. His breath hitched. Then suddenly, he was running - sprinting toward the very life he'd sworn to abandon.

Thirty minutes later, Everett stood before the wrought iron gates of the Whitmore estate. Golden light spilled from the windows, warm and inviting.

His hands flexed at his sides, clenching and unclenching. The internal war raged on.

Finally, he stepped forward.

Inside the mansion, Rosalind lay curled on her bed, phone clutched to her chest. Still no reply.

Her bottom lip protruded in a sulk.

Was she being too demanding? Everett had his own struggles. Maybe she should-

Knock. Knock.

"Who is it?" she called hoarsely.

"Beatrice, miss. You have a visitor waiting outside."

Rosalind's heart leapt. Everett!

The feverish lethargy vanished as she threw off the covers. "Where? Where is he?"

Beatrice tried to stop her. "Miss, please slow down! You'll-"

But Rosalind was already flying down the grand staircase, bare feet slapping against marble.

He came! She knew he couldn't resist her!

With trembling hands, she yanked open the massive oak door.

"Everett!" The name burst from her lips in joyous relief.

Then her smile died.

Standing on the doorstep wasn't Everett at all.

It was Julian.

Julian Blackwood had come calling.
###Chapter 581

Rosalind's fleeting joy evaporated instantly, replaced by crushing disappointment. Standing at her doorway wasn't Everett Sinclair as she'd hoped - but Julian Blackwood, her ex-fiancé.

Beatrice rushed forward, draping a cashmere wrap over Rosalind's shoulders. "You'll catch your death in this draft, miss."

Rosalind shot her maid a questioning look. "This is my visitor?"

Beatrice nodded. "Mr. Blackwood arrived moments ago. I was just coming to announce him when you flew downstairs."

"Has no one else come?" Rosalind pressed, fingers tightening on the doorframe.

Beatrice shook her head. "No other callers, Miss Fairchild. Were you expecting someone?"

Everett hadn't come after all.

Julian's lips curled into that infuriating smirk she knew too well. "Waiting for Sinclair, were you?" Rosalind's mouth flattened into a hard line. "Yes. What are you doing here?"

His expression darkened. "Heard you were burning up with fever. Came to check on you."

"Still breathing, as you can see. Your concern is touching," Rosalind snapped, moving to slam the door.

Julian wedged his polished Oxford in the doorway. "Charming as ever, I see. Rush over here out of concern and this is the welcome I get?"

Rosalind met his gaze squarely. "Remove 'seem' from that sentence. I don't want to see you."

His temper flared visibly. "You ungrateful little-"

"Arabella's your girlfriend now. Need I remind you again? A decent ex would know to stay out of my life. Stop harassing me."

Julian closed the distance between them in three long strides, his piercing gaze sweeping over her. The delicate pink silk nightdress clung to her curves, raven hair tumbling over slender shoulders. Even fever-flushed and makeup-free, she outshone Arabella's cosmetic-enhanced beauty - that artificial perfection Julian had once found so alluring.

The contrast between Rosalind's natural radiance and Arabella's manufactured glamor had become painfully obvious.

When Julian stepped closer, Rosalind instinctively retreated. "What are you doing? Personal space, Julian."

His intense stare pinned her in place. "We need to talk."

"About?"

His jaw worked. "Arabella and I... we're through."

What?

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. They'd barely been together two months before splitting?

Julian had indeed ended things, though Arabella refused to accept the breakup. The moment he'd heard of Rosalind's illness, he'd come running.

Rosalind blinked slowly. "Congratulations? Why is this my concern? Don't report your relationship status to me like I'm your social secretary."

Julian's fists clenched at his sides. "Still playing games, Rosalind? This hard-to-get act has gone on long enough."

She froze, bewildered. "What are you on about?"

"I know you've always been in love with me. When I chose Arabella instead, you latched onto Sinclair as revenge, didn't you? This whole charade with Everett - it's just to make me jealous." Rosalind gaped at him, stunned by the absurd accusation.

"Clever scheme - I'll give you that. It worked. Even with Arabella, I couldn't stop thinking about you. Remembering our time together. Realizing how much light you brought to my life. I miss what we had."
###Chapter 582

Julian advanced another step, his piercing gaze locked onto Rosalind.

"I'm no longer in love with Arabella. My heart belongs to you now."

His words hung in the air—a declaration that he had moved on from Arabella and fallen for Rosalind instead.

Rosalind's thoughts scattered. She hadn't anticipated such a drastic shift from Julian. The man who had once dismissed her, even betrayed her, now stood before her, professing his transformation and newfound love.

His arms encircled her, pulling her close. The delicate fragrance of her perfume enveloped him, stirring something deep within.

"Be with me," Julian murmured, his voice rough with urgency.

Outside, Everett had just arrived, prepared to seek out Rosalind. But then Julian's sleek sports car rolled up, halting his steps.

He watched, motionless, as Julian knocked and Rosalind answered.

Now, Everett stood frozen, witnessing Julian crush Rosalind against his chest.

His hands curled into fists at his sides, knuckles cracking sharply in the quiet.

A searing pain lanced through his chest at the sight.

Yet, slowly, his fingers unclenched. Hadn't this been what he wanted? To push her away? His wish had been granted.

Without a word, Everett turned and vanished into the night.

Inside, Rosalind shoved Julian back with surprising force. "Have you lost your mind?"

Julian staggered, colliding with the doorframe.

Her expression was glacial, her voice cutting. "I never realized your ego was this inflated. Let me be clear—your breakup with Arabella means nothing to me. I won't be with you."

Julian blinked, stunned. "Why?"

Rosalind crossed her arms, unyielding. "You already know why. Let me repeat it—Julian, I don't love you anymore."

"That's impossible," Julian denied, shaking his head.

"Haven't you been listening? I admit I once cared for you, but it was nothing more than a girl's admiration for an older brother. Back then, I didn't even understand real love—until Everett."

Her voice softened, warmth seeping into her words.

"My world shifted toward him. When he's near, he's all I see. When he's gone, he's all I miss. I've never felt this way about anyone else. He's my first true love."

Julian refused to accept it. He had always believed Rosalind was his. "You're lying! You don't love Everett. You're just using him to punish me!"

"Julian," Rosalind said firmly, "if delusions plague you, see a doctor. I'm not playing games. Everett is the man I love."

Without hesitation, she pushed Julian out the door. He stood there, stunned, his voice rising in frustration. "Rosalind, enough games! I've ended things with Arabella for you! What more do you want?"

Her eyes narrowed. "I want you gone from my life. I want you to leave my home—now."

With a final, resounding slam, the door shut in his face.

Julian stood there, speechless.

No. He couldn't—wouldn't—believe it. Rosalind couldn't have stopped loving him.

What did Everett have that he didn't? Why would she choose him?

He wasn't ready to let go.

Not yet.
###Chapter 583
Rosalind couldn't stand waiting any longer for Everett. She clenched her fists, determination flashing in her eyes.

If Everett wouldn't come to her, she would hunt him down herself.

The casino lights blinded her as she stormed inside, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. She cornered a dealer near the roulette table. "Is Everett Sinclair here?"

The man smirked, twirling a chip between his fingers. "Another gorgeous woman asking for Everett? Sorry, darling. He's not working tonight."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Where is he?"

Leaning closer, the dealer dropped his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Out at The Velvet Lounge with the boss's daughter. Having a real good time, if you know what I mean."

The boss's daughter?

Genevieve Blackwood—the woman with curves that could stop traffic and a smile that melted men? Everett was with her right now?

The dealer chuckled at Rosalind's stunned expression. "Got a crush on Sinclair? Don't waste your time, sweetheart. He's taken."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

"Oh yeah. Everett and Ms. Blackwood are official. Whole casino knows."

The words hit like a slap. Everett was dating Genevieve?

That explained why he'd vanished from her life. He'd moved on—without a single word to her.

What had she been to him? Just another distraction?

Without another thought, Rosalind bolted for the exit. She had to see this for herself.

The Velvet Lounge pulsed with bass-heavy music, but the VIP section was eerily quiet—privatized for the night. And there he was.

Everett.

Dressed in a crisp white button-down that clung to his sculpted torso, sleeves rolled to reveal corded forearms. His usual dark wardrobe made the shift to white startling—like moonlight cutting through shadows. That sharp undercut, that lazy confidence as he lounged across the velvet couch.

Even in a room full of people, he was magnetic.

Genevieve perched beside him, her manicured fingers tracing circles on his thigh. A ring of their inner circle laughed over champagne flutes.

"Here, boss. Smoke?" Someone offered Everett a cigarette.

Genevieve swatted it away with a giggle. "No smoking for him."

"Why not?"

She bit her lip, casting Everett a coy glance. "We're getting married soon. And after that..." She trailed off, pressing a hand to her flat stomach. "We'll be trying for a baby. He needs to stay healthy."

The group erupted in cheers.

"Marriage? Damn, congrats!"

"First round's on me! To the future Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair!"

Everett's arm curled around Genevieve's waist, pulling her flush against him. The way his fingers splayed possessively over her hip made Rosalind's stomach twist.

She'd never seen him touch anyone like that. With her, he'd always been restrained. Distant.

Now he looked at Genevieve like she hung the stars.

"Since no smoking," a voice called, "how about a drink? A ceremonial toast for the engaged couple!"

Glasses were thrust into their hands. Genevieve hooked her arm through Everett's, her gaze locked on his as she purred, "After this, I'm yours forever, Everett."

Someone wolf-whistled. "Ms. Blackwood, you're not even married yet!"

She tossed her hair. "I don't care. After tonight, I belong to him."

Everett's lips curved—a rare, genuine smile. "Yeah," he murmured, voice rough. "You do."

Rosalind's knees buckled.

The attendant hadn't lied.

Everett wasn't hers.

He'd never been.
###Chapter 584

Rosalind's lips curved into a bitter smile as she watched Everett and Genevieve clink their glasses together in celebration.

The crowd exploded with cheers, their voices rising in a chorus of, "Honeymoon time!"

Each word felt like a dagger twisting in Rosalind's chest. The pain was so sharp she could barely breathe.

Everett was toasting with Genevieve. Soon, he would marry her.

He was going to vow his life to another woman.

Why was he doing this to her?

Just then, a voice cut through the noise. "We need more drinks over here! The bottle's empty!"

A server hurried forward with a fresh bottle of champagne.

Rosalind intercepted him. "I'll take it."

The server blinked in confusion. "Excuse me?"

Without hesitation, she pulled out a thick stack of bills and pressed them into his palm. "This should cover it."

Understanding dawned on his face, and he grinned. "Of course. It's all yours."

Rosalind took the bottle, slipped on a mask, and made her way toward the VIP section.

"Set the drinks here," someone instructed.

She nodded. "Got it."

As she placed the bottle on the table, a young man's gaze locked onto her. His eyes raked over her figure—her flawless skin, her large, luminous eyes, the high ponytail that gave her an effortlessly youthful allure. She was magnetic, impossible to ignore.

"I had no idea this place had such a stunning waitress," he drawled. "How old are you, sweetheart?"

The entire booth turned to stare at her.

"Wait, how did we miss her when we walked in?"

"You work here? Come sit with us."

The men's gazes were predatory, but Everett, with his striking features, remained indifferent, his attention fixed on his drink as if none of this concerned him.

Genevieve, however, noticed Rosalind immediately. Beautiful women always recognized each other. There was something familiar about her.

Genevieve tilted her head. "Have we met before?"

Rosalind shook her head, her eyes flickering briefly to Everett.

At that moment, Genevieve wrapped her arms possessively around Everett's arm, pouting. "Everett, doesn't she look familiar? I swear I've seen her somewhere."

Everett finally glanced up.

His expression had been bored, detached—until his eyes met Rosalind's.

The glass in his hand stilled.

She held his gaze, knowing he recognized her instantly.

"Do you know her?" Genevieve pressed.

Rosalind's breath caught. What would he say?

Would he acknowledge her? Or deny her existence?

Everett's lips thinned, his gaze turning cold. "No. You're mistaken."

Rosalind flinched. He was really going to pretend she meant nothing to him.

He was with Genevieve now, eager to erase every trace of their past.

Just then, a hand clamped around her wrist, pulling her forward.

"Come here, gorgeous. Let's have some fun."
###Chapter 585
Rosalind stared at the arrogant young man, attempting to free her slender wrist from his grasp. "I'm merely a server here to deliver drinks. I don't socialize with patrons. Release me this instant!"

His grip only tightened, amusement flickering in his eyes as she struggled. "Surely you're here for the tips? One glass with me, and I'll make it worth your while."

She shook her head vehemently. "Keep your money!"

With a sharp snap of his fingers, Julian Ashford's assistant strode in, bearing a sleek black case. The lid flipped open, revealing crisp hundred-dollar bills stacked neatly inside. The assistant peeled off a thick wad and dangled it before her.

"One thousand. For one sip."

Rosalind's jaw clenched. "I said no."

Julian's smirk widened. "Five thousand, then. Just one glass—that's all I ask."

"Not interested!" Her voice rang clear as crystal.

The surrounding crowd erupted in laughter. "Julian never begs twice! You should feel honored," someone jeered.

"Seems our Julian's finally met his match," another voice chimed in.

From the plush velvet sofa, Genevieve Blackwood observed the scene before nudging Everett Sinclair beside her. "Looks like Julian's found tonight's entertainment."

Everett swirled his cabernet lazily, his icy gaze fixed on Julian and Rosalind. The ruby liquid sloshed against the glass, mirroring the tension coiling in the air.

"You're unusually quiet," Genevieve murmured, studying his stony profile.

Everett was a fortress—unyielding, inscrutable. Even after months of dating, Genevieve often felt like she was deciphering hieroglyphs. But now, his stillness carried a razor's edge, the temperature around him plummeting.

Her attention snapped back to Rosalind. Who was this girl?

Julian chuckled, snapping the case shut. "Fine. Take the whole box. Now drink."

Before Rosalind could react, he yanked her down onto his lap. She stiffened, every muscle locking in revulsion.

"Get off me!" She shoved against his chest.

Julian ignored her, fingers brushing the edge of her lace mask. "Why hide this pretty face? Let's see what you're—"

Rosalind caught his wrist mid-air. "Don't."

His brows arched. "Why not?"

"Because," she hissed, "only my partner gets that privilege. And he won't appreciate you trying."

"Partner?" Julian recoiled slightly. "You're taken?"

The room erupted in fresh taunts.

"Julian Ashford, rejected? That's a first!"

"Bet the boyfriend's some broke college kid. She'll regret turning you down!"

Everett's glass hit the table with a sharp clink. Every head turned as he rose, his voice slicing through the noise like winter wind.

"Enough."

A beat of silence. Then—

"Everett?" Genevieve blinked. "What are you—"

But he was already striding forward, his shadow falling over Julian and Rosalind.

Rosalind's breath hitched. Those glacial eyes—she'd know them anywhere.

Everett Sinclair.

Here.

Now.

And the look he was giving Julian could've frozen hell over.
###Chapter 586
Rosalind's hands trembled visibly as her mind raced. She could feel Everett's piercing gaze burning into her back.

This was her test.

Would he intervene?

Did she still mean anything to him?

If he remained seated, she would finally let go.

"That's right," she declared, her voice quivering just slightly, "I'm taken."

Julian's eyebrow arched mockingly. "And who might this lucky man be?"

"Not your concern," Rosalind snapped. "Just know he towers over you in every way. We're deeply in love!"

The crowd erupted in laughter.

"Ouch, Julian got burned!"

"Looks like someone's striking out tonight."

Julian's smirk turned vicious. "Prove it. Where is this mystery man? If he cared, why would he let his woman work in a dump like this?" He took a swig of whiskey before thrusting the glass toward her. "Drink. If he exists, he'll come running."

He lunged forward, attempting to force the liquor down her throat.

Rosalind twisted away, shoving at his chest. "Get off me! I said no!"

Amber liquid splashed across her blouse, leaving dark stains on the fabric. The spectators howled with laughter.

"Still no white knight? Guess she was lying!"

"Julian's not so bad, sweetheart. He'll treat you right!"

Her heart plummeted. Everett wasn't coming.

Genevieve watched Everett with feline amusement. "Our private evening's become quite the spectacle, hasn't it?" She draped herself against his arm. "Though I must say, their drama is more entertaining than our conversation."

Everett's knuckles whitened around his crystal tumbler. He downed the remaining bourbon in one burning swallow before slamming the glass onto the table with a thunderous crack.

The entire room froze.

Julian blinked in confusion. "Problem, Sinclair?"

Genevieve stiffened. "Everett?"

But his glacial stare remained locked on Julian. "Remove your hand. Now."

"What the hell are you—"

Everett moved like lightning. In one fluid motion, he wrenched Julian's wrist sideways. The sickening snap of bone echoed through the silent room as the glass shattered against the Persian rug.

Without sparing Julian a glance, Everett turned to Rosalind. His touch was unexpectedly gentle as he pulled her upright.

"We're leaving," he stated, his voice leaving no room for argument.

Murmurs exploded through the crowd.

"Since when does Sinclair care about waitresses?"

"Who is that girl?"

"Ms. Blackwood, what's happening?"

Genevieve stood rooted, realization dawning. That wasn't just any waitress.

It was Rosalind Fairchild.
###Chapter 587

Genevieve's nails dug into her palms as bitter jealousy burned through her veins. Though officially engaged to Everett, she knew with painful certainty that Rosalind still held a piece of his heart.

That unshakable feminine intuition screamed at her, impossible to ignore.

With Rosalind's sudden reappearance, Genevieve felt danger closing in like a tightening noose. She was utterly obsessed with Everett - losing him wasn't an option.

"Ms. Blackwood, is everything alright?"

Genevieve snapped, her expression darkening. "All of you - out!"

The staff scattered instantly, sensing the storm brewing in her stormy eyes.

Just then, Reginald arrived. His concerned gaze swept over his daughter. "What happened? Who upset you?"

Genevieve threw herself into her father's arms. "Papa..."

Reginald glanced around the empty room. "Where's Everett? I thought you two were together. Why are you alone?"

Genevieve bit her lip, unwilling to criticize Everett directly. "He stepped away briefly. I... I can't bear the thought of losing him. We must marry immediately!"

Reginald arched an eyebrow. "Why this sudden urgency?"

"I just need to be his wife," she whispered desperately. "But he seems reluctant to set a date. You must find a way to make him commit."

With a calculated smile, she added, "You've always admired Everett, haven't you? Called him the son you never had. Once we're married, you can hand the business to him. We'll give you grandchildren to spoil while you enjoy retirement!"

Reginald chuckled deeply. "My little girl's grown up so fast. Very well, I'll arrange something."

"What's your plan?"

He winked conspiratorially. "A little overnight arrangement to make an honest woman of you."

Genevieve's cheeks flushed scarlet. "Father!"

"Unless you'd rather not?"

"Of course I want to!" she declared fiercely.

Genevieve was certain that once she shared Everett's bed, he'd have no choice but to marry her. Then that Rosalind would be permanently out of the picture.

Everett gripped Rosalind's slender wrist like a vice, dragging her down the corridor. She stumbled after his long strides, protesting. "Release me!"

He whirled suddenly, slamming her against the wall. With one sharp motion, he tore off her mask, revealing her delicate features.

"What are you doing here?" he demanded, voice like ice.

Rosalind glared defiantly. "Since when do I need your permission? I go where I please."

Everett's jaw tightened. "You don't belong here. Return to your own—"

"If you can come, so can I!" she interrupted, lips curling in challenge. "You claimed not to know me earlier. So why rescue me? Why care?"

Everett's gaze darkened. "Rosalind, there's no future for us."

He turned to leave.

But Rosalind moved faster. She reached up, wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling his tall frame down. Caught off guard, Everett found himself nose-to-nose with her fiery gaze.
###Chapter 588

Rosalind gazed at Everett with unwavering intensity. "I know how you feel about me. You're in love with me!"

Her declaration wasn't a question—it was an undeniable truth.

Everett stiffened, caught completely off guard.

"You can't lie to me, because I already know the truth. Denying it would be pointless. We belong together!"

Without hesitation, Rosalind tilted her head up and pressed her lips against his.

Everett froze, stunned by her boldness. He tried to pull away, his voice strained. "Rosalind—"

But it was no use. Rosalind tightened her arms around his neck, refusing to let him escape. Her lips moved against his with desperate urgency, deepening the kiss. The warmth of her mouth, the way she clung to him—it left him breathless.

Everett had never been one for romance. The sensation overwhelmed him, sending heat coursing through his veins. His body burned, his thoughts scattering.

Rosalind tasted the sharp tang of whiskey on his lips, wild and intoxicating. It made her dizzy, but she didn’t stop.

Somehow, Everett managed to break free. "What are you doing?"

Her lips glistened, slightly swollen from the kiss. She leaned in closer, her voice trembling. "Have you ever kissed Genevieve?"

She was asking about Genevieve.

Everett didn’t answer. He tried to pry her hands from his neck, but Rosalind stood on her toes and bit his lower lip, stopping him.

He winced, his voice low and rough. "Don’t leave marks. People will see."

He didn’t want anyone noticing.

Rosalind released his lip—only to sink her teeth into his neck instead. The sharp sting made him inhale sharply.

His hands instinctively wrapped around her waist, fingers tangling in her soft hair. She smelled like vanilla and something sweet, her body warm and pliant against his.

"Are you done?" Everett murmured, his voice unexpectedly tender.

Rosalind pulled back slightly. "If you ever hurt me again, I’ll bite harder. And I know exactly where to make it hurt."

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "There’s no future for us. I’m with Genevieve now."

Rosalind’s eyes bore into his. "Then what happens to me?"

Everett swallowed hard, his throat tight. "You—"

Before he could finish, Rosalind kissed him again, softly this time. "Just answer me one thing. Do you really want me to walk away?"

His expression darkened, conflict swirling in his gaze. He hesitated. "I—"

"Everett," she interrupted, her voice softer now. "If you let me go now, I’ll be with someone else. Can you live with that?"

The thought made his chest tighten. How could he ever let her go?

But...

Rosalind wrapped her arms around him again. "Everything you said before—I didn’t believe a word of it. I know you wouldn’t just fall for someone else. There’s a reason you’re with Genevieve. Tell me. I’m not afraid of anything, as long as we face it together."

Everett’s resistance crumbled. After all the cold words he’d thrown at her, she still trusted him completely.

But could he really tell her the truth?
###Chapter 589

In the end, Everett couldn't bring himself to tell Rosalind the truth.

Steeling himself, he pushed her away gently. "We've been through this before—there's no future for us. You should leave now."

Rosalind opened her mouth to protest, but—

"Rosalind." Everett's voice was sharp, cutting through her words like a blade. The way he said her name left no room for argument. "Don't ruin this for me. Go home."

He told her not to ruin things.

If he had said anything else, perhaps Rosalind wouldn’t have walked away. But those words—those exact words—were what made her turn.

With a quiet sigh, she released her grip on his sleeve and stepped back.

After a few paces, she glanced over her shoulder, her gaze lingering on him for a heartbeat. Then, she lifted a delicate hand in farewell.

"Goodbye, Everett. If you ever need me… call. I'll always answer."

Her slender figure melted into the crowd, disappearing from view.

Everett stood motionless, watching her go. She was so soft, so yielding—for a moment, his chest tightened with something he couldn’t name. He didn’t want her to leave.

But he had his own battles to fight.

Just then, his phone buzzed. Genevieve.

He answered immediately.

"Where are you?" Her voice was urgent. "My father's here, and he's looking for you. Get back now."

Reginald wanted to see him.

Everett ended the call and slipped the phone into his pocket, turning on his heel.

Genevieve was waiting when he arrived, her eyes sharp with suspicion. "There you are. Where's that waitress? Why did you take her? What's going on between you two?"

Everett met her gaze evenly. "I—"

"Shh." She pressed a finger to his lips, silencing him. "No explanations. Just promise me you're mine. And don’t worry—I haven’t told my father a thing."

Everett said nothing as they approached Reginald.

"Everett! Looks like you and Genevieve had quite the evening," Reginald said with a chuckle.

Genevieve laughed, looping her arm through Everett's. "He deserves more time off, Father. Preferably with me."

Reginald grinned. "My daughter’s already wrapped around your finger, I see!"

He handed them each a glass of wine. "A toast."

Everett accepted his and clinked it against Reginald's before downing it in one swallow.

Genevieve watched, satisfaction curling in her chest. She knew exactly what was in that drink. Tonight, Everett wouldn’t be able to resist her.

Everett set the glass down. "We should head back."

Reginald nodded. "Right. Let’s go."

Outside, two sleek black cars idled at the curb, flanked by men in dark suits. One opened the rear door. "Ms. Blackwood, Everett, after you."

As Everett moved to enter, a sudden wave of heat surged through him. His mouth went dry, his skin prickling with unease.

He knew this feeling.

He’d been drugged.

Turning to Reginald, his voice was low. "What was in that drink?"

Everett already knew the answer.

Reginald smirked, unsurprised. "Nothing harmful. Just something to… enhance the mood between you and Genevieve."

"Enhance the mood?" Everett’s tone was edged with warning.

Reginald clapped him on the back. "Don’t play coy. Tonight, I’m entrusting my daughter to you."

Everett’s gaze flicked to Genevieve, who stood nearby, cheeks flushed, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Tonight, she would get exactly what she wanted.
###Chapter 590

Everett pressed his lips into a thin line, carefully removing Genevieve's hand from his shoulder. "I should head home."

He turned to leave.

Genevieve froze for a split second before calling out, "Everett!"

Reginald stepped forward, his voice laced with concern. "You're already under the influence. Why insist on leaving? I'll arrange for you and my daughter to be taken to the hotel."

Everett shook his head. "No, I'm fine."

Genevieve's face paled at the rejection. She was stunning—flawless features, a figure that turned heads—and yet, despite the endless line of suitors, she had fallen for Everett, a man with nothing but ambition.

She had been bold, making her desires clear at every opportunity. So why was he resisting? Wasn't she the one risking her reputation?

Reginald frowned, studying Everett with suspicion. "What's the problem? Genevieve is your fiancée. This is just a natural step forward. Why make it complicated?"

His gaze sharpened. "Unless... you're not serious about my daughter? Have you been playing us?"

"Father, Everett would never!" Genevieve rushed to his defense.

Everett glanced at her, then took her hand in his. "Mr. Blackwood, it's not what you think."

Reginald's expression softened. "Good. Everett, I value you. I already see you as family." He leaned in, lowering his voice. "In a few days, some very important figures will arrive in Willowbrook. Their movements are confidential, but I'm telling you this because I trust you. If you and Genevieve take this step, I'll introduce you to them."

A thrill shot through Everett's chest. This was the moment he had been waiting for—his chance to finally meet him.

But the price was clear. He had to spend the night with Genevieve.

Reginald opened the car door. "Get in."

The choice was his.

The drug pulsed through Everett's veins, heat spreading relentlessly. He hesitated—then exhaled sharply and slid into the car beside Genevieve.

A triumphant smile curved her lips.

Reginald grinned. "That's more like it. Welcome to the family."

He turned to the driver. "Take them to The Grand Celeste. Ensure they're undisturbed."

The driver bowed. "Of course, Mr. Blackwood."

The door clicked shut, and the sleek black car sped away.

Minutes later, they arrived at the penthouse suite of the luxury hotel. Men in dark suits stood guard outside—Reginald's men.

One opened the door with a deferential nod. "Everything has been prepared. You won't be interrupted."

Genevieve's cheeks flushed as she stepped inside, pulling Everett with her. The door closed behind them with a soft, final click.
###Chapter 591

Everett attempted to pry Rosalind's fingers from his body, but she only clung tighter.

"We're already in a hotel suite," she whispered, her breath hot against his neck. "You can't possibly resist me now. Don't you desire me?"

Every inch of his skin burned with unnatural heat, waves of fire coursing through his veins like liquid torment. The sensation was maddening.

Yet the press of Rosalind's curves against him, her delicate fingers tracing patterns on his chest, provided momentary relief from the agony.

"I've wanted you for so long, Everett," she murmured, lips brushing his jaw. "Let me show you how good we can be together tonight."

When Everett turned to face her, Rosalind's breathtaking beauty struck him anew. Her flawless features, the way her dark hair cascaded over bare shoulders - she was exquisite. He'd been surrounded by beautiful women all his life, but Rosalind stood apart.

Her fingertips traced the sharp angles of his face. "Everett..."

Instead of pushing her away, he lifted her effortlessly, carrying her toward the plush bed.

Rosalind landed softly on the mattress, immediately wrapping her arms around his neck to pull him down with her. "Let me help with these," she purred, fingers working at his shirt buttons.

Abruptly, Everett caught her wrists. His bloodshot eyes locked onto hers. "I need to—"

"Shower together?" she suggested with a coy smile.

"No. Alone."

Rosalind flipped their positions, pinning Everett beneath her. She straddled him boldly, desire burning in her gaze. "Don't leave me. Not now when we're finally together."

A muscle jumped in his jaw as he gripped her waist, pulling her flush against him until their lips nearly touched.

Rosalind's pulse raced at their proximity. She'd never been this close to Everett before. The raw masculinity of him, the way his dark eyes smoldered - it made her breath catch. She leaned in, lips parting—

Pain exploded at the base of her skull. Everett's precise strike sent her collapsing onto the bed, unconscious before she hit the sheets.

Everett sat up, body still aflame but mind clearing. When Rosalind had been atop him moments ago, an image of Rosalind's delicate features had flashed through his mind - how she'd once sat astride him just like this.

The memory made him ache for her.

Outside, Reginald's men stood guard, making escape impossible. Confrontation wasn't an option - not yet. Everett moved to the bathroom, shedding his shirt before turning the shower to icy cold. The freezing spray did little to quell the fire raging within him.

If anything, the shock of cold water intensified the war between ice and fire tormenting his body. He groaned, bracing against the tile.

He couldn't endure this.

Fumbling for his phone, Everett scrolled to Rosalind's number. After a heartbeat's hesitation, he pressed call.

At that exact moment, Rosalind sat in her quiet villa. When Everett's name illuminated her screen, her heart stuttered.

He was calling.

Earlier at the lounge, she'd promised to wait for his call. That someone like Everett would reach out first meant everything.

"Hello?" she answered eagerly.

Only ragged breathing answered. Harsh. Uneven.

Rosalind tightened her grip on the phone. "Everett? Are you there? Why won't you speak?"

Under the punishing spray, Everett's entire being focused on Rosalind's melodic voice. Like birdsong to a drowning man, it made the veins in his eyes darken further.

A rough sound escaped him.

He was there.

"Something's wrong," Rosalind pressed. "That noise - what's happening? Where are you?"

Everett squeezed his eyes shut, phone clutched in one hand while the other drifted lower. "Rosalind..." Her name was a prayer on his lips.

"I'm here. Tell me where you are! Why won't you answer me?"

"You're not with Genevieve, are you?" Her voice turned fierce. "I won't have you with her, Everett Sinclair! Do you hear me? I refuse to let you two—"

Everett remained silent as Rosalind continued, oblivious to his torment.

"Do you miss me?" The question came softly, hopeful. Everett stilled.

"If you do...come to me. I'm home alone tonight. Father and Beatrice are away." The invitation couldn't be clearer.

When Everett didn't respond, Rosalind sighed. "I'm hanging up now."

The line went dead with two sharp beeps.

Restlessness consumed him. He needed Rosalind - now. Shutting off the water, Everett dressed hastily. With Genevieve unconscious and guards at the door, only one exit remained.

The fourth-floor window.

Everett fashioned a rope from bedsheets and descended swiftly. Cool night air filled his lungs as his feet hit the ground. He ran, long strides eating up the distance between him and Rosalind.

Meanwhile, in her villa, Rosalind puzzled over Everett's strange behavior. That ragged breathing, his silence...

She considered calling back when the doorbell rang.

Everett stood on her doorstep, breathing hard from his sprint.

"You came," she breathed, equal parts shocked and delighted. "Come in."

She pulled him inside, shutting the door behind them. As she stepped back, Rosalind noticed the angry scrape on his forearm from his hurried descent.

Everett seemed unaware of the injury. Without warning, he hauled Rosalind against him, capturing her lips in a searing kiss so intense her knees nearly buckled.

His arms banded around her, molding her soft curves to his hard planes. Heat radiated from him in waves.

Rosalind pushed against his chest, breaking the kiss. "What—"

"I need you." Everett's voice was gravel, his gaze molten. "Now."
###Chapter 592

Rosalind took a sudden step backward, her eyes catching the angry red marks on Everett's forearm. "How did this happen?" Her fingers hovered over the wound without touching.

Everett barely glanced at the injury, likely sustained during his frantic rush to reach her. There were more pressing matters demanding his attention now.

Without warning, his strong hands encircled Rosalind's narrow waist, pulling her flush against his body. His mouth crashed down on hers with desperate intensity. The sheer force of his kiss made her knees buckle dangerously.

But Everett's iron grip held her upright, molding her pliant form against his hardened frame. Rosalind could feel the scorching heat radiating from his skin, the primal hunger thrumming through his veins.

She planted both palms against his solid chest, twisting her face away. "Have you lost your mind?" Her breath came in ragged gasps.

Everett's smoldering gaze pinned her in place as his voice dropped to a rough whisper. "Rosalind, I need you."


###Chapter 593
Rosalind studied Everett with growing concern.

"Something's wrong with you," she murmured, pressing her palm against his chest. "You're scorching hot!"

Everett's eyes flickered with crimson embers, his jaw clenched tight with restraint. He shouldn't have come to Rosalind tonight—but resisting the pull toward her had been impossible.

"Drugged," he rasped.

Rosalind's breath hitched. "Again?"

The word slipped out before she could stop it. This wasn't the first time someone had slipped something into Everett's drink.

"Was it Genevieve's father?" she demanded, suspicion sharpening her tone.

A low, affirmative grunt was his only reply.

Rosalind exhaled sharply, irritation sparking in her gaze. "What does he want? To force you into Genevieve's bed?"

Everett remained silent, his smoldering stare answering for him.

Rosalind scoffed, though her fingers curled into his shirt. "Honestly, Everett. First the heiresses, now mafia princesses. They'll stoop to anything to claim you, won't they?"

Without warning, Everett crushed his lips to hers, swallowing her words in a searing kiss.

Rosalind's pulse skyrocketed. Her arms wound around his neck instinctively, returning the kiss with equal fervor.

With the woman he loved in his arms, Everett's control shattered. Heat scorched through his veins, every nerve alight with desperate need.

Rosalind's freshly showered skin carried the delicate scent of jasmine. Everett buried his face against her throat, inhaling deeply as if starved.

Her eyes darkened with understanding. "What now?"

Everett's voice was rough. "Cold shower."

"Come with me."

She led him upstairs to her bedroom—a soft, feminine space awash in blush tones and lace, the air sweet with vanilla.

"The bathroom's here," she said, gesturing.

Everett vanished inside without another word.

The rush of water filled the silence. Rosalind slipped out briefly, returning with fresh clothes and a towel. She knocked lightly on the bathroom door.

"Everett? I brought you—"

No response.

Her knocks grew more urgent. "Everett!"

Still nothing.

Dread coiled in her stomach. The drug had clearly taken hold earlier—what if he'd collapsed?

"Everett, open this door!"

Her hand closed around the knob just as the door swung inward. Rosalind stumbled forward, crashing into Everett's bare chest.

She jerked her gaze up. "Are you—"

Water droplets slid down his sharp jawline, his damp skin glistening under the soft light.

"Fine," he ground out.

Rosalind exhaled sharply. "Then why didn't you answer? I thought—"

Everett suddenly pinned her against the wall.

Rosalind froze. Then her eyes widened—Everett stood before her, gloriously unclothed.

"Oh!" She slapped both hands over her face.

Everett's low chuckle vibrated against her. "Suddenly shy? I thought you were bolder than this."
###Chapter 594

Rosalind couldn't comprehend his words at all.
She was still a maiden, for heaven's sake!

Her small fist clenched instinctively, landing a weak punch against Everett's broad chest. "You're absolutely terrible!"

Everett caught her delicate hand effortlessly, his lips descending upon hers without warning. The sudden kiss left Rosalind dizzy, her thoughts scattering like autumn leaves. "Didn't the cold shower help at all?"

The intensity in Everett's gaze burned like molten silver, predatory and possessive. "I need you. May I?"

His blunt request stunned her into silence.

Rosalind felt heat flood her cheeks as she nibbled her lower lip, giving the tiniest nod. "Alright."

Just as Everett leaned in again, she placed trembling fingers against his lips.

His brows furrowed in confusion. "What's wrong?"

She hesitated, her voice barely above a whisper. "Could we... move to the bed? I'm nervous. This is... my first."

The admission hung between them. Without another word, Everett swept her into his arms, carrying her to the plush four-poster bed.

Sensing her tension, he gently entwined their fingers. "Tell me if it's too much. Truth be told, I'm inexperienced too. This is my first time as well."

Rosalind's eyes sparkled at his confession. She bridged the distance between them, pressing her lips to his.

Time lost meaning. When awareness returned, Rosalind lay curled against the pillows, her forehead dewy with perspiration, cheeks flushed like dawn-kissed roses.

Everett nestled behind her, his sculpted face buried in her fragrant hair, fingers combing through the silken strands with reverent wonder.

"Shall we shower?" His murmur tickled her ear.

Rosalind turned, her luminous eyes meeting his. "Carry me."

Everett's lips curved. "As my lady commands."

Rising, he noticed the crimson evidence gracing the sheets - proof he'd claimed her innocence. Gathering her close, he carried his blushing bride to the marble ensuite, where she hid her face against his shoulder.

Steam curled around them as warm water cascaded down. Everett carefully gathered her long tresses, washing each strand with surprising tenderness.

Suddenly, Rosalind stiffened. "Everett?"

His hands stilled. "Yes, love?"

"We didn't... use protection?" Her voice wavered with dawning realization.

Everett froze. In their mutual inexperience, neither had considered contraception - Rosalind certainly kept no such items, and the thought hadn't crossed his mind.

He pulled her close, murmuring against her damp hair. "Forgive me. It completely slipped my mind."

Rosalind nodded. "I'll visit the apothecary tomorrow for the morning-after draught."

Everett cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheekbone before sealing his apology with a kiss. "Next time, I'll be prepared."

She mock-glared through her lashes. "Assuming there will be a next time?"

Everett's arms tightened possessively. "Don't you want there to be?"

Rosalind splashed him, laughter bubbling up. "You're incorrigible!"

Their playful banter continued until Everett suddenly pinned her against the tiled wall.

Rosalind gasped, feigning ignorance. "And what exactly are you doing?"

Everett's smoldering gaze held hers captive. "I want you again."

She bit her lip, suddenly serious. "First, answer me truthfully."

"Anything."

"Do you have feelings for me? Do you love me, Everett?" Her heart hammered against her ribs.

Everett cradled her face, his kiss tender yet fervent. "With all that I am. I love you, Rosalind."

The raw sincerity in his deep voice melted her resolve. Rosalind wound her arms around his neck, pulling him closer. "And I love you, Everett Sinclair!"


###Chapter 595

Rosalind stirred awake to the sensation of movement beside her. The warmth of Everett's body leaving the bed made her eyelids flutter open reluctantly.

Last night had been a whirlwind of passion—from the bed to the shower, then to the chaise lounge by the window. They had lost themselves in each other until exhaustion claimed them. Now, every slight movement sent a delicious ache through her limbs, a reminder of their shared intensity.

"Leaving already?" Her voice was sleep-soft, muffled against the pillow. She had fallen asleep curled against his chest, his arms wrapped securely around her. Even his gentlest shift had roused her.

Everett turned, his gaze softening as it met hers. "I have to."

"What time is it?"

"Just past four. Sleep a little longer."

Rosalind reached for him, winding her arms around his waist like a vine clinging to its support. "Then stay. Just a little longer."

He needed to return to The Grand Celeste before Genevieve woke. There were matters to attend to. But the way Rosalind nestled against him, her touch pleading and sweet, unraveled his resolve.

With a sigh, he sank back onto the mattress, pressing a lingering kiss to her forehead. "Fine. A little longer."

Rosalind rewarded him with a drowsy but enthusiastic kiss before succumbing to sleep again, her lashes fluttering shut.

Everett didn't sleep. He held her, savoring the weight of her in his arms, the scent of her hair. The memories of last night burned bright in his mind—every touch, every whispered confession. The way she had surrendered to him completely, as if she had always been his.

It had been reckless. Impulsive. And yet, now that he had claimed her, he couldn't imagine letting go.

His fingers traced the curve of her cheek, the softness of her lips. Unable to resist, he kissed her again—her temple, the corner of her mouth, the pulse at her throat. He buried his face in the silk of her hair, breathing her in.

All this time, he had restrained himself. But now that the floodgates were open, the depth of his feelings threatened to drown him. He wanted her. Needed her. Forever.

His arms tightened around her, pulling her flush against him—perhaps too roughly. A faint whimper escaped her, her brow furrowing in discomfort.

Everett immediately loosened his grip, chastising himself. She was delicate. Fragile in ways he couldn't afford to forget.

Once her breathing evened out again, he carefully disentangled himself. Dressed swiftly. Pressed one last kiss to her lips before slipping out the door.

Back at The Grand Celeste, Genevieve was still asleep when he returned.

Everett settled beside her, his mind still full of Rosalind as he closed his eyes.

At seven, Genevieve stirred. She blinked up at him, realization dawning as she found herself in his arms.

Everett sat up. "Morning."

Genevieve pushed herself upright, frowning slightly as she tried to piece together the night before. She remembered sitting on his lap, the warmth of his hands on her waist—but after that, nothing.

"Did we...?" Her voice wavered.

Everett stood, his expression cool. "Last night, you and your father drugged me to get what you wanted. Congratulations. You got it."

Understanding flickered in her eyes.

She scrambled off the bed, reaching for him. "Are you angry? Please don't be mad—I was scared you'd reject me, so I—"

Everett stepped back, just out of reach. "Genevieve, I already agreed to date you. There was no need for this."
###Chapter 596

"I can sense your heart isn't truly mine!" Rosalind whispered, tightening her arms around Everett's waist. "But now, everything's changed. We're finally together. Nothing will ever tear us apart again!"

Everett remained silent, his expression unreadable as he held her.

As they stepped out of the room, Reginald approached with a knowing smirk. "So, how was last night with Everett?"

Rosalind beamed, her cheeks flushed with triumph. "Everett is officially part of our family now."

Reginald let out a booming laugh. "Excellent! Everett, welcome to the Blackwoods. I've already spoken to him—he's on his way here."

Everett's eyes narrowed. "He's coming?"

"Indeed," Reginald confirmed, clapping him on the shoulder. "He'll be attending your wedding to Rosalind. Everything's arranged—you'll be married in three days."

Three days?

Everett's jaw tightened. The old fox had played him perfectly.

First, he'd orchestrated last night. Now, he was forcing a rushed wedding before Everett could react.

Rosalind studied his face, her smile faltering. "You... don't want to marry me?"

Both father and daughter watched him expectantly.

Everett forced a slow exhale. "Of course I do. I was just thinking three days might be too soon. Don't you need time for a proper wedding dress?"

Rosalind's face lit up like the sun.

"Oh, don't worry about that! I've already had mine designed. Dad, you'll need to give Everett time off these next few days. We have so much shopping to do—I intend to be the most breathtaking bride the world has ever seen."

Reginald chuckled. "Consider it done. Go enjoy yourselves."

Rosalind practically glowed with happiness.

Meanwhile, across town, Harrison took far too long to regain her strength.

By the time she woke, Everett was already gone.

Her fingers hovered over her phone, itching to message him—but she hesitated. He was probably busy. She set it down.

Then it rang.

"Harrison?" Lillian's voice trembled through the speaker.

Harrison's grip tightened. "Lillian? What's wrong?"

Lillian broke into sobs. "I-I tried calling Everett, but he didn't answer. Mom collapsed—she's in the hospital!"

Harrison shot to her feet. "I'm on my way."

She raced to the hospital, where Theodore met her at the door.

"Ms. Fairchild," he said quietly.

"Dr. Whitmore, what happened to Mrs. Sinclair?"

Theodore's expression darkened. "You should prepare yourself. She won't last more than two days."

Harrison's breath caught.

From inside the room, Lillian's anguished cry pierced the air.

"Two days?! Harrison, what is he saying?"


###Chapter 597

Theodore's words pierced through Rosalind's consciousness like shards of ice. Lillian had been completely unaware until this moment. The revelation hit her with the force of a tidal wave, leaving her gasping for air.

Rosalind moved closer, placing a steadying hand on Lillian's trembling shoulder. "Lillian, breathe. Your mother's condition... it's been deteriorating for a while now."

There had been a time when Margaret had begged Rosalind to keep this from Everett and Lillian—especially with Lillian's final exams looming. The timing couldn't have been worse.

Tears spilled down Lillian's cheeks, hot and unchecked. The weight of the news crushed her. Her voice cracked as she choked out, "How? She was fine! She can't—she can't just leave us now. Not like this."

Rosalind pulled Lillian into a tight embrace, her own heart aching. "She didn't want you to suffer. That's why she kept it from you."

Lillian's sobs grew heavier. "Everett and I lost our father years ago. Mom raised us alone. Even blind, she never let us go without love. My friends pitied me for not having a father, but I never felt lacking—because of her. Because of Everett. And now..." Her voice broke. "Now she's leaving me too."

There were no words strong enough to mend such grief. Rosalind simply held her, one hand rubbing soothing circles on her back.

Theodore's voice was gentle but firm. "Ms. Fairchild, we've done everything medically possible. These next few days... just be with her."

With that, he quietly exited the room.

Lillian wiped her tears fiercely. She wouldn't let Margaret hear her cry. She had to be strong now.

"Thank you, Rosalind. You're always here when we need you."

Rosalind squeezed her hand. The Sinclair siblings had steel in their spines. Hardship only made them stronger.

"Has Everett arrived yet?"

Lillian shook her head. "I've called him repeatedly. No answer. He's been so distant lately, barely coming home."

She didn't know what Everett was wrapped up in.

Rosalind wouldn't be the one to tell her. "Let's go see your mother."

They stepped into the hospital room. Margaret lay still, her frail form neatly arranged against the stark white sheets, her face pale as moonlight.

"Mom, Rosalind is here."

Rosalind approached, taking Margaret's thin hand in hers. "Mrs. Sinclair, I came as soon as I could."

Margaret's lips curved weakly. "Rosalind. I thought I heard your voice. Thank you for coming."

Rosalind's eyes burned, but she blinked back the tears. "Of course. Don't worry about anything. Just rest. I've arranged everything here, and Lillian will stay with me. Her exams are in five days."

Lillian nodded quickly. "Five days."

Rosalind gave Margaret's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Oakwood High is right near my place. I'll take care of her like she's my own sister."

Margaret's breath hitched, emotion thickening her voice. There was no need for words—Rosalind already understood.

Rosalind made sure Margaret knew she had nothing left to fear.

Margaret gripped her hand tighter. "Thank you. Meeting you has—"
###Chapter 598

Rosalind's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as they traced paths down her pale cheeks. She leaned forward, pressing her forehead gently against Margaret's trembling fingers.

"Mrs. Sinclair," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "Meeting you, Lillian, and Everett has been the greatest blessing of my life."

Margaret's clouded eyes softened. "My son... I haven't seen Everett in so long."

A sudden coughing fit wracked Margaret's frail body, ending with crimson droplets staining her hospital gown.

"Mrs. Sinclair!"

"Mother!"

Rosalind and Lillian rushed to her bedside simultaneously.

"I'll fetch the doctor immediately!" Rosalind declared, already turning toward the door.

Margaret's surprisingly strong grip stopped her. "No, child. I know my time has come. This is the end for me."

Lillian collapsed against the bed, her sobs shaking the thin hospital sheets. "Please don't say that!"

Rosalind blinked through her tears. "Should we... should we bring Everett to see you?"

Margaret managed a weak nod. "Yes."

Without hesitation, Rosalind sprang into action. "I'll find him right now. Just hold on, Mrs. Sinclair. I promise I'll bring him back!"

She raced through the hospital corridors, fumbling for her phone. Everett's line went straight to voicemail - his device was powered off.

Where could he possibly be?

Her fingers flew across the screen to call Alistair. "Father, can you locate Everett? It's a matter of life and death!"

Alistair's response came swift and efficient. "Give me sixty seconds."

The reply arrived sooner than expected. "He's at The Grand Celeste's shopping arcade. With a woman."

That could only mean one person - Genevieve.

Everett was with Genevieve now?

Rosalind didn't pause to think. She hailed the first available taxi to the luxury hotel.

At the boutique, Everett stood stiffly near the dressing rooms while Genevieve paraded before mirrors with a sales assistant. An inexplicable dread had settled in his chest, making his palms clammy.

He reached for his phone instinctively.

Genevieve materialized beside him instantly. "Put that away! We had an agreement - your undivided attention for these three days. No distractions."

She'd made him power off his device, ensuring complete focus on her demands. With the important meeting looming, Everett had little choice but to comply.

He forced a placating smile. "Of course, darling."

The assistant returned holding an emerald gown. "This would look divine on you, Miss Blackwood. Shall we?"

Genevieve tossed Everett a warning glance. "Don't move from this spot."

As she disappeared behind the curtain, a familiar voice cut through the perfumed air. "Everett."

He turned to see Rosalind - disheveled and breathless - sprinting toward him.

Everett's entire body tensed as he glanced at the closed fitting room, then moved swiftly to intercept Rosalind. "What's wrong?"

She seized his wrist with surprising strength. "Come with me! Now!"

"Where—"

"It's your mother."

Everett's world tilted. He stared at Rosalind, the blood draining from his face. Then without another word, they were running.

The hospital blurred past them. Madeline's tear-streaked face greeted them at the door. "Everett! You're here!"

He fell to his knees beside the bed where Margaret lay fading. "Mother!"

Margaret's frail hand lifted weakly. Everett caught it between both of his, his voice breaking. "You were fine yesterday. What happened?"

A ghost of a smile touched Margaret's lips. "My dear boy... I'm going to see your father again."
###Chapter 599

Everett's eyes were bloodshot and swollen. He hadn't been home much these days, keeping his distance to shield Lillian and Margaret from his dangerous activities. Protecting his family meant keeping them out of the public eye.

But today, Margaret had suddenly taken ill.

"Why didn't you tell me you were sick?" His voice cracked with emotion.

Margaret gave him a gentle smile. "It wasn't so bad. Rosalind took excellent care of me, and the doctors provided the best treatment. Everett, I didn't want to burden you. All I want is for you to live a peaceful life. That's what your father would have wanted too. Do you understand?"

She had spent years trying to steer him away from the path Theodore had taken.

Everett gripped her frail hand, his voice thick. "Don't worry. This time, things will be different."

Tears spilled down Margaret's cheeks. "My darlings..."

Rosalind and Lillian moved closer, each taking one of her hands.

Margaret pressed their palms together. "I'm leaving now. Don't grieve for me. I'll be with your father. He's been alone all these years—he must miss me terribly."

Rosalind's shoulders shook as silent sobs wracked her body.

"Everett, I'm entrusting Lillian to you. She's your sister—protect her. And Rosalind... she's a remarkable woman. You're fortunate to have her. Cherish her."

Everett swallowed hard, fighting back tears. "I will."

Margaret's smile was faint but serene. "I've had a good life. Your father when I was young, then you two. Life isn't perfect, but its small joys make it worthwhile. Now... it's time for me to rest."

With those final words, her eyes fluttered shut, her expression peaceful as she slipped away.

So much remained unspoken—regrets about Theodore, sorrow at not seeing her children's futures—but time had run out.

She departed quietly, leaving behind a silence heavy with unvoiced love.

Everett and Lillian collapsed into each other, their anguished cries echoing through the room. "Mom!"

Margaret was gone.

Later, Rosalind found Everett alone in the dim hallway. His broad frame leaned heavily against the wall, clad only in a black sweater.

In that moment, his powerful build seemed strangely vulnerable. Head bowed, he stood motionless, shadows clinging to him like grief.

Rosalind approached. "I've made arrangements for Mrs. Sinclair's funeral. If you need to handle anything, go ahead. I'll stay with Lillian."

Everett straightened, his eyes raw. He had to leave. He had to return.

Genevieve would be searching for him by now.

Even in his mother's final moments, he couldn't stay.

Without Rosalind, he might have missed his last chance to see Margaret.

Life's burdens had crushed him young, leaving no choices.

The injustice burned hotter the more he thought about it. Revenge festered in his chest. He met Rosalind's gaze. "Thank you. For everything."

There was so much more to say, but words failed him. Gratitude was all he could offer—for her presence when he needed it most, for standing beside him in his darkest hours.

Rosalind stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him. She pressed her cheek to his chest, listening to the steady rhythm beneath. "Don't thank me. If you need to cry, then cry. I know how much this hurts."

The dam broke. Everett's shoulders shook as silent tears fell at last.
###Chapter 600

Everett's eyes were swollen and red. Though Rosalind whispered soothing words, the scalding tears kept streaming down his face uncontrollably.

He pulled Rosalind into a crushing embrace, his entire frame trembling with suppressed grief. "I'm motherless now," he choked out between ragged breaths. "An orphan with no family left."

Rosalind held him just as fiercely, her arms forming a protective cocoon around him.

Never before had Everett revealed such raw vulnerability. Never had he allowed anyone to witness his tears.

Rosalind pressed her cheek against his damp shoulder. "You still have Lillian," she murmured. "And you have me. I'm not going anywhere."

Rising on her toes, she cradled his face between her palms and placed a featherlight kiss on his forehead.

That simple gesture spoke volumes - the purest form of tenderness one soul could offer another.

Everett clung to her like a drowning man to driftwood, drawing strength from her steady presence.

The inevitable couldn't be postponed. The hospital had completed all arrangements, and Rosalind had escorted Margaret's ashes home with Lillian's help.

Rosalind carefully positioned the urn and framed photograph in the antique cabinet while Lillian stood motionless before it.

"We'll keep vigil tonight," Rosalind said with gentle firmness. "Tomorrow you'll come stay at my family's estate."

Lillian's fingers twisted in her sweater. "I'd rather remain here."

"That's not an option." Rosalind's tone brooked no argument. "It's unsafe alone. My father and our housekeeper Beatrice will adore you. Now get some rest - midterms approach and you need sleep. I'll keep watch."

Lillian shook her head stubbornly. "I'm staying with Mother."

Without another word, Rosalind spread a thick quilt on the hardwood floor. "Then we'll keep vigil together."

They huddled beneath the blanket, warmth gradually seeping between them. Lillian pulled out her textbooks, determined to honor her mother's wishes by excelling in her studies.

Rosalind adjusted the lamp's glow, watching as Lillian's eyelids grew heavy. Within the hour, the girl had succumbed to exhaustion, her chemistry text slipping from slack fingers. Rosalind carefully removed the book and tucked the blanket snugly around her.

Gazing at Margaret's photograph, memories surfaced of happier times - Everett's booming laughter, Margaret's gentle teasing, Lillian's animated chatter during their shared meals.

Now their table would always have one empty chair.

The weight of loss pressed against Rosalind's ribs as exhaustion finally claimed her.

The creak of the front door startled her awake. "Who's there?"

A familiar silhouette filled the doorway - Everett had returned in the dead of night.

Rosalind's pulse leapt. "You came back."

Everett knelt before the urn, whispering a prayer. Then he crouched beside Rosalind, taking in the sight of the two most precious people left in his world.

Only in their presence did the storm within him still.

His thumb brushed the dark circles beneath Rosalind's swollen eyes. "I'm home," he murmured. "Rest now."
###Chapter 601

Rosalind studied Everett with inquisitive eyes. "Aren't you leaving tonight?"

Everett had just finished calming Genevieve and sneaking back home. His departure was inevitable, but not until morning. There were still precious hours remaining.

"Go back to sleep," Everett murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face. "I'll slip out after you're asleep."

Rosalind scooted over, patting the empty space beside her. "Then lie with me for now. It's cozy here."

Everett slid beneath the covers, settling beside her.

Her delicate frame molded against his, her dark curls spilling across his arm as luminous eyes peered up at him.

A surge of warmth flooded Everett's chest. He drew Rosalind closer, enveloping her in his embrace.

As they adjusted positions, Everett's gaze drifted to Lillian, peacefully asleep on the other side of the bed. She hadn't stirred all evening.

"When did Lily fall asleep?" Everett whispered.

"Around ten. She was cramming for midterms until then. Three days of exams start tomorrow morning. I'll take her to campus, so don't fret."

Rosalind's calm assurance soothed him, her capable hands managing all domestic matters.

Everett's lips curved slightly. The domestic scene reminded him of his parents' dynamic - Theodore handling external affairs while Margaret maintained their household. With Theodore always occupied, Margaret ensured everything ran smoothly.

But Rosalind owed him no such devotion.

Though circumstances prevented his full presence, Rosalind had steadfastly stood by him.

Everett studied her face, voice dropping to a husky whisper. "Rosalind, I—"

Her fingers gently pressed against his lips.

"Hush. I've had enough gratitude. Everything I do is by choice. Besides," her eyes sparkled with mischief, "Lily's brilliant. In ten years when she's wildly successful, I'll reap the rewards. Consider it an investment."

Everett tightened his embrace, bringing her flush against him. He pressed a kiss to her forehead. "You're right."

Suddenly, Rosalind began sniffing at his collar like an inquisitive puppy.

"What is it?" Everett chuckled.

"Mmm..." She inhaled deeply. "Everett, you smell like...perfume. Women's perfume!"

Rosalind's olfactory senses were razor-sharp, particularly when detecting rival scents.

Everett's pulse spiked. Having spent the day with Genevieve, her fragrance undoubtedly lingered. Rosalind remained unaware of his impending marriage plans.

She tilted her chin up, eyes playful yet probing. "Confess, Everett! Whose scent is this?"

Everett hesitated, then drew breath to explain. "Actually—"

"It's Genevieve's, isn't it?" Rosalind interrupted, lips pursing. "I knew you'd been with her!"

Her crimson mouth formed a petulant pout. "I don't understand why you're still seeing her. The rumor mill says you're marrying her. I won't allow it."

Everett froze, words dying in his throat. "If I were to wed Genevieve—"

"I'd leave you!" Rosalind's declaration sliced through the air like a blade.

Everett stiffened. The confession lodged in his throat. He couldn't voice it - couldn't risk Rosalind actually walking away.

With that ominous figure looming on the horizon and his future uncertain, he possessed no promises to give.
###Chapter 602

Everett knew this was selfishness at its worst. He had nothing to offer Rosalind, yet his arms tightened around her slender frame, terrified of losing the warmth she brought to his life.

Rosalind lifted her delicate hands, encircling his neck with surprising strength. "You belong to me! Do you understand?"

Her declaration sent electric currents through his body. That possessive claim came straight from her soul.

Everett cradled the back of her head, his lips meeting hers in a fleeting, tender kiss. The brief contact left them both breathless, the sweetness lingering between them.

Rosalind nestled against his chest, completely at peace in his embrace.

"Sleep now," Everett murmured, stroking her hair.

Her eyelids fluttered shut as exhaustion claimed her. When dawn broke, she awoke to find his side of the bed cold and empty.

The first day of Lillian's midterms arrived. Rosalind escorted the nervous girl to the examination hall, offering last-minute encouragement. The tests proceeded without incident, and when Lillian calculated her potential scores that evening, the results were nearly flawless.

Everett had been the state's top science student during his university entrance exams. Lillian clearly shared her brother's brilliant mind. Rosalind had no doubts the young woman would achieve similar academic greatness.

The following morning, Rosalind waited outside the exam center after dropping Lillian off. The peaceful moment shattered when a gleaming sports car screeched to a halt nearby. Julian Blackwood emerged, his trademark smirk in place.

"Still playing babysitter?" he taunted, sauntering toward her.

Rosalind kept her expression neutral. "I'm supporting Lillian. This is an examination zone - lower your voice and leave. You're not permitted here."

Julian's smirk widened at her frosty reception. "How touching. You're so devoted to Everett's little sister. Tell me, do you know what your precious Everett is doing right now? You're such a naive fool."

This wasn't Julian's first attempt to provoke her. Rosalind barely glanced up. "Let me guess - the casino again? Message received. Now leave."

A cruel laugh escaped Julian's lips. "Wrong. Wouldn't you like to know his real whereabouts? What he's actually doing this very moment?"

Rosalind's gaze sharpened. "Whatever nonsense you're peddling, I'm not interested. Go away."

Julian's eyes gleamed with malicious delight. "Not even curious about Everett's big day?"

"A big day?" Rosalind's brows knitted together. "What are you talking about?"

"Today," Julian announced with theatrical flourish, "Everett is marrying Genevieve!"

The words struck like a physical blow. Rosalind shot to her feet, blood draining from her face. "That's impossible! He would never marry her. This is another one of your lies!"

She turned to leave, but Julian blocked her path. "The ceremony's happening right now. Don't believe me? Come see for yourself."

Rosalind recoiled. "No! I won't go!"

"Rosalind..." Julian's voice took on a mocking singsong quality.

"Stop! I don't want to hear another word!" She pressed her hands over her ears.

Julian's laughter turned cruel. "Look at you - trembling like a frightened rabbit. You're scared, aren't you? Terrified it might be true!"

Before she could react, Julian seized her wrist in a vice-like grip. "Running won't change anything. The more you resist, the more determined I am to make you witness this. You're coming with me!"
###Chapter 603

Julian's grip was ironclad as he dragged Rosalind toward the opulent Silver Pines Hotel.

Rosalind twisted her wrist, her voice sharp. "Release me! I don't care where you're taking me—I won't go!"

Julian's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "What exactly are you afraid of?"

She met his gaze steadily. "I'm not afraid. I trust Everett. When you love someone, you believe in them. I know he wouldn't betray me."

"You're naive," Julian sneered. "He's exploiting your trust. Playing you for a fool while he strings another woman along. He's nothing but a manipulative bastard!"

"Shut your mouth!" Rosalind snapped, her eyes blazing. "Don't you dare insult him! He's mine, and I won't let you disgrace him!"

"Yours?" Julian's gaze darkened as he scrutinized her. "What does that mean? Have you already slept with him?"

Rosalind glared. "That's none of your business!"

She yanked her arm, but Julian's fingers tightened like a vise. His eyes burned with intensity. "Answer me—have you?"

"Yes," she spat. "Happy now?"

Julian's free hand clenched into a fist at his side. "You're not even married! Do you have no self-respect?"

Rosalind let out a bitter laugh. "What century are you living in? Everett is my boyfriend. What's wrong with two people in love being intimate?"

Julian faltered. "You—"

"And who are you to judge? You and Arabella aren't married either, yet you've slept together. If I'm 'self-destructive,' then what does that make you?"

Her words struck like a whip, leaving him speechless.

Yes, he had been with Arabella—and regretted it. But hearing Rosalind confirm her relationship with Everett ignited a fire of jealousy inside him. The urge to erase Everett from existence clawed at his chest.

"Let me go! I'm leaving!" Rosalind struggled again.

Julian ignored her protests, hauling her forward.

"You're hurting me!" she cried.

He pulled her toward the grand ballroom entrance. "Open your eyes and see for yourself—Everett is right there."

Rosalind looked up—and froze.

There, standing tall and striking amidst the glittering crowd, was Everett.

The wedding reception was in full swing, guests mingling with champagne flutes in hand. Everett wore a tailored black suit, his presence commanding as he stood beside Genevieve, who shimmered in an ivory wedding gown.

They were deep in conversation with a group of businessmen, led by Reginald Blackwood.

One of the men clapped Reginald on the shoulder. "Congratulations on your daughter's marriage! You've found an exceptional son-in-law."

"Everett is truly remarkable," another added. "He and Genevieve make a perfect match."

"You're lucky—with his skills, your empire is in good hands."

Genevieve gazed at Everett with adoration, and he returned her look with a tenderness that made Rosalind's stomach twist.

The scene before her shattered something inside her chest.
###Chapter 604

Rosalind stood frozen, her breath catching in her throat. The scene before her seemed impossible. Everett was actually marrying Genevieve!

This couldn't be happening.

Julian's mocking voice cut through her shock. "Still don't believe me? That's Everett Sinclair and Genevieve Blackwood's wedding ceremony!"

Rosalind took an involuntary step backward, shaking her head in denial.

Inside the grand hall, the master of ceremonies stepped onto the stage. "Distinguished guests, we sincerely thank you for joining us today to witness the union of Mr. Sinclair and Ms. Blackwood. Without further ado, let the ceremony commence. Please welcome our bride and groom."

The lights dimmed dramatically as the familiar strains of the wedding march filled the air. Genevieve, her arm linked with Everett's, began her graceful procession down the aisle. They reached the altar together, bathed in soft golden light.

The officiant turned to Genevieve first. "Ms. Blackwood, do you take Mr. Sinclair to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?"

Genevieve's cheeks flushed pink as she answered, "I do."

Then the officiant addressed Everett. "Mr. Sinclair, do you take Ms. Blackwood to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?"

Rosalind felt her heart shatter into a million pieces, each shard cutting deeper than the last. Never in her wildest nightmares had she imagined Everett would actually go through with marrying Genevieve.

He was really doing this.

Julian's cold laughter echoed beside her. "See for yourself now? Convinced? While you've been caring for his blind mother and sick sister, he's been planning this elaborate wedding with another woman. He's played you for a fool!"

Was Everett truly a deceiver? Was this wedding real? Rosalind couldn't accept it. With trembling fingers, she pulled out her phone - she needed to hear his voice, needed him to explain.

Julian scoffed. "Why can't you just accept the truth? Why cling to this fantasy?"

"This is between Everett and me!" Rosalind snapped, her voice sharper than she intended. "Stay out of it!"

Julian's fist clenched at his side, a sharp pain lancing through his chest. For the first time, he truly understood - Rosalind's heart belonged completely to Everett Sinclair.

She was utterly, irrevocably in love with him.

Rosalind dialed Everett's number with shaking fingers.

Inside the venue, just as the officiant turned to Everett for his vows, his phone vibrated insistently in his pocket. Pulling it out discreetly, he saw Rosalind's name flashing on the screen.

Rosalind was calling him.

Genevieve's grip on his arm tightened. "We're in the middle of our vows. Don't you dare answer that."

Everett stared at the phone, torn.

"Who is it?" Genevieve demanded, her voice barely above a whisper but laced with steel.

Instead of answering, Everett pressed the answer button.

Outside the grand doors, Rosalind watched through the glass as Everett raised the phone to his ear. Her grip on her own phone turned white-knuckled as she demanded, "Everett, where are you right now?"

Her pulse pounded so loudly she could hear it in her ears. She prayed desperately for honesty, for some explanation that would make sense of this nightmare. She needed the truth, no matter how painful.

She shouldn't have to stand here like some pathetic outsider. True love was built on trust and transparency, wasn't it?

Everett's lips pressed into a thin line at her question. Of all times for Rosalind to call... He hesitated for several heartbeats before answering, "I'm... occupied at the moment. Is this urgent?"
###Chapter 605
Everett chose deception.

Rosalind's tears spilled over instantly, her heart plummeting with crushing disappointment. After everything, how could he still lie to her?

Why?

She bit back a sob.

Everett heard her muffled cries clearly, his chest constricting. "What's wrong? Are you crying? Did something happen?"

All eyes in the grand cathedral were fixed on Everett and Genevieve, the golden couple at the center of this lavish wedding. Yet now, standing before the archbishop, Everett had frozen mid-ceremony to take a call. The murmurs among the elite guests grew louder.

Genevieve stepped closer, gripping his sleeve with manicured fingers. "Everyone's waiting," she hissed. "Whatever it is can wait until after our vows."

Outside the cathedral doors, Rosalind stood trembling, her voice breaking. "What could possibly be so important? Are you busy marrying Genevieve Blackwood?"

Everett's breath caught. "You know? Who told you—"

"I'm standing right outside!"

What?

Everett's head snapped up. There, framed in the arched doorway, stood Rosalind. Their gazes locked across the sea of confused guests, her tear-filled eyes piercing his soul.

Time froze.

Never in his wildest dreams had Everett imagined Rosalind would appear at his wedding. He'd carefully orchestrated this charade, intending to explain everything once it was over. One more day, and the dangerous game would be complete.

Yet here she stood—his undoing.

Rosalind's voice shook. "Tell me why you're doing this. Give me one believable reason, and I'll walk away."

Everett faltered. "I...I can't—"

Just then, Reginald Blackwood rose from the front row, his expression thunderous. "Everett! The ceremony!"

A black-suited man rushed in, whispering urgently: "Mr. Sinclair, he's arrived!"

The mysterious benefactor—here at last!

Reginald's eyes gleamed with triumph. "Our honored guest awaits. Finish this farce quickly."

Everett's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. He couldn't reveal the deadly stakes—not with so many lives at risk. Rosalind had to leave. Now.

"Go home," he ordered hoarsely.

"And what about you?" Rosalind's voice shattered between sobs. "Come with me! I can't watch you marry her. If you go through with this, I swear—"

Everett's heart tore in two. How he longed to sprout wings and sweep her away from this nightmare.

But one misstep now would destroy them both. Years of careful planning balanced on this razor's edge.

He couldn't.

Everett's voice dropped to a tortured whisper. "Stop crying, darling. I'll find you when this is over."

"No! It's now or never!" This was her final stand. That night, she'd sworn if he married another, she'd vanish forever.

Rosalind loved fiercely, wholly—but she refused to share her heart with lies and other women.

Everett's jaw clenched. "I'm sorry. I can't leave."

The line went dead.

Genevieve exhaled shakily, having recognized Rosalind's voice. For one terrifying moment, she'd thought Everett might actually abandon her at the altar.

But he'd stayed.
###Chapter 606

A triumphant smile played across Rosalind's lips as she stood beside Everett at the altar once more.

The minister turned to Everett with solemn dignity. "Mr. Sinclair, do you take Ms. Blackwood to be your lawfully wedded wife, to cherish through all circumstances life may bring, until death parts you?"

Everett's response came without hesitation. "I do."

Each word struck Genevieve like physical blows. The world seemed to dissolve around her, leaving only the echo of those two devastating syllables.

Julian's cruel whisper cut through her daze. "Open your eyes, Rosalind. He's marrying Genevieve. You were always just a delusional fool chasing after someone who never cared. All that devotion wasted on empty promises."

Tears streamed down Genevieve's face as the minister continued, "By the authority vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may exchange rings."

A young attendant presented two platinum bands glittering with diamonds. Genevieve carefully slid the ring onto Everett's finger, her hands trembling slightly. Everett mirrored the action with mechanical precision.

Reginald initiated the applause, prompting cheers from the gathered guests.

"A lifetime of joy to the happy couple!"

"May heaven bless this union!"

Genevieve felt euphoric as she threw her arms around Everett in their first embrace as husband and wife.

Outside the chapel, Rosalind watched the intimate moment through blurred vision. Something inside her fractured irreparably. Turning mechanically, she walked away from the scene without looking back.

She was done.

Julian matched her stride. "Finally accepting reality? He's married now. Time to move on. I may have betrayed you with Arabella, but people change. Now that Everett's out of the picture, give me another chance. I'll treat you right."

Rosalind's knees buckled suddenly, her consciousness slipping away before she hit the ground.

Julian caught her limp form. "Rosalind! What's wrong?"

Meanwhile, Everett and Genevieve emerged from the ceremony.

Reginald clapped Everett on the shoulder. "Welcome to the family, son. I expect you'll take excellent care of my daughter."

Everett forced a tight smile. "Of course, Mr. Blackwood."

Genevieve giggled. "He's your father-in-law now, darling. You should call him Reginald."

"Reginald," Everett corrected stiffly.

The older man nodded approvingly. "Excellent. Now, shall we proceed to your other request?"

Everett's pulse quickened. "The meeting with Shadow?"

Reginald gestured toward a secluded cabin. "Follow me."

He led Everett to the hidden structure and knocked in a distinct pattern. "Shadow, it's me."

At the name, Everett's blood surged with anticipation.

The door opened to reveal two armed guards. "Mr. Blackwood. And this must be your new son-in-law."

"Indeed. This is Everett Sinclair. He's here to meet Shadow."

"Standard procedure first." The guards began patting them down thoroughly before nodding. "Clean. Proceed inside."

The dim interior revealed several more armed men standing at attention.

In the center sat Shadow - his face marked by a jagged scar that lent him a terrifying presence.
###Chapter 607

Everett Sinclair gave a respectful bow to Shadow. "Good evening, Shadow. It's a pleasure to meet you. This is the man I told you about—my son-in-law, Nathaniel Whitmore."

Nathaniel met Shadow's gaze steadily, his expression unreadable. "Shadow."

Shadow's piercing eyes swept over Nathaniel, cold and assessing. "So you're Reginald's son-in-law?"

Nathaniel inclined his head. "That's correct."

Shadow studied him for a long moment before a flicker of recognition crossed his sharp features. "I could swear I've seen you before. Have we met?"

Reginald chuckled, though his grip tightened slightly on his cane. "Surely not. Nathaniel wouldn't have crossed paths with someone like you. Perhaps he resembles someone you know?"

Shadow's lips curled into a humorless smile. "He looks exactly like an undercover narcotics officer I once knew."

At the mention of the officer, Reginald's face darkened. "You mean the one who infiltrated your operation?"

"Yes, that man." Shadow's voice turned icy. "He was sharp, relentless. Earned my trust, saved my life—only to betray me in the end."

His fingers traced the jagged scar running down his cheek, his expression twisting with bitter amusement.

"I had him cornered in the end. Took ten schoolchildren hostage, knowing he'd come for them. Watched as he walked right into the trap." Shadow's laugh was dark. "Burned him alive. Made sure the world remembered him as a drug lord, not some hero."

Nathaniel's hands clenched at his sides, his nails digging into his palms.

Shadow was talking about his father.

Theodore Sinclair had died a hero, but the world only remembered him as a criminal. Nathaniel had spent his life carrying that shame, that injustice.

Now, standing before the man responsible, he felt the weight of vengeance settle over him.

Reginald cleared his throat, forcing a smile. "That's all in the past. The man is dead."

Shadow's gaze lingered on Nathaniel. "You have his eyes."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Do I?"

"Same fire. Same determination." Shadow's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "It's uncanny."

Nathaniel smirked. "But I'm not him."

Reginald clapped a hand on Nathaniel's shoulder. "Exactly. Nathaniel is my successor. I trust him with everything."

Shadow opened his mouth to respond—

Then, sirens wailed in the distance.

Two guards burst in, panic etched across their faces. "Police! They're surrounding the building!"

Shadow shot to his feet, his expression twisting with fury. "How? No one knew I was here!" His gaze snapped to Reginald and Nathaniel. "You."

His voice was deadly.

"You betrayed me."
###Chapter 608
My Father, Please Come 608

Everett shook his head vehemently, his expression one of wounded loyalty. "It's not me! I've been by your side for years—how could I betray you to the police?"

Shadow's piercing gaze shifted like a blade. "If not you, then it must be you." His finger jabbed toward Dominic.

Dominic didn't flinch. His eyes, cold and unyielding, locked onto Shadow's. Without a word, he reached behind his neck and retrieved a concealed tracker and wire.

"Correct. It was me." His voice was steel. "Every word you just said was transmitted directly to the authorities. The stain of 'drug lord' on my father's name—I'm here to erase it. What he never got to say, I'll declare to the world: He was an undercover narcotics officer."

Everett staggered back as if struck. "Y-Your father was—"

Shadow's face twisted with recognition. "I knew those eyes... They're his. You're his son."

Dominic didn't blink. "Yes. He was my father."

Everett's hands trembled. "So it was all a lie! You never intended to marry my daughter—you used me to get close to Shadow!"

The realization crashed over him. Every moment, every word—Dominic's entire presence had been a meticulously crafted trap.

Outside, tires screeched. A fleet of police vehicles surrounded the building, officers swarming with weapons drawn. At the forefront stood Lawrence, the grizzled detective, megaphone in hand.

"Shadow! Everett! You're surrounded!" His voice boomed. "Surrender now, or face the full force of the law!"

One of Shadow's men burst in, panic etched across his face. "Boss! We're trapped!"

Shadow's glare could have frozen hell. "You little rat," he spat at Dominic. "Never thought I'd be outplayed by you. But I don't surrender." He turned to his men. "We fight our way out."

Chaos erupted.

Lawrence grabbed Dominic's arm, yanking him toward an exit. "Kid, move! This place is a death trap!"

Dominic's gaze stayed fixed on Shadow, who was carving a brutal path through the officers with a submachine gun.

"I'm not leaving," Dominic said flatly. "My father let him slip once. Not again."

"Your father and I were partners," Lawrence growled. "I failed him then—I won't fail you now. Move!"

But Dominic wrenched free and charged straight at Shadow, blocking his escape. "You're going nowhere."

Shadow's smile was lethal. "Then you'll die here."

Their clash was brutal. Dominic fought with precision, but Shadow was a seasoned killer. Blows landed, blood sprayed—neither gave ground.

With Shadow distracted, his men fell one by one. Everett crumpled to his knees, hands raised. "It's over! They've got us!"

Dominic seized the opening, lunging to tackle Shadow—

—only for Shadow to twist, a knife flashing in his hand. The blade sank deep into Dominic's side.

Lawrence moved like lightning, slamming Shadow against the wall. Cold metal clicked around his wrists. "Game over."

He turned to Dominic, voice tight. "You cleared your father's name. But you're bleeding out. Hospital. Now."

Dominic shoved him off, jaw set. "Later. There's someone I need to find first."

The bloodstain on his shirt spread like ink.


###Chapter 609

Everett Sinclair staggered forward, blood dripping from his wound onto the pavement. Lawrence grabbed his arm firmly.

"You're bleeding out, kid! That stab wound needs medical attention now!"

Everett shook his head violently. "Can't stop. Not yet."

With sudden determination, he broke free and sprinted down the street.

"Everett!" Lawrence shouted after him, but the young man had already disappeared around the corner.

That stubborn boy would be the death of him one day.

Everett's first thought was the examination hall. His little sister Lillian should be finishing her exams today. With everything that had happened between him and Rosalind, who would be there for her?

When he arrived, the gates stood empty. The three-day examination period had concluded.

A proctor noticed his frantic appearance. "Looking for someone, young man?"

"Is the exam over?" Everett panted.

"Finished an hour ago. All students have been collected by their families."

"Lillian Sinclair - was she picked up?"

Two girls in school uniforms approached, recognizing him immediately. "Mr. Sinclair!"

They were Lillian's classmates. Everett had visited campus before, and his striking features made him memorable.

"Have you seen my sister?"

The taller girl nodded. "Miss Fairchild came for her."

Everett's stomach clenched. "Rosalind?"

"Yes! She was here every day during exams," the other girl chimed in. "We just saw them leave in a black Bentley. Lillian looked really happy!"

So Rosalind had kept her promise.

Despite walking out on their wedding. Despite her angry words. Despite everything - she'd still come for Lillian.

That realization sent warmth flooding through Everett's chest. "Thank you."

He hailed the first available taxi. "Whitmore Estate. Fast."

Thirty minutes later, the cab pulled up to the wrought iron gates. Everett moved painfully toward the entrance.

Through the bars, he saw them. Rosalind stood on the manicured lawn with Lillian, Alistair Whitmore beside them.

Rosalind had her arm draped protectively around Lillian's shoulders. "So? Now that it's over, how do you feel?"

Alistair chuckled. "Based on her mock results, I'd say we're looking at a state topper. The essay portion might be subjective, but the rest?" He winked at Lillian.

A proud smile curved Rosalind's lips as she tousled Lillian's hair. "You crushed it, little genius."

Then she turned to Alistair. "Father, remember how you always wanted another daughter? Why not make it official? I'd love having Lillian as my sister."

Lillian stiffened. "Oh no, I couldn't! You've already done so much letting me stay here. Once high school starts, I can board at campus. I've calculated everything - math competition prizes will cover my tuition. I'll be fine."

The girl's humility broke Everett's heart. She still didn't believe she belonged.

Rosalind's expression softened. "Sweetheart, I know you're brilliant enough to support yourself. But wouldn't it be nicer having a sister to spoil you? A godfather to open doors? A real home?"

Alistair beamed. "Consider it done! Even without Rosalind's suggestion, I'd planned to make this official. Talent like yours is rare. If we couldn't keep your brother, we're certainly keeping you!" He clapped his hands decisively. "Next week, we'll host a gala to announce your place in the Whitmore family!"
###Chapter 610

Rosalind's silver-blue eyes shimmered with unshed tears. Since Lillian's passing, she had never allowed herself to hope for a family again.

Yet here she stood—with a sister and a father.

It was more than she had ever dared to wish for.

"Everett..."

Everett tenderly brushed the tears from Rosalind's cheeks. "From this moment on, I'm your sister. Welcome to the Whitmore family. I'll protect you, and when you're older and stronger, you'll protect me too, won't you? We're family now."

Rosalind nodded, her voice thick with emotion. "Yes... family."

Alistair lingered by the gates, watching the scene unfold. His vision blurred—he hadn't anticipated Everett would formally bring his sister into the Whitmore fold.

Two maidservants passed by, whispering. "Lillian is so fortunate! To have crossed paths with Ms. Rosalind and now be embraced by the Whitmores... it's like destiny itself has rewritten her story." "For a girl like her, the Whitmore name is the greatest blessing life could offer." "We mustn't call her Lillian anymore. From now on, she's Ms. Madeline."

Their voices faded as they walked away.

Alistair's throat tightened. His gaze remained fixed on Rosalind—the woman who had stormed into his life like a tempest, reshaping everything in her wake.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed her number.

He needed to hear her voice.

There were so many things left unsaid—about Theodore, about Genevieve, about all the secrets he had buried deep within himself. Words he had choked back before, he would speak now.

He was ready to lay himself bare, to let her see the truth of his heart.

He needed to tell her it was over.

That from this day forward, he belonged to her—and only her.

And above all, he needed to say the words burning in his chest: I love you. More than life itself.

Inside, Rosalind was laughing with Madeline when her phone buzzed. Alistair's name flashed across the screen.

Her pulse stuttered. He was calling her.

Memories of his wedding to Genevieve surged forward—his refusal, her desperate plea for him to walk away with her, and his silence. Now, after all this time, he dared to call?

She had given him his chance. He had thrown it away.

Hand trembling, she swiped to decline the call.

But within seconds, her phone lit up again. Alistair.

Madeline glanced at her. "Aren't you going to answer? Who is it? Is it Alistair? I haven't seen him in ages. He's been so busy lately."

Rosalind's resolve wavered. No matter how much she despised Alistair, he was still Madeline's brother. He had the right to know his sister was safe.

Reluctantly, she accepted the call.

"Rosalind."

Her name on his lips sent a traitorous shiver down her spine.

She hated him. She loathed him.

Yet the moment she heard his voice, her heart betrayed her.

"Madeline is with me. She's safe. Was there anything else?"

"I need to speak with you."

"I have nothing left to say to you."

"Then come outside. I'm standing at your gates."
###Chapter 611
Rosalind froze in shock.

Everett was standing right outside her apartment? What was he doing here?

"You need to leave. You're married now. To Genevieve. I don't involve myself with taken men. That's non-negotiable."

"The marriage isn't what it seems."

Rosalind's pulse quickened. What did he mean? If not what she thought, then what?

"Just give me five minutes to explain. Let's try again, please?" Everett's voice was soft, pleading.

Her fingers tightened around her phone. A flicker of hope stirred within her. Was there more to his sudden wedding with Genevieve? It had never made sense—why would Everett marry her out of nowhere?

She still loved him. But the confusion was unbearable.

"Fine," she relented. "I'm coming out."

She ended the call and moved toward the door.

Outside, Everett's expression brightened. Finally, he could make her understand. Everything would be okay again.

Then—tires screeched.

A black SUV swerved toward him. Two armed men in tactical gear leapt out, seizing him.

Everett snarled. "Who sent you?"

"Your grave did."

He struggled—but agony ripped through his side. Blood bloomed across his shirt.

They dragged him into the vehicle.

Through the tinted window, he saw Rosalind step outside. His heart lurched. He slammed his palms against the glass. "Rosalind! Look at me!"

A blade plunged into his chest.

Crimson dripped from his lips as he gasped her name. "Rosalind... please..."

"Move it!" a guard barked.

The SUV peeled away, leaving Rosalind oblivious on the sidewalk.

She scanned the empty street. Where was he? He'd just called—

"Waiting for someone?"

She spun. Julian stood there, smirking. Not Everett.

Disappointment flashed across her face. "Why are you here?"

"Can't I visit my favorite girl?" He stepped closer, catching her hand. "Or were you hoping for a married man?"

She yanked free. "Stop it."

"Face it, Rosalind. Everett's gone. But I'm here. And I'm not giving up." His gaze burned into hers.

She turned away. "I don't love you. Not now. Not ever."

His smile vanished. Fists clenched.

If she still wanted Everett... then Everett would disappear. Permanently.

The SUV halted at a cliff's edge. The guards hauled out a bloodied figure.

Julian approached slowly, a cold smile twisting his lips.
###Chapter 612

"We've brought Everett as you requested."

Julian strode toward the van with calculated steps. Inside, Everett slumped against the seat, his body a canvas of crimson.

The gaping wound in his abdomen had bled relentlessly. Now, his heart had been pierced as well. The dark fabric of his shirt was saturated, clinging to his skin with the weight of his life seeping away.

Everett's face was ghostly pale, his eyes glazed with pain. When his gaze landed on Julian, his lips barely moved as he whispered, "You...?"

"Indeed, it's me," Julian sneered. "Don't blame me for this. You brought this upon yourself. Look at you—pathetic. You were never worthy of Rosalind. She belongs to me. Only me."

A bitter smile tugged at Everett's bloodied lips. "Rosalind... will never... love you."

Julian's expression darkened. "She only loves you for your face. What if that face were gone? What if you were nothing but a grotesque monster? Do you think she'd still look at you then?"

One of the bodyguards stepped forward, handing Julian a small vial of acid. "Be cautious, sir. This will burn through skin on contact."

Julian uncapped the vial without hesitation. With deliberate cruelty, he tilted it over Everett's face.

The liquid seared into flesh.

Everett's scream tore through the air, raw and agonizing, as his features melted into a ruin of blood and ruined tissue.

Julian watched, satisfaction coiling in his chest.

Back in university, Everett had dared to rival him for the title of campus heartthrob. Now, he had the audacity to steal Rosalind? A nobody like him, thinking he could compete with Julian Blackwood? The thought was laughable.

"Clean your hands, sir," the bodyguard murmured, offering a handkerchief.

Julian took it, wiping his fingers with slow, deliberate strokes. His gaze never left Everett's ruined face. "Just die quietly. Don't worry—Rosalind will forget you soon enough. I'll make sure of it. I'll love her the way you never could."

Everett's bloodshot eyes burned with defiance. He tried to drag himself forward, his body trembling with the effort.

But he was too weak. Too broken.

Julian turned to the bodyguards. "Push the van off the cliff. I want him erased. Understood?"

The men nodded. "Consider it done."

They slammed the doors shut, revved the engine, and sent the van hurtling toward the cliff's edge.

The crash echoed through the ravine as metal met rock below.

Julian tossed the handkerchief aside, watching it flutter to the ground. Finally, Everett Sinclair was gone. Soon, Rosalind would have no choice but to accept him.

Rosalind sat in her room, a book open in her lap, when a sudden, searing pain lanced through her chest.

It felt like a blade carving into her heart. A crushing, inexplicable loss gripped her, as if something vital had been torn away.

Lillian noticed immediately, rushing to her side. "Rosalind! What's wrong?"

Rosalind clutched her chest, breath ragged. "I don't know... It hurts. Like something's... missing."

"Your heart? I'll call a doctor!" Lillian turned to leave.

Rosalind grabbed her wrist, stopping her. "No. Don't."

Lillian froze, staring at her in shock. "Why...?"

Rosalind frowned. "What?"

Lillian's voice softened. "You're crying."

Crying?

Rosalind touched her cheeks. Her fingers came away wet. Tears she hadn't even realized were falling streaked her face, unstoppable.
###Chapter 613

Harrison remained in the Whitmore family estate, meticulously preparing the antidote, when the door creaked open.

A young maid entered hesitantly. "Mrs. Margaret requests your presence immediately."

Margaret wanted to see her?

Harrison didn't bother glancing up, her voice cool and detached. "I'm occupied."

The maid stiffened, clearly shocked by the refusal. "You—you can't refuse! Mrs. Margaret summoned you personally. This is unacceptable!"

A humorless laugh escaped Harrison's lips. The fact that even a servant dared to speak to her this way spoke volumes about how little the Whitmores respected her.

"Let me make something clear," Harrison said, finally lifting her gaze. "I was brought here to formulate an antidote. Your family sought me out—not the other way around. If she wants something, she can come to me herself."

The maid's face flushed with indignation. "Fine!"

With a huff, she stormed out, clearly furious.

Moments later, the maid burst into Margaret's chambers. The elderly woman turned eagerly. "Where is Harrison?"

"She refused to come!"

Margaret's brows knitted together. "What do you mean?"

"She was insufferable! Said if you needed her, you should go to her instead."

Margaret froze, shock rippling through her.

Her beloved Theodore lay in a hospital bed, declared vegetative by the finest specialists. Harrison was her only hope.

"Very well," Margaret muttered through gritted teeth. "I'll go to her."

She marched straight to Harrison's quarters.

"Harrison," Margaret began, forcing a polite tone.

Harrison glanced up, a smirk playing on her lips. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"

Margaret opened her mouth, but Harrison cut her off.

"Let me guess. Theodore's condition has worsened. The doctors have given up. And now, you've come crawling to me."

Margaret's breath hitched. Harrison's sharp, perceptive gaze gleamed with intelligence—almost unnervingly so.

In that moment, Margaret understood why men like Nathaniel were so captivated by her.

She swallowed hard. "Theodore hasn't regained consciousness. The physicians say he never will. He's... vegetative."

Harrison's lashes lowered slightly. She had been prepared to treat Theodore earlier, but Victoria had intervened. Even then, seeing him drenched in blood had told her everything.

Margaret stepped closer, desperation bleeding into her voice. "You're the renowned Dr. Sinclair! You can save him, can't you? You can wake him."

A slow, knowing smile curved Harrison's lips. "Yes. I can."

Relief flooded Margaret's features. She seized Harrison's wrist. "Then come with me now! Please—save my son!"

Harrison yanked her arm free, her expression turning glacial.

"I can save him," she said softly. "But why should I?"

Margaret recoiled. "What—"

"I need a reason to heal someone. Theodore means nothing to me. Why would I lift a finger for him?" Harrison's voice dripped with mocking amusement.

Margaret scrambled for leverage. "Theodore is your uncle! If Benjamin were alive, he would beg you to help!"

At the mention of her father, Harrison's eyes turned to ice.

The audacity.

Did Margaret truly believe she had forgotten how Benjamin died—and who had orchestrated it?
###Chapter 614

Harrison clenched her pale fingers briefly before releasing them.

"Alright, I'll save Theodore."

Margaret's face lit up with relief. Moments ago, she had feared Harrison would refuse—yet here she was, agreeing.

"Wonderful! I'll arrange the car immediately. We'll head to the hospital now!"

Harrison didn't truly wish to save Theodore, but she had no choice.

Something about his condition felt off. A nagging suspicion told her there was a buried secret between Theodore and Victoria—one someone was desperate to keep hidden.

Only by waking Theodore could she uncover it.

The Whitmore family was a web of deceit, and she intended to unravel every thread.

Soon, Harrison and Margaret arrived at the hospital. Victoria had been playing the devoted wife, stationed at Theodore's bedside day and night.

When she spotted them entering, her expression froze. "What are you doing here?"

Margaret spoke first. "I brought her."

Victoria turned sharply. "Why would you do that?"

Margaret's gaze fell on Theodore's motionless form. "I asked her to treat him."

What?!

Victoria's eyes widened in shock. "No, you can't!"

"Why not?" Harrison countered, her voice steady but edged with steel.

Victoria faltered. "I—"

Harrison stepped forward, her smile sweet but her words razor-sharp. "I heard Theodore took a fall and ended up like this. As his wife, shouldn't you want him to wake up? I'm Dr. Sinclair—the miracle doctor. Mrs. Margaret asked me to help your husband, yet you're standing in my way. That's... odd, don't you think?"

Her scrutinizing gaze pinned Victoria in place.

Victoria stood rigid, speechless.

Margaret's eyes narrowed with sudden suspicion. "She's right. What's your game? Don't you want Theodore to recover? Or is there something you're hiding?"

Fury simmered beneath Victoria's skin. Why did Harrison always ruin everything?

She forced a wounded expression. "How could you say that? I've given everything for Theodore. How dare you doubt me?"

Margaret had never questioned Victoria's devotion before—everyone knew she was obsessed with Theodore.

"You shouldn't trust her," Victoria pressed, voice trembling. "Think about it—Harrison hates us. She wants us destroyed. Why would she help? What if she uses this chance to hurt him? I'd rather care for him forever than risk her harming him further."

Her words were persuasive, dripping with false concern, and Margaret hesitated.

Harrison watched, her suspicion deepening. "Well, then hire someone you trust—or trust the one you've hired. If you don't want me here, I'll leave."

She turned to go, and Victoria's lips curled in triumph.

But then—

"Harrison, wait!" Margaret commanded.

Victoria stiffened.

Harrison paused, glancing back.

Margaret's voice was firm, her decision made. "Theodore is already like this. No one else can save him but you. I have no choice but to trust you—because I need him awake. Please. Treat him."
###Chapter 615

Margaret stood resolute in her decision, demanding that Harrison take charge of Theodore's treatment.

Victoria's expression froze. "Mother, are you certain about this? You can't possibly trust Harrison with Theodore's life. What if—"

Harrison cut her off with a sly smirk. "Why so defensive? If you keep interfering, I might start wondering what you're trying to hide."

Margaret's eyes turned icy as she glared at Victoria. "My decision is final. Step aside!"

Her tone left no room for argument. Victoria had no choice but to retreat.

A heavy weight settled in Victoria's chest as she stood there, powerless. She could protest all she wanted, but pushing further would only deepen Margaret's suspicions—risking everything.

With a defeated exhale, she moved away.

Harrison approached the bed where Theodore lay motionless. In her memory, he had always been a doting father, his world revolving around his daughter, Isabella.

Now, he was a shadow of himself—pale, lifeless, the vitality drained from him.

Harrison placed her fingers lightly on his wrist, beginning her examination.

Margaret hovered anxiously. "Well? Can you save him?"

Harrison nodded. "He can be saved."

Victoria's stomach dropped, panic flickering in her eyes. Could Harrison actually heal Theodore?

"Then do it quickly," Margaret urged.

Harrison withdrew an acupuncture needle and carefully inserted it into Theodore's skull.

Theodore, who had been utterly still, suddenly convulsed. His hands twitched violently, his entire body writhing in agony.

"Theodore!" Margaret cried out in alarm.

Victoria's pulse spiked, fear clawing at her throat. "What are you doing to him? Look at him—he's suffering! Stop this now!"

But Harrison didn’t stop. She selected another needle and drove it deeper.

This time, Theodore's reaction was even more severe. A gush of blood erupted from his mouth.

Splash!

Warm crimson splattered across Margaret and Victoria's faces.

Margaret screamed.

Theodore, after expelling the blood, collapsed back, utterly still. His face turned ghostly white. The heart monitor screeched—a single, unbroken tone.

Victoria's voice trembled. "His heart stopped!"

Margaret rushed forward, pressing her fingers beneath Theodore's nose. No breath.

"He's gone..." she whispered, disbelief hollowing her voice.

Victoria checked for a pulse. Nothing. A flicker of triumph sparked in her eyes. Harrison hadn’t saved Theodore—she had killed him.

This was better than Victoria could have hoped.

She cast one last glance at Theodore—the man she had loved desperately, yet who had never truly been hers. Once, her love had burned fiercely; now, only hatred remained. Death was the perfect resolution.

Drawing a sharp breath, she whirled on Harrison. "You murdered my husband! You're a killer!"

Margaret stared at Harrison, horrified. "You promised you could save him. Instead, you killed my son! Why would you do this?"

Victoria couldn’t suppress her glee.

"Don’t you see? Harrison never meant to save him!" she declared. "This was deliberate—revenge for Benjamin’s death! She took Theodore’s life as payback. We need to call the authorities—have her arrested!"

Her excitement was barely contained.

This unexpected twist was a double victory—ridding herself of both Theodore and Harrison in one decisive blow.
###Chapter 616

Though Victoria was secretly amused, she cried out, "Help! Someone, please!"

Harrison lifted her gaze, her piercing eyes locking onto Victoria's face. A knowing smirk played on her lips.

"What are you smiling about?" Victoria snapped, her voice trembling with forced outrage. "You murdered my husband, and now you dare to smirk?"

Unease prickled at Victoria's skin—Harrison's expression was unsettling.

Harrison's voice remained eerily calm. "Are you absolutely certain Theodore is dead?"

Victoria froze. "What kind of question is that? He isn't breathing. Of course he's dead."

Harrison tilted her head slightly. "Why don't you check again?"

Hesitant, Victoria pressed her fingers against Theodore's nose. Cold. No breath.

Just as she pulled back, ready to lash out at Harrison for toying with her, Theodore's eyes flew open.

Victoria shrieked, stumbling backward. "Ah—!"

In a flash, Theodore's hand shot out, clamping around her wrist.

A dead man—now alive—was gripping her.

Her heart hammered against her ribs as she wrenched free, crashing onto the floor. "Ghost! He's a ghost!"

Margaret rushed forward, tears of joy streaming down her face. "Theodore! You're alive!"

Victoria gaped, disbelief twisting her features. Theodore's chest rose and fell—deep, steady breaths. The heart monitor beeped rhythmically, confirming his pulse.

Alive.

Just moments ago, she had confirmed his death. No breath. No heartbeat.

How?

This was impossible.

Margaret turned to Harrison, awe softening her voice. "Is he truly alright now?"

Harrison rose gracefully. "Yes."

Victoria scrambled to her feet, her voice shaking. "What did you do to him?"

Harrison's lips curved into a faint, enigmatic smile. "I treated him. My methods involve death before revival. You wouldn't understand."

"You—you really are Dr. Sinclair," Margaret whispered, reverence in her tone.

Harrison had done it.

Theodore was awake.

Victoria stood paralyzed, panic clawing at her throat. What now?

Margaret leaned over Theodore, hope lighting her eyes. "Can you speak?"

Theodore's movements were sluggish, but his gaze sharpened—locking onto Victoria with blistering fury. His jaw clenched, his fingers curling into fists.

If he had the strength, he would have lunged.

Victoria's breath hitched. She took a step back.

Margaret frowned, glancing between them. "Why are you looking at Victoria like that?"

Theodore's glare never wavered. Rage burned in his eyes—raw, untamed.

Margaret's suspicion grew. "Did she hurt you? Tell me!"

Victoria's stomach dropped.

If Theodore spoke, Isabella's secret would be exposed.

They were out of time.
###Chapter 617

Theodore's lips parted as if attempting speech.

Only incoherent murmurs escaped his throat, unintelligible to everyone present.

"Why can't Theodore speak yet?" Margaret turned to Harrison, her voice quivering with concern.

Victoria, who had been tense, felt some relief wash over her. She'd feared Theodore might suddenly regain his voice and reveal everything, but apparently, he remained unable to form words.

Seizing the moment, she rushed forward and grasped Theodore's hand.

"Darling, what is it? Do you need to tell me something? I'm right here. You can speak to me."

Harrison studied Theodore with a solemn expression. "I've already used acupuncture to revive him, but his speech hasn't returned yet. Recovery will take time."

Margaret could only offer reassurance. "Theodore, don't push yourself too hard. You'll regain your strength gradually, I'm certain."

Theodore's bloodshot eyes remained locked on Victoria, burning with silent fury, yet his lips remained sealed.

At that moment, the maid hurried into the room, breathless with excitement. "Mrs. Margaret, wonderful news!"

Margaret looked up. "What is it?"

The maid beamed. "Ms. Isabella has awakened!"

What? Isabella was awake?

Victoria's face brightened instantly. "Really? She's conscious? That's marvelous!"

Margaret also exhaled in relief. After all, Isabella was the daughter of the world's wealthiest man. Her well-being was crucial to the Whitmore family's power and prestige. "Prepare the car immediately! I must see Isabella at once!"

Harrison frowned. She hadn't yet finished the antidote, yet Isabella had woken up on her own.

How... interesting.

In the bedroom, Isabella was already sitting up in bed. Though pale, her gaze was sharp and alert.

Henry, ever attentive, hovered by her side. "How are you feeling?"

Despite her pallor, Isabella radiated confidence. Now that she was the heiress to unimaginable wealth, she held all the cards. She leaned into Henry and pouted. "Daddy, I'm still a little dizzy."

"Should I call the doctor?"

"No. Just having you here is enough."

Just then, Harrison, Margaret, and Victoria entered.

Victoria rushed forward, relief evident in her voice. "Isabella, you're awake! How did you get poisoned? You terrified us!"

"We're so relieved," Margaret added warmly. "You're Mr. Lancaster's beloved daughter. Had anything happened to you, how could we ever face him?"

Isabella smirked, her lips curling with smug satisfaction.

Harrison observed her closely. Isabella appeared to have fully recovered from the poisoning.

"Daddy, someone tried to kill me!" Isabella declared dramatically.

Margaret and Victoria gasped in unison. "Who would dare harm the Lancaster heiress? Such audacity!"

Henry immediately soothed her. "Who poisoned you?"

Isabella pointed directly at Harrison. "It was her!"

Harrison didn't flinch. She'd anticipated this accusation.

All eyes turned to her.

Victoria was the first to react, jumping to her feet. "So it was you all along! Mr. Lancaster, I told you she was responsible, but you didn't believe me. Now that Isabella has named her, surely you see the truth?"

Henry's brow furrowed, but he remained silent.

Harrison stepped forward, meeting Isabella's gaze unflinchingly. "Do you have any proof to support your claim?"

"We spoke that day, and right after, I was poisoned. It had to be you!" Isabella retorted confidently.

Harrison arched an eyebrow.

"Let me clarify," she said, her tone calm yet razor-sharp. "You're making accusations based solely on conjecture? Courts require evidence. Continue slandering me without proof, and I'll have no choice but to sue for defamation."
###Chapter 618

Isabella's voice shook with barely contained fury. "Be careful what you say!"

Harrison studied Isabella with narrowed eyes, her piercing gaze cutting through the tension. "There's something else. I never prepared the antidote, so how did you miraculously wake up on your own?"

A flicker of unease crossed Isabella's face before she could mask it.

Turning to Henry Lancaster, Harrison continued, "If I were the poisoner, I'd ensure my victim remained unconscious. Yet here she is, awake prematurely. Mr. Lancaster, this entire poisoning incident reeks of deception. You should investigate thoroughly."

Henry's dark eyes bore into Isabella with unsettling intensity.

Beneath his scrutiny, Isabella's pulse quickened. She could almost feel him peeling back her layers of lies. Feigning weakness, she clutched her forehead. "Father, I feel faint."

"Rest now," Henry murmured, tucking the blankets around her before ushering everyone into the hallway. Once the door closed, he fixed Harrison with a searching look. "What's your assessment of this poisoning?"

Harrison met his gaze steadily. "I suspect self-poisoning." Henry's jaw tightened.

"My theory? She attempted to frame me but miscalculated the dosage," Harrison continued. "Now she's awake before her staged recovery timeline."

Silence stretched between them, Henry's expression unreadable.

Harrison's sharp eyes never wavered. "Frankly, she doesn't share your intellect, Mr. Lancaster. The incompetence is staggering. And her mother—what was she like? Because clearly Isabella didn't inherit her brains from you."

At the mention of Isabella Delacroix, Henry's posture shifted almost imperceptibly, his aristocratic features hardening.

"No," he said icily. "Her mother was exceptionally cunning."

Harrison arched an eyebrow. Interesting. So the stupidity was entirely Isabella's own creation.

"You have my word—I'll get to the truth," Henry stated with finality.

Harrison nodded. "I appreciate that, Mr. Lancaster."

She turned on her heel and left without another word.

Inside the bedroom, Isabella sat rigidly against the headboard, her face a mask of cold fury.

Victoria perched nervously beside her, reaching for her hand. "Are you feeling better?"

Isabella jerked away as if burned. "Don't touch me!"

Victoria recoiled. "What's wrong?"

"Wrong?" Isabella hissed. "Our entire plan has collapsed! I poison myself to frame Harrison, you're supposed to convince Father to exile her, and instead you bungle it so badly I wake up early! Everything's ruined!"

The scheme had been simple: Isabella would fake poisoning, Victoria would pin it on Harrison, and Henry would finally rid them of the pregnant threat carrying Nathaniel's heir. That child was a disaster waiting to happen.

"Listen to me!" Victoria's voice cracked with frustration. "I tried everything! But your father only trusts Harrison. Both he and Nathaniel are under her spell!"

Isabella's face darkened. That her fiancé favored Harrison was infuriating enough—but her own father taking that woman's side? Unthinkable.

What black magic had Harrison woven around them?

"And why," Isabella spat, "did you administer the antidote prematurely?"

Victoria's expression turned grave. "Because Theodore is in trouble."
###Chapter 619

Isabella's brow creased in confusion, her thoughts spinning wildly. "What are you talking about? What happened to Theodore?"

Victoria's voice dropped to a whisper, laced with urgency. "He's discovered the truth about who you really are. He—"

Before she could finish, Isabella cut her off sharply. "Truth about my identity? What other truth could there be? My lineage is crystal clear—I'm the sole heir of the wealthiest man alive! Henry Lancaster's one and only daughter!"

The reality of her true origins remained hidden from Isabella.

Victoria hadn't intended to reveal everything, but with Theodore awake, there was no choice. She had to brace Isabella for what was coming.

"Isabella, I need to tell you something crucial. You're not Mr. Lancaster's biological daughter."

What?!

Isabella's face drained of color, her eyes widening in shock. "Who dares say that? Have you gone mad?!"

Victoria held her gaze, steady but sorrowful. "The truth is, you're the daughter I had with Benjamin. I switched you with Harrison when you were just a baby."

Isabella's breath hitched, her chest tightening. "You... switched me with Harrison? You and Benjamin are my real parents? Then what about Harrison? Does that mean... she's..."

Victoria nodded gravely. "Yes. She is Mr. Lancaster's true daughter—the rightful heiress to the Lancaster fortune."

Harrison was Henry's biological child, the legitimate heir to everything!

The words struck Isabella like a bolt of lightning, her vision tunneling as her thoughts shattered. Her mind went blank, unable to process the revelation.

She understood each word individually, but together, they made no sense.

"No! This is a lie!" Isabella's voice cracked with hysteria. "I see now—Harrison is your real daughter. You've been scheming to replace me with her as the Lancaster heiress! You're nothing but a fraud!"

Victoria reached for her, but Isabella recoiled.

"No, listen to me—everything I'm saying is true. You have to accept this—"

"I won't hear another word! You're lying! Harrison is your and Benjamin's child, and I am the true Lancaster heiress! That's the only truth!" Isabella screamed, clapping her hands over her ears.

She refused to listen.

The foundation of her world had crumbled. For years, she had lived under the illusion that she was the rightful Lancaster heir. Now, Victoria had shattered that delusion.

How could that nobody Harrison be the true heiress?

Isabella was certain—she was the real one!

Victoria's voice turned desperate as she forced Isabella to confront reality.

"You must face the truth. Think about it—if Harrison were my real daughter, would I have treated her so poorly? You're my flesh and blood. I used Harrison as a stepping stone to secure your position. But now, Theodore knows everything. He's awake, and he could expose your secret at any moment. If that happens, we're both ruined!"

Her words doused Isabella like ice water, freezing her heart but clearing the fog in her mind. She had to accept it.

She was the impostor—Harrison was the true Lancaster heir.

Isabella could never allow Harrison and Henry to reunite as father and daughter, nor let Harrison claim the life that should have been hers.

She would stop it—no matter what.

Her eyes burned with fury as she glared at Victoria. "What do we do now? Why did Theodore wake up? Why isn't he dead already?"
###Chapter 620

Isabella was the epitome of self-absorption.

For decades, Theodore had poured his heart into raising her, treating her as his own flesh and blood with unwavering devotion. Yet she remained utterly indifferent. Anyone who stood in her way became an obstacle to be ruthlessly eliminated.

"Theodore was completely comatose at first," Victoria whispered urgently. "But Margaret brought Harrison in for acupuncture treatment, and now he's conscious. We must prevent your secret from coming out!"

Isabella's eyes darkened with cold calculation. "Then Harrison needs to vanish."

Victoria blinked in surprise.

"That meddling girl is the root of all our problems. Once she's gone, everything she possesses will rightfully be mine!" Isabella declared with venomous conviction.

Death was the only suitable fate for Harrison now.

Victoria nodded slowly, malice twisting her features. "She should have died years ago when we abandoned her in that village. Somehow the little wretch survived. This time, we'll make sure she disappears permanently."

Isabella gripped Victoria's arm, her voice razor-sharp. "I'm entrusting this to you. You'll handle Harrison personally."

Victoria stiffened. "You want me to do it myself?"

"Who else can we rely on? With Nathaniel and Henry watching our every move, it's too dangerous to involve outsiders. If anything leaks, everything unravels. It has to be you." Isabella's tone turned saccharine. "Mother...you're my real mother. You love me enough to do this, don't you?"

This was the first time Isabella had addressed Victoria as "Mother" without disgust. She clung to Victoria's hands with desperate pleading in her eyes.

Victoria melted. This was her true daughter after all. "Very well. I'll take care of it."

Isabella's face lit up as she threw her arms around Victoria. "Thank you, Mother! I knew you'd protect me. You're wonderful!"

Victoria returned the embrace warmly. "Silly girl, I'd move heaven and earth for you."

The moment their embrace broke, Isabella's smile vanished, replaced by icy calculation.

Harrison. Theodore. Victoria. They all needed to die.

Even as she pretended affection, Isabella was already plotting how to eliminate Victoria next. The woman knew too much. Only permanent silence could safeguard Isabella's secrets.

Meanwhile, Harrison entered Theodore's hospital room once more. The once-powerful man sat slumped in a wheelchair, his limbs lifeless, his voice stolen—a hollow shell of his former self. A nurse attended to his basic needs.

Harrison dismissed the caregiver. "I'll take over now."

As the nurse departed, Harrison turned to Theodore. "I'm going to administer acupuncture treatment today."

She reached into her medical bag for the needles.

Suddenly, Theodore's trembling hand shot out, clutching desperately at Harrison's sleeve.

Harrison started. "What is it?"

Theodore's mouth worked soundlessly, his eyes burning with urgency.

"Do you need to tell me something?" Harrison asked gently.

Theodore nodded with frantic intensity.

Harrison leaned closer. "What is it?"

Another violent nod.

"Is this about Isabella?" Harrison watched his reaction carefully.

Theodore's eyes blazed with confirmation, his entire body trembling with the effort to communicate.

Harrison's suspicions about Isabella and Victoria solidified. Theodore clearly knew something crucial.

She extended her palm. "You can't speak, but you can write. Take your time. Trace the words on my hand."

With shaking fingers, Theodore began forming clumsy letters on Harrison's palm.

"Isabella...is...a...fraud..." Harrison read aloud, her voice barely above a whisper.

Her blood ran cold.

Why would Theodore call Isabella a fraud?
###Chapter 621

Harrison stood frozen in shock. She had witnessed Theodore's devotion to Isabella firsthand - perhaps more intense than anyone else's affection.

But now, Theodore's demeanor had transformed completely, making an abrupt about-face as he labeled Isabella a deceiver.

What falsehoods had Isabella fabricated?

Harrison studied Theodore's face, her bewilderment intensifying. "Isabella lied? What exactly did she lie about?"

Theodore nodded eagerly, his fingers trembling as he began tracing letters on Harrison's palm. "She...is...not..."

Not what? What wasn't Isabella?

Theodore was preparing to write "Ms. Lancaster," intending to reveal Isabella wasn't Henry's biological daughter. But at that precise moment, the door burst open with a sharp creak.

Harrison turned to see Isabella and Victoria sweeping into the room.

Isabella shoved past Harrison with unnecessary force. "What are you doing hovering over my father? Planning to hurt him?"

Harrison rose slowly, her eyebrows knitting together as she met Isabella's hostile gaze. "Why the hysterics?"

Isabella shot Harrison a venomous look before clutching Theodore's frail hand possessively. "Father, I heard about your fall! I rushed here immediately - I've been sick with worry!"

Theodore regarded Isabella with icy revulsion, attempting to pull away from her grasp, but her fingers tightened like vices.

"You must have been terrified," Isabella cooed, "but I'm perfectly fine now. That dreadful poison is completely out of my system."

Victoria moved to flank Isabella, adding her support. "Darling, Isabella has been beside herself with concern. She's utterly devoted. You'll recover soon, I'm certain."

Isabella turned her glare on Harrison. "Why are you still here? Get out! My father doesn't need you - he needs me!"

Theodore's mouth worked desperately, but no sound emerged.

Victoria strategically positioned herself between Harrison and Theodore's line of sight.

Harrison offered a tight smile and shrugged. "Very well, I'll leave."

She began gathering her acupuncture needles.

At that moment, Isabella exchanged a loaded glance with Victoria - a silent signal. With Harrison's back turned, the moment was perfect.

Victoria's eyes burned with barely contained malice as she stared at Harrison's unprotected back. Eliminating Harrison would remove the final obstacle between her and Isabella's ambitions.

Steel glinted as Victoria produced a slender blade from her sleeve, the edge catching the sterile hospital light.

The room was otherwise empty - the ideal circumstances for their scheme.

Victoria advanced toward Harrison with measured steps.

Harrison remained focused on organizing her medical supplies, oblivious to the approaching threat. She only noticed Victoria's ominous expression as the woman drew nearer.

From his wheelchair, Theodore saw everything unfolding. His eyes bulged in silent panic, his entire frame trembling with terror.

Victoria now stood directly behind Harrison. In one fluid motion, she raised the knife for a lethal strike.

The sickening sound of steel piercing flesh echoed through the room, followed by a choked gasp.

Harrison whirled around at the noise. To her absolute shock, Theodore had somehow summoned the strength to rise from his wheelchair and place himself between her and danger.

Victoria's blade had sunk deep into Theodore's abdomen, crimson spreading rapidly across his hospital gown.

Harrison's eyes widened in horror. She lunged forward to support Theodore, her voice shaking with fury. "Victoria, have you lost your mind?!"

Victoria stood paralyzed, stunned. She'd never anticipated that Theodore, in his weakened state, could possibly intervene.

The warmth of Theodore's blood seeped into her fingers, freezing her in place.

This was the man she'd loved for decades - and she'd just plunged a knife into his chest with her own hands.
###Chapter 622

Theodore collapsed to the floor, blood seeping through his shirt. Harrison immediately pressed her hands against the wound, her fingers trembling.

"Stay with me," she pleaded, her voice thick with urgency. "I can help you—just hold on!"

Her mind reeled. Never had she imagined Theodore would throw himself in front of her, taking the blade meant for her chest.

Theodore weakly shook his head. He already knew—his time was up. His gaze, heavy with remorse, locked onto Harrison. There were so many words left unspoken, but all he could manage was a broken whisper.

"I... regret..."

His hand fell limp. His eyes closed.

Harrison clutched him tighter. "No! Don't you dare give up! I can fix this—just stay awake!"

Victoria knelt beside them, pressing two fingers to Theodore's neck. No pulse.

He was gone.

By her own hand.

Harrison looked up at Victoria, her voice shaking with disbelief. "How could you? You tried to kill me—your own daughter?"

The realization struck like ice. She had long accepted Victoria's cold indifference, her blatant favoritism toward Isabella. But this? This was beyond cruelty. Victoria had raised a knife against her. She had wanted her dead.

If not for Theodore, Harrison would be the one lying lifeless on the floor.

Isabella didn't shed a single tear. No grief, no remorse. Her mind raced only about replacing Theodore with Henry. Fury burned through her—Theodore had ruined everything! They had been so close to ending Harrison!

"Mother, hurry!" Isabella hissed. "You killed the wrong one! Finish her now—before it's too late!"

Driven by hatred, Victoria snatched the bloodied knife and stood. Her eyes burned with venom as she glared at Harrison.

"You were always a mistake. I should have gotten rid of you years ago."

She lunged.

Harrison moved faster. A silver needle flashed in her hand, striking a precise point on Victoria's wrist.

Victoria gasped as her fingers went numb. The knife clattered to the floor.

Harrison's voice turned glacial. "You're insane. You just murdered someone. Enjoy prison."

"What are you waiting for?" Isabella shrieked. "Pick it up! Kill her!"

Victoria scrambled for the knife, desperation twisting her features.

Then—the door exploded open.

A towering figure stormed in.

Nathaniel.

Isabella's face paled. He was here. It was over.

Nathaniel's furious gaze locked onto Victoria. "What the hell do you think you're doing?!"

He didn't hesitate. A brutal kick sent Victoria crashing into the wall. Blood sprayed from her lips as she crumpled.

Nathaniel rushed to Harrison, his hands cradling her face. "Harrison, I'm here. Are you hurt?"

She shook her head. "I'm fine... but Theodore... he's gone."

Nathaniel checked for a pulse. Nothing.

Then Harrison gasped, clutching her stomach. Pain twisted her features. "Something's wrong..."
###Chapter 623

Nathaniel's arms tightened around Harrison as he lifted her limp body. "Get a doctor now!"

His voice cracked with urgency as he sprinted from the room, cradling Harrison against his chest.

Victoria stood motionless, her wide eyes fixed on Theodore's still form sprawled across the bloodied floor. Her fingers trembled violently as hot tears streaked down her cheeks.

"Theodore! Why did you shield her? I never wanted this!" Her voice broke into a sob. "I gave you everything—my youth, my devotion—and you threw it away for her! Don't you dare haunt me for this... Don't you dare!"

Isabella grabbed her mother's arm, panic sharpening her tone. "Snap out of it! Harrison's alive! This isn't over!"

Victoria whirled on her daughter, grief twisting her features. "He was your father too! He raised you, spoiled you—how can you stand there so cold?"

Isabella's gaze flicked to Theodore's body, her lips curling in disgust. "Why should I care? If he hadn't interfered, Harrison would be dead. He ruined everything! He never loved me—not really."

Victoria recoiled. "How could you—"

The door burst open. Margaret stormed in, flanked by security, her scream piercing the air when she saw her son.

"Theodore! No, no, wake up! Please!" She collapsed beside him, shaking his shoulders, but his skin had already gone cold.

Her tear-filled eyes burned into Victoria. "What did you do? Did you murder my boy?"

Victoria stumbled back. "It wasn't me—"

Henry Lancaster entered, his expression thunderous. "Explain this."

Isabella instantly clung to him. "Daddy, I'm terrified!"

Henry's gaze sliced to her. "Who did this? You were here—talk!"

Margaret seized Isabella's arm. "Tell me! My son was recovering—he should be alive! Who took him from me?"

Isabella's finger shot toward Victoria. "Her! She stabbed him!"

Victoria's face drained of color. Her own daughter—her flesh and blood—had just condemned her.

Isabella retreated behind Henry, her voice trembling with manufactured fear. "I saw it happen. She had the knife—it's covered in her prints!"

Margaret lunged, yanking Victoria's hair so hard her scalp burned. "You monster! I'll make you suffer!"

Crack!

The slap echoed through the room. A second blow followed, nails raking Victoria's cheeks. She gasped, her desperate eyes locking onto Isabella. "I'm your mother! I—"

Isabella cut her off, voice icy. "You're a killer. I won't protect you. Harrison and I both saw you do it. The evidence is undeniable."

Margaret twisted Victoria's hair tighter, forcing her head back. "I should've never let you near my family. You'll pay for this—with your life!"
###Chapter 624

Margaret slammed Victoria onto the marble floor, her fists raining down merciless blows.

Victoria's body trembled violently as she gasped between sobs. "Please... no more... I can't take it!"

Henry Lancaster's icy command sliced through the chaos. "Remove her."

Black-clad security personnel materialized instantly, dragging the battered woman away as she screamed incoherent pleas.

Margaret collapsed beside Theodore's lifeless form, her anguished wails echoing through the grand hall. "Theodore! How could you leave me like this? I can't go on without you..."

The Lancaster estate buzzed with funeral preparations while Isabella paced her chambers, nails biting into her palms. Victoria's capture by Henry's men sent waves of terror through her. That loose tongue could ruin everything.

Slipping through shadowed corridors, Isabella found Henry deep in conversation with the head butler. She pressed against the mahogany doorframe, straining to catch their hushed exchange.

"Has she talked?" Henry's voice carried an edge Isabella had never heard before.

The butler's response came in a whisper. "Not a word, sir. But forensic analysis confirms her fingerprints on the weapon. The murder charge will hold."

A weighted pause followed before the butler continued, "Do you suspect... complications?"

Henry's silhouette moved toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. "I'm certain she's protecting someone. And I believe that someone is Isabella."

"Isabella?" The butler's shock was palpable even through the door.

"Consider her behavior since the poisoning incident," Henry continued. "We all know she orchestrated it to frame Harrison."

The butler nodded slowly. "In my decades of service, sir, I've never seen such duplicity. Miss Harrison, by contrast, possesses remarkable integrity and intellect."

A ghost of a smile touched Henry's lips. "Nathaniel always did have impeccable judgment."

Isabella's vision blurred with rage as her manicured nails drew blood from her palms. Henry's growing favor toward Harrison was bad enough. Now he questioned her very character?

She'd clawed her way to this position through blood and sacrifice, while Harrison waltzed in and stole everything. The injustice burned like acid in her veins.

Henry's next words turned her blood to ice. "Make Victoria talk. I want full disclosure."

The butler bowed. "It will be done."

Isabella retreated on silent feet, her mind racing. Her entire legacy as the Lancaster heiress hung by a thread. Only Victoria stood between her and ruin.

Some problems required permanent solutions.

The damp cellar reeked of mildew and despair. Victoria huddled in a corner, her once-elegant gown now torn and stained. Each breath sent sharp pains through her bruised ribs, but she held her silence. Speaking meant death. Silence might yet bring salvation.

The rusty hinges screamed as the heavy door swung open. Victoria didn't bother looking up. "I told you, I won't—"

The familiar scent of Chanel No. 5 made her head snap up. Her swollen eyes widened at the elegant figure standing before her.

"Isabella!" Hope surged through her battered body. "You came! I knew my daughter wouldn't abandon me!"
###Chapter 625

Victoria clung to Isabella's hand desperately, her gaze brimming with fragile hope. In this moment, Isabella was her only lifeline. She truly believed her daughter would be her salvation.

Isabella met Victoria's eyes and murmured softly, "Mother."

Victoria immediately pulled her into a crushing embrace. "Yes, my darling?"

Isabella didn't resist. She allowed the embrace but her voice carried an undercurrent of tension as she confessed, "Henry is beginning to question my origins."

"What?" Victoria froze, her pulse stuttering. "Why would he doubt your background?"

"Because I went to plead your case. I begged him to release you, but he insists you're a murderer who can't be freed. I groveled at his feet, but he said you're just my adoptive mother—not my real one. That's when the suspicion started."

Isabella's voice fractured with barely restrained frustration and something darker—guilt.

Victoria was profoundly moved. "You... you actually did that for me? I thought you'd written me off."

"Never! At the hospital, when I accused you of killing Father, it was just survival—a temporary act. I could never truly abandon you. But now I've failed to free you, and Henry's suspicions are growing. Mother, what do I do?"

Her fingers twisted in Victoria's sleeves. "If I lose my identity as Lancaster's heir, the Whitmores and Lancasters will discard me. I'll have nothing. My entire life, I've been superior to Harrison. She'll trample me into the dirt if I fall. I can't live like that!"

Tears spilled down Isabella's cheeks, silent and rapid. "You're my real mother. You'll help me, won't you? You're all I have left."

Victoria's heart shattered at the sight. She cupped Isabella's face. "Don't cry, my love. I'll find a way."

"But how? Henry won't stop until you confess, and now he's unraveling everything! Unless..."

"Unless what?" Victoria whispered, dread coiling in her stomach.

"Unless you vanish from this world."

Victoria recoiled as if struck. "Vanish?"

Isabella stepped forward, her expression glacial. "It's the only solution. You must shoulder all the blame and end it. That's how you save me."

Victoria's breath came in shallow gasps. "You came here today... to ask me to kill myself? You never pleaded for me at all, did you? This was all an act! Even your tears—they're lies!"

Had she seen through the ruse? Isabella had intended to manipulate Victoria into a willing sacrifice, but the facade was crumbling.

Coolly, Isabella wiped her tears away and dropped the pretense.

"Correct. I never begged for you."

"How could you?" Victoria's voice was raw with betrayal.

"Why wouldn't I? Begging for you would only expose me. Henry's already suspicious. Do you want me ruined? You're the one who made me Lancaster's daughter. You orchestrated this. Now that I'm here, I refuse to fall. Is that so terrible?"

Isabella's tone was steel, unrepentant. Victoria's face drained of color as the truth settled over her.

This was her own making. She'd forged Isabella into this.

"You taught me to climb, to crush people like Harrison beneath me. Wasn't that your lifelong lesson? I've grown accustomed to luxury, to power. I won't surrender it! You're my mother, and you're condemned for murder. There's no escape. Shouldn't you protect your daughter one final time?"

Isabella's grip on Victoria's shoulders tightened, her nails biting into flesh. "Mother. Do this for me."
###Chapter 626

Isabella clutched Victoria's shoulders with trembling hands. "Mother, you must do this for me! Take the blame and everything will be fine. You've always protected me—just one last time!"

Victoria stared into her daughter's desperate eyes, the weight of decades of poor choices crushing her chest. She'd spent a lifetime clearing obstacles for Isabella—arranging the theft of Nathaniel's savior identity, securing her position as the Lancaster heiress. She'd turned a blind eye to every transgression.

Now karma had come knocking.

The bitter truth settled in her bones—she'd molded this monster with her own hands.

And now that monster was about to destroy her.

"I carried you for nine months... How can you be this cruel?"

Isabella collapsed to her knees, grasping Victoria's skirt. "I have no choice! If you truly love me, you'll do this. Disappear for me, Mother. Please!"

A broken laugh escaped Victoria's lips as she absorbed the depth of her daughter's betrayal.

It was over.

She should have seen this coming when Theodore died. Some secrets demanded blood as payment.

Victoria closed her eyes.

Across town, Harrison returned from the hospital with her newborn. Though physically recovered, her mind reeled—Theodore had died saving her, but something felt terribly wrong. The pieces didn't fit.

She turned to Margaret. "Where's Victoria?"

Margaret's tear-swollen face twisted in rage. "That witch murdered my son! I'll see her burn in hell!"

Just then, Henry Lancaster entered. "Harrison."

Her gaze turned glacial. "Victoria tried to kill me. Theodore took the knife."

Henry nodded grimly. "I know."

"Do you also know Isabella was involved?"

Confusion flickered across his face. "What?"

"She entered the ward with Victoria. While her mother attacked me, she did nothing to stop it!" Harrison's voice sharpened with accusation.

Henry's expression hardened. "Isabella is my daughter."

Nathaniel stepped forward, his arm protective around Harrison. "That makes you responsible for holding her accountable. Blood doesn't excuse crimes."

A heavy silence fell.

Harrison pressed on. "Take me to Victoria. I need answers about Theodore."

"She's secured in the east wing," Henry said evenly. "Come."

As they approached the guarded room, Harrison's pulse quickened. The guard unlocked the door.

"Victoria's inside," Henry confirmed.

Harrison stepped forward, calling out, "Victoria, I need to know why Theodore—"

Her words died.

Victoria lay motionless in a crimson pool, her skull shattered against the marble wall.

Harrison's breath caught. She rushed forward, fingers pressing against Victoria's cold wrist. Nothing. No pulse. No life.

Nathaniel and Henry stood frozen in shock.

"She's gone," Nathaniel confirmed quietly.

With Victoria's last breath, every secret died. Every truth vanished.
###Chapter 627

Harrison spun to face Henry, her piercing gaze locking onto his. "Explain this to me - how could Victoria just die like that? What made her crash into that wall?" Henry's expression darkened with confusion. "I honestly don't know."

Harrison stared at Victoria's motionless body, a storm of emotions churning within her. Though this woman had never shown her a mother's love, though she'd inflicted countless wounds upon her heart, Harrison had never once desired her death.

Her pale irises began shimmering with unshed tears. One by one, they overflowed, tracing hot paths down her cheeks in an unstoppable flood.

The head butler's urgent voice shattered the heavy silence. "Mr. Lancaster! Emergency!"

Henry whirled toward the sound. "Report."

"It's Ms. Isabella - she's vanished!"

Gone? Isabella missing?

Henry bolted from the room, his polished shoes pounding against marble as he raced to Isabella's chambers. The space stood hauntingly vacant - not a single clue remained of her presence.

"Isabella! Where are you?" Henry's desperate shouts echoed through the empty suite before he turned wild eyes to the butler. "When was she last seen?"

"The maid discovered her absence when bringing afternoon tea. No one witnessed her departure, but judging by the cold tea service, she's been gone for hours."

Henry's jaw clenched. "Mobilize every available resource. Comb through all of Willowbrook if necessary - I want her found immediately!"

The butler gave a sharp nod. "At once, sir."

As Henry turned to leave, Harrison materialized before him, her expression inscrutable. "Mr. Lancaster, we need to talk."

"Not now."

"Don't you see the pattern? Theodore and Victoria are dead. Now Isabella disappears."

Henry's face darkened like gathering storm clouds. "Finding her takes priority. This discussion can wait."

He brushed past her without another word.

Harrison's brow furrowed as gears turned behind her composed facade.

Nathaniel approached, draping a protective arm around her shoulders. "Why would Isabella flee like this? Where could she possibly go?"

Harrison's gaze followed Henry's retreating form, her voice steady with quiet conviction. "She'll be fine. That woman would never let harm come to herself."

Nathaniel nodded slowly.

"Come," Harrison said, squaring her shoulders. "Let's follow and observe this unfolding drama."

The search party operated with military precision. Within the hour, a breakthrough came.

The butler reappeared, slightly breathless. "We've located Ms. Isabella. She's on the Harborview Overpass."

"Take me there immediately!" Henry barked.

A fleet of luxury vehicles screamed toward the coastal overpass. Henry practically launched from the moving car, his frantic eyes immediately locking onto the solitary figure perched precariously on the railing.

Isabella sat with her back to the city, legs dangling over the hundred-foot drop to churning waters below. One gust of wind, one wrong movement, and she'd be gone forever.

Henry approached cautiously, his voice thick with concern. "What are you doing out here alone? Come back - it's not safe!"

Isabella turned tear-filled eyes toward him. "Stay back!"

Henry froze mid-step. "Alright, I'll stay right here. But please, come to me?"

Tears streamed down Isabella's face as her voice cracked. "Father... do you even love me anymore?"

Henry's head jerked back as if struck. "How could you doubt that? You're my daughter."

"Then why does it feel like you care more about Harrison?"

"I..." Henry's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish.

"You know I despise her! She stole Nathaniel, the man I love. Yet you keep drawing closer to her. You're supposed to be my father! Why take her side? Why champion my enemy?"

The accusation hung heavily between them. The truth was undeniable - Henry did admire Harrison. Her sharp intellect, unshakable poise, and transparent honesty had won his respect. He understood the bitter rivalry between the two women, both vying for the same man's heart.

Guilt twisted in Henry's chest. "I... I never meant to hurt you."

"I'll confess everything. That poisoning incident? I staged it to frame Harrison!" The words burst from Isabella like a dam breaking.

"Isabella, please—"

"Don't you understand? I couldn't bear watching Nathaniel give his heart to her. But what destroyed me was seeing you - my own father - choosing her over me!"
###Chapter 628

"I've suffered from a congenital heart condition since childhood," Isabella wept, her voice trembling with raw emotion. "I've always felt... broken. When I finally found you, Father, I thought everything would change. But you don't love me. I had to resort to such shameful tactics just to earn your affection."

Tears cascaded down her porcelain cheeks, each droplet reflecting the dim harbor lights like liquid diamonds.

Henry Lancaster studied his daughter with conflicted eyes. "You shouldn't have needed to. This is entirely my failing. I've been blind to your pain..."

"Twenty-six years apart," Isabella whispered hoarsely. "When we were reunited, I dreamed you'd cherish me, spoil me, love me without conditions... How foolish I was. Mother's gone forever now. Perhaps I should join her. At least I could tell her how her beloved husband abandoned their daughter."

The mention of Isabella struck Henry like a physical blow. His stern features softened visibly, the hard lines around his mouth relaxing. He moved closer, his voice thick with remorse.

"My darling girl, forgive me. Just one more chance - I'll take you back to Metropolia immediately. Anything you desire, it's yours."

Isabella's body swayed precariously over the railing. "Swear it! If you're lying, I'll let go right now!"

Henry's breath caught in his throat. "I vow it on your mother's memory! From this moment, I'll keep my distance from Harrison. No more contact. Now please, come back to safety."

After a tense hesitation, Isabella finally nodded and climbed down. Henry crushed her in a desperate embrace. "Never frighten me like that again." She buried her face in his tailored suit. "If you truly mean what you say, I won't need to."

"I'll arrange a gala to formally welcome you into Lancaster society," Henry promised, stroking her hair.

Just then, headlights cut through the harbor mist as Harrison and Nathaniel arrived. Harrison stepped from the car and froze at the sight of Henry cradling Isabella like precious porcelain.

Isabella turned her head just enough to lock eyes with Harrison. Her lips curved in a slow, victorious smile - the smirk of a chess player declaring checkmate.

Harrison stood paralyzed.

Nathaniel grasped Harrison's icy fingers. "She's his flesh and blood after all. He's searched decades for her, so..."

Harrison gave a barely perceptible nod. "I should go."

"Let me drive you," Nathaniel insisted.

Harrison shook her head. "I prefer to walk."

When Nathaniel's phone rang with Victoria's caller ID, Harrison offered a brittle smile. "Your mother awaits. Goodnight, Nathaniel."

A silver Bentley suddenly pulled up, and Oliver emerged. "Harrison?"

Without another word, Harrison slid into the passenger seat. As the car disappeared into the foggy night, Nathaniel stood staring at the empty road, the phone still ringing in his hand.

"Son? We're returning to Metropolia at once. Mr. Lancaster is taking Isabella back as well," Victoria declared when he finally answered.

"I'm staying. My place is with Harrison."

"With Harrison? She just drove off with another man!"

Nathaniel's blood ran cold. He whirled around, but the mist had swallowed every trace of Harrison's departure.

In that moment, he understood with terrible clarity - Harrison's quiet farewell had been permanent. While he'd been distracted, she'd slipped through his fingers like moonlight on water.

And now she was gone.
###Chapter 629

Three years had passed in Florentia...

Inside a sprawling, sunlit villa, Harrison rested peacefully on her bed. Her dark lashes brushed against porcelain cheeks, the morning light casting a rosy glow across her delicate features. She looked like a sleeping angel—so ethereal one might hesitate to disturb her.

Cream-colored drapes cascaded to the marble floor. Sunbeams streamed through the arched windows, painting the room in liquid gold.

Then—the door swung open with a soft click.

A tiny whirlwind of energy bounded inside. A little girl clambered onto the bed and pressed her plump cheeks against Harrison's face, smacking a loud kiss onto her cheek.

"Wakey-wakey, sleepyhead!" Charlotte Lancaster chirped, her voice bright as wind chimes. "Mommy, time to rise and shine!"

Charlotte was now three years old. Harrison had returned to Florentia years ago and brought her daughter into the world.

Dressed in a lavender tutu dress, she looked like a storybook princess. Her wide, sparkling eyes held galaxies of curiosity, her button nose and rosebud lips the perfect blend of her parents' finest traits.

Harrison stirred, blinking awake. For three years, motherhood had been her world. And nothing compared to mornings like this—greeted by Charlotte's sunshine smile.

She pulled her daughter close, breathing in the sweet scent of baby shampoo. "I had a late surgery last night," she murmured. "Forgive me for sleeping in."

Charlotte nodded sagely. "I played quietly so you could rest! But..." She leaned in conspiratorially. "Uncle Oliver's here. He wants to see you."

Harrison's heart swelled. Her little girl was pure magic.

Oliver visiting? That meant business.

She sat up. "Let's not keep him waiting." Hand in hand, they left the bedroom.

In the grand sitting room, Oliver stood by the fireplace. "Did I disturb you?"

Harrison offered a small smile. "What brings you here?"

His expression turned serious. "I just returned from Metropolia. Aren't you curious about what's happened there these past three years?"

Harrison glanced down at Charlotte, who peered up with wide, inquisitive eyes.

She smoothed her daughter's silken curls. "Sweetheart, go play in the garden for a bit, okay?"

"Okay!" Charlotte skipped away, her laughter trailing behind her.

Harrison turned back to Oliver. "I don't need updates."

For three years, she'd poured everything into Charlotte and her work. Life had been... peaceful.

Oliver arched a brow. "Really? Three years ago, Isabella left with Mr. Lancaster. No interest in her fate? And Nathaniel returned to Metropolia too. The Falcon and Lancaster families have that marriage pact. Don't you wonder what became of him and Isabella?"

Harrison kept her face neutral. "What's your point?"

"Rumor says they're marrying soon."

At the mention of those names, her lashes flickered—just once.

Harrison had believed time healed all wounds. That she'd moved on.

But Nathaniel's name still sent a tremor through her.

Three years since they'd parted.

And now... he was marrying Isabella?

It made sense. The Falcon and Lancaster dynasties had been intertwined for generations. Isabella was the heiress to the Lancaster fortune. Of course they'd unite.

If anything, she was surprised it had taken this long.

"So?" Oliver pressed. "When are you going to Metropolia? Don't say you're not."

Harrison smirked. "Why wouldn't I? Of course I'm going."

Isabella was there.

And Harrison had unfinished business with her.

"Good." Oliver crossed his arms. "So when do we leave?"
###Chapter 630

"I'm still considering my options," Harrison murmured, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup.

Oliver reached into his tailored suit jacket and produced a shimmering platinum-edged invitation. "The time for hesitation is over. You must depart tomorrow. Metropolia is hosting the Celestial Summit, and they've exclusively invited the crème de la crème of global elites—the top 100 from Forbes' list. Every attendee wields unimaginable influence. This," he tapped the embossed card, "is your golden ticket."

Harrison accepted the luxurious invitation, its weight substantial in her palm. Flipping it open, the name "Seraphina" gleamed back at her in elegant calligraphy.

"Seraphina Montgomery, CEO of Vitalis Health—the world's leading pharmaceutical empire—has confirmed attendance. The media is already buzzing. Your presence will be the crown jewel of the event. There's no better moment to make your move to Metropolia."

Seraphina was Harrison's carefully crafted alter ego, the enigmatic powerhouse behind Vitalis Health.

She didn't refuse, but her gaze drifted to Charlotte, who sat cross-legged on the plush carpet, utterly absorbed in coloring a picture of unicorns. "But Charlotte... She's never been away from me for more than a night. You know how she gets."

The worry in Harrison's voice was palpable.

Oliver arched a perfectly groomed eyebrow. "Why not take her with you?"

Harrison shook her head decisively. "Out of the question."

"Ah." Understanding dawned in Oliver's eyes. "You're worried about Nathaniel being there."

Harrison's jaw tightened as she stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the city skyline. "That chapter is closed. He's marrying the Lancaster heiress now. I won't have Charlotte exposed to that world—not yet. I know it's selfish, denying her the truth about her father...but I refuse to let her become a pawn in the Falcon-Lancaster power games. All I want is for her to grow up safe and happy."

Oliver nodded solemnly. He'd witnessed firsthand the battles Harrison had fought to protect her daughter. "Go to Metropolia. Charlotte stays with me."

"You'd do that?"

"Of course." He feigned offense, pressing a hand to his chest. "Don't tell me you doubt me?" With a whistle, he called, "Charlie! Come here, princess!"

Charlotte came barreling across the room like a tiny hurricane, launching herself into Oliver's waiting arms. "Uncle Ollie! Did you call me?"

He peppered her cheeks with kisses. "Your mommy has an important trip. Want to have a superhero sleepover with me while she's gone?"

Charlotte's big eyes turned to Harrison. "Mommy, are you going far?"

Harrison crouched to her level. "Very far, sweetheart."

"Can't I come? I'll be super good!" Charlotte's lower lip trembled.

Harrison smoothed her daughter's golden curls. "Mommy has boring grown-up meetings. But I'll call you every night, and be back before you can finish all Uncle Ollie's ice cream stash. Deal?"

Charlotte nodded solemnly. "Okay...but hurry back."

"That's my brave girl."

The next morning, Harrison zipped up her designer luggage. Oliver and Charlotte accompanied her to the private airfield.

"Everything's handled here," Oliver assured her, adjusting his Patek Philippe. "Focus on your mission."

Charlotte waved frantically. "Bye-bye, Mommy! Bring me a present!"

Harrison kissed her daughter's forehead before ascending the Gulfstream's stairs.

Oliver hoisted Charlotte onto his shoulders. "Let's get you those chocolate-dipped strawberries you love, yes?"

Charlotte's eyes lit up. "With sprinkles?"

"With extra sprinkles." He set her down on a plush terminal bench. "Stay right here. Daddy's going to work his magic."

As Oliver strode toward the gourmet kiosk, Charlotte swung her legs, humming to herself.

Then—

A familiar towering figure materialized across the bustling terminal.

Nathaniel Hawk.

His piercing gaze locked onto Charlotte with startling intensity.
###Chapter 631

Nathaniel had arrived in Florentia.

Three years had passed, yet his chiseled features appeared even more striking, as if carved by a master sculptor. The bespoke suit clung to his powerful frame, accentuating his lean waist with precision.

His commanding stride through the hotel lobby exuded undeniable authority, turning heads as he moved with purpose.

Dominic followed closely, murmuring, "Mr. Falcon, our search yielded nothing. Ms. Harrison isn't in Florentia." Nathaniel approached the panoramic windows, his gaze distant. "For three years, I've scoured countless cities searching for Harrison. Yet she remains vanished, as if the earth swallowed her whole."

Three years prior, Harrison had departed in Oliver's luxury vehicle and never returned.

Now standing in Florentia's most opulent hotel, Nathaniel found himself no closer to answers.

"Mr. Falcon, the jet awaits," Dominic reminded. "The Global Summit in Metropolia requires your presence tomorrow."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Very well."

With no leads here, Metropolia called him back.

His phone chimed softly. Victoria's name flashed on the screen.

"Mother," he answered.

Nearby, Charlotte played with her cherished crystal sphere - a birthday gift from Harrison that she treasured above all toys.

The sphere slipped from her tiny hands, rolling across the marble floor.

"Oh no!"

The child scrambled after her precious toy.

The crystal came to rest against Nathaniel's polished Oxfords.

Victoria's voice carried through the phone, "Return promptly. Isabella awaits you here. It's time you set a wedding date."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed at the mention of Isabella.

As he turned, his foot descended upon the delicate sphere.

A small voice piped up beside him. "Sir...you stepped on my crystal..."

Nathaniel looked down to find Charlotte gazing up at him with wide, tear-filled eyes.

The three-year-old barely reached his knees, a vision in her frilly princess dress and patent leather shoes - a perfect doll-like creature.

Something unfamiliar stirred in Nathaniel's chest. This tiny human was unbearably precious.

"Sir, my crystal..."

Nathaniel lifted his foot immediately. "My apologies, little one."

The damage was done - the sphere lay shattered beneath his shoe.

"You broke Mommy's present!" Charlotte's lower lip trembled as fat tears rolled down her cheeks.

Panic gripped Nathaniel. He crouched to her level, voice uncharacteristically gentle. "Please don't cry. I'll replace it, I promise."

Never had he witnessed such raw sorrow in something so small. Each tear felt like a dagger to his chest.

"But Mommy gave me this one!" Charlotte wailed, clutching the broken pieces. "It was special!"
###Chapter 632

Nathaniel swiftly brushed away Charlotte's tears with his thumb. "There now, sweetheart. What if I get you a brand new one? Would that make it better?"

Charlotte's lower lip quivered as she shook her head. "No... I only want the one Mommy gave me."

The billionaire tycoon shifted uncomfortably, clearly out of his depth with children. "All right then. Where's your mother? I'll go speak with her immediately."

"She's not here..." Charlotte whispered, fresh tears welling in her big eyes.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply before bending down to scoop up the tiny girl. "Come along then. Let's find your parents."

Charlotte gasped as she was lifted effortlessly into strong arms. She blinked up at the striking man holding her, momentarily distracted from her sorrow. No one had ever held her this high before - not even Daddy Oliver.

"If your mother isn't here, where's your father? Surely you didn't wander off alone?"

Before Charlotte could answer, a familiar voice cut through the airport noise.

"Charlotte! Charlotte, where are you?" Oliver's panicked shouts grew closer as he searched the terminal, the chocolate strawberries forgotten in his hand.

Charlotte wriggled excitedly. "That's my daddy calling me!"

Nathaniel carefully set her down, his lips curving into an unexpected smile. "Run along then, little one."

"Bye bye, Mr. Prince!" Charlotte beamed, using her favorite fairytale term for handsome men.

The corner of Nathaniel's mouth twitched. "Next time we meet, I promise you'll have the finest crystal ball in Metropolia."

"Pinkie promise?" Charlotte held up her tiny finger.

Nathaniel solemnly linked his pinkie with hers before watching her dart off toward Oliver's voice.

"Daddy Ollie!" she called out.

Nathaniel's breath caught as he caught sight of Oliver's profile. "Oliver Pembroke...?"

For three endless years, Nathaniel had scoured the globe for any trace of Oliver, only to find him here, of all places?

He took an involuntary step forward.

"Mr. Falcon," Dominic materialized at his side. "The jet is prepared for departure."

Nathaniel hesitated just long enough for Oliver and Charlotte to vanish into the crowd. His gaze swept the terminal, but the familiar figures had disappeared like morning mist.

Had he imagined it? After all this time?

"Sir?" Dominic pressed.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Very well."

He followed his secretary toward the private hangar, casting one last glance over his shoulder.

Meanwhile, Oliver had pulled Charlotte behind a pillar, his heart pounding. He'd recognized Nathaniel instantly - the last person he expected to encounter here.

"Daddy Ollie, why were we hiding? Was it from Mr. Prince?" Charlotte's innocent question snapped him back to reality.

Oliver studied his daughter's curious face. "Charlotte... how did you meet that man?"

Charlotte held up the shattered remains of her beloved crystal ball. "My magic ball rolled to him and he stepped on it by accident."

Oliver marveled at the irony. For three years, Harrison had gone to extraordinary lengths to keep Charlotte's existence from Nathaniel. And yet fate had conspired to bring father and daughter together in the most mundane of circumstances.

"Do you... like that man you met?" Oliver asked carefully.

Charlotte's entire face lit up. "Oh yes! He's like a storybook prince! And when he held me up, I could see the whole world!"

Oliver swallowed hard, watching as Charlotte twirled with the broken crystal pieces, completely unaware of the seismic encounter that had just occurred.
###Chapter 633

Oliver cradled Charlotte in his arms, his touch gentle. "So you like Mr. Handsome, huh?"

Charlotte nodded eagerly, her eyes sparkling. "Yes! He's so tall and dreamy. Can you introduce him to Mommy? Then he can be my daddy!"

Oliver chuckled. This little girl never failed to amaze him. Even at her age, she was already playing matchmaker for Harrison. The moment she saw a good-looking man, her first thought was to pair him with her mother.

"Let's head home."

"Okay!" Charlotte beamed.

Oliver carried her back to their villa in Rosewood Manor.

That night, Harrison called for a video chat.

Charlotte practically bounced with excitement as she answered. "Mommy!"

Harrison, currently staying in a lavish suite at The Grand Celeste in Metropolia, felt her exhaustion melt away at the sight of her daughter's radiant face.

"Did you miss me?"

"More than anything! I miss you so much, Mommy!"

"I miss you too, sweetheart."

Charlotte leaned closer to the screen, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Mommy, guess what? Today, I saw the most handsome man at the airport. I want him to be your husband!"

Harrison froze.

Her daughter was already setting her up on blind dates?

"Who is this mystery man?"

Just then, Oliver stepped into the frame, holding Charlotte. "Oh, you know him."

Harrison arched a brow. "Do I?"

"Nathaniel."

What?

Harrison's fingers twitched. Charlotte had met Nathaniel? How was that even possible? He was supposed to be in Florentia.

Oliver continued, "He flew into Florentia but left right after. You must’ve just missed him. Charlotte ran into him at the airport. She was instantly smitten."

Harrison’s pulse spiked. She never imagined their paths would cross like this. "Did he... recognize her?"

Oliver shook his head. "No. Don’t worry."

She exhaled in relief. Even if Nathaniel had recognized Charlotte, he’d assume she was Oliver’s daughter.

Then Charlotte piped up again, her voice sweet and hopeful. "Mommy, do you know Mr. Handsome? I really want him to be my daddy..."

Harrison’s throat tightened.

She never denied Charlotte anything—but this? This was impossible.

"Sweetheart, grown-up relationships are complicated. Mr. Handsome might already have a family. We can’t just decide these things for him."

Charlotte’s face fell, but she nodded obediently. "Okay..."

"Get some rest, Harrison," Oliver said before ending the call.

Charlotte looked up at him with wide, curious eyes. "Daddy Oliver, does Mommy really know Mr. Handsome?"

Oliver ruffled her hair, his heart aching at how much she longed for a father. "How about we go to Metropolia? Your mom’s there right now. Want to visit her?"

Charlotte’s entire face lit up. "Really? Yes! Let’s go!"

"Alright. We leave tonight."

Oliver had made up his mind.

He wasn’t asking for permission.

Harrison would protest, but for once, he was taking matters into his own hands.

Charlotte was going to Metropolia.

Metropolia.

Nathaniel had just stepped out of his Rolls-Royce when his phone buzzed.

Another call from Victoria.
###Chapter 634

Nathaniel's finger hovered over the screen before accepting the call. "Victoria, Mother."

The familiar voice carried warmth through the speaker. "You've returned to Metropolia, haven't you? Come to Falcon Manor for dinner tonight. I'd like to see you."

Refusal wasn't an option. "Of course."

Within the hour, his sleek Bentley glided to a stop on the manicured lawns of the Falcon estate. Nathaniel stepped out, his polished Oxfords crunching on the gravel as he entered the grand foyer.

Victoria sat regally in her wheelchair by the fireplace, an unexpected guest beside her—Isabella.

Three years had only heightened Isabella's striking beauty. As the Lancaster heiress, her life remained gilded with privilege and success.

Victoria's face lit up. "Nathaniel, darling!"

Isabella sprang to her feet, her designer dress swishing as she rushed forward. "Nathaniel! I've missed you."

His jaw tightened at her presence. Cold detachment settled over his features. "Why are you here?"

"Isabella knew you'd return today. She's been waiting hours," Victoria interjected with a pleased smile. "Such devotion from your fiancée! I've already selected wedding dates. Would you like to review them?"

"No." The single word sliced through the room. "I won't be marrying Isabella."

Silence descended like a guillotine.

Nathaniel turned his glacial gaze on Isabella. "Know your place. My feelings haven't changed—I don't love you. This desperate pursuit only deepens my contempt."

He turned toward the staircase.

Isabella's porcelain skin paled. The Lancaster name had always commanded reverence, yet Nathaniel remained impervious.

Her voice trembled. "Is Harrison why you refuse me?"

Nathaniel froze mid-step at the name.

"You went searching for her again, didn't you?" Isabella pressed, nails digging into her palms. "This trip—it was to find her."

Without turning, his voice remained steady. "Yes."

Isabella's hands clenched into fists.

Three years. She'd thought victory was hers when Harrison vanished without trace. Yet Nathaniel's obsession never wavered.

Harrison wasn't even present, yet she remained the insurmountable wall between them.

The bitterness choked her. How could she keep losing to a ghost?

Victoria's wheelchair creaked as she leaned forward. "You're being absurd! Harrison left with another man, yet you pine like some lovesick fool. Open your eyes—Isabella is everything you need."

Nathaniel didn't turn. After a weighted pause, his voice rang clear.

"Harrison is the only woman I've ever loved. That hasn't changed. It never will."

His broad shoulders disappeared up the staircase, the study door closing firmly behind him.

Victoria exhaled sharply. "Stubborn boy! What magic did that woman weave?"

She grasped Isabella's shaking hands. "Don't fret, darling. Harrison won't return. Nathaniel will see reason. You're the only daughter-in-law I'll accept."
###Chapter 635

Isabella would never surrender Nathaniel without a fight.

Since his return to Metropolia and taking control of Falcon Enterprises three years ago, he'd become the city's most formidable business magnate. His meteoric rise in the corporate world was unstoppable. Every socialite in the capital coveted his attention, dreaming of capturing his heart.

How could Isabella possibly let such a prize slip away?

A determined smile curved her lips as she met Victoria's gaze. "My heart belongs entirely to Nathaniel. I'll wait however long it takes for him to see that."

Victoria patted her hand approvingly. "You'll make the perfect daughter-in-law."

Isabella's smile deepened with satisfaction.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel sat in his study reviewing documents when an unexpected image surfaced in his mind—a cherubic face with delicate features and sparkling eyes.

Charlotte.

The child had inexplicably taken root in his thoughts.

He'd never particularly cared for children before, yet since meeting Charlotte, he couldn't shake her from his memory.

She must be three years old now.

When Harrison left three years ago, she'd been pregnant. Had she given birth? Was it a boy or girl?

For three endless years, Nathaniel had thought of Harrison daily. When the longing became unbearable, torturous questions would plague him—was she with Oliver now? Were they playing happy family somewhere?

Each imagined scenario sent searing pain through his chest. He'd lost his woman.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts. "Mr. Falcon?" Dominic's voice called through the door.

Nathaniel straightened. "Enter."

His assistant stepped inside, placing a folder on the desk. "The guest list for tomorrow's Global Elite Summit. Your review is requested."

Nathaniel had returned from Florentia specifically for this event.

His finger paused on one unfamiliar name. "Jolin? Who is this? I don't recognize the name."

Dominic cleared his throat. "Our intelligence indicates she's the CEO behind Vitalis Health."

Nathaniel froze. The mysterious figure behind Vitalis Health was named Jolin?

Years ago in Stonebridge, he'd glimpsed this enigmatic woman in shadowed lighting—regal, poised, breathtakingly beautiful.

Never had he imagined her name was Jolin, nor that she'd appear at tomorrow's summit.

"Her attendance has caused quite the stir," Dominic added. "Everyone's eager to glimpse this female titan."

Understandable. Jolin had recently debuted on the Forbes Billionaires list, cementing her status as an industry powerhouse.

Nathaniel closed the folder with a nod. "Understood. I'll attend."

Dominic hesitated. "We've found no trace of Ms. Harrison in Florentia. It appears she's actively concealing her tracks. She doesn't wish to be found. Shall we continue searching?"

Three years of fruitless pursuit. Like chasing shadows across continents. Should he persist?

"Continue," Nathaniel commanded, steel in his voice. "I will find her."

Dominic bowed slightly. "As you wish."

Alone again, Nathaniel leaned back, Harrison's heart-shaped face floating before his eyes.

"Harrison... where are you hiding?"

The following morning...

As Nathaniel prepared for the summit, Victoria and Isabella arrived unannounced at his office.

"You're attending the Global Elite Summit today?" Victoria began smoothly. "Take Isabella with you."



###Chapter 636

The Apex Soiree was the most exclusive event of the season, a glittering convergence of power and prestige where the elite gathered to see and be seen.

Isabella lived for these moments—the dazzling lights, the whispered politics, the intoxicating rush of being at the center of it all. Naturally, she wanted to attend, and she wanted Nathaniel by her side.

Nathaniel shut her down immediately. "You're not coming with me."

Isabella's lips parted in protest, but she had expected this. She was always prepared. "The Lancasters received an invitation too. My father never attends these things, so I'm going in his place. At least let me ride with you."

"No." His refusal was absolute.

For a fraction of a second, her composure faltered.

Nathaniel didn’t spare her another glance as he turned away.

Disappointment flickered through her, but she smoothed it over with practiced ease. "Mrs. Hawk, since Nathaniel won’t take me, I’ll have the driver drop me off."

Victoria nodded. "Very well. Once you’re there, you’ll still have plenty of opportunities to be near him. Enjoy yourself."

"Thank you."

Half an hour later, Isabella arrived at the Apex Soiree with Arabella in tow.

Arabella had relocated to Metropolia three years ago. After her messy breakup with Julian, who had generously compensated her, she was back on the market. Tonight, she was here to scout for a wealthy prospect—someone who could secure her future.

She clung to Isabella’s arm. "This place is unreal!"

Isabella smirked. "Stick with me. I’ll show you how it’s done."

Just then, a sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up to the entrance. Nathaniel stepped out, flanked by Dominic.

Isabella brightened. "Nathaniel! You made it!"

Nathaniel barely spared her a glance, his expression unreadable. Of course she was here—she always was.

He moved toward the entrance without a word.

But then another luxury car arrived. The door opened, and a breathtaking figure emerged—graceful, poised, effortlessly commanding attention.

Harrison.

It was as if an electric current passed between them. Nathaniel turned sharply, his breath catching as his gaze locked onto her.

His voice was barely a whisper. "Harrison?"

"Harrison? Where?"

Isabella and Arabella spun around, scanning the crowd.

The moment Harrison stepped out, she was immediately surrounded by staff, who greeted her with deference. "Ms. Jolin, right this way."

They whisked her away before Nathaniel could react, leaving him with only a fleeting glimpse of her retreating figure.

Isabella frowned. "Harrison? I didn’t see her."

Arabella shrugged. "She’s not here. Nathaniel, are you sure you weren’t imagining things?"

Nathaniel didn’t answer. He was already moving, pushing through the crowd, his pulse roaring in his ears.

No, he wasn’t mistaken.

That had been Harrison.

After three long years, she was back.

He broke into a run, chasing after her.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella’s voice was sharp with frustration.

But he didn’t stop. When he reached the spot where he’d last seen her, she was gone—swallowed by the sea of guests.

His voice cut through the hum of conversation. "Harrison! Harrison!"

Up on the second floor, Harrison paused at the railing. She had heard him calling her name.

She looked down, her fingers tightening around the polished banister.

There he was—Nathaniel, standing amidst the crowd, his eyes wild with desperation.

Three years.

It had been so long.
###Chapter 638

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Harrison as he extended his arm. "Allow me to escort you inside."

His eagerness to accompany her to the prestigious Zenith Gala was palpable.

Harrison's lips curved into a subtle, knowing smile. "That won't be necessary. I have my own arrangements."

Isabella let out a derisive laugh. "Oh, please. This isn't some charity fundraiser. Only the elite are welcome here. What makes you think you belong?"

Both Isabella and Arabella exchanged skeptical glances. Even Nathaniel had his doubts—though he was prepared to use his influence to secure her entry.

Harrison reached into her clutch and produced an embossed invitation. "I believe this answers your question."

Isabella's jaw slackened. Arabella blinked rapidly, as if the card might vanish if she looked away. "How did you—? You're not on the Forbes list!"

Arabella scoffed, recovering first. "Impossible. The only woman making headlines tonight is Jolin, the pharmaceutical magnate. Unless you're her personal assistant?"

Harrison's expression remained unreadable, though amusement flickered in her eyes. "So you're aware Jolin will be attending."

"Obviously," Isabella sneered. "She's the most powerful woman in the industry. Since you're the so-called 'wonder doctor,' I assume you fetch her coffee?"

Harrison's assistant clenched her fists, barely restraining herself. "You—"

A slight shake of Harrison's head silenced her.



There was no need to engage. The truth would reveal itself soon enough.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice low and earnest. "Jolin will be here. Walk in with me. We have much to discuss."

Harrison inclined her head politely. "Another time, perhaps. I have my own agenda tonight."

Without another word, she turned toward the grand entrance.

"Harrison—" Nathaniel called after her, but she didn't look back.

Isabella smirked, looping her arm through Arabella's. "This should be entertaining."

Arabella nodded. "If she causes a scene, security will toss her out before she takes two steps."

Isabella shot Nathaniel a pointed look. "Forget her. She's beneath you. Let's enjoy the evening."

Nathaniel ignored her completely, striding ahead with Dominic shadowing him.

Isabella's face darkened with irritation.

Arabella squeezed her arm. "Relax. You're the Lancaster heiress now. Tonight is your moment to shine—and her moment to crumble."

A slow, vindictive smile spread across Isabella's lips.

Of course.

If Harrison wanted to embarrass herself in front of high society, Isabella would ensure she did so spectacularly.

"Let's go."

The Zenith Gala was a glittering sea of power and privilege—CEOs, investors, and industry titans mingling beneath crystal chandeliers. Nathaniel, impeccably dressed in a bespoke black tuxedo, stood among them, exchanging quiet words with a group of influential executives.

###Chapter 639

Nathaniel commanded attention like a gravitational force, his presence making every debutante in the ballroom subtly adjust their posture. Heads turned in unison as he moved through the crowd.

Isabella watched him beneath the crystal chandeliers, her pulse quickening. How could any woman resist this man? At the peak of his career now, she knew countless socialites fantasized about him.

She would make sure he belonged only to her.

With bated breath, Isabella continued her silent admiration.

Nearby, Arabella was already scanning the room like a predator. She needed someone tall, wealthy, and devastatingly attractive to attach herself to.

The past three years had seen Falcon Enterprises' value triple, making Nathaniel the undisputed king of real estate. Arabella hadn't intended to end things with Julian, but when his attention fixated solely on Rosalind, she'd taken the generous settlement and moved on.

"Arabella, who's caught your eye? I'll make introductions," Isabella offered.

Arabella's cheeks pinkened.

Just then, a broad-shouldered man with aristocratic features approached. "Excuse me, might I have the pleasure of your number?"

A wealthy heir was asking for Arabella's contact.

Flushing deeper, she retrieved her phone. "Of course."

After exchanging digits, the man smiled. "I'll message you. Perhaps we could share cocktails when you're free."

As he walked away, Isabella nudged her friend playfully. "See? Irresistible as always. Another conquest."

Arabella beamed. "I owe this to you."

"What are best friends for?" Isabella replied smoothly.



Both women had flourished these past years. Coming from elite families, blessed with beauty and ambition, their self-centered nature only propelled them further in high society.

Isabella guided Arabella toward Nathaniel's circle. "Nathaniel, darling."

The surrounding executives immediately greeted her. "Ms. Lancaster, what an honor."

Upon returning to Metropolia, she'd legally become Isabella Lancaster.

Her lips curved into a practiced smile. "Gentlemen."

"Ms. Lancaster, is your father not attending tonight's Zenith Gala?" one CEO inquired.

Isabella nodded gracefully.

"Indeed. Father rarely attends social functions anymore, but he insisted I experience this event." Her gaze softened as it landed on Nathaniel. "And of course, my fiancé Nathaniel is here. We arrived together."

Isabella was staking her claim publicly.

The truth was, the Lancaster-Falcon alliance had become an open secret among the elite. Marriage alliances strengthened dynasties, and everyone knew the game.

The executives immediately fawned, "We hear wedding bells will ring soon. When might we expect invitations?"

"What a perfect match. Truly destiny."



"The Falcon-Lancaster merger will be unstoppable. No competitors stand a chance now."

Isabella soaked in the admiration like sunlight. She lived for this validation.

Nathaniel's expression remained icy. He opened his mouth as if to speak.

But Arabella interjected first, "Speaking of powerful women, where is the elusive Adriana? She's conspicuously absent tonight?"

The mention of Adriana Rowe sent whispers through the crowd.

"That woman is in a league of her own. Rumor says her net worth rivals Mr. Falcon's!"

"Have you ever met her?"

"Never. She's a complete enigma."

Isabella, who harbored quiet resentment toward Adriana, smirked.

"To amass that kind of wealth, she must be practically ancient by now." 

###Chapter 640

Harrison gave a subtle nod. "Most female tycoons are well-established in their forties or fifties, with decades of experience under their belts."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "Jolin is remarkably young."

What? Jolin was young?

Harrison's eyes widened in surprise. "You've actually met Jolin?"

Another voice chimed in eagerly, "You have? You absolutely must tell us everything about her!"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "I only saw her from behind. But she was unmistakably youthful."

Isabella's chest tightened. Nathaniel had encountered Jolin? When had that happened?

It was always the same—these alluring women circling Nathaniel like vultures.

Just then, a ripple of excitement spread through the crowd. "Look! Who is that breathtaking woman?"

Nathaniel glanced up—and there she was.

Arabella.

She had arrived in a sleek, black halter-neck fishtail gown, her hair elegantly swept up. The delicate straps of her dress accentuated her porcelain shoulders and sculpted collarbones. The gown clung to her slender waist, emphasizing her mesmerizing hourglass figure as she moved with effortless grace.

The moment she stepped inside, the room stilled. Every gaze locked onto her.

"She's absolutely stunning!"

"A goddess descended among mortals—her poise is unmatched."

"Hands down, the most captivating woman here tonight."



As the room buzzed with admiration for Arabella, Isabella and Arabella froze. Mere moments ago, they had been the center of attention. Now, Arabella had effortlessly stolen the spotlight, reducing them to mere shadows.

Arabella. Why did it always have to be Arabella?

Nathaniel's eyes lingered on her. Over the past three years, Arabella hadn’t changed drastically—yet somehow, she had transformed. Her beauty had fully bloomed, shifting from delicate to utterly mesmerizing.

As Arabella moved further into the room, Isabella quickly called out, "Arabella! You actually came!"

Curious gazes turned toward Isabella. "Ms. Lancaster, you know this young woman?"

Isabella lifted her chin with practiced arrogance. "Of course. This is Arabella. She grew up in the countryside."

Arabella swiftly added, "She dabbles in medicine, but she’s certainly not on the Forbes Billionaires list. I have no idea how she managed to sneak into the Zenith Gala."

Arabella met their eyes, offering a polite but distant smile before turning away.

Isabella’s voice turned icy. "Arabella, this isn’t the place for someone like you. You should leave immediately."

Arabella nodded in agreement. "Exactly. The Zenith Gala is for Forbes-listed elites only. You’re lowering the standard of the event. Get out."

Their goal was clear—to humiliate Arabella by having her forcibly removed.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened as he stepped protectively to Arabella’s side. "As long as I’m here, no one is making Arabella leave."

He turned to her with a reassuring smile. "Don’t worry. I won’t let anything happen to you."



Arabella met his gaze, her expression unreadable. "Mr. Hawk, I don’t need your protection. No one can force me to leave."

Isabella scoffed. "You’re delusional. I’ll have security escort you out myself."

With that, she raised her voice sharply. "I demand to speak to the event coordinator!"

Within moments, a harried-looking representative hurried over. "Ms. Lancaster, how may I assist you?"
###Chapter 641

Harrison studied the event coordinator with piercing eyes. "If I recall correctly," she began smoothly, "the Zenith Gala exclusively invited Forbes-listed individuals this year?"

The coordinator nodded briskly. "Precisely, madam."

"Then logically," Harrison continued, her voice dropping to a dangerous purr, "any unlisted attendee would be an intruder?"

"Undoubtedly," the coordinator confirmed. "Our security team would immediately remove such persons to maintain the event's exclusivity."

Arabella's lips curled in satisfaction. "This isn't some charity fundraiser where gatecrashers belong. The organizers should make an example of any imposters."

Isabella's smirk turned predatory as she raised a manicured finger. "How fascinating then, that we've discovered one such fraud among us tonight."

All eyes followed her accusing gesture to where Harrison stood, utterly unruffled. The heiress merely arched one perfectly sculpted brow, her champagne flute steady in elegant fingers.

The murmurs began instantly among the glittering crowd.

"Ms. Lancaster claims Ms. Harrison isn't listed?"

"No Harrison on this year's rankings..."

"Another social climber trying to snag a billionaire husband?"

"Pathetic really - getting caught by the Lancasters of all people!"

Isabella basked in the growing scandal, advancing on Harrison with venomous delight. "Well? Will you leave gracefully, or must security drag you out?"

Nathaniel moved like shadow given form, his towering frame materializing beside Harrison. "She's my personal guest." His voice could have frozen the champagne in their glasses.

Isabella scoffed. "Using you as her golden ticket, more like! Open your eyes, Nathaniel - she's just another-"

Harrison's sudden laughter cut through the tension like shattered crystal. "Oh Isabella," she sighed, shaking her head with genuine amusement. "You always did have spectacular timing for humiliation."

With the effortless grace of a panther, Harrison stepped into the gala's spotlight. The ambient chatter died as every guest instinctively turned toward her commanding presence.

"Let me clarify my position," she announced, her voice carrying effortlessly. "I require no wealthy patron. No powerful benefactor." Her gaze swept the room, leaving no doubt. "I am the power in any room I enter."

The declaration hung in the air, vibrating with unshakable certainty. Nathaniel found himself transfixed - the way the chandeliers caught in Harrison's upswept hair, the defiant set of her shoulders. She reminded him painfully of another woman who'd once stood just so, years ago...

A startling realization dawned. Could Harrison possibly be...?

Isabella's shrill cackle shattered the moment. "Delusional much? Not even ranked yet you dare claim equality here?"

Arabella joined the attack with a pitying smirk. "Honestly, it's embarrassing watching you pretend."

Harrison merely smiled, reaching into her clutch with deliberate slowness. What she withdrew silenced the room more effectively than any shout.

The newly printed Forbes list trembled in Isabella's suddenly nerveless fingers. There, glaringly obvious in the top twenty, glared the name she'd never expected to see: Harrison.

The gasps were everything.
###Chapter 642

Harrison studied Isabella and Arabella with an amused glint in her eyes. "Who told you my name doesn't appear on the Forbes list?"

"It doesn't," Isabella snapped. "We've combed through every page—there's no Harrison listed anywhere!"

Both women stood their ground, certain of their facts. The name Harrison would have jumped out immediately if it had been there.

Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Naturally, my name isn't on that list. I go by something else."

"What are you talking about?" Isabella frowned, her confusion evident.

Arabella rolled her eyes. "Stop spinning tales. Just walk away before you humiliate yourself further."

Harrison tilted her head slightly. "Humiliate me? Perhaps you should take another look."

Just then, the event coordinator stepped forward, positioning himself beside Harrison. "Ms. Harrison is the distinguished guest of honor at this year's Celestial Gala. As the host representative, we will not tolerate any disrespect toward her."

As he spoke, a team of black-suited security personnel materialized, forming a protective barrier behind Harrison.

Isabella and Arabella paled. They exchanged stunned glances before turning back to the coordinator.

"Harrison? Guest of honor? That can't be right!"

The coordinator shook his head. "There's no mistake. You simply don't understand who Ms. Harrison truly is."

"Then enlighten us," Isabella demanded, her voice trembling.

The coordinator raised his voice, ensuring every guest heard. "Ms. Harrison is none other than Seraphina—the reclusive billionaire behind the largest biotech empire in the world!"

Harrison was Seraphina?

Isabella and Arabella gasped in unison, their eyes darting between the coordinator and Harrison as if the words were a physical blow.

"That's impossible!" Isabella blurted.

Arabella, still reeling, added, "Seraphina is famously private—no one knows what she looks like! How could Harrison possibly be her?"

Harrison's smile deepened as she retrieved a small pin from her clutch. The delicate golden needle gleamed as she fastened it to her gown.

Isabella and Arabella froze.

The engraved nameplate read:

Seraphina.

At that moment, Harrison's assistant stepped forward, her patience clearly exhausted. "This is our CEO, Seraphina. How could you two be so blind?"

The ballroom erupted in murmurs.

"My God—she's Seraphina!" a guest exclaimed.

"We came hoping to catch a glimpse of her! I never imagined she'd be this breathtaking!"

"And to think Ms. Lancaster accused her of sneaking in. Talk about irony."

Isabella and Arabella staggered back as if struck. Three years ago, they'd orchestrated Harrison's downfall, forcing her into exile. Now she stood before them—radiant, untouchable, and more powerful than ever.

How?

Why?

Nathaniel stepped forward, his gaze locked onto Harrison. He'd suspected the truth from the moment she entered the room.

She was Seraphina.

His mind raced as he absorbed the revelation. Harrison had always been extraordinary—always holding his attention, never letting him look away.

Now he understood.

Their connection had been written in the stars long before tonight.
###Chapter 643

Nathaniel had known Harrison for years.

Isabella stood frozen, her hands trembling. "This...this can't be true! You're lying to me, aren't you?" Her voice cracked with disbelief.

Harrison tilted her head, amusement dancing in her eyes. "Ms. Lancaster, as the daughter of the wealthiest man alive, shouldn't you mind your manners? Your current behavior is rather...unbecoming, don't you think?"

The whispered murmurs around them grew louder.

"Look at how she's acting - positively green with envy."
"Ms. Lancaster may have wealth, but she lacks Harrison's grace and talent."
"Such a stark contrast between them. No wonder she's losing her composure."
"Embarrassing display for someone of her status. The Lancasters must be mortified."

Arabella's face flushed crimson with fury. "You planned this humiliation all along, didn't you? How calculating!"

Harrison merely shrugged. "You created this situation yourself. I simply obliged." Her gaze sharpened. "Though frankly, Arabella, I doubt you even belong here. Did Isabella sneak you in?"

The event coordinator materialized beside them. "Ms. Arabella, this is an invitation-only affair. Security will escort you out immediately."

Arabella's mouth fell open as two broad-shouldered guards appeared. The handsome tycoon she'd flirted with earlier now regarded her with open disdain.

"You'll regret this, Harrison!" Arabella spat as the guards gripped her arms.

Harrison smiled sweetly at the coordinator. "She seems reluctant to leave voluntarily."

"Understood, Ms. Harrison."

The guards marched Arabella toward the exit, her heels scraping against the marble floor. The weight of public disgrace crushed her - being ejected from the prestigious Global Scholars Forum would ruin her social standing.

"Nathaniel! Isabella!" she cried desperately. But neither moved to help. The grand doors swung shut behind her.

The coordinator bowed slightly. "Our deepest apologies, Ms. Harrison."

"A minor inconvenience," Harrison dismissed gracefully.

The murmuring crowd immediately swarmed Harrison. "Ms. Harrison, what an honor! We've followed your work for years."

Nathaniel finally approached, his gaze intense. "I never imagined you were Harrison."

She met his eyes, a playful smirk tugging at her lips. "I did tell you I didn't need rescuing."
###Chapter 644

Nathaniel's lips twitched into a knowing smirk. Harrison didn't need any man's protection—she was power and wealth personified.

He reached out his hand. "Pleasure to finally meet you properly, Harrison."

She accepted his hand with effortless elegance. "The feeling's mutual."

Under the glittering chandeliers, their handshake lasted a heartbeat too long. Across the ballroom, Isabella watched with nails digging into her palms. Once again, Harrison had stolen the spotlight.

Three years as the Lancaster heiress, yet she remained perpetually in Harrison's shadow.

The bitterness tasted like poison on her tongue.

As the Zenith Gala wound down, Nathaniel turned to Harrison. "Where are you staying? Let me drive you back." His voice carried unspoken urgency.

Harrison shook her head, glancing pointedly at Isabella. "My driver's waiting. You should attend to your fiancée."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "That's not—"

A ringing phone cut through his words.

Harrison checked the screen—Oliver. "Excuse me." She stepped away, leaving Nathaniel staring at the caller ID with clenched jaw.

In a quiet alcove, Harrison answered. "Oliver?"

"Where are you?" His familiar warmth seeped through the line.

"The Zenith Gala. Why?"

"Charlotte and I are coming to see you."

Harrison's grip tightened. "You brought her to Metropolia?"

"She wouldn't stop asking for you." Oliver's chuckle sounded forced. "Surprise?"

Silence. Harrison knew this was no coincidence.

Then—"Mommy?" Charlotte's sweet voice melted her resolve.

Harrison's shoulders relaxed. "Hi, baby."

"Are you mad we came?"

"Never." Harrison's voice softened. "I've missed you terribly."

"Yay! Daddy Ollie says we're coming now!"

"Alright, darling. I'll be waiting."

After sending her suite details, Harrison instructed her assistant: "Charlotte's arriving soon. Escort them straight up."

Meanwhile, Nathaniel waited impatiently at the emptying gala. When Harrison didn't return, he stood abruptly—only for Isabella to block his path.

"Going after her?" Her voice dripped venom.

Nathaniel's patience snapped. "Move."

Isabella stood her ground. "She's trying to steal you! After everything—"

"Enough." Nathaniel's icy tone made her flinch. "There is no 'us.' There never was."

He strode past her, leaving Isabella trembling with rage.

The game had changed. And Harrison held all the cards.
###Chapter 645
Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Isabella.

"Is that truly your belief?" A humorless chuckle escaped his lips as he shook his head. "How I wish your assumptions held truth."

Isabella stood frozen, her breath catching painfully in her throat. "But..."

"Isabella," Nathaniel's voice carried finality, "Harrison never needed to steal me. I've always been hers. This marriage won't happen—stop deluding yourself."

He turned on his heel without another word.

His rejection struck like a physical blow. What flaw made her so unworthy compared to Harrison?

Exiting the Zenith Gala, Nathaniel's expression remained inscrutable as he addressed Dominic. "Where did Harrison go?"

Dominic inclined his head slightly. "She returned to her suite." Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "I'll find her."

Meanwhile, Oliver arrived with Charlotte, searching for Harrison. Oliver pinched the child's rosy cheek playfully. "Missing Mommy?"

Charlotte bobbed her head enthusiastically. "So much!"

"We'll see her soon," Oliver promised with a grin.

Then he spotted Nathaniel approaching.

Charlotte's eyes sparkled with recognition. "Uncle Oliver! It's Pretty Gentleman!"

Nathaniel moved through the corridor with effortless elegance, his commanding presence impossible to ignore. Oliver mused how fate kept intertwining their paths—first in Florentia, now in Metropolia.

"Can I go say hello?" Charlotte begged, squirming excitedly.

Oliver chuckled. "Go ahead, little star."

The moment her feet touched the ground, Charlotte dashed toward Nathaniel, her sweet voice ringing out, "Pretty Gentleman!"

The familiar cadence halted Nathaniel mid-stride. Turning, he saw the golden-haired child barreling toward him.

His heart swelled with unexpected warmth as he caught her in his arms. "You! What brings you to Metropolia?"

Charlotte giggled, her tiny hands clutching his jacket. "I came to find Mommy!"

Her mother?

Nathaniel imagined an extraordinary woman must have birthed this radiant child.

An unfamiliar tenderness bloomed in his chest—this marked the first time a child had captivated him so completely. Their repeated meetings felt destined.

He ruffled her silken hair gently. "About that broken crystal ball... Let me replace it properly this time."

Guilt still nagged him about crushing her treasure in Florentia.

Charlotte's eyes shone as she nodded vigorously. "Yes! Mommy's staying here. You can come with me to buy it!"

Her secret hope? Introducing Nathaniel to Harrison—perhaps as a future father.

Nathaniel hesitated, surprised by the invitation. While Harrison remained his priority, meeting this enchanting child's mother first wouldn't hurt.

"Of course. Which room is Mommy in?"

"Suite 808!"

Nathaniel glanced at nearby door numbers. "That's just ahead. Shall we?"

Effortlessly, he lifted Charlotte, her slight frame cradled securely against him.

As they walked, Charlotte peered up curiously. "Pretty Gentleman, do you have a wife?"

A soft smile curved his lips. "Not yet."

Charlotte's heart leapt—until he added, "But my heart belongs to someone."
###Chapter 646

Charlotte's eyes widened in surprise as Nathaniel confessed he already had someone special in his heart.

"What's she like?" Charlotte asked, tilting her head with innocent curiosity.

A tender smile played on Nathaniel's lips. "She's breathtakingly beautiful, sharp as a whip, incredibly gifted, and carries herself with this magnetic presence. She shines brighter than anyone I've ever known."

Wow.

Charlotte's face lit up with a knowing grin. "That sounds just like my mommy! She's exactly like that too."

To little Charlotte, Harrison was her entire universe - sparkling and perfect like the rarest gemstone.

Nathaniel chuckled softly. Every child saw their mother as the most wonderful person in the world. He understood that completely.

In his eyes, no one could ever compare to Harrison's radiance.

"Are you and your special person together?" Charlotte asked with childlike bluntness.

Nathaniel shook his head, a shadow crossing his features. "Not yet. I'm still working to earn her heart."

Charlotte nodded sagely, her young mind processing this information carefully.

They had arrived at Room 808. Nathaniel glanced down at the little girl. "We're here." He reached out and pressed the doorbell.

Inside the suite, Harrison had been anxiously awaiting her daughter's return. At the sound of the chime, she stood abruptly from the sofa.

Her assistant moved toward the door, but Harrison stopped her. "I'll get it. Charlotte will want to see me first."

Harrison smoothed her dress and walked to the entrance.

Outside, Nathaniel studied Charlotte's bright face. "What's your full name, sweetheart?"

Charlotte beamed up at him. "I'm Charlotte Whitmore! But you can call me Charlie if you want."

Charlotte Whitmore?

What a charming name.

Nathaniel smiled. "And your mother's name?"

With evident pride, Charlotte declared, "My mommy's name is Harrison!"

The words struck Nathaniel like a physical blow. His tall frame went completely rigid.

His dark eyes widened in shock as he stared at Charlotte in disbelief. "What did you just say your mother's name was?"

"What's wrong? It's Harrison. H-A-R-R-I-S-O-N. At her office, people call her Jocelyn sometimes."

Nathaniel felt the world tilt beneath his feet. Charlotte's mother... was Harrison?

At that precise moment, the door swung open, and Harrison's melodic voice floated out. "Charlie, you're back—"

"Mommy! Look who I found! It's Mr. Dreamy!" Charlotte announced excitedly.

Mr. Dreamy?

Harrison's gaze lifted from her daughter to the man standing beside her—and froze.

Nathaniel's piercing eyes locked onto hers, and time seemed to stand still.

Harrison's face drained of color.

Her shocked gaze darted between Nathaniel and Charlotte. The sight of Nathaniel holding her daughter at her doorstep sent her mind reeling.

This couldn't be happening.

Nathaniel stared at Harrison, realization dawning. The timeline matched perfectly—when Harrison left three years ago, she must have been pregnant. Charlotte was their...

"Mr. Falcon," Harrison managed, her voice strained. "What are you doing here?"

Without waiting for an answer, she swiftly pulled Charlotte into her arms.

Nathaniel struggled to find his voice. "Charlotte is... your daughter?"

Harrison gave a tight nod. "Yes."

Charlotte looked between them, her innocent voice cutting through the tension. "Mommy, do you know Mr. Dreamy?"

Harrison turned to her daughter. "Charlie, is this the nice man you told me about?"

Charlotte nodded enthusiastically. "Uh-huh! He helped me when I got lost!"

The irony wasn't lost on Harrison—this was the undeniable pull of blood ties. Despite everything, Charlotte had found her way to Nathaniel. And of course she'd nicknamed him "Mr. Dreamy."

Nathaniel's voice was rough with emotion when he spoke again. "Is Charlotte... yours and Oliver's?"
###Chapter 647

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Harrison. "Is Charlotte the daughter you had with Oliver?"

Harrison recoiled as if struck. The question hung heavily between them. Before she could respond, Oliver's familiar voice cut through the tension.

"Hello there."

Nathaniel turned to see Oliver leaning casually against the doorframe.

Charlotte beamed, her tiny voice ringing with affection. "Papa Oliver!"

She called him Papa.

Nathaniel's chest tightened. A bitter laugh threatened to escape him. Why had he even asked?

He already knew the answer. Three years ago, Harrison had been carrying Oliver's child. Charlotte was undeniably theirs. Yet, some foolish part of him had hoped—

For what?

Oliver stepped forward, arms outstretched. "Come here, sweetheart. Let me carry you so Mommy can relax."

"Okay!"

Charlotte eagerly went to him, and Oliver lifted her effortlessly before turning his attention back to Nathaniel. "Mr. Falcon, it's been a while."

Nathaniel forced a tight smile. "Indeed it has."

"What a coincidence," Oliver mused, glancing between Harrison and Charlotte. "First Harrison, now Charlotte—both running into you like this."

Nathaniel's fingers curled into fists at his sides. The sight of them—so effortlessly whole—burned like acid.

"Since we've crossed paths," Oliver continued smoothly, "why not join us for dinner tonight?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Another time. I have business to attend to."

"Next time, then. Charlotte, say goodbye to Mr. Handsome."

Charlotte waved enthusiastically. "Bye-bye, Mr. Handsome!"

Nathaniel turned on his heel and walked away without another word.

Once he was gone, Harrison exhaled. "Let's go inside."

Oliver set Charlotte down once they entered the room. Harrison studied him, a silent question in her eyes.

"Was that intentional?"

Oliver feigned innocence. "What do you mean?"

"You were provoking Nathaniel," Harrison stated.

Oliver smirked. "Does it bother you?"

Harrison shook her head. "No."

"Good," Oliver said, chuckling. "Because he deserves it. Three years ago, he threw you and Charlotte away. Now he's still tangled up with Isabella. A little torment is the least he's earned."

Harrison's lips curved slightly. She remembered the raw pain in Nathaniel's expression—the self-loathing, the regret.

Good.

Charlotte suddenly tugged at Harrison's sleeve. "Mommy, I like Mr. Handsome! Can he be my new daddy?"

Harrison's smile softened. The innocence of children—so pure, so blind to the complexities of adult hearts.

"Are you hungry?" she deflected. "I had them make your favorite."

Charlotte's eyes lit up. "Yes! I'm so hungry!"

Nathaniel returned to the Falcon estate, his mood black. The moment he stepped into the grand foyer, he spotted Victoria waiting in her wheelchair.

"What happened at the Zenith Gala?" she demanded. "Isabella called me in hysterics. She said Harrison showed up—that you were entranced by her and abandoned Isabella."

Of course Isabella had run to tattle. She'd made a habit of it these past three years.

"Yes," Nathaniel admitted coolly. "I saw Harrison there."

"Why is she in Metropolia?" Victoria's voice sharpened. "She must be here for you. You cannot let this continue."
###Chapter 648

"Mother," Nathaniel cut Victoria off before she could continue. "Didn't Isabella inform you? Harrison is actually Jolin."

What?

Victoria's breath hitched.

Of course she'd heard of Jolin. In elite circles, that name carried weight—everyone knew the formidable woman behind it. Never had she imagined Harrison was that very person.

"Harrison wasn't here for me. She was invited to the Zenith Gala. Our meeting was pure coincidence. She's never been one to depend on a man. These past three years have only made her more formidable," Nathaniel explained, his voice steady.

Victoria didn't truly dislike Harrison. Over the years, whenever she recalled her, it was those piercing, intelligent eyes that came to mind. Now, discovering Harrison was the legendary Jolin? Unthinkable.

Yet there she was—radiant, poised, standing beside Nathaniel with effortless grace.

Victoria studied her son. As his mother, how could she not understand his turmoil? A woman like Harrison was irresistible to any man.

But Nathaniel could never have her.

"Nathaniel—"

"Mother, spare me the lecture," he interjected. "Harrison and I are impossible now. I met her daughter today."

Victoria stilled, her chest tightening.

Nathaniel offered a faint, bitter smile. "The child is exquisite—gentle, sweet, everything like her. She's Harrison and Oliver's daughter. They're a family now. I've lost my chance."

With that, he ascended the stairs, leaving Victoria rooted in the hallway, the weight of his words pressing down on her.

Nathaniel entered his room, leaving the lights off. Darkness swallowed the space whole. He moved to the floor-to-ceiling windows, his tall frame a silhouette against the city's glow. A cigarette found its way between his fingers. The lighter flicked open with a soft click, the flame illuminating his sharp features momentarily before he took a long drag, smoke curling around him like ghosts.

His mind replayed it—Harrison, Oliver, little Charlotte. A perfect portrait of happiness. Each mental image was a blade twisting deeper, an ache with no end.

That should have been his life.

His to cherish.

Yet he'd lost it.

Three years of searching, only to find her and realize it was a death sentence for his hopes.

A humorless smile tugged at his lips.

Meanwhile, at The Grand Celeste, Harrison was packing when her phone rang. Rosalind's excited voice spilled through the line. "You're in Metropolia? Perfect! So am I! We must meet—bring Charlotte! I've gifts for her!"

Rosalind, the cherished daughter of the Whitmore family, had returned to their ancestral home in Metropolia a year prior. Everett's younger sister, Lillian, had enrolled at Willowridge University.

In three years, Lillian had blossomed remarkably. By her sophomore year of high school, she'd claimed top honors in statewide mathematics, later dominating an international competition. She entered Willowridge that same year, a prodigy in her own right.

Rosalind had taken Lillian under her wing, treating her as kin. When Lillian moved to campus, Rosalind and her parents relocated to Metropolia to support her—though Lillian had since grown fiercely independent.

It had been too long since Harrison had seen an old friend. Warmth bloomed in her chest.

"Alright," she agreed, smiling. "Charlotte and I will leave shortly."


###Chapter 649

The afternoon sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of The Grand View as Harrison and Charlotte arrived. Within minutes, Rosalind Fairchild made her entrance.

Three years had done little to diminish Rosalind's effortless elegance. Her raven-black hair fell in silken waves past her shoulders, framing delicate features that still carried the glow of youth. She moved with the refined grace of someone born into privilege.

"Harrison! Charlotte!" Rosalind's musical laughter filled the space as she rushed forward, arms outstretched.

The two women embraced tightly, the years melting away in that instant.

Little Charlotte giggled, her cherubic face alight with mischief. "Rosalind, you're even more beautiful than in your magazine photos!"

Rosalind crouched to the child's level, pressing a kiss to her rosy cheek. "Oh, you delightful little charmer! I'd trade all my designer gowns for a daughter like you!"

Charlotte beamed. "No need! Everyone already thinks we're sisters!"

Rosalind's laughter tinkled like crystal. "Such silver-tongued flattery deserves a reward."

From her clutch emerged a platinum bracelet studded with diamonds, which she fastened around Charlotte's tiny wrist.

Harrison arched an eyebrow. "That's far too extravagant for a child."

Rosalind waved a manicured hand. "Nothing but the finest for our Charlotte. Besides, it's one of my original designs."

In the past three years, Rosalind had become a celebrated name in haute couture, her eponymous studio the talk of Metropolia's fashion circles.

Charlotte gasped, turning her wrist to catch the light. "It sparkles like fairy dust! Thank you!" She planted an enthusiastic kiss on Rosalind's cheek.

Rosalind's heart melted at the child's effervescent charm. With effortless grace, she scooped Charlotte into her arms.

"Our table awaits, ladies."

Harrison nodded. "Lead the way."

As they settled into their plush velvet booth, Harrison studied her old friend. "You've flourished these past years. It eases my mind."

Three years prior, Rosalind had endured a devastating breakup with Everett Sinclair, after which he'd vanished without explanation. Harrison had feared the heartbreak might break her.

Rosalind's crimson lips curved knowingly. "Darling, you of all people should know - a woman's worth isn't defined by a man's presence. If anything, we thrive to remind them what they've lost."

Both women had ascended to remarkable heights, no longer the shadows of their former selves.

Harrison raised her champagne flute. "To formidable women."

Their glasses met with a crystalline chime, eyes alight with shared understanding.

"Speaking of which," Harrison tilted her head, "where's Lillian? You should have brought her along."

At the mention of her adopted sister, Rosalind's face softened with pride. "She's currently sequestered with the national aerospace team. Some classified propulsion project - I only see her fortnightly."

Harrison's eyes widened. "Rocket science? That's extraordinary. Though hardly surprising with your guidance." Lillian possessed innate brilliance, but Rosalind's mentorship and the Whitmore family's influence had undoubtedly paved her path.

"She's the sister I never had," Rosalind murmured, affection warming her voice.

Harrison studied her friend carefully. "Has Everett truly not resurfaced in all this time?"

A fleeting shadow crossed Rosalind's features before she lifted her chin. "Not once."

"How peculiar," Harrison mused. "Lillian is his blood sister. One would think he'd visit, if only for her sake."
###Chapter 650
Rosalind shook her head slowly.

"Three years back, Everett called me out of the blue, asking to meet. But he never showed." Her lips twisted into a bitter smile. "He married Genevieve that same year. Both of them vanished from Metropolia afterward. Probably building their perfect life somewhere far away."

Harrison studied Rosalind's face with concern. "Are you holding up okay?"

Rosalind tugged at her sleeve. "It's ancient history. Everett and I were over long before that. No more tears for him."

Harrison nodded. "Good. Let's eat."

Just then, the restaurant doors swung open—revealing Arabella and Isabella.

Both women had suffered public humiliation at the Global Elite Gala and had arranged this lunch to commiserate.

Arabella's manicured nails dug into her clutch. "This is all Harrison's fault! The entire social circuit is mocking us. Three of my sugar daddies ghosted me overnight. Blocked on everything."

She'd been juggling multiple wealthy benefactors, keeping her options wide open. Now her carefully curated roster had evaporated.

Isabella's expression darkened. "Relax. We'll make Harrison pay."

Suddenly, Arabella froze. "Look! It's Harrison and Rosalind!" Isabella turned—spotting them immediately, along with Harrison's daughter, Charlotte.

Isabella's breath hitched. "That's Harrison's child? She's gotten so big."

Harrison had been absent for three years. This marked her first public appearance with Charlotte, leaving both women stunned.

"Definitely hers," Arabella sneered. "Same pretty face, same conniving blood."

Isabella's stomach churned. "Harrison brought Nathaniel's daughter to Metropolia? What if he finds out?"

Nathaniel remained unaware of Charlotte's true parentage—a fact both Arabella and Isabella knew intimately.

Arabella waved a dismissive hand. "No rumors have surfaced. Clearly, he's still clueless."

"The truth always comes out," Isabella hissed, her gaze locked on Charlotte. "That child can't stay here."

Arabella's smile turned predatory. "Then we'll remove her. Permanently."

Her attention shifted to Rosalind. Jealousy flared in her chest. Over three years, Rosalind had only grown more radiant—commanding attention effortlessly.

After her breakup with Julian three years prior, Arabella had failed to secure anyone of comparable status. She knew Julian's heart still belonged to Rosalind—his relentless pursuit over the years proving it.

Once, Rosalind had been beneath her. Now? An untouchable rival. The injustice burned.

Arabella's fists clenched. She needed someone to scar that perfect face.

She'd reduce Rosalind to the pitiful, broken creature she once was. Then Julian would never glance her way again.

Harrison, Rosalind, and Charlotte continued their meal. Rosalind suddenly stood. "Be right back. Restroom break."

Harrison nodded. "Sure."

Rosalind grabbed her phone and headed down the corridor.

As she turned the corner, two masked figures materialized from the shadows. They seized her arms with bruising force.
###Chapter 651
Rosalind froze mid-step, her emerald eyes narrowing into slits as she took in the two shadowy figures blocking her path. "Release me this instant!" she demanded, her voice laced with venom.

The men tightened their hold, their faces obscured by the dim alley's darkness. "Bad timing, princess," one growled. "We've got orders to make sure that pretty face of yours never sees daylight again."

Rosalind's breath hitched. Someone had actually hired assassins to disfigure her?

"Who sent you?" she spat, struggling against their iron grip. "Tell me!"

The second man chuckled darkly. "Wouldn't you like to know? Just know your modeling days are over."

She twisted violently, but their strength was overwhelming. One clamped a gloved hand over her mouth as she screamed.

"Feisty little thing," the first muttered. "Hurry up—slice her up good before someone hears."

A glint of steel flashed as a blade was drawn. Rosalind's pulse skyrocketed as the cold metal neared her cheek.

Adrenaline surged through her veins. With a sudden jerk, she drove her knee into one attacker's groin. His agonized yowl echoed off the brick walls as he crumpled.

Seizing the moment, she bit down hard on the other's hand. He howled, loosening his grip just enough for her to wrench free.

"Bitch!" they snarled in unison as she sprinted down the alley. "You're dead!"

Rosalind's lungs burned as she fled, their pounding footsteps closing in. "HELP!" she shrieked, her voice raw with terror. The deserted street offered no salvation.

Then—impact.

She collided with a solid wall of muscle, stumbling back with a gasp. Looking up, her blood ran cold.

A masked figure loomed before her, his face completely concealed by black fabric. Only his piercing eyes were visible beneath the hood.

The thugs skidded to a halt behind her. "Back off, freak!" one brandished his knife. "This doesn't concern you!"

The blade arced toward Rosalind's face—

A blur of movement. The masked stranger's boot connected with the attacker's ribs, sending him flying into a dumpster with a sickening crunch.

"Last chance," the savior's voice was a velvet growl.

Something about that timbre sparked recognition in Rosalind's mind. Those broad shoulders, that commanding presence... Had they met before?

The remaining assailant lunged. The masked man moved like lightning—one fluid motion, and the would-be killer was sprawled unconscious on the pavement.

As he turned toward her, Rosalind caught a glimpse of sharp jawline beneath the mask. Whoever he was, danger radiated from him like heat from a furnace.

And yet... she'd never felt safer.
###Chapter 652

Rosalind stood frozen, her mind elsewhere as two shadowy figures drew gleaming blades from their belts. In one fluid motion, they charged toward the masked stranger, steel flashing under the streetlights.

The mysterious man remained silent. His body moved with lethal grace, each motion radiating an aura of controlled violence that made the air itself seem to tremble.

Within moments, both assailants lay motionless on the pavement.

"Rosalind!" Harrison's voice cut through the night as she arrived with Charlotte in hand. "What happened here?"

"I'm... I'm alright," Rosalind managed, though her hands still shook.

Her gaze darted back to the masked savior. Having dispatched his opponents, he was already turning to leave.

"Wait!" Rosalind called desperately. "Who are you?"

The figure paused mid-step but didn't turn.

Watching his retreating silhouette, she tried again. "Do I know you?"

Silence.

"Thank you... for saving me," she whispered.

Without acknowledgment, the masked stranger melted into the crowd, leaving only an unsettling chill in his wake.

Harrison was already on the phone with authorities. "Do you recognize him?" she asked urgently.

Rosalind shook her head. "Not at all."

Charlotte tugged at Rosalind's sleeve with wide eyes. "I was so scared for you."

Rosalind managed a weak smile, tousling the child's hair.

"Someone clearly wants you dead," Harrison stated grimly. "We'll find out who sent these men. Let's get you home."

But Rosalind didn't move. "You go ahead. There's something I need to do."

Harrison grabbed her arm. "Where could you possibly need to go now? After him?"

Rosalind said nothing.

"That man... he moved just like Everett," Harrison observed quietly.

Before another word could be spoken, Rosalind was sprinting down the street.

Charlotte looked up at her mother. "Why is Rosalind crying?"

Harrison knew Everett Sinclair. And that masked figure had carried himself exactly the same way.

Rosalind had claimed she'd moved on, that Everett was part of her past. Yet at the slightest resemblance, she'd abandoned all caution.

Three years. Three long years, and she still hadn't let go.

Scooping up Charlotte, Harrison answered simply, "She's going to find someone very special."

"Does she love him?" Charlotte asked innocently.

Harrison's smile was bittersweet. "More than anything."

Meanwhile, concealed in darkness, Arabella's nails dug bloody crescents into her palms.

Those assassins had been her doing - paid handsomely to carve up Rosalind's perfect features.

She'd been so close. One more second and-

Then that masked interloper had ruined everything.

The rage threatened to choke her.

Rosalind burst onto the crowded boulevard, shoving through the evening throng.

Her eyes darted frantically across every face, searching for that impossible familiarity.

Could it really have been him?

But the sea of strangers yielded nothing.

"Everett!" she cried desperately. "EVERETT!"

Then - a glimpse. That unmistakable posture across the street.

She lunged forward without thinking.

A car horn screamed.

Tires screeched.

Headlights blinded her.
###Chapter 653

Rosalind stood paralyzed as the speeding vehicle hurtled toward her.

At the critical second, a powerful arm encircled her waist, pulling her against a firm chest. The car's side mirror grazed her sleeve as it roared past.

Heart pounding, Rosalind tilted her head upward.

There he was.

The masked stranger she'd been desperately seeking now stood before her in broad daylight.

"It's you," she breathed.

Everett released her carefully, his deep voice steady. "You've been searching for me?"

"Yes," she confirmed without hesitation.

"Pay attention to your surroundings next time," he advised coolly, already turning to leave.

Rosalind rushed after him. "Who are you? We've met before—I know we have."

His response was flat. "We're strangers."

"That's impossible!" She grabbed his sleeve. "You saved me twice today—first from those armed men, now this. Why?"

"Basic human decency," he replied without emotion.

Rosalind's grip tightened. "You're lying. I recognize you."

A pause. Then quietly: "Are you mistaking me for someone you loved?"

The question struck like lightning. Her fingers trembled slightly. "Someone I... used to love."

Everett went still. "I see."

There was something heartbreaking in his tone.

"Why the mask?" Rosalind pressed, matching his stride. "What are you hiding from me?"

A shrug. "Not hiding. Just sparing people the horror of my face."

Horror?

Preposterous!

Everett had been campus royalty—girls had literally fought over his attention. That chiseled jawline, those piercing eyes. This scar story didn't add up.

"Prove it," she challenged. "Remove the mask."

"Go home, Rosalind."

She planted herself in his path, fiery determination in her hazel eyes. "Not until I see your face."

Everett studied her stubborn expression. "I'm not who you think I am."

"Then show me."

"You truly want this?"

"More than anything."

"Very well."

Rosalind's pulse skyrocketed. Closing the distance, she reached for the black fabric concealing his features.

This was Everett Sinclair. She'd bet her life on it.

The mask slipped away—revealing a nightmare landscape of twisted flesh. No trace remained of the handsome student she remembered, only grotesque scarring.

She recoiled instinctively, hand flying to her mouth.

Wordlessly, Everett replaced his mask. "Satisfied? Am I your lost love?"

Rosalind shook her head, mortified. "I... I was wrong. Forgive me."

"Go home."

"Thank you. For everything today."

A curt nod. Then he vanished into the crowd, leaving Rosalind standing frozen on the sidewalk, her world turned upside down.
###Chapter 654
Rosalind stood motionless for a long moment before turning away. She and the masked stranger walked in opposite directions, their figures gradually swallowed by the distance until neither remained in the other's line of sight.

The moment she stepped into Rosewood Manor, Lillian came rushing out. "Rosalind! You're home!"

Rosalind blinked in surprise before pulling her into a tight embrace. "What are you doing here today?" Lillian grinned. "Research team got an unexpected day off. I couldn't wait to see you."

"Perfect timing. I'll have Beatrice prepare your favorite dishes—you're still at that growing age after all."

Her smile faltered as Lillian studied her face. "I saw you from the window, walking with your shoulders slumped. Something's bothering you. Weren't you supposed to meet Harrison today? Did something happen?"

Three years had transformed Lillian from a gangly schoolgirl into an elegant young woman of eighteen. As one of Westfield University's brightest research prodigies, she immediately sensed the shift in Rosalind's mood.

Rosalind's lips twitched into a strained smile. "I thought I saw Everett today..."

Lillian's breath caught. "Everett? Where? He's been gone for three years—I haven't heard a single word from him!"

"It... wasn't him. Just someone who resembled him. My mistake."

The hope drained from Lillian's eyes. After their mother's passing, Everett had been her only remaining family—until he vanished without explanation.

"Where could he have gone?" Her voice cracked as tears spilled over. "Why wouldn't he come back to us after all this time?"

Rosalind cradled her close. "I don't know where he is. Or why he never returned."

Everett Sinclair had disappeared from the face of the earth.

Did he even know how desperately he was missed?

Outside the manor's gates, a tall figure in a black mask stood vigil—the same man who'd saved Rosalind twice that day. Everett.

He hadn't revealed himself. The accident three years ago had stolen his face along with nearly everything else. When Rosalind tore off his mask earlier, the horror in her eyes had been unmistakable.

That car crash off the cliffs of Wintervale should have killed him. The villagers who pulled him from the wreckage barely recognized him as human. Months of agony followed. He survived, but the man she'd loved no longer existed.

Over the years, he'd tracked Lillian's accomplishments through news reports—state awards, international accolades, acceptance into Metropolia's prestigious Stanfern University, now pioneering rocket propulsion research. She'd surpassed all his achievements. Because unlike him, she'd had Rosalind.

For three years, Rosalind had raised his sister, fulfilled the responsibilities that should have been his.

The manor's windows glowed warm against the gathering dusk. Inside were the two women who meant more to him than life itself—the home he'd always dreamed of but could never reclaim.

The mirror showed a stranger's face now. Sometimes he couldn't even recall his own features.

Better this way.

Let them remember him as he was. Let them move forward without his shadow.

The mask settled back into place as he turned away. Some goodbyes were meant to be silent.
###Chapter 655

After Rosalind had departed, Harrison took Charlotte's small hand in hers. "Let's return to Silver Pines Hotel."

Charlotte nodded obediently. "Alright, Mommy."

"We're flying back to Florentia tomorrow. Is there anything you'd like to do in Metropolia before we go?"

"So soon?"

"Yes, darling."

"But I want to play with Mr. Charming again."

Harrison's delicate lashes fluttered in surprise. She hadn't anticipated Charlotte still clinging to Nathaniel, still yearning for his company.

"Mr. Charming has important matters to attend to right now. How about Mommy spends time with you instead?"

Before Charlotte could respond, Isabella's sharp voice sliced through the air.

"Harrison! What an unexpected encounter!"

Harrison lifted her gaze to see Isabella approaching with calculated grace.

Isabella's lips curved into a saccharine smile. "Dining with your daughter? What a coincidence—Nathaniel and I have reservations here too. Mrs. Victoria will be joining us shortly to finalize our wedding arrangements. You do know Nathaniel and I are engaged, don't you?"

Harrison studied Isabella's carefully composed expression. A faint smile touched her lips. "I wasn't aware before, but I am now. Was there a particular point you wished to make?"

Isabella's tone turned razor-sharp. "Simply that Nathaniel is my fiancé. Surely you wouldn't dream of poaching another woman's intended?"

A deep, resonant voice interrupted.

"What's this discussion about?"

Harrison looked up to find Nathaniel's imposing figure standing mere feet away.

Isabella instantly latched onto his arm. "Nathaniel, darling!"

Nathaniel's gaze flickered toward Harrison.

Harrison maintained her composure, offering a polite nod. "Good evening, Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel disentangled himself from Isabella's grasp and focused on Charlotte. "Hello, Charlotte."

The little girl's face illuminated with joy as she dashed forward. "Mr. Charming, pick me up!"

Harrison moved to intercept her daughter. "Charlotte, no. Don't trouble him."

"Quite right," Isabella interjected with false sweetness. "Where's your father, Charlotte? Shouldn't he be the one holding you?" She shot Nathaniel a meaningful glance. "She has a father, after all."

Nathaniel's chest constricted painfully. Oliver was Charlotte's father—what claim did he have to hold her?

Yet Charlotte's hopeful eyes remained fixed on him, tiny arms outstretched. "Please, Mr. Charming?"

Against his better judgment, Nathaniel's lips quirked into a reluctant smile as he lifted the child into his arms. Regardless of paternity, he couldn't resist this adorable girl.

Isabella's expression darkened, though she masked it quickly. "If you're so fond of children, we can have our own after we're married. As many as you'd like."

Nathaniel remained silent.

Harrison stepped forward. "Alright, Charlotte. You've had your moment. Let's not keep Mr. Falcon from his evening."

Nathaniel recognized Harrison's discomfort—she clearly disapproved of his interaction with her daughter. Did she fear he might harm the child?

Charlotte peered up at Nathaniel. "Mommy says we're leaving tomorrow."

Isabella's eyes gleamed with triumph.

Nathaniel stiffened, his gaze snapping to Harrison. "You're departing tomorrow?"

Harrison nodded. "Our business here is concluded. There's no reason to linger."

Nathaniel studied her. She'd only just arrived in Metropolia, and now she was fleeing again. Yet what right did he have to stop her? She had Charlotte and Oliver now—how could he disrupt their happiness?

Isabella beamed, tugging at Nathaniel's sleeve. "Your mother will be here shortly. Shall we proceed to our private dining room?"
###Chapter 656

Harrison cradled Charlotte in her arms. "Time to leave, sweetheart."

The little girl waved enthusiastically at Nathaniel. "Bye-bye, Mr. Prince Charming!"

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly. "Take care, princess."

As Harrison walked away with their daughter, Nathaniel remained motionless, his gaze fixed on their retreating figures until they vanished around the corner.

Victoria's wheelchair rolled up abruptly. "Why are you both just standing here like statues?"

Isabella gracefully stepped forward, taking the wheelchair handles from the attendant with practiced ease. "We were keeping your seat warm, Mrs. Victoria."

"Let's move to the private lounge," Victoria declared. Once settled, she turned to Isabella. "When does your father return from his trip?"

"He'll be back by Thursday. He specifically mentioned hoping Nathaniel and I could set a wedding date soon," Isabella replied sweetly.

Victoria nodded approvingly. "I've preselected several auspicious dates. Nathaniel, review them and choose one for your wedding with Isabella."

An attendant placed an embossed folder beside Nathaniel's untouched champagne flute. The gold-lettered dates shimmered under the chandelier lights.

Nathaniel didn't bother opening it. "I won't be marrying Isabella. My stance hasn't changed."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly. Both women stiffened.

Isabella's lower lip trembled dramatically. "Mrs. Victoria, you see how he treats me after everything? Three years of unwavering devotion, and he still rejects me like this. The humiliation..."

She dabbed at nonexistent tears, knowing full well Victoria was her strongest ally - Nathaniel's legendary filial piety being her trump card.

Victoria immediately patted Isabella's hand. "Don't distress yourself, dear. In our circles, parents arrange these matters. Nathaniel, you will select a date this instant!"

Her tone brooked no argument.

Nathaniel's expression remained glacial. "I'm not getting married. If someone's so eager, they're welcome to walk down the aisle themselves."

"How dare you!" Victoria's cane slammed against the marble floor. "After decades of obedience, you choose now to rebel? The Lancaster-Whitmore alliance is nonnegotiable!"

"I'll concede anything else. Not this."

"Final warning - will you comply?"

Nathaniel met her glare unflinchingly. "No."

A crystal vase shattered against his temple before anyone could react. Crimson trails snaked down his sharp cheekbones.

Isabella shrieked. "You're bleeding! Someone fetch the medical kit immediately!"

She rushed forward with a monogrammed handkerchief, only to have her wrist caught mid-air. Nathaniel's grip was like iron. "Don't touch me."

Isabella recoiled as if burned. "I can't even tend to your wounds now?"

Victoria watched the exchange, her voice shaking with fury. "Look how she cares for you! Why must you spurn such devotion?"

"If she chooses to love me, that's her concern," Nathaniel said icily, releasing Isabella's wrist. "Should I wed every woman who claims affection, you'd need a separate mansion just for daughters-in-law."

The brutal retort left both women speechless.
###Chapter 657

Nathaniel rose abruptly from his seat. "I have no appetite for dinner. I'm returning to the office."

Without sparing anyone a glance, he strode toward the exit.

"Nathaniel! Nathaniel!" Victoria called after him, her voice sharp with frustration.

Isabella's expression darkened as she watched him leave. Three years of relentless pursuit had yielded nothing but cold indifference. Yet his elusiveness only fueled her obsession.

Now, as the wealthiest heiress in the world, she was certain she could claim him.

She moved closer to Victoria, her voice laced with false concern. "Look how he treats us!"

Victoria's grip tightened on her armrest. "His behavior is unacceptable. I won't tolerate such disrespect—especially toward you."

"Please don't be too harsh on him," Isabella murmured, lowering her eyes. "It would break my heart if he suffered because of me."

"You're far too forgiving."

"It's not his fault," Isabella insisted, her tone sweet yet venomous beneath the surface. "The real problem is Harrison. She returned to Metropolia right when Nathaniel and I were about to announce our engagement. Everyone knows the Falcon and Lancaster families are destined to unite—yet she deliberately chose this moment to interfere. How calculated!"

Victoria's frown deepened. "She always did have a scheming nature."

"And that's not all," Isabella continued, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Remember how she got pregnant three years ago? Now she's back with her daughter. Oliver is the father, yet she still clings to Nathaniel, even letting her child demand to be carried by him. Like mother, like daughter—both determined to manipulate him!"

Victoria's eyes flashed with outrage. "What? That little girl dared to—?"

Isabella nodded solemnly. "I witnessed it myself."

Victoria's knuckles whitened against the wheelchair. "The Falcon bloodline is pure and noble. I've waited years for Nathaniel to marry you and produce a worthy heir. And now, that woman's child thinks she can latch onto him? Does she intend to make him a stepfather? Over my dead body!"

A faint, satisfied smile curved Isabella's lips. The thorn had been planted. Victoria now despised Charlotte as much as she despised Harrison.

This was only the beginning. The child had to disappear—only then could the truth remain buried forever.

"You know I would wait for Nathaniel forever," Isabella murmured, feigning devotion.

Victoria patted her hand. "And you have my full support."

"Thank you, Mrs. Victoria."

Victoria signaled for her maid, Beatrice, to push her wheelchair. "Has Nathaniel left?"

Beatrice nodded. "Yes. I saw him walking away with blood on his forehead. Did you argue again?"

Victoria sighed. "That stubborn boy."

"Mr. Nathaniel has always been filial. You shouldn't stay angry for long. Just talk to him."

But Victoria knew the truth—his heart belonged to Harrison.

Just then, a small, melodic voice chimed in. "Madam...?"

Victoria turned and saw little Charlotte standing there, her wide eyes filled with innocent curiosity.

Charlotte tilted her head at the wheelchair. "Why are you sitting in that?"

Victoria softened despite herself. "Sweetheart, this is a wheelchair."

"Why can't you walk?"

Beatrice opened her mouth to intervene, but Victoria waved her off. "Mrs. Victoria—"
###Chapter 658

"My legs have failed me completely now. The wheelchair has become my constant companion," Victoria murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Charlotte tilted her head in innocent confusion before nodding sympathetically. "Are you hurting? Don't worry, you'll feel better soon. Here—" She rummaged through her tiny purse and produced a glittering lollipop. "This always makes me happy!"

Victoria went utterly still. No child had ever offered her candy before.

In her youth, the Lancaster family had drilled aristocratic manners into her—lessons on poise, etiquette, and the refined tastes expected of a future matriarch. Sugary treats were considered vulgar, beneath their dignity. She'd never held something so vibrantly colored, so unapologetically artificial.

Her fingers twitched uncertainly.

With gentle insistence, Charlotte pressed the candy into her palm. "Go on! It's strawberry—the best flavor!"

Seeing the girl's radiant smile, Victoria felt an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest. The corners of her lips lifted slightly.

Then Harrison approached.

"Charlotte."

Victoria's head snapped up. Her spine stiffened at the sight of the woman she hadn't seen in three years—not since their last tense confrontation.

"Harrison? Is this...your child?"

Harrison hadn't anticipated Charlotte darting off to Victoria during her phone call. Three years had passed since their paths last crossed, since those painful words were exchanged between them.

Strangely, Harrison bore no resentment. As women navigating a world designed to pit them against each other, she understood Victoria's perspective all too well.

Taking Charlotte's hand, Harrison answered with quiet dignity. "Yes. This is my daughter, Charlotte."

Victoria studied her carefully. Time had been kind to Harrison—she still carried that same razor-sharp elegance, but motherhood had softened her edges, adding a new glow. The perfect picture of a woman who'd rebuilt her life beautifully.

"So you're the renowned Jolin I've heard so much about."

A ghost of a smile touched Harrison's lips. "Guilty as charged."

Victoria chuckled dryly. "I must admit, I admire you. You're...exceptional."

Harrison arched a brow. "Let's skip the pleasantries. If you have something to say, say it plainly."

The directness earned Victoria's respect. Intelligent women always recognized each other. "You've achieved so much. Built an empire. Raised this lovely child. So why cling to the past? Why haunt a man who was never truly yours?"

Harrison's gaze turned flinty. "You mean Nathaniel?"

"Precisely," Victoria said crisply. "The Lancaster-Whitmore alliance is inevitable. Nathaniel will marry Isabella. I won't have you confusing him any longer."

Harrison met her stare unflinchingly. "I walked away from Nathaniel three years ago by choice. I've neither contacted him nor interfered. If he chooses Isabella, they have my genuine blessing."

Victoria searched those clear eyes and found no deception. "Good. That's...good."

"I'm leaving Metropolia tomorrow."

That gave Victoria pause. "So soon?"

Harrison stepped forward, producing a small crystal vial. "I actually wanted to find you before I left. This is for you."

Victoria accepted it warily. Inside rested an assortment of jewel-toned lozenges.

Her brows knitted. "What is this supposed to be?"
###Chapter 659

Harrison met Victoria's gaze steadily. "I've prepared this medication specifically for you. Take one pill daily, and sensation will gradually return to your legs. In time, you'll walk again."

Victoria's breath caught. "What did you just say?"

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined Harrison would create medicine for her. The possibility of standing again had long been abandoned—a hope buried decades ago.

Eleanor, the maid hovering behind them, gasped audibly. "Ms. Harrison, can this truly work? Mrs. Victoria has consulted every specialist. Twenty-three years confined to that wheelchair... All doctors agreed her condition was permanent."

A faint smile touched Harrison's lips. "Permanent paralysis is already the worst outcome. What more do you have to lose? Have the pills analyzed if you distrust me. I'd expect nothing less from Falcon Enterprises' security protocols."

Victoria sat frozen, struggling to comprehend. That Harrison Sinclair—the woman she'd once scorned—would extend such mercy left her speechless.

Then Charlotte piped up with childish certainty, "Mama's the miracle doctor, Dr. Sinclair. If she says you'll walk, you will!"

Harrison adjusted her hold on their daughter. "Your paralysis resulted from childbirth complications. I diagnosed the root cause years ago but lacked one key ingredient. Now the formula is complete." She shrugged lightly. "Consider it a professional courtesy. No gratitude necessary."

Still reeling, Victoria opened her mouth but found no words.

With Charlotte balanced on her hip, Harrison turned toward the door. "We're leaving. Goodbye."

The little girl waved enthusiastically. "Bye-bye, Grandma!"

As their figures disappeared down the hallway, Eleanor trembled with excitement. "This changes everything! Dr. Sinclair has cured terminal illnesses—if she says you'll walk, it's guaranteed!" With shaking hands, she dispensed the first pill. "Take it now, madam!"

Victoria swallowed the capsule. Almost immediately, warmth blossomed in her chest, cascading downward like liquid sunlight. For the first time in twenty-three years, heat penetrated the icy numbness of her legs.

She gasped. "I... I feel something."

Eleanor clapped her hands. "Praise God! One pill daily and soon you'll—"

Tears spilled down Victoria's cheeks. She'd made peace with her prison of flesh and steel long ago. This fragile hope terrified her more than any prognosis.

"Don't mistake my words for flattery," Eleanor added quietly. "Ms. Harrison possesses genuine kindness unlike those society vipers—especially that Isabella Lancaster. No wonder Mr. Nathaniel remains obsessed with her."

Victoria stared at the empty doorway, silent.

Later at Rosewood Manor, she dialed Nathaniel's private line, only to reach Dominic.

"Mrs. Victoria, Mr. Falcon is in negotiations. May I relay a message?"

"Nothing urgent. Will he return tonight?"

"Afraid not. He's working late at headquarters."

"And his forehead injury?" Victoria's chest tightened remembering how she'd struck her own son.

Dominic hesitated. "The wound required stitches, but he refused painkillers. Said he deserved the discomfort."

Victoria's breath hitched. The pills in her pocket suddenly weighed a thousand pounds.
###Chapter 660

"Don't fret," Dominic reassured. "Mrs. Hawk's head injury has been properly attended to."

Victoria exhaled in relief. "Thank goodness."

She drifted off to sleep after ending the call. At dawn, her maid Eleanor uncorked a delicate vial and offered a pill to Victoria, who swallowed it without hesitation.

"How are you feeling today, madam?" Eleanor inquired.

A peculiar warmth blossomed in Victoria's legs, intensifying with each passing second. Tentatively, she flexed her toes.

Her legs responded.

Eleanor gasped. "Your legs—they moved!"

Victoria's heart pounded wildly. After decades of paralysis, she could finally feel her limbs obeying her commands. With trembling determination, she planted both feet firmly on the floor.

"Good heavens! You're standing! Let me assist you!" Eleanor rushed to steady her mistress.

Victoria rose shakily from the wheelchair. "Release me."

As Eleanor withdrew her hands, Victoria remained upright, swaying slightly but maintaining her balance. "You're doing it! This is miraculous!"

Victoria stared at her legs in awe. After twenty-three years, she was standing on her own.

Then her knees buckled, and she collapsed back into the wheelchair. Though she couldn't sustain the position yet, the breakthrough was undeniable. Her legs were healing.

"Madam, this is extraordinary! That medicine from Ms. Harrison works wonders!"

Victoria's eyes shimmered with emotion. "Is she departing today?"

Eleanor nodded. "Her flight leaves this morning."

"Then we must hurry!" Victoria declared. "She gave me back my legs. I must thank her personally. Prepare the car immediately—we're going to the airport!"

Within minutes, they were speeding toward Metropolia International.

Meanwhile, Harrison and Charlotte had just cleared security. The little girl clung to her mother's hand.

"Mommy, can't we stay longer?" Charlotte murmured wistfully.

Harrison smoothed her daughter's hair. She recognized the unspoken longing—Charlotte had taken to Nathaniel instantly, drawn by that unbreakable paternal bond.

A pang of guilt twisted Harrison's heart. This was one gift she could never provide.

"We'll visit again soon, darling," she promised.

Charlotte nodded obediently.

Harrison checked her watch. Boarding would commence shortly, but Oliver was nowhere to be seen. He'd promised to accompany them on the private jet back to Florentia. Where was he?

She settled Charlotte in a lounge chair. "Wait here, sweetheart. I need to call Daddy Oliver."

As Harrison stepped away, two figures in black hoodies materialized across the terminal. Their baseball caps shadowed their faces as they moved with predatory focus toward the unsuspecting child.

Harrison's phone connected after two rings. "Oliver? Where are you?"

"Ran into complications," his voice crackled through the receiver.

Her grip tightened on the phone. "What kind of complications?"

Before Oliver could respond, a child's scream pierced the airport din. Harrison whirled around—just in time to see Charlotte being snatched by the hooded figures.


###Chapter 661

Charlotte sat quietly in the chair, clutching her lollipop tightly while waiting for Harrison.

Without warning, two figures in black emerged from the crowd. One clamped a gloved hand over Charlotte's mouth and yanked her from the seat.

Her eyes widened in panic. She tried to scream for Harrison, but no sound escaped.

The lollipop slipped from her fingers and hit the ground with a soft clink.

The men moved swiftly, carrying her toward the exit.

Meanwhile, Harrison was still on the phone with Oliver. "What's going on?"

"Minor accident on the way to the airport. Nothing serious, but I'll be delayed," Oliver explained.

Harrison exhaled in relief. Just a fender-bender. She had feared worse.

"Just get here safely. I'll make sure the plane waits."

"Understood."

The call ended. Harrison turned back to Charlotte. "Sweetheart, Daddy Ollie—"

Her breath caught.

The chair was empty.

"Charlotte? Charlotte!"

Her voice echoed through the terminal, but there was no response.

Then she spotted the lollipop on the floor.

Her stomach twisted.

Charlotte was gone.

Outside, the men shoved Charlotte toward a black van.

She wasn’t going without a fight.

Sharp teeth sank into one man’s hand.

"Damn brat!" he snarled, recoiling.

Charlotte dropped to the pavement and bolted.

"Get her!"

She ran, screaming, "Mommy! Help!"

A sleek limousine pulled up just then. A maid stepped out, pushing Victoria’s wheelchair.

Victoria’s head snapped up at the desperate cries. "Charlotte?"

The little girl crashed into her arms, trembling. "They’re trying to take me!"

Victoria’s grip tightened protectively. Her glare burned into the approaching men. "Who the hell are you? Kidnapping a child in broad daylight?"

The men smirked. "Old woman, walk away if you value your life."

The maid stepped forward. "Do you have any idea who you're threatening?"

A brutal strike to her neck sent her crumpling to the ground.

Victoria gasped. "You monsters!"

The men advanced. "Hand over the kid, or you’re next."

Charlotte clung to Victoria, shaking. "Don’t let them take me!"

Victoria held her close. "I won’t."

Rough hands grabbed Charlotte. "Time to go, brat."
###Chapter 662

The men in black dragged Charlotte away, their grip unrelenting as they marched forward with purpose.

"Help me!" Charlotte's desperate cry trembled through the air, her voice laced with fear.

Victoria's fingers tightened around the armrests of her wheelchair.

"Let her go!" she commanded, her voice sharp with authority.

Then—something miraculous happened.

With a surge of determination, Victoria pushed herself up from the chair. Her legs, once thought useless, carried her forward in swift strides. She lunged toward the men, her hands outstretched to pull Charlotte free.

Charlotte's eyes widened in disbelief, shimmering with hope. "You're standing! You can walk!"

Victoria froze. In the heat of the moment, she hadn’t even realized it. Her body had moved on its own. The healing was real. She was no longer bound by the wheelchair.

The men snarled, their faces twisting in anger. "You want trouble? Fine. You're coming with us too!"

They seized Victoria roughly, shoving both her and Charlotte into the waiting black van. The engine roared to life, tires screeching as the vehicle disappeared into the distance.

At that moment, Harrison burst through the airport doors, her heart pounding. "Charlotte? Charlotte, where are you?"

Her gaze landed on a maid collapsed on the floor—one of Victoria’s attendants. Without hesitation, Harrison dropped to her knees, swiftly performing emergency needle therapy.

The maid’s eyelids fluttered open.

"Mrs. Victoria!" Recognition flickered in her eyes. "Ms. Harrison? What—what are you doing here?"

Harrison’s voice was urgent. "I brought Charlotte to the airport, but someone took her!"

The maid struggled to speak. "I saw your daughter… just now."

"Where is she?" Harrison demanded.

"Mrs. Victoria took the medicine you gave her. She stood up this morning—she came to thank you. But when we arrived, two men in black were chasing Charlotte. They knocked me out… and now both Mrs. Victoria and Miss Charlotte are gone. Those men took them!"

Harrison’s blood ran cold.

Both Charlotte and Victoria—kidnapped.

Who were these people? Why target Charlotte?

The maid grasped Harrison’s wrist weakly. "You must call Mr. Nathaniel! He’s the only one who can bring them back safely!"

Call Nathaniel?

This was his city. His territory. If anyone could find them, it was him.

And if she didn’t act now, both Charlotte and Victoria could be lost forever.

Harrison pulled out her phone, fingers flying over the screen as she dialed Nathaniel’s number without hesitation.

At Falcon Enterprises headquarters, Nathaniel sat in his office, his expression dark as he reviewed documents. The air around him was heavy, a silent warning to anyone who dared disturb him.

Dominic stood nearby, tense. Ever since Nathaniel had returned from the restaurant with a bandaged forehead, his mood had been stormy. The entire company walked on eggshells, afraid to even breathe too loudly.

Nathaniel signed the last document with a sharp stroke of his pen before glancing up. "What time is it?"

"10:00 AM," Dominic answered carefully. "Ms. Harrison’s private plane was scheduled to depart at 9:30. By now, she and Miss Charlotte should be en route to Florentia."

Dominic knew exactly what weighed on Nathaniel’s mind. Harrison was leaving today—taking Charlotte with her.

That was why Nathaniel’s mood was darker than ever. He didn’t want her to go, but he had no right to stop her.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened at the thought.

Then—his phone rang.

The sharp tone cut through the suffocating silence.
###Chapter 663

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to his buzzing phone screen—an unrecognized number flashed across the display.

Dominic moved closer, eyebrows raised. "That's not a contact I recognize. Who could be calling you at this hour?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he hesitated. With a quick swipe, he answered. A voice, smooth and achingly familiar, flowed through the receiver.

"Hello, Mr. Falcon. It's Harrison."

Harrison?

Nathaniel's breath hitched. In all his wildest imaginings, he hadn't anticipated this. She'd changed her number years ago—three, to be exact.

He'd assumed she was already airborne, halfway across the world. Yet here she was, reaching out. The unexpected contact sent a surge of hope coursing through him.

His grip on the phone turned white-knuckled, his voice barely steady. "Did you leave?"

"I was about to," she admitted, her tone strained. "But something happened. Someone took Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria!"

Taken?

Nathaniel shot to his feet, his voice razor-sharp. "What did you just say? Who took them?"

Harrison relayed the chaotic scene at the airport in rushed, fractured sentences. Without missing a beat, Nathaniel commanded, "Stay right there. I'm coming."

Dominic's expression darkened. "Are Miss Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria in danger?"

Nathaniel's eyes turned stormy. "Someone dared to snatch my family on my own territory. They'll regret it."

At the airport, Harrison and the maid paced anxiously. Then, cutting through the frigid air like a blade, Nathaniel appeared—tall, imposing, the very air around him crackling with barely restrained fury.

"Harrison!" he called.

She whirled around, relief flooding her features. "You're here! You have to find them—Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria—"

Nathaniel locked onto her gaze, seeing the raw fear there. "I will."

Dominic stepped forward. "I've already dispatched a team to pull the airport surveillance."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "And?"

Dominic's lips thinned. "Every camera in the vicinity malfunctioned today. The footage is gone."

Harrison's stomach dropped. The timing was too precise. Too deliberate.

She met Nathaniel's eyes. "This wasn't an accident. Someone disabled those cameras on purpose."

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. "This is Metropolia's central airport. Tampering with security here takes serious resources. This was planned."

Harrison nodded grimly. "They came for Charlotte. Mrs. Victoria was caught in the crossfire trying to protect her. But who would target a child?"

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "Any enemies? Anyone you've crossed recently?"

Harrison shook her head. "I just got back to Metropolia. I haven't had time to make enemies here."

A beat of silence. Then Nathaniel's voice dropped. "What about Oliver?"

Harrison blinked.

Nathaniel pressed, "Oliver is Charlotte's father. If he made an enemy, they might use her to get to him."

Harrison's throat tightened.

She shook her head again. "No. That's impossible."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "This is Metropolia. My mother was taken too. Whoever did this won't act recklessly. They'll contact us. We wait."

Harrison's voice cracked. "Wait? What if they don't? Charlotte's only three—she's never been away from me before! I can't just—"
###Chapter 664

Nathaniel's hand settled gently on Harrison's shoulder. "I understand..."

Harrison jerked away, her voice cutting like glass. "You don't! You're not even trying to help me!"

A deep crease formed between Nathaniel's brows. "Why would you doubt me? Just because Charlotte isn't my blood? You think so little of me. I wouldn't abandon her—I care about her too."

Harrison's chest tightened with panic. Charlotte was missing, and as her mother, fear clawed at her insides.

Nathaniel was right. How could she question him? Victoria had been taken too.

Every second of waiting was agony.

"I'm sorry," Harrison whispered. "I'm just... terrified."

Nathaniel exhaled. "It's fine."

Then, his gaze sharpened—Oliver had arrived.

"This is Metropolia," Nathaniel said firmly. "I'm the only one who can help you here. I swear I'll bring Charlotte and my mother back. But right now, you're coming with me."

"Where?" Harrison tensed.

"To Rosewood Manor."

Her spine stiffened. "No."

Nathaniel smirked. "Why? Afraid I'll devour you?"

Harrison scoffed. "Please. With your status, your legion of admirers, and your wealthy fiancée, someone like me wouldn't even register."

She refused to step foot in his home. They were adults—boundaries mattered.

Nathaniel saw right through her. "Fine. My office, then."

His office?

This time, he didn't let her argue. "Nothing inappropriate happens there. Stop wasting time. Charlotte and Victoria come first."

Harrison relented. "Fine."

Nathaniel guided her away, casting a glance at Oliver still searching—but he'd find nothing. Harrison was already gone.

The CEO's office was sleek, all cool tones and sharp lines—unmistakably Nathaniel.

Then Harrison saw it.

A crystal pendant rested on his desk.

The very one he'd given her years ago in that cave. Now it sat there, proof that for three years, he'd kept it close.

Her fingers hovered over it, trembling.

"Thirsty?" Nathaniel's voice came from behind, smooth and calm.

She snatched her hand back, spinning—

And collided with his chest.

She hadn't realized he was so close.

Stumbling forward, she crashed into him. His warmth enveloped her.

"Sorry," she breathed.

Harrison jerked back—only for her heel to catch. She yelped, falling backward.

Nathaniel's arm snapped out, locking around her waist. He hauled her against him, steady.

Her gaze lifted. His eyes burned into hers.
###Chapter 665

Nathaniel's striking features suddenly dominated Harrison's field of vision, so close he eclipsed everything else.

His strong hands settled possessively on the delicate dip of her waist, his voice a velvet murmur. "Are you hurt?"

Three endless years had passed since they'd last touched. That familiar citrus-and-sandalwood scent enveloped her again. Melting into his warmth made her head swim.

She jerked back to reality. Palms flattening against his broad chest, she shoved with all her strength. "I'm perfectly fine. Release me."

Nathaniel didn't budge. If anything, his grip tightened, pulling her flush against him. "What were you thinking about just now?"

Harrison's lashes fluttered. "Nothing."

"Liar." His lips curved knowingly. "You were thinking about me."

He'd always seen through her.

Their bodies aligned perfectly now—his hardened muscles against her yielding curves—and the atmosphere crackled between them. Harrison twisted away. "Let. Me. Go."

"What if I refuse?"

His arms remained an unbreakable cage.

Regret burned through her. Coming to Falcon Enterprises headquarters had been a mistake.

She writhed, icy fury flashing in her gaze. "Have you no decency? Release me now or I won't be responsible for what happens next."

Like quicksilver, she twisted in his grasp. Nathaniel felt every tantalizing inch of her, and after three years of abstinence, his restraint shattered. Heat pooled low in his abdomen.

Amusement tugged at his lips. "And what precisely do you intend to do, little rebel?"

Harrison glared up through her lashes. "Is this your game? My daughter's been taken and you drag me here—what vile scheme are you plotting?"

One arm banded around her waist while his other hand tilted her chin up.

"Do you even understand what 'taking advantage' means?" His thumb brushed her lower lip. "If I wanted that, we wouldn't be in my office. I'd have you in my penthouse bed. Then I'd propose a trade—'Sleep with me, and I'll find your daughter.'"

Harrison's eyes flashed. Before reason could stop her, her palm connected with his cheek.

The slap wasn't hard, but the sound rang through the room like a gunshot.

Nathaniel's expression darkened dangerously. "You actually hit me."

"You earned it," she shot back.

His voice dropped to a lethal purr. "You've just signed your own punishment."

Without warning, he crushed his mouth to hers.

Harrison's mind blanked. What was happening? He was kissing her—claiming her without permission!

His lips moved with bruising intensity, mapping every curve of her mouth like a man starved. Three years of celibacy had left her body hypersensitive, and against her will, a traitorous shiver ran down her spine.

Nathaniel had always been devastatingly skilled—wealth, power, and sinful expertise combined into one lethal package. Memories she'd buried came flooding back, weakening her knees.

One kiss, and her resistance dissolved like sugar in hot tea. She tore her mouth away. "Stop this—mmph!"

He swallowed her protest, tongue sweeping in to conquer.

Helpless, Harrison's fingers curled into his Brioni lapels. A soft moan escaped as his hand slipped beneath her silk blouse, tracing fiery patterns along her ribcage.

"No... oh!"

Her breath hitched as Nathaniel's touch grew bolder, igniting sensations she'd forgotten existed. The office, her missing child, their bitter history—everything faded beneath the white-hot need he awakened.
###Chapter 666

A shiver raced down Nathaniel's spine.

Harrison was like an addictive drug—once tasted, impossible to resist. That intoxicating craving set his blood on fire, burning away all self-control.

He buried his face in her silken hair, his voice rough with desire. "What were you trying to tell me?"

Nathaniel's breathing came heavy and uneven.

Harrison's lashes fluttered like trapped butterflies. A deep blush stained her porcelain cheeks. "Release me this instant!"

His lips brushed against her temple. "Your body tells a different story. It never lies."

Everything was spiraling beyond Harrison's grasp. She shoved against his chest. "Nathaniel!"

Without warning, he nipped at her earlobe. "Tell me, has Oliver ever satisfied you in bed?"

Her pupils dilated. She wanted to silence his filthy mouth. "Because I can tell you're starving for more," Nathaniel continued relentlessly.

The audacity!

Harrison's glare could have melted steel. "Have you no decency?"

A crystalline ringtone shattered the charged atmosphere—her phone.

"That's my phone! Unhand me!"

She fumbled for the device. Oliver's name flashed across the screen.

After combing the airport unsuccessfully for Harrison and Charlotte, Oliver had resorted to calling.

Harrison answered breathlessly. "Yes?"

Oliver's worried voice crackled through. "Where are you? I've searched everywhere—where's Charlotte?"

He remained oblivious to the fates of Charlotte and Victoria.

Harrison opened her mouth. "Charlotte—"

Nathaniel's lips crashed against hers, stealing the words from her tongue.

Her eyes flew wide. Was he insane? She was speaking with Ol—

"Harrison? What's happening? Are you hurt?" Oliver's voice sharpened with alarm.

Nathaniel deepened the kiss, then wrested the phone away. "Evening, Mr. Oliver."

Oliver stammered, "Mr. Falcon? Is Harrison with you?"

Harrison lunged for her phone. "Give that back!"

Nathaniel held it aloft, smirking as she strained futilely on her toes.

"Indeed she is. And perfectly... occupied."

Oliver's tone turned icy. "I don't know what game you're playing, but Harrison's been my wife for three years!"

The marriage claim hung between them.

Harrison stayed silent—this was clearly Oliver's pathetic attempt at provoking jealousy.

Nathaniel stilled. He'd suspected their marital status given Charlotte's age, but hearing it confirmed struck like a physical blow.

"Harrison is mine, and Charlotte is my daughter," Oliver pressed. "Are you truly so desperate to steal another man's family?"

The accusation hung in the air.

Harrison nearly choked on the absurdity.

Nathaniel studied her flushed face, the rapid rise and fall of her chest.

"Then consider me a thief," he purred. "Because I have no intention of returning what's rightfully mine."


GET IT NOW
###Chapter 667

Harrison sat frozen, her wide eyes locked on Nathaniel in utter disbelief. The words that had just left his lips echoed in her mind—he had openly declared his intention to become a homewrecker!

A man of Nathaniel's stature, power, and influence could have any woman he desired. Yet here he was, lowering himself to fight for another man's wife.

On the other end of the call, Oliver was equally stunned. The silence stretched between them, thick with tension.

"Anyway, I'm busy. Goodbye."

Without waiting for a reply, Nathaniel ended the call. His gaze shifted back to Harrison, who was still staring at him as if he'd grown a second head. A slow, roguish smirk curved his lips.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

Harrison shivered, her long lashes fluttering. "You shouldn't have said those things to Oliver. It'll only complicate things."

Nathaniel reached out, his fingers tilting her chin up. "Every word I said was the truth. Why shouldn't I say it? Or are you worried my words will make things difficult for you? That Oliver will demand an explanation when you return?"

Harrison hesitated. "Both, actually."

Nathaniel's grin widened. "There's a simple solution to both problems."

"What?"

"Divorce Oliver and marry me."

Harrison studied him for a long moment before responding. "You should focus on your relationship with Isabella. The alliance between the Falcon and Lancaster families is inevitable."

Nathaniel opened his mouth to argue, but she cut him off.

"Mr. Falcon, Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria are still missing. Even though you've sent people to search, I don't want to discuss anything else right now. All I care about is their safe return. Can we agree on that?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply but nodded. "Fine. Once Charlotte and my mother are back, we'll revisit this conversation."

Meanwhile, Charlotte and Victoria were locked in a dim, windowless room by the black-clad men. Trembling, Charlotte whimpered, "Where are we? I'm scared... I want Mommy..."

Victoria pulled the little girl close. "It's alright, Charlotte. We're still in Metropolia. My son will come for us soon."

Charlotte's voice was small but hopeful. "Really? Mr. Handsome will save us?"

Victoria nodded firmly. "Of course he will! So don't be afraid—I'm right here with you."

Charlotte's tiny shoulders relaxed slightly. "My Mommy will come too. She's the best."

Victoria glanced down at her legs—once crippled, now fully healed—and felt a pang of guilt.

She had never been kind to Harrison. Every encounter had been laced with warnings to stay away from her son. Yet Harrison had held no grudge, instead using her skills to restore Victoria's mobility.

Harrison truly was extraordinary.

Victoria smiled softly. "Yes, your mother is incredible."

"Mr. Handsome is amazing too. I want them to get married. They'd be perfect together."

Victoria blinked in surprise. "But isn't your mother already married? I heard she wed Oliver."

Charlotte shook her head. "No, she's been single for three years. It's just been me and her. I want Mr. Handsome to be my daddy..."

Victoria's breath caught. So Harrison had never married Oliver?

But why?

Their daughter was already so grown. What had kept them apart?

Confusion swirled in Victoria's mind. She would have to wait until they were free to tell Nathaniel and have him investigate.

Just then, the sound of a luxury car pulling up outside reached them. Moments later, the door swung open—and in walked Isabella.

The men in black were hers. With her current influence, hijacking Metropolia's airport surveillance and abducting Charlotte had been child's play.
###Chapter 668

The figures clad in black swiftly approached, bowing their heads in deference. "Ms. Lancaster."

Isabella's sharp gaze pinned them in place as she wasted no time. "Did you retrieve the girl as instructed?"

"Yes, Ms. Lancaster," one confirmed.

Satisfaction ignited in her eyes. At last, she had secured Harrison's legitimate child—the one born to Nathaniel. Once Charlotte was dealt with, her secret would remain buried forever. The suffocating weight on her shoulders lifted, allowing her to breathe freely again.

"Take me to her. Immediately!"

"Right away."

They guided Isabella to a dim, cramped chamber. A narrow window on the door revealed Victoria cradling Charlotte protectively in the corner, the grandmother and granddaughter clinging to each other.

Isabella stiffened. She blinked, doubting her vision, but the image remained unchanged—Victoria was truly there.

What in the world? Why was she here?

She whirled toward the black-clad men. "Why is there another person inside?"

"An unforeseen complication," one admitted. "When we seized the girl, this old woman intervened. She fought to protect her, so we had no choice but to bring her as well."

Damn it!

Lightning might as well have struck her. Never had she anticipated this—her future mother-in-law had been dragged into the mess.

Since when did Victoria care so deeply about the child?

A wave of dread crashed over Isabella, but fear eclipsed everything else.

She snapped at the men, "Have you lost your minds? Do you realize who she is?"

"Just some wheelchair-bound crone," one scoffed.

Victoria had lived reclusively for years. It wasn't surprising they didn't recognize her.

Isabella's fury left her speechless. "That 'crone' is Victoria Hawk!"

"What?" The man paled. "That's Mrs. Hawk?"

"Exactly! Now do you grasp the disaster you've created? Nathaniel already knows his mother is missing—and that she vanished alongside Charlotte. I wanted this done quietly, but you've dragged him into it! What now?"

Panic flickered across their faces. Everyone knew of Nathaniel's merciless reputation, and this was his domain.

"We didn't recognize her! She resisted, and we couldn't risk exposure. If Mr. Hawk finds us, we're dead men!"

They were all trapped now. There was no escape.

Isabella's expression darkened. "I'm working on a solution, but our options are limited. Nathaniel has likely set traps everywhere. One wrong move, and we're finished."

Besides, this was Victoria. Harming her was unthinkable.

"Ms. Lancaster, what's our next move?"

"Keep them confined for now. Don't lay a finger on either until I devise a plan."

"Understood."


###Chapter 669

Isabella collapsed onto the plush sofa, her thoughts spiraling as she struggled to regain composure.

What was her next step?

Victoria was missing—Nathaniel must have already discovered this. At this very moment, he was likely with Harrison, the two of them undoubtedly scheming against her.

Isabella's frustration surged. She couldn't let this perfect opportunity slip away. Harrison needed to vanish—no matter the cost.

She snatched her phone and typed a message.

Across the city, Harrison sat in the CEO's office at Falcon Enterprises. A sharp buzz from her phone interrupted the tense silence. She glanced at the screen—an unknown number.

[If you want your daughter to live, find somewhere private and answer my call. Tell anyone, and she dies immediately.]

A chill slithered down Harrison's spine. The kidnappers had finally made contact.

She had feared they might stay silent. But now that they had acted, there was a chance to exploit their weakness.

The number was masked, routed through a virtual network. These people were careful—too careful.

Nathaniel, seated across the room, looked up at the sound of her phone. "Who's messaging you?"

The kidnappers' warning echoed in her mind: No one can know.

Harrison forced calm into her voice. "Just Rosalind."

Nathaniel nodded, turning back to the documents before him.

Dominic entered quietly. "Still no sign of Miss Charlotte or Mrs. Victoria. But the good news is, the kidnappers haven't made any demands yet. That means they're still safe."

Nathaniel exhaled, unfolding a map. "Expand the search to these sectors."

As Nathaniel and Dominic pored over the plans, Harrison stood and slipped out unnoticed.

She moved to a secluded corner just as her phone rang again.

Without hesitation, she answered. "Who is this? Where is my daughter? Where is Mrs. Victoria?"

A distorted, mechanical voice responded, "They're with me."

Harrison's grip tightened on the phone. "Prove it. Let me hear Charlotte's voice."

"Fine."

A moment later, a small, trembling voice came through. "Mommy?"

Harrison's breath hitched. "Charlotte! Are you hurt?"

"I'm okay. Mrs. Victoria is here too."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Be brave, sweetheart. I'm coming for you both."

Then Victoria's voice cut in. "Harrison—"

The mechanical voice interrupted. "Enough talking."

Relief flickered—they were alive. "What do you want?"

"Go to the exclusive vineyard. There's a private event happening tonight."

A party? Harrison scoffed. "I'll go. But you swear they won't be harmed?"

"Follow my orders, and they stay unharmed. Disobey, and they suffer. And remember—no one can know. If you involve anyone else, the consequences are on you."
###Chapter 670

The abrupt dial tone echoed sharply in Harrison's ear as the call disconnected.

Her fingers tightened around the phone until her knuckles turned white. What dark secrets lay hidden within this exclusive vineyard? For Charlotte and Victoria's safety, she had no other option but to comply.

Nathaniel must never discover her mission.

Returning to Nathaniel's office, Harrison forced calm into her voice. "Rosalind requested to meet me. I'll be stepping out briefly."

Nathaniel barely glanced up from his documents. "Of course. I'll hold down the fort here. Stay safe."

Harrison offered a tight nod before slipping away.

Thirty minutes later, her heels clicked against the cobblestone path leading to the secluded vineyard estate. A uniformed attendant materialized before her. "Ms. Harrison, I presume?"

"That's correct."

"All guests must change for the event. We've prepared appropriate attire for you." The attendant presented a garment bag with gloved hands.

Harrison accepted it wordlessly.

Inside the lavish dressing chamber, she unzipped the bag to reveal a scandalous creation - an onyx slip dress with perilously thin straps, the back plunging to dangerous depths. The fabric shimmered like liquid shadow, designed to provoke.

Swallowing her revulsion, she slipped into the constricting silk.

The dress transformed her - clinging to every curve, highlighting the elegant sweep of her collarbones, the delicate slope of her shoulders. The daring back exposure revealed porcelain skin that seemed to glow under the dim lighting, a siren's call to predators.

Steeling herself, Harrison entered the pulsating chaos of the main hall. The air thickened with cigar smoke and the musky scent of expensive cologne. Dozens of men moved in frenzied rhythm to the deafening bass, their pupils dilated with illicit substances.

Every head swiveled toward her entrance.

A circle of hungry wolves closed around their new prey. "Well, well...our promised entertainment has arrived."

Harrison's glacial gaze swept across them. "Explain yourself."

Their laughter slithered over her skin. "Some anonymous benefactor called tonight - said they'd send us a prime cut of meat to celebrate our monthly gathering."

Understanding dawned like ice water. This was no rescue mission - she'd been delivered as payment.

"Darling, that skin looks smoother than satin."
"That waist could fit in my hands...let's see how long you last tonight."
"Allow me to be the first to taste-"

The boldest reached out, fingers aiming for her cheek. Harrison moved like lightning - seizing his wrist and twisting with surgical precision.

The snap of bone echoed through the sudden silence, followed by his animalistic howl. "Bitch! Let go!"

She tightened her grip, voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "You'll answer my questions. Truthfully."

"Anything! Just release me!"

"Who contacted you?"

"No idea! We host these parties monthly. Some burner number called saying they'd send us fresh meat!"

Harrison's eyes glittered like Arctic ice. A dead end. "Show me the number."

The man fumbled with his phone, displaying the call log.

A disposable virtual number, naturally. These pawns knew nothing.

Just then, her concealed phone vibrated against her thigh.

With a dismissive flick, she sent her captive stumbling backward into his cronies. Their shocked expressions would've been comical had the situation been less dire - none had anticipated such ferocity from this delicate-looking beauty.

Harrison silenced them with a single withering glare before retrieving her phone. 

###Chapter 671

Another disposable number flashed on the screen.

These burner phones multiplied like rabbits, each tracing back to different ghost servers across the globe - completely untraceable.

The puppet master was calling again.

Harrison's finger hovered over the answer button before pressing it firmly. "Yes?"

A digitally distorted voice crackled through the receiver. "Are you in position?"

Her grip tightened around the sleek device. "I'm here."

"Did you see the entertainment I arranged for you tonight? You'd better play your part and satisfy every one of them!"

A humorless chuckle escaped her lips. "Oh I'm playing my part perfectly - serving them exactly as they deserve."

"Liar! You haven't touched a single one. You're defying me!"

Harrison's gaze turned razor-sharp as she scanned the sprawling underground wine cellar with predatory precision. "You're watching me right now, aren't you?"

The calculated bait worked instantly. Somewhere in this labyrinth of oak barrels and crystal chandeliers, Isabella was lurking in the shadows like a spider in its web.

But the space was too vast. Harrison's sweeping visual search came up empty.

The voice on the line turned venomous. "Clever little bitch!"

Harrison's lips curled into an arctic smile. "Do we have history?"

Dead air filled the line for three heartbeats.

She pressed her advantage, each word a scalpel's cut. "We do know each other. This is personal. You're targeting me and Charlotte specifically. I think I've figured it out - you're Isabella, aren't you?"

Up in the private mezzanine, Isabella's manicured nails dug into the velvet railing as she watched her prey turn the tables. She'd orchestrated this entire spectacle - luring Harrison here, surrounding her with hired predators, wanting to witness her destruction.

But Harrison was rewriting the script.

That damning question hung between them like a guillotine blade: "You're Isabella, aren't you?"

Ice water flooded Isabella's veins. She gasped audibly before she could stop herself.

"No! You're mistaken!" The denial came too fast, too sharp.

Harrison's smirk widened. "Interesting. You didn't ask who Isabella is. Just immediate denial. That confirms it's you."

Silence.

Harrison's knuckles turned white around the phone.

"I've had my suspicions. Only you would be brazen enough to move against me and Charlotte in Metropolia. But even I didn't expect this level of recklessness - kidnapping people in broad daylight at Metropolia International, even taking Victoria Hawk. Though I suspect that last part was an accident?"

Her voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Have you considered how this ends? Your pathetic obsession with Nathaniel? When Victoria learns you orchestrated her kidnapping, do you really think she'll welcome you as her daughter-in-law? You're chasing a fantasy."

Isabella's face twisted in rage. "Shut your mouth!"

Harrison's smile turned feral. Confirmation received - Isabella was behind Charlotte and Victoria's abduction.

Composing herself, Isabella hissed, "Enough distractions! Your daughter and Victoria are at my mercy. Entertain these men properly or your precious Charlotte suffers!"

Harrison shook her head slowly. "Not happening."

"Oh?" Isabella's voice dropped to a purr - then Charlotte's terrified scream pierced the line.

"No! Mommy!"

The connection went dead.
###Chapter 672

Charlotte's terrified scream sliced through Harrison's chest like a blade.

"What are you doing to her?" she demanded, her voice trembling with fury.

Charlotte's cries were ragged with fear. "Let me go! Please! Don't hurt me! Mrs. Victoria, help me!"

Victoria's frantic shouts echoed behind her. "Where are you taking her? She's just a child! Have you no conscience?"

"Mommy... please... save me!" Charlotte sobbed, her voice breaking.

Harrison's blood turned to ice. "Stop this! If you lay a finger on my daughter—"

Isabella's mocking laughter cut her off. "I warned you, didn't I? Cooperate, or your precious little girl suffers. Right now, she's being taken somewhere... Oh, I remember—she's terrified of rats, isn't she? Imagine her locked in a dark room, surrounded by them. How long before she breaks?"

Harrison's breath hitched. "No! Leave her alone!"

"I could call it off... but only if you behave." Isabella's voice turned sharp. "Entertain these men. Properly."

Harrison's gaze flickered to the circle of leering faces closing in around her.

"Strip." Isabella's command was cold. "A body like yours shouldn't go to waste."

Harrison's nails dug into her palms, her fists clenched so tight they shook.

"Tick-tock, Harrison!" Isabella's smirk was audible. "Her fate is in your hands. Three... two..."

The countdown pounded in Harrison's skull. Gritting her teeth, she surrendered. "Fine. I'll do it. Just don't touch my daughter."

Upstairs, Isabella's crimson lips curled in triumph.

The men erupted in crude excitement.

"Finally! Off with the dress—let's see what you're hiding!"

"Don't worry, sweetheart. We'll be gentle..."

"Come on! We don't have all night!"

Their vulgar taunts slithered around Harrison like venom. With icy resolve, she reached for the thin strap of her black dress, letting it slip off one shoulder.

Beneath, she wore nothing.

The men roared, pounding the tables. "Take it off! Take it off!"

Isabella watched with glee. This was the woman who had ensnared Nathaniel and Oliver. Tonight, she would be reduced to nothing more than cheap entertainment.

Phone in hand, Isabella began recording.

This footage would destroy Harrison. The brilliant Dr. Sinclair, the untouchable Jolin, exposed as nothing but a whore. Her reputation would be ashes.

"Let the show begin," Isabella murmured.

As Harrison's fingers moved to the second strap—

CRASH!

The doors exploded inward. Cold night air rushed in, carrying with it a towering, black-clad figure.

Nathaniel.

His presence was a storm. Behind him, an army of bodyguards swarmed the room, seizing control.

Nathaniel's gaze, sharp as a blade, swept over the crowd. "Arrest every last one of them."

"On it!"

As chaos erupted, Nathaniel shrugged off his coat and draped it over Harrison's bare shoulders.
###Chapter 673

Upstairs in the dimly lit corridor, Isabella's breath hitched as she witnessed the unexpected turn of events below.

Her perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms. How had Nathaniel discovered their location? She'd explicitly warned Harrison not to involve anyone - especially not Nathaniel.

The realization struck like lightning. Harrison had betrayed her trust.

Nathaniel's protective gaze swept over Harrison as he approached. "Are you hurt?" His voice carried that familiar edge of barely contained fury.

Harrison shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. "You arrived just in time."

With deliberate slowness, she lifted her phone, her eyes locking with Isabella's through the security monitor. "You're probably wondering how Nathaniel knew where to find me. I called him the moment I stepped inside."

Isabella's blood ran cold.

Harrison continued, her voice dripping with quiet triumph. "All those warnings about keeping this between us? You only cared about keeping Nathaniel in the dark. So I did the one thing you didn't want - I brought him right to your doorstep."

The monitors flickered as Isabella's hands trembled. Once again, Harrison had outmaneuvered her. Every confrontation, every carefully laid plan - they all crumbled against Harrison's uncanny ability to turn the tables.

Harrison's piercing gaze swept across the wine cellar's security feeds. "Nathaniel's men have this place surrounded. You should be more concerned about your escape route than your revenge tonight."

The call disconnected with finality. Upstairs, panic clawed at Isabella's throat. The winery was now a gilded cage, and Harrison had been the bait all along.

She had to move. Now.

Downstairs, Nathaniel's fingers lingered as he fastened the top button of Harrison's trench coat. "She's still here somewhere," Harrison murmured.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "We'll find her."

Harrison exhaled slowly. "At least Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria are safe. She wouldn't dare harm them - they're her only leverage now."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Every exit is covered. She won't slip through this time."

One of the captured thugs suddenly recognized Nathaniel and began babbling pleas. "Mr. Falcon, we didn't know she was yours! Have mercy!"

Nathaniel moved with lethal grace. His boot connected with the man's chest, sending him sprawling across the stone floor. Blood speckled the man's lips as he gasped for air.

"You looked at my wife." Nathaniel's voice was colder than the cellar's temperature. "That's a death sentence."

The man paled. "W-wife? We didn't know!"

Nathaniel pulled Harrison against him, his arm possessive around her waist. "You're all lucky she's the merciful one."

Harrison placed a restraining hand on Nathaniel's chest. "We have bigger priorities tonight."

The thugs groveled, swearing repentance. Nathaniel delivered one final kick. "Get out of my sight before I change my mind."

As the men were dragged away, Harrison felt Nathaniel's grip tighten. "I should have blinded them," he growled.

Harrison tilted her head. "Why? What did they actually do to you?"

The unspoken plan between them hummed in the air. This entire evening had been orchestrated - a carefully laid trap with Harrison as the irresistible lure.

And Isabella had taken the bait.
###Chapter 674

Nathaniel's grip on Harrison's wrist tightened as his dark eyes burned with possessive fury.

The sight of her in that crimson silk dress had nearly undone him when he'd entered the private winery earlier. The way those men had been leering at her—it took every ounce of his self-control not to break their necks right then.

"You've never dressed like this before," he murmured, his voice rough. "And I won't let them walk away after seeing you like that."

Harrison rolled her eyes. "You're just as bad as they are."

A slow, dangerous smirk curved Nathaniel's lips. "Of course I am. But I'm the only man who gets to see you like this."

When he'd first spotted her standing there, the candlelight casting shadows over her bare shoulders, he'd wanted to drag her away and lock her somewhere no one else could ever lay eyes on her.

Harrison shot him a pointed look, silently reminding him they still had to find Charlotte and Victoria.

Just then, Dominic approached. "Mr. Falcon, Ms. Harrison."

Harrison's pulse spiked. "Did you find her?"

Dominic shook his head. "We've turned the entire estate upside down. No sign of Isabella."

Harrison clenched her fists. "She slipped away again."

She wasn't entirely surprised. Isabella had been bold enough to show her face here—of course she'd planned an escape route.

Nathaniel's hand settled on the small of Harrison's back. "Let's go."

She nodded.

By the time they returned to Falcon Enterprises, night had fallen. Nathaniel studied her. "You're certain it's Isabella?"

"Absolutely." Harrison's jaw tightened. "But I don't have proof. I get it if you don't believe me."

She stood abruptly. "She's your fiancée. It's natural you'd take her side."

She turned to leave, but Nathaniel caught her wrist.

"Are you angry?"

Harrison didn't look back. "Why would I be? It's understandable."

Nathaniel chuckled. "I didn't say I didn't believe you. I do. After tonight, she won't dare touch Charlotte or my mother again."

Harrison finally met his gaze. "You really believe me?"

"I do." His thumb brushed over her pulse point. "We'll regroup tomorrow. For now, we rest."

Harrison exhaled. He was right—they'd been running on adrenaline all day.

Isabella wouldn't make another move tonight. Not now that they were onto her.

"Alright," Harrison relented. "I'll go stay with Rosalind—"

Nathaniel pulled her back. "You're staying here."

Harrison blinked. "In your private suite?"

His grip tightened. "Where else?"

"I really think I should—"

"What if there's news about Charlotte in the middle of the night?"

Harrison hesitated.

Nathaniel's voice dropped. "Stay."
###Chapter 675

Harrison's footsteps halted abruptly.

Nathaniel was too perceptive—he knew precisely how to target her vulnerabilities.

His voice turned grave. "I'm certain it was Isabella. But if she calls tonight and I can't reach you, wouldn't that jeopardize Charlotte and my mother's rescue?"

Harrison hesitated, realizing his logic was sound. Saving Charlotte and Victoria was the priority.

Yet she bit her lip. "If we both stay in your lounge tonight, rumors could spread. Your fiancée might misunderstand."

Fiancée?

A dangerous glint flickered in Nathaniel's eyes. If Isabella dared harm Charlotte or Victoria, she'd regret it.

He closed the distance between them, his imposing frame casting a shadow over her. "Are you suggesting we do something inappropriate tonight?"

Harrison shivered at his proximity, eyes widening. "Inappropriate? If you're hallucinating, perhaps consult a psychiatrist."

Amused by her sharp retort, Nathaniel smirked. "Since you're clearly uninterested, nothing will happen. Even if word gets out, what could they possibly say?"

Harrison remained silent.

He continued smoothly, "Relax. You'll take the bed. I'll sleep on the couch. You'll be perfectly safe."

Seeing no alternative, Harrison nodded. "Fine."

Nathaniel guided her into his lounge.

The space was expansive, decorated in his signature cool-toned aesthetic. Harrison scanned the room, noting the absence of feminine touches—only his personal grooming items sat neatly arranged.

She arched a brow. "No women's toiletries here?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "None. I've been celibate for three years. No woman has ever stayed at Rosewood Manor."

Harrison blinked in surprise. At his age and status, resisting temptation for so long seemed improbable.

Nathaniel dialed Dominic. "Deliver a full set of women's toiletries immediately."

Hanging up, he met her gaze. "Go ahead and shower. The supplies will arrive shortly."

Harrison nodded. "Alright."

She still wore Nathaniel's tailored coat. Unbuttoning it, she slipped the garment off, revealing the sleek black dress beneath. As she turned away, the open back exposed her flawless skin—the delicate dip of her spine, the elegant curve of her waist, the subtle swell of her hips. Three years had refined her figure into something devastatingly alluring.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened, lingering longer than intended.

Harrison moved toward the bathroom when suddenly—her heel caught. A gasp escaped as she stumbled backward.

"Watch out!"

Nathaniel's arms shot out, catching her effortlessly.

She collided against his chest. His palm splayed across the small of her back, skin searing where they touched. His throat tightened.

Heart racing, Harrison murmured, "I slipped. Thank you."
###Chapter 676
Harrison attempted to rise from her position.

In that instant, Nathaniel took several deliberate steps backward, his grip on her unyielding as he pressed her slender waist firmly against the marble vanity. The cold surface bit into her skin as he effectively caged her between the counter and his powerful frame.

A tremor ran through Harrison's body. "Release me this instant!" Her voice wavered despite her command.

Her palms flattened against the solid wall of his chest, pushing with all her might—yet he didn't budge. Instead, Nathaniel pulled her closer until their bodies aligned, the thin barrier of fabric doing little to disguise the heat between them. His voice dropped to a gravelly whisper. "Stay. Still."

Harrison froze, her breath hitching as she registered the unmistakable evidence of his arousal. Crimson flooded her porcelain cheeks. "Have you lost your mind?!"

"I'm only human," Nathaniel countered, his jaw tight. "Three years without touching a woman, and now you're standing there looking like that? What did you expect?"

Her fingers curled into fists against his shirt. "Let. Me. Go."

"Keep squirming like that, darling, and I won't be responsible for what happens next."

Harrison went rigid.

Nathaniel seized the opportunity to tilt her chin up, capturing her lips in a searing kiss that left her gasping.

She shoved him away, her eyes blazing. "We had an agreement! One more stunt like that, and I'm walking out that door!"

The threat worked. Nathaniel released her with a frustrated exhale. "Fine. Go shower."

Harrison scrambled backward, putting several feet between them.

A sharp rap at the door interrupted the tension. Dominic's voice filtered through. "Mr. Falcon, I've brought the items you requested."

Nathaniel wrenched the door open, snatched the bag, and dismissed his secretary with a terse, "Leave."

The door clicked shut. He extended the bag toward Harrison without a word.

"Thank you." She inspected the contents—luxury toiletries, skincare, and... Her fingers closed around silky fabric. Her expression darkened.

"Care to explain this?" She flung the offending garment at him.

Nathaniel caught the scrap of lace and satin, his eyebrows shooting up. The "sleepwear" consisted of two translucent triangles connected by flimsy straps.

His mouth opened, then closed. "This isn't—Dominic clearly misunderstood my instructions."

Harrison's blush deepened to scarlet. "Birds of a feather! No wonder your employees act this way!"

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose. For once, he was genuinely innocent.

Watching her furious expression, a slow smirk curved his lips. "Since you've already convicted me, I might as well enjoy the sentence. You're wearing this tonight." He advanced on her. "Shall I help you change?"

Harrison's eyes widened. "You're revolting!"

She bolted into the bathroom, slamming the door and twisting the lock.

A low chuckle rumbled in Nathaniel's chest as he stared at the closed door.
###Chapter 677
The steady rhythm of shower water still echoed from the bathroom—Harrison was finishing her shower.

Nathaniel lingered by the floor-to-ceiling windows, pushing them open to let the crisp night air wash over him. The breeze did little to cool the heat simmering beneath his skin.

Just the memory of Harrison's curves—the way her body moved with effortless grace—sent a pulse of desire through him.

Three years. Three years since he'd last held her, since their bodies had tangled in desperate passion. The recollection alone was enough to make his restraint waver.

He hadn't realized just how much he'd missed her until now.

The water shut off. Nathaniel closed the window just as the bathroom door clicked open.

Having discarded the ruined lingerie, Harrison had instead slipped into one of Nathaniel's crisp white dress shirts.

The fabric swallowed her petite frame, the hem brushing mid-thigh. Her toned legs stretched endlessly beneath the oversized shirt, her feet tucked into plush hotel slippers. Damp chestnut waves cascaded down her back, the scent of jasmine and vanilla clinging to her skin.

She looked like temptation incarnate—ripe, irresistible.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened as it trailed over her. Harrison narrowed her eyes. "Keep staring and I'll pluck those pretty eyes right out of your skull."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Always so violent."

Harrison huffed, marching toward the plush sofa in the suite's lounge area. "I'm sleeping here tonight."

The sofa was wide enough to be comfortable, with velvet cushions that promised decent rest. She flopped onto it decisively. "You take the bed."

Nathaniel prowled closer. "Absolutely not. The bed is yours."

Harrison crossed her arms. "This is your suite. I'm already intruding—"

"Do you honestly think," Nathaniel interrupted smoothly, "that I'd let a woman sleep on the couch while I take the bed?"

Before she could protest, he scooped her up effortlessly, cradling her against his chest.

Harrison kicked out, her bare feet flailing. "Put me down, you overgrown—"

Nathaniel deposited her onto the king-sized bed with exaggerated care. "Stop fighting. You're sleeping here."

Harrison opened her mouth to argue.

"One more word," Nathaniel warned, his voice dropping to that dangerous timbre she knew too well, "and we'll both sleep in this bed."

Together.

Harrison immediately yanked the duvet over herself, burrowing into the pillows. "Fine. Enjoy your couch, then."

Nathaniel chuckled, reaching out to pinch her cheek before turning toward the bathroom.

Alone, Harrison exhaled sharply, listening as the shower started again.

This had been a mistake. Coming here. Staying. After three years apart, she never imagined they'd end up sharing a roof again.

Her phone buzzed—the "Gilded Roses" group chat with Rosalind and Gabrielle lighting up.

[Harrison, you back home yet?] Gabrielle had sent.

Neither knew about Charlotte's kidnapping. Harrison wouldn't burden them with that.

[Still in Metropolia,] she typed.

Rosalind replied instantly. [What?? You're still here and didn't come see me?]

[Got held up with something,] Harrison answered vaguely.

[What something?] Rosalind pressed.

Harrison hesitated, then admitted, [I'm at Nathaniel's place.]

Gabrielle's response was immediate. [WAIT. You're with Nathaniel Hawk right now? So does this mean you two are finally—]

Harrison threw her phone onto the nightstand before the rest of that sentence could appear.
###Chapter 678
Harrison remained silent. She couldn't fathom what outrageous scenarios Gabrielle was conjuring in that imaginative mind of hers, always "leaping to the most scandalous conclusions."

Harrison fired back, [There's absolutely nothing between him and me!]

Meanwhile, Nathaniel stood beneath the shower's icy spray, the faint chime of WhatsApp notifications barely audible over the rushing water. Harrison was clearly engrossed in a conversation with someone.

The cold water cascaded over his toned physique, droplets ricocheting off his skin, yet it did nothing to extinguish the heat coiling inside him. Every time his thoughts drifted to Harrison sprawled across his bed, his mind wandered into dangerous territory.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, his dark eyes fluttering shut as his hand trailed downward.

"Harrison," he murmured, voice rough.

Outside, Harrison perked up. "Hmm?"

"What are you doing?" Nathaniel pressed.

"Just texting friends," she replied breezily.

"Male friends?" His tone sharpened.

Harrison scoffed. "That's none of your business."

A low chuckle rumbled from the bathroom. "After everything I've seen of you, I'd say it is."

"Nathaniel!" she snapped, cheeks flaming.

Hearing his name in that indignant, lilting tone sent Nathaniel's control snapping. His mind blanked, consumed by the image of her beneath him.

Unaware of the storm she'd stirred, Harrison turned back to her buzzing phone.

The "Glamour Girls" group chat had exploded again.

Gabrielle teased, [Three years without a man, Harrison. Are you sure you're not tempted by Mr. Falcon?]

Harrison rolled her eyes.

[Don't ignore me!] Gabrielle prodded. [We're best friends—spill the details!]

Heat crept down Harrison's neck, staining her ears pink. She had no such thoughts about Nathaniel.

Just then, the bathroom door swung open. Nathaniel emerged, towel slung low on his hips, damp hair tousled. The black silk robe hung open, revealing sculpted abs and powerful thighs.

Harrison averted her gaze—though not before appreciating the view. She'd never denied Nathaniel was devastatingly attractive. A man who'd held Isabella's obsession for years clearly had lethal appeal.

"See something you like?" Nathaniel smirked, toweling his hair.

Harrison feigned indifference. "Not at all."

Her phone buzzed again. Gabrielle, impatient with texts, had sent voice messages.

Harrison hit play—and Gabrielle's suggestive purr echoed through the room:

"Darling, three years is too long. Mr. Falcon is rich, gorgeous, and built like a god. Just throw him onto that bed and ride him into sunrise. You'll thank me later."

Harrison choked, scrambling to silence the messages. But the damage was done.

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto hers, molten and predatory.

Mortified, Harrison squeezed her eyes shut, mentally cursing Gabrielle to the moon and back.
###Chapter 679

Nathaniel let the towel slip from his fingers, his muscular frame moving with predatory grace as he stalked to the edge of the bed. His piercing gaze pinned Harrison beneath him like a butterfly under glass.

"Tell me the truth. Was Gabrielle lying?"

Harrison's eyes flew open, her breath hitching. "Every word out of her mouth was nonsense!"

"Liar," Nathaniel murmured, the word dripping with dark amusement.

He already knew the truth. Gabrielle's confession had ignited something primal in him - a savage satisfaction that Harrison had been just as tortured by their separation as he had.

His fingers closed around her delicate chin, tilting her face up. "Three years without being touched? Is that really possible?"

The thought baffled him. She was married to Oliver, for God's sake. How could any man resist her? When Gabrielle first revealed Harrison's secret, shock had rendered him speechless. Then came the flood of possessive triumph.

"Stop twisting Gabrielle's jokes into something serious," Harrison protested, her voice trembling.

Nathaniel wasn't having it. "Your best friend wouldn't lie about this. Why hasn't Oliver claimed what's mine?"

Harrison's lips parted. "I-"

"Were you thinking of me?" Nathaniel's voice dropped to a growl. "Dreaming of me?"

Silence.

Damn her.

Gabrielle's careless compliments about his wealth and looks had clearly gone to his head - not that they weren't true. But Harrison refused to feed his ego further.

She slapped his hand away. "For the last time, Gabrielle was teasing. That's what friends do."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "Do you want this?"

Before she could react, he seized her wrist, pressing her palm against the hard planes of his chest. The silk robe parted as he guided her hand lower, over the ridged landscape of his abdomen.

"Is this what you've been craving?"

Three years of celibacy made Harrison hypersensitive. The heat of his skin, the flex of muscle beneath her fingertips - it short-circuited her brain. A furious blush spread across her cheeks.

She tried jerking away. "Have you lost your mind? Back off!"

Nathaniel's grip tightened, his smirk turning wicked as he dragged her hand lower. "Liar. Your body betrays you."

Harrison gasped, wrenching free as if burned. "Y-You're disgusting!"

In one fluid motion, Nathaniel caged her beneath him, his knee sinking into the mattress. "Feel that? I'm hard for you again. Took care of myself in the shower thinking about you, but it wasn't enough."

Understanding dawned. That's why he'd been calling her name earlier - the bastard had been pleasuring himself to thoughts of her.

Harrison twisted like a wild thing, scrambling backward.

Nathaniel caught her ankle with effortless grace, yanking her back beneath him. "Running only makes me hungrier."

His mouth crashed down on hers.

Harrison fought, but his kiss demolished her defenses. Three years of deprivation made her body traitorously responsive. As his tongue conquered hers, she melted against him with a broken whimper. "Nathaniel...stop...mmm..."

He felt the exact moment she surrendered, her curves molding to him. Just like before. Her body remembered what her pride denied.

When his fingers found the hem of her shirt, Harrison jerked back to reality. "Nathaniel!"
###Chapter 680

Nathaniel's desperate kisses rained down on Harrison's face, his lips tangling in her silken hair as his hands roamed possessively.

"Stop fighting me. Your body betrays you—trembling with need even as you protest," Nathaniel growled against her skin.

"I'm not!" Harrison gasped, her voice breaking.

"Surrender to me," he commanded, tearing her blouse open with one sharp motion. His iron grip pinned her delicate wrists to the mattress as he claimed her with ruthless determination.

Harrison's brows furrowed in defiance. With a sharp intake of breath, she sank her teeth into Nathaniel's shoulder with all her strength.

The bastard deserved it.

A hiss escaped Nathaniel's lips as white-hot pain radiated through his body. Yet the sting only fueled his desire, sending electric pleasure coursing through his veins.

Tears spilled from Harrison's eyes. How had she ended up in Nathaniel's arms again? Her heart screamed resistance, but her traitorous body arched toward his touch.

Nathaniel's lips brushed her damp cheeks, tasting salt. "Why the tears?" he murmured, cradling her face with unexpected gentleness.

Through her blurred vision, Harrison glared up at him. "You're despicable!"

His mouth curved into a wicked smile. "I know. Now stop crying."

Fury ignited in Harrison's chest. "I'm married to Oliver! I'm his wife! How dare you—"

The mention of Oliver's name ignited a wildfire in Nathaniel's gaze. "Does your precious husband know how responsive you are in my arms? Three years of marriage, yet he's never claimed you. Let me do what he couldn't—I've fantasized about this every damn night."

The raw confession hung between them.

Harrison bit down harder, her sharp teeth breaking skin. Blood bloomed beneath her lips as Nathaniel gritted his teeth, his eyes darkening to crimson. He crushed his mouth against hers in a punishing kiss.

"You have no idea how much I've craved you," he rasped against her lips. "Countless nights spent aching for you. Dozens of women thrown at me—none of them mattered. One glance from you, and I'm undone."

His fingers intertwined with hers, locking them together in an unbreakable hold.

"Knowing you belonged to Oliver these past years—that you lived where I couldn't reach you—drove me mad with jealousy. But fate's irony—he never even touched you."

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a primal growl. "Tonight, Harrison, you're mine."

Three years of restraint shattered as he finally claimed what he'd longed for. He would brand her with his touch, mark her as his once more.

Harrison could only gasp as waves of pleasure overwhelmed her, her final broken words lost between ragged breaths: "You're... insufferable..."

Dawn's pale light filtered through the curtains as Harrison stirred, every muscle protesting. She felt thoroughly ravaged—her body no longer her own. Only concern for Charlotte and Victoria's safety kept her from sinking back into the pillows.

She shifted slightly and found herself cocooned in Nathaniel's embrace, his arms locked around her even in sleep.

Her gaze traced the angry red scratches marring his chest and back—her handiwork from last night's passionate battle. The memory of his relentless possession made her cheeks burn.

She hadn't scratched him nearly hard enough. The bastard still deserved her wrath.
###Chapter 681

Harrison stirred beneath the silk sheets, attempting to slip away unnoticed.

The moment she shifted, Nathaniel's arms tightened around her waist. His deep voice rumbled against her ear, thick with sleep. "Awake already, darling?"

She pressed her face into his bare chest without responding.

Nathaniel's usual sharp features were softened by drowsiness, his piercing gaze now hooded with lazy satisfaction. His fingers traced the curve of her cheekbone. "That silent treatment won't work on me, sweetheart. Tell me what's bothering you."

Anger simmered in Harrison's veins. Last night's memories flooded back - how he'd taken what she wasn't willing to give. She wasn't ready to forgive him yet.

A low chuckle vibrated through his chest as he pressed his lips to her forehead. "Even when you're furious, you're breathtaking."

Her fingers found the hard planes of his abdomen and pinched sharply.

In one fluid motion, Nathaniel flipped her beneath him, his body caging hers. "If last night wasn't enough, we can certainly continue now."

A shiver ran down her spine. He'd already drained her completely - how could he want more?

"Absolutely not!" She pushed against his shoulders. "It's broad daylight. There's still no word from Isabella about Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria. I need to focus on that."

Understanding softened Nathaniel's expression. He brushed a stray lock from her face. "No news might be the best scenario right now. Isabella's probably scrambling for solutions."

Harrison nodded. "We should get up."

"Very well."

As they dressed, Dominic entered with files in hand. "Mr. Falcon."

The secretary had arrived for their morning briefing.

Harrison exchanged a glance with Nathaniel before quietly slipping out of the CEO's office.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Rosalind: [Just heard Mr. Lancaster returned to the country this morning.]

Henry Lancaster had been abroad for weeks, but today he'd finally come back.

Harrison's pulse quickened. [Is he at the airport now?]

Rosalind replied instantly: [His plane just landed. If you hurry, you can intercept him.]

Perfect timing.

Without hesitation, Harrison headed straight for her car and sped toward the airport.

This time, she came alone - deliberately leaving Nathaniel behind. Isabella remained his fiancée, and the intricate alliance between the Falcon and Lancaster families carried too much political weight.

Charlotte couldn't become collateral damage in their family feud, and she refused to put Nathaniel in that impossible position either.

Right now, all that mattered was seeing Henry.

The airport's grand hall buzzed with activity when Harrison arrived. Her eyes immediately locked onto the commanding figure cutting through the crowd.

Three years hadn't diminished Henry's presence. Dressed in a tailored black overcoat, his aristocratic features stood out starkly against the terminal's fluorescent lights. An invisible forcefield of authority surrounded him, causing people to instinctively step aside while stealing awed glances.

This was the aura of a man who ruled empires.

His butler and personal aide trailed closely as he strode forward with purpose.

Harrison stepped directly into his path. "Mr. Lancaster. It's been too long."

Henry halted. His assistant immediately moved to intercept. "Madam, you'll need to schedule an appointment through proper channels—"

Henry raised a single gloved hand. The aide fell silent instantly.

Those piercing eyes studied Harrison's face. Of course he remembered her. Those keen, intelligent eyes hadn't changed in three years - impossible to forget.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "Ms. Whitmore. Three years is indeed a significant passage of time."

Harrison arched an elegant brow. "I'm flattered you recall."

Henry inclined his head. "I've followed your recent endeavors. Attending the Metropolia Summit as Jolin, wasn't it?"
###Chapter 682
The Daughter Returns

"Yes, I'm Harrison," she declared without hesitation.

Henry Lancaster studied the young woman before him with newfound respect. It wasn't every day he encountered someone so composed in the cutthroat world of high finance.

"How may I assist you?" he inquired politely.

Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I've just arrived in Metropolia and wished to see your family estate."

She needed to accompany Henry to the Lancaster mansion immediately.

Henry raised an eyebrow before chuckling. "You wish to tour my home?"

"Indeed. I've heard remarkable things about Lancaster Manor. Thought I should witness its grandeur firsthand."

Though uncertain of her true motives, Henry nodded graciously. "Very well. My car is waiting."

Harrison hadn't anticipated such easy compliance. "You're most kind, Mr. Lancaster."

Meanwhile at the estate, Isabella paced the marble floors anxiously. Last night's disastrous attempt to trap Harrison at the private vineyard still haunted her. Not only had the plan failed spectacularly, but she'd nearly been exposed before barely escaping.

Sleep had been impossible. She'd been awake since dawn, knowing her father would return today. During Henry's overseas trip, she'd enjoyed unchecked freedom as the heiress to the Lancaster fortune. But with him home, reckless behavior wasn't an option.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the tense silence. One of the black-clad operatives.

"Who authorized this call?" she snapped. "I explicitly said no contact unless I initiate it! Just follow the damn plan!"

Isabella couldn't risk these mercenaries making mistakes that might lead back to her.

The gruff voice responded, "We know the rules. This was supposed to be one job, but Mrs. Victoria and the girl are still our responsibility. The situation's getting hot. Price just went up."

They were extorting her now.

Isabella exhaled sharply, lowering her voice. "Understood. You'll get your bonus - just keep them hidden."

"Payment today. No delays."

"Don't push me!" she hissed. "My father's arriving any moment. Once I deal with him, you'll get your money. And remember - if my father discovers this, none of us survive!"

"Ms. Lancaster-"

Before the threat could continue, a maid's voice echoed through the hall. "Ms. Lancaster! Your father has arrived!"

Henry was home.

Isabella ended the call abruptly, forcing a bright smile as she turned toward the entrance.

The grand double doors swung open, revealing Henry flanked by his butler and personal assistant.

"Daddy!" Isabella rushed forward, arms outstretched. "You've been gone forever! I missed you terribly."

Henry smiled warmly, tousling her hair affectionately. "And I you, my dear."

As Isabella moved to link arms with him, a familiar melodic voice cut through the reunion.

"Hello, Isabella."

She froze.

Turning slowly, Isabella's blood ran cold at the sight of Harrison standing calmly behind her father.

Harrison had actually come to Lancaster Manor!

Her face drained of color, eyes widening in shock. "What are you doing here? This is my home! How dare you-"

Harrison's smile deepened, her gaze knowing. "Oh Isabella... I came especially to see you."
###Chapter 683

Isabella couldn't believe her eyes. The audacity of Harrison showing up uninvited at the Lancaster estate—home to the wealthiest man in Metropolia—was beyond comprehension.

Her voice dripped with venom. "We're not friends. This isn't a social call. Get out."

She moved to physically escort Harrison out, her fingers curling with barely restrained fury.

Harrison merely arched a brow, unmoved. She hadn't come all this way to be dismissed so easily.

A deliberate glance at Henry Lancaster. "Your father personally invited me. Surely, Mr. Lancaster, you wouldn't rescind your hospitality now?"

She knew Henry's reputation. A man of his standing didn't renege on his word.

True to form, Henry intervened. "Harrison just arrived in Metropolia. She'll stay." His tone brooked no argument as he addressed the maid. "Tea, please."

Isabella's jaw tightened. "Father!"

Henry was already walking toward the sitting area, his decision final.

Harrison met Isabella's glare with calm amusement. "The Lancaster heiress. I've heard so much about your... accomplishments. Naturally, I wanted to see for myself."

Isabella's laugh was brittle. "Cut the act. We both know why you're really here."

"Do enlighten me."

Silence.

Harrison stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "My daughter Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria were taken."

Isabella recoiled. "And? I had nothing to do with it! If you're accusing me—"

"I didn't accuse you." Harrison's gaze sharpened. "Why so defensive?"

With a scoff, Isabella turned on her heel. "Father, I'm retiring for the evening."

Henry nodded absently.

Alone with Henry, Harrison settled onto the plush sofa.

His question was direct. "Why come to me?"

"Charlotte and Victoria are missing."

Henry's frown deepened. "Who took them?"

"The Falcon and Lancaster families have history. You'd help Victoria, wouldn't you?"

"Of course. What do you need?"

Harrison held his gaze. "I think Isabella is involved."

Henry stiffened. "Impossible. My daughter wouldn't—"

"Here's what I ask." Harrison's voice was steel. "Keep her here. Don't let her leave."

A beat of silence.

"This proves her innocence. If I'm wrong, I'll apologize personally."

Henry studied her—the clarity in those sharp eyes, the unshakable conviction. Finally, he nodded. "Done."

"Thank you."

For all their differences, Henry Lancaster was a good man.

A soft voice interrupted.

"Henry, you're home?"
###Chapter 684
Harrison turned sharply at the sound of approaching footsteps. A woman in an emerald silk gown glided toward them. Eleanor Lancaster—Henry's first love—stood before them with the poise of a queen.

At forty-five, Eleanor maintained an effortless elegance that made Harrison catch her breath. The delicate lines of her face spoke of meticulous care, her hazel eyes holding decades of unspoken stories.

Harrison had never known any woman close to Henry. Rumor had it his marriage to Isabella had ended years ago over irreconcilable differences.

"Mr. Lancaster," Harrison asked carefully, "who is this? How should I address her?"

Henry's gaze flickered to Eleanor. "Ms. Lancaster will suffice. Eleanor, this is Ms. Whitmore."

The moment he said "Ms. Lancaster," Harrison noticed the brief tightening around Eleanor's eyes. A fraction of a second—then it was gone, replaced by perfect composure.

"Pleasure, Ms. Whitmore," Eleanor said, her smile polished.

Harrison inclined her head. "Likewise, Ms. Lancaster."

Eleanor turned back to Henry. "Your trip abroad lasted longer than expected. Business complications?"

Henry's jaw tensed. "I located Isabella's mother."

Harrison's breath hitched. She'd never been certain whether the woman was alive, but Henry's tone left no room for doubt—not only alive, but found.

Eleanor's porcelain skin paled. "After all these years... she survived?"

"Barely," Henry admitted. "In a coma until recently. She's awake now. I've told her everything about Isabella. She'll be returning to Metropolia soon."

A storm of emotions flashed across Eleanor's face before she smoothed her expression. "Isabella always misunderstood us. When she returns, you should clarify everything. Perhaps... there's still hope for reconciliation."

Henry's voice turned to ice.

"She chose the divorce. She walked away. That chapter is closed."

Without another word, he strode down the hall, his footsteps echoing like gunshots.

Eleanor's lips curved in a private smile before she turned back to Harrison. "Your suite is prepared, Ms. Whitmore. My staff will attend to any needs."

Harrison studied Eleanor—the way she commanded the manor like its undisputed mistress. The rumors were true: Eleanor had been the one Henry loved before political alliances forced him to marry Isabella. When Isabella discovered their ongoing connection, she'd filed for divorce without hesitation.

By all appearances, Eleanor had won.

Yet victory remained incomplete. After all these years, she remained "Ms. Lancaster"—never Mrs.

"Thank you," Harrison said simply.

Settling into the Lancaster estate, Harrison knew the real pressure point wasn't herself—it was Isabella.

Charlotte and Victoria remained Isabella's prisoners. The longer her associates went without contact, the more reckless they'd become. Desperation bred mistakes. Mistakes led to exposure.

Isabella was pacing her locked bedroom when the burner phone vibrated again. "Ms. Lancaster speaking."

Her pulse spiked. "I told you—no calls unless I initiate!" she hissed. "My father's home! If he hears—"

It wasn't just Henry. Harrison lurked in the estate like a shadow. Every creak of the floorboards set Isabella's nerves alight.

The distorted voice chuckled. "Relax. This line's untraceable. Just don't get sloppy."

"But—"

"You were supposed to meet us today. Where the hell are you? This isn't a game!"
###Chapter 685

Isabella was seething with frustration. "I'm not ditching you! My father returned unexpectedly, and there's been a complication here."

The voice on the other end dripped with suspicion. "How do we know you're not lying? You promised extra payment, yet we haven't seen a dime. Now you're a no-show—what else should we assume?"

"I'll pay you more, just not tonight," Isabella snapped, her patience thinning. "Enough with the accusations! It's late, and my father's asleep. I'm on my way now."

A tense pause. "Fine. But you'd better actually show up this time."

"How are they?" Isabella demanded.

"Unharmed. We wouldn't dare act without your say-so."

Isabella clenched her teeth. If those fools hadn’t taken Victoria, she wouldn’t be scrambling like this. Charlotte would’ve been dealt with easily.

She ended the call and slipped out of her room, moving like a shadow through the silent Lancaster estate. The grand staircase creaked under her careful steps as she reached the front door.

The moment she turned the handle, black-suited guards materialized from the darkness. "Miss Lancaster."

Isabella recoiled. "What are you doing here?"

"Securing the premises. You’re not permitted to leave."

Her pulse spiked. "Since when?"

If she didn’t get out tonight, the kidnappers would spiral. She had to go.

The lead guard stood firm. "Apologies, but you’re confined to the estate."

"Unbelievable!" Isabella’s voice slashed through the night. "Do you forget who I am? The Lancaster heiress! Cross me, and I’ll have my father ruin every last one of you!"

The guards bowed but didn’t budge. "Our orders come directly from Mr. Lancaster. No exceptions."

Her father’s doing? Impossible.

She shoved past them. "Move. Now."

Then—a voice, cool and commanding, from above.

"Isabella."

She whirled. Henry Lancaster loomed on the balcony, his silhouette cutting against the moonlight.

Isabella’s fists trembled. "Why am I being treated like a prisoner? I’m leaving!"

Before Henry could respond, another voice floated down—light, yet laced with steel.

"Where could you possibly need to go at this hour?"

Harrison.

Of course.

Isabella’s nails bit into her palms. "You." Her accusation hissed through the air. "This is your doing, isn’t it? Poisoning my father against me?"

Harrison didn’t flinch. "I advised caution, yes."

Rage blurred Isabella’s vision. Even as the Lancaster heir, she still played second fiddle to Harrison’s whispers. Three years of freedom, obliterated the moment she returned.

"Father!" Isabella’s voice cracked. "How could you side with an outsider over your own blood?"

Henry’s gaze remained steady. "Tell me where you’re going. I’ll accompany you."

A trap.

Harrison’s smile was a knife twist. "Mr. Lancaster only worries for your safety. Surely you can share this urgent midnight errand?"

The question hung, sharp as a guillotine.

Who, indeed, was worth this risk?
###Chapter 686

Isabella stood frozen, her throat tight. Harrison's slick words had backed her into a corner with effortless precision.

Henry Lancaster turned to his daughter, his gaze insistent. "Speak up, Isabella."

What could she possibly say? Remaining silent would only deepen Henry's suspicions.

"I had plans with Arabella," she finally admitted, lifting her chin. "We were going dancing at The Velvet Lounge. I just wanted a night out."

"Absolutely not." Henry's voice cut like ice. "It's far too late. You're going straight to bed."

"But Father—"

"Your mother will be returning in a few days."

Isabella's breath hitched. Her eyes widened in disbelief. "Mother? But I thought she was... gone."

"She's very much alive," Henry stated firmly. "And she's coming back to see you."

A cold dread slithered down Isabella's spine. She had spent years believing Isabella Lancaster was dead. Now, suddenly, she was returning?

If Isabella Lancaster walked through those doors, everything would unravel.

Harrison was her mother's true daughter. That bond ran deeper than blood—deeper than any connection Isabella had fabricated with Henry. With Harrison already living at the Lancaster estate, how long before the truth came spilling out?

Harrison tilted her head, studying Isabella's expression. "Your mother is coming home. Shouldn't you look at least a little happy?"

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. She despised Harrison more than anyone.

"I was abandoned in Willowbrook as a child," she spat at Henry, her voice trembling with manufactured hurt. "This is all your fault—and hers!"

Without waiting for a response, she stormed away, leaving the words hanging like poison in the air.

Harrison smirked.

Clever girl. Those words would only amplify Henry's guilt, making him more determined to compensate his "daughter."

Henry watched Isabella disappear, then turned to Harrison. "You've settled in quite comfortably. Even barging into my study now."

Harrison dipped her head in apology. "My mistake. The door was ajar. I knocked, but when I saw you speaking with Isabella, I... overstepped. Forgive me."

Henry studied Harrison's delicate features—the sharp intelligence in her eyes. None of his employees dared to be this bold.

They stepped into the study together.

That was when Harrison noticed it—a painting hanging on the far wall. A portrait of a breathtaking woman in a crimson gown, vibrant as a rose in full bloom. Isabella Lancaster.

Harrison's breath caught. She moved toward it almost unconsciously, her fingers twitching as if drawn by an invisible force.

Henry's voice cracked like a whip. "Don't touch that."

Her hand froze mid-air. She withdrew it slowly. "Apologies."

She hadn't meant to. But something about the painting pulled at her, demanding her attention.

"Is this Mrs. Lancaster?" Harrison asked softly.

Henry gave a single nod.

"Did you paint this yourself?"

Silence.

Harrison suddenly laughed—a light, knowing sound.

Henry arched a brow. "What's so amusing?"

She met his gaze, her lips curving. "You."

"Me?"

"I'm laughing because when Mrs. Lancaster was here, you were too busy chasing your first love to appreciate her. Now that she's gone, you immortalize her in paint. How tragically poetic."
###Chapter 687

Henry Lancaster's piercing gaze locked onto Harrison, his expression darkening with irritation. "You'd better watch your words!"

Everyone knew Isabella was a sensitive topic for Henry—no one dared to bring her up.

Yet Harrison not only mentioned her but openly mocked him right to his face. The audacity of this woman was staggering.

Harrison met his glare without flinching. "Tell me, Mr. Lancaster, which part of what I said was incorrect?"

Henry's jaw tightened. "There was never anything between Eleanor and me."

Harrison tilted her head, unimpressed. "If nothing happened, then why did Ms. Whitmore misunderstand?"

Henry hesitated before replying, "She was just being petty and jealous."

A sharp glint flashed in Harrison's eyes. "How amusing, Mr. Lancaster. When things go wrong, you blame her jealousy. But tell me—if there were no other women around you, what would she have to be jealous of? Or better yet, knowing how she felt, why did you keep others so close?"

Henry was rendered speechless.

Before, Isabella's theatrics had given him headaches. Now, Harrison's razor-sharp tongue left him utterly defenseless.

"What happens between me and my wife is private. It's none of your concern. I suggest you learn some restraint."

Harrison dipped her head slightly. "My apologies. I won't speak of it again. I'll take my leave now."

She turned to go but paused at the door, glancing back.

"Oh, one more thing, Mr. Lancaster. Allow me to correct you—Ms. Whitmore is your ex-wife now. So, strictly speaking, it's no longer your private affair, is it?"

Henry's glare could have burned holes through steel, silently commanding her to leave.

Suddenly, a voice echoed from the hallway. "Nathaniel, you can't just storm into Henry's study!"

Nathaniel's deep, smooth voice responded, "Where's Harrison? I heard she came here. Is she really in Mr. Lancaster's study?"

Eleanor stammered, "I—"

"Ms. Whitmore, step aside. I'm here for Harrison."

"This is Henry's private study. Perhaps you should wait outside while I inform him of your arrival."

"No need."

With a soft creak, the door swung open, revealing Nathaniel's tall, imposing figure in the doorway.

Henry's eyes lifted, his brows knitting together sharply.

Nathaniel strode in with effortless confidence, stopping beside Harrison. "Harrison, why did you leave without telling me? And what are you doing in Mr. Lancaster's study?"

Harrison hadn't expected Nathaniel to catch up so quickly. "I was just visiting Mr. Lancaster's home."

Nathaniel's lips thinned in displeasure. "Fine. But why his study? What exactly is your relationship with him?"

Henry's already foul mood darkened further. Nathaniel was looking at him as if he'd caught him in some scandalous act.

"What are you implying?" Henry growled. "Do you seriously think there's something between us? I'm old enough to be her father."

Nathaniel shot him a sharp glance. "How would I know what goes on in your head? These days, older men seem to have a peculiar fondness for younger women."

Henry was left speechless—the insult couldn't have been more blatant.

"Both of you—get out!" Henry barked.

Eleanor stepped forward nervously. "Ms. Whitmore, Nathaniel, please leave before he gets angrier."
###Chapter 688

Nathaniel grasped Harrison's hand firmly. "We're leaving."

He tried to guide her toward the door, but Harrison swiftly pulled her hand away. "You go ahead. I'm staying here for a few more days."

Nathaniel frowned, confusion flickering in his eyes. "Stay? You're not even related to Henry Lancaster! Why would you want to remain in his home?"

He had already noticed how differently Henry treated Harrison. No one else was permitted in Henry's private study, yet Harrison had been inside. The man's unusual leniency toward her was impossible to ignore.

Harrison offered a faint smile. "He's a good man. You don’t need to question his intentions."

"Good man?" Nathaniel scoffed. "You're being too trusting."

Harrison couldn’t explain the inexplicable warmth she felt toward Henry—it was as if an invisible thread of kinship bound them together, something instinctive and undeniable.

"I'm here to save Charlotte and Victoria."

"How?"

"Isabella is under house arrest. It won’t be long before she makes a mistake."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Why are you acting alone? You didn’t even tell me you were coming here."

Harrison met his gaze steadily, her clear eyes locking onto his. "Since you and Isabella are engaged, I don’t want Charlotte or me to get tangled in your family’s arranged marriage. Do you understand?"

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. "I won’t marry Isabella. Once Charlotte and my mother are safe, I’m ending the engagement. That childhood pact means nothing to me."

"You’d really refuse the Lancaster heiress?"

He pressed a hand over his heart. "I swear right now—if I ever marry the Lancaster heiress, then I—"

Harrison quickly covered his mouth. "Don’t make reckless vows. What if you change your mind?"

There was no "what if." Nathaniel was certain.

Harrison exhaled. "Beatrice will return in a few days."

At the mention of her name, Nathaniel tensed. Beatrice Lancaster was indeed coming back.

"Isabella is her only daughter. Beatrice adores her. Once she returns, she’ll pressure you. Then you’ll have no choice but to marry Isabella."

Nathaniel remained silent for a long moment. "Right now, our priority is rescuing Charlotte and my mother. When Beatrice returns, I’ll make my stance clear."

Isabella twisted restlessly in bed, sleep evading her. If she stood up the kidnappers again, they’d lose patience. If the truth about her kidnapping Charlotte and Victoria came out, the consequences would be catastrophic.

She sat up, glancing out the window. Past midnight—everyone was asleep. If she moved carefully, she could slip out unnoticed.

She had no choice now. She had to meet those men in black.

Her mind was made up—Charlotte and Victoria couldn’t be allowed to live. Keeping them alive was too dangerous. The threat had to be eliminated now.

Silently, she knotted bedsheets into a makeshift rope, tied it to the window frame, and climbed down.

Not a single sound escaped her lips. The last thing she needed was to alert her father, Harrison, or the guards.

Her feet touched the ground.

She had done it.
###Chapter 689

Isabella's heart soared with triumph.

She had finally broken free.

Her eyes darted cautiously around the dimly lit alley. Silence enveloped everything—no footsteps, no whispers. Under the cloak of darkness, she had slipped away from the Lancaster estate undetected. Now, she could move without restraint, executing her plans without suspicion.

A cruel smirk twisted her lips. Every ounce of suffering Harrison had inflicted upon her would now be repaid tenfold—through Charlotte.

Without hesitation, she turned and vanished into the night.

Soon, she arrived at the abandoned warehouse where the kidnappers waited.

The masked man yanked open the creaking door. "Took you long enough."

Crack!

Isabella's palm struck his cheek with brutal force. "That's no way to address your employer," she hissed. "Or have you forgotten who funds this operation?"

The man winced, rubbing his stinging skin. "Apologies. We were just... anxious. The longer this drags on, the riskier it gets."

Even these lowlifes understood the danger of keeping Victoria and Charlotte captive for too long.

"Are they still secured?" Isabella demanded.

"Locked tight. No one's seen them."

She grabbed a black mask and pulled it over her face, then shrugged into a sleek, dark coat. "Take me to them."

The man led her down a narrow corridor, stopping before a rusted metal door. With a grunt, he shoved it open.

Inside, Victoria and Charlotte lay curled on a thin mattress, stirring at the intrusion. Victoria instantly shielded Charlotte, her eyes blazing with defiance.

"Who are you?" Victoria's voice was steel. "You're the one behind this, aren't you?"

Isabella's altered voice dripped with icy amusement. "Clever girl."

Victoria's fists clenched. "What did we ever do to you? Kidnapping is a crime—you won't get away with this."

Isabella scoffed. "Still so bold for a hostage."

"Do you have any idea who I am?" Victoria snapped. "I'm Victoria Hawk. Harm me, and you'll regret it."

Despite days in captivity, neither showed fear. Their hair was tangled, their clothes rumpled, but their spirits remained unbroken.

Isabella hesitated—hurting Victoria wasn't part of the plan.

Then Charlotte piped up, tiny fists shaking. "You're mean! My mommy's gonna save us!"

The mention of Harrison sent fury surging through Isabella. "You insolent brat!" She whirled to the men. "Grab her. She's first."

The thugs lunged forward—but Victoria threw herself between them and Charlotte.

"Don't you dare touch her!" Victoria snarled.

Isabella froze.

Victoria was standing. Walking.

Her legs—once paralyzed—were healed.

"You... can walk?" Isabella's voice cracked with disbelief.

"Harrison cured me," Victoria said coldly. "She's a miracle worker. And Charlotte's mother. So think very carefully about your next move."

Isabella's blood turned to ice.

Victoria's legs had been deemed hopeless by specialists. Yet Harrison had healed them effortlessly.

For years, Isabella had painstakingly won Victoria's trust. Now, hearing Victoria defend Harrison—praising her—felt like a knife twisting in her chest.

Jealousy and rage consumed her.

This wasn't over. Not even close.
###Chapter 690

Victoria could sense Isabella's growing affection for Charlotte through their connection. Her rage erupted like a volcano, her features twisting into something dark and dangerous as she clenched her teeth.

"Are you all incompetent?" she snapped at the masked men. "Can't even handle one little girl?"

The black-clad figures immediately surged toward Charlotte.

"Stay away from me!" Charlotte shrieked, her voice trembling. "Mrs. Victoria, help me!"

Victoria reacted instantly, shielding Charlotte with her body as she glared at Isabella. "Who are you?" she demanded. "You know me, don't you?"

Isabella froze mid-step, her breath hitching.

Victoria's sharp eyes swept over her, analyzing every detail. "You're aware I've been confined to this wheelchair for years. Otherwise, you wouldn't have questioned my legs." Her voice turned icy. "You're someone from my past, aren't you? Definitely a woman."

Years of being the Falcon family matriarch had honed Victoria's instincts to razor sharpness. Her piercing gaze seemed to strip Isabella bare.

A cold sweat broke out on Isabella's back. If Victoria recognized her, everything would unravel. She had no choice but to escalate.

"Since the old hag is so protective of the brat," she hissed, "eliminate them both."

The masked men nodded in unison. "Understood."

Isabella cast one last frigid look at Victoria and Charlotte. "You'll learn my identity when you're breathing your last."

With that, she turned sharply to leave.

A sudden cry made her whirl around. Victoria had shoved aside one attacker and lunged forward with surprising strength, yanking the mask from Isabella's face.

A cold rush of air hit Isabella's exposed skin. Her eyes locked with Victoria's—wide with shock and dawning horror.

"Isa...bella?" Victoria whispered, her voice breaking.

The mask was off.

Isabella stood paralyzed, her mind reeling. Victoria had recognized her.

No. No, no, no—

Charlotte gasped. "I know you! You're that horrible woman from before!"

Isabella scrambled to snatch back the mask. "Give that back!" She desperately covered her face with her hands. "Don't look at me!"

Victoria staggered back, disbelief written across her features. "How could it be you? You orchestrated Charlotte's kidnapping? You—"

Panic clawed at Isabella's throat. "Mrs. Victoria, listen! I never meant to involve you! I only wanted Charlotte. Why did you interfere? You've ruined everything!"

"What plan?" Victoria's voice rose. "You wanted to harm a child? Have you lost your mind? This is illegal!"

"Harrison started this!" Isabella spat, then caught herself. "It's her or me!"

Victoria's eyes flashed. "Harrison hasn't set foot in Metropolia for three years! She's never competed with you. You're already the wealthiest heiress in the city. I've even supported your marriage to Nathaniel! What more do you want? How could you sink this low?"

Isabella studied Victoria's face. "You've grown fond of Harrison, haven't you?"

Victoria hesitated. "I—"

"See? You keep defending her! Everyone always takes her side!"

"It's not about sides," Victoria countered. "Harrison would never resort to this madness—"

Isabella's scream cut through the air. "ENOUGH!"
###Chapter 691

Isabella cut Victoria off sharply. "So what you're saying is I'm not as good as her!"

Victoria hesitated. "L..."

Isabella clenched her fists tightly at her sides. "Every one of you thinks the same way—Harrison's the miracle doctor, Dr. Sinclair! She's perfect, so talented, so flawless! And me? I'm nothing. That's why you all side with her and despise me!"

Victoria recoiled, startled by the venomous bitterness twisting Isabella's face. Her expression had contorted into something unrecognizable.

Charlotte shrank behind Victoria, trembling. "I'm scared..."

Victoria wrapped her arms around Charlotte protectively, then gave Isabella a strange, almost pitying look. "How could you believe that? It's not because you lack talent that we don't favor you. It's your jealousy—it's poisoned your soul. And now, resorting to something this cruel and illegal... You've truly let me down."

Isabella's eyes burned with fury as she glared coldly at Victoria. "I don't need your approval anymore. Because neither of you will be leaving here alive."

Victoria gasped. "You'd actually kill me?"

Isabella lifted her hand in a sharp motion. "Take them down!"

The masked men immediately seized Victoria and Charlotte.

Charlotte burst into tears, sobbing, "Let me go! Let her go! Mommy will come! She'll save us!"

Victoria hurried to comfort her. "Charlotte, don't be afraid! Isabella, remember who I am. If you harm me, Nathaniel will never forgive you!"

Isabella's expression darkened. "Don't worry. Nathaniel will never find out. Just wait. Once I marry him and become your daughter-in-law, I'll make sure we visit your grave every year."

Victoria's voice trembled with disbelief. "You've truly lost your mind!"

Isabella had no more use for them. She ordered coldly, "Deal with them. I never want to see them again!"

"Right away."

The kidnappers drew their knives, stepping closer to Victoria and Charlotte. "Isabella, you can't do this! You're insane!" Victoria shouted.

A cruel smile curled Isabella's lips. Anyone who stood in her way deserved to die. What she wanted, she would take—no matter the cost.

Suddenly, the door burst open with a deafening crash. A cold gust of wind swept through the room.

Isabella spun around, stunned, as a group of armed men stormed in, swiftly overpowering her men. The knives clattered to the ground.

Isabella's face paled, shock gripping her. "Who are you? How did you find this place? Stop! Stop right now!"

Her breath came in ragged gasps. This location was supposed to be secret! Her plan was flawless. Who were these people? How had they discovered her?

Then a clear, composed voice rang out. "Hello, Ms. Lancaster."

Isabella's heart lurched. That voice—it was Harrison!

The next moment, Harrison's elegant figure appeared before them.

Harrison was here!

Charlotte's eyes lit up, joy flooding her face. "Mommy, you're here! You came to save us! I knew you would!"

Harrison rushed forward, pulling Charlotte into a fierce embrace and pressing a kiss to her cheek. "Yes, I'm here. Are you all right?"
###Chapter 692

Charlotte's soft lips brushed against Harrison's cheek. "I'm alright, but there's just one tiny thing..."

Harrison's expression instantly darkened with worry. "What's wrong?"

A radiant smile spread across Charlotte's face. "I just missed you terribly... When I didn't see you before bedtime, I cried."

Harrison's lips curved into a tender smile. She pulled Charlotte into a fierce embrace. "I missed you too, my darling."

Victoria glanced up at Harrison, relief flooding her features. "You're here."

Harrison straightened, her voice steady. "Are you hurt?"

Victoria shook her head slowly. "No, I'm fine."

Then, Isabella's sharp voice sliced through the air. "How did you track us down? Did you follow me?"

Harrison's piercing gaze locked onto Isabella's face. "Congratulations. You guessed correctly—I did follow you. I knew if we let you stay, you'd find a way to slip out. I was simply waiting."

Isabella's fists clenched in frustration, her teeth grinding. She had been outmaneuvered. Defeated.

"Anything to say for yourself?" Harrison asked coolly.

Isabella hesitated. "I—"

Before she could speak, Nathaniel stepped forward, his eyes burning with fury. "I never imagined you could be this cruel—kidnapping Charlotte and my mother! If you're capable of abduction and murder today, what atrocities will you commit tomorrow?"

Isabella paled. She lunged forward, gripping Nathaniel's sleeve desperately. "Listen to me! I only meant to take Harrison's daughter. I never intended to harm your mother—"

Victoria cut her off with an icy glare. "Don't lie. You were ready to kill me to silence me. I haven't forgotten."

Isabella's voice trembled. "Nathaniel, I love you... I couldn't bear to lose you. That's why I did this."

Nathaniel shoved her away, his eyes filled with disgust. "Save your excuses for the courtroom."

Isabella gaped at him in shock. "You'd turn me in? I'm the Lancaster heiress—the daughter of the wealthiest man alive! You wouldn't dare!"

A deep, commanding voice interjected. "He wouldn't, but I would."

Isabella whirled around to see Henry Lancaster striding in, his long black coat billowing behind him. Her breath hitched. "Father? What are you doing here? Harrison, is this your doing?"

Harrison nodded. "Yes. I brought Mr. Lancaster here."

Isabella's voice shook. "Why? Why would you drag my father into this?"

Harrison met Henry's gaze squarely. "Mr. Lancaster, the truth is clear—your daughter kidnapped Charlotte and Mrs. Victoria and attempted to murder them. What do you intend to do about it?"

Isabella rushed to Henry, clutching his arm. "Father, I'm your daughter! You can't abandon me!"

SMACK!

Henry's palm struck Isabella's cheek with brutal force. Her head snapped to the side, the sting searing through her skin. Her mind went blank.

Slowly, she turned back to him, stunned.

"You... hit me?"

Henry's gaze was glacial. "Don't you deserve it?"
###Chapter 693

Henry Lancaster stared at Isabella, his disapproval barely concealed. "You've crossed a line this time. How could you stoop so low?"

He had always known his daughter was willful and manipulative, but when Harrison revealed she had orchestrated kidnappings, he refused to believe it. The idea that his own flesh and blood could be so ruthless was unfathomable.

As the patriarch of the Lancaster dynasty, Henry took immense pride in his lineage. Isabella's mother, the elegant and refined Lady Isabella, came from equally distinguished stock. With such noble bloodlines, how had they produced someone so morally bankrupt?

His heart ached with bitter disappointment.

Yet Isabella showed no remorse. Instead, her expression twisted with indignation.

"Father! How could you humiliate me like this in front of Harrison? I'm your daughter! Why do you always take their side over mine?"

She spun on her heel, ready to storm out—but a broad-shouldered bodyguard blocked her path.

Harrison's voice cut through the tension like steel. "Did I say you could leave?"

Nathaniel's tone was glacial. "You abducted Charlotte and my mother. The evidence is undeniable. Did you really think you could walk away unscathed?"

Isabella's gaze darted between them, realizing neither would back down.

Then she looked at Victoria, whose eyes had turned to ice. The warmth she once held for Isabella was gone.

Her only lifeline now was Henry.

"Father," she pleaded, voice trembling, "I'm your only child! You can't let them do this to me!"

Henry remained silent.

Panic crept into her tone. "If you don't protect me, my life is over!"

Finally, Henry turned to Harrison and Nathaniel. "I'm taking Isabella home."

Despite everything, he still shielded her. No matter how deep his disappointment ran, he couldn't abandon his blood.

Harrison wasn't surprised. She had expected this. Henry was a devoted father, even to a daughter like Isabella.

"If you let her escape consequences," Harrison said firmly, "she'll only grow bolder. Next time, who knows what she'll do? If you truly love her, you must teach her to be better."

Henry hesitated—she was right. "From now on, I'll keep her under strict supervision. Her mother returns soon, and I can't let you take her yet. But I give you my word—once Lady Isabella arrives, justice will be served."

Nathaniel glanced at Harrison. "Your call."

Harrison nodded. "Fine. I'll hold you to that promise."

For now, she would let it go.

Isabella exhaled, a smug smirk playing on her lips. As long as she remained the Lancaster heiress, she believed herself untouchable.

Henry signaled his men. "Clean this up. Isabella, with me."

Father and daughter departed together.

Harrison gathered Charlotte into her arms. "Let's go home."

Victoria looked at her gratefully. "Thank you for healing my legs."

Nathaniel, unaware of the miracle, stared in shock.

Victoria smiled. "Harrison did it."

Nathaniel's eyes softened as they met Harrison's. "Thank you."
###Chapter 694

Victoria smiled warmly at Isabella and Nathaniel. "Please, don't stand on ceremony—it was nothing at all. Just a small gesture."

Charlotte tugged gently at Harrison's sleeve, her voice sweet and pleading. "Mommy, Mrs. Isabella kept me safe! Can we go to their house? I want to play there!"

Harrison hesitated. For now, she had no intention of leaving Metropolia—she needed to wait for Henry to fulfill his promise.

Besides, Isabella was returning soon, and Harrison was eager to meet her.

She turned to Isabella with a nod. "I’d love to take you up on that invitation."

Nathaniel held out his arms. "Charlotte, come here—let me carry you."

But Harrison shook her head firmly. "That’s all right, Mr. Hawk. I’ll hold my daughter."

Charlotte blinked her wide, sparkling eyes—first at Harrison, then at Nathaniel. "But Mommy, I want Mr. Handsome to carry me!"

Harrison was speechless. After three years of raising her little girl, she hadn’t expected such betrayal.

Nathaniel effortlessly lifted Charlotte into his arms.

The little girl grinned and explained, "Mommy, I’m getting bigger and heavier. I don’t want your arms to get tired, so I’ll let Mr. Handsome carry me. I love you, Mommy!"

Harrison was completely disarmed by her daughter’s clever reasoning.

Isabella chuckled at the adorable Charlotte. "All right then. Let’s go."

Meanwhile, Henry had brought Isabella back to the Lancaster estate. In the grand living room, he fixed her with a stern gaze.

"Do you even realize what you’ve done?"

"Why do you always favor Harrison?" Isabella snapped back. "It’s because all of you take her side that I had to send people after her daughter! For the past three years, while she was gone, I behaved perfectly! This is all Harrison’s fault—she shouldn’t even exist!"

Henry’s temper flared. "Whether it was three years ago or now, you blame everything on Harrison! Have you ever once reflected on your own mistakes?"

Isabella’s voice turned icy. "I’m not wrong!"

"How can you be so stubborn?" Henry growled.

Suddenly, Isabella’s tone shifted to desperation. "If you don’t love me anymore, I’d rather die!"

Henry’s anger burned hotter. "You pulled this suicide act three years ago. Aren’t you tired of the same old tricks? Can’t you come up with something new?"

On the way home, Isabella had already planned her strategy—cry, make a scene, and threaten to end her life, just like before. She was certain it would force Henry to yield again.

But Henry saw right through her, and she froze.

Just then, Eleanor hurried into the room. "Henry, why are you arguing with Isabella? She’s your only daughter. No matter what she’s done, you should talk to her calmly. Don’t scold her!"

She gently soothed Isabella. "Your father loves you deeply. He’s only harsh because he cares."

For the past three years, Eleanor had been exceedingly kind and indulgent toward Isabella. The girl knew full well that Eleanor was trying to win her favor—if she succeeded, she might finally marry Henry.

Tension still crackled between Henry and Isabella.

Then, a crisp ringtone cut through the silence—Henry’s phone was ringing. He pulled it out, and the screen flashed with the name "Isabella."

Isabella was calling.

Henry answered immediately. Her voice came through, calm yet firm. "I’m back in the country."

She had returned ahead of schedule.

"Where’s my daughter?" she continued. "I want to see her now. Arrange a meeting."
###Chapter 695

Henry clenched his phone until his knuckles turned white. "Isabella's with me. I've booked a private suite at The Grand View for lunch. You can see her there."

The arrangements were made swiftly.

Victoria agreed immediately. "Fine. Noon it is."

Just then, a youthful male voice interrupted from Victoria's end. "Vic, where to next?"

Vic?

Henry's brow furrowed, his patience wearing dangerously thin. "Victoria—"

The line went dead before he could finish.

The message was clear—Victoria had no interest in speaking to him beyond what was absolutely necessary. Her daughter was her sole priority. Henry was left standing there, utterly speechless.

Eleanor, noticing the storm clouds gathering on Henry's face, already knew who had called. No one else could rattle him the way Victoria did.

She stepped closer. "Was that Victoria?"

Isabella's pulse quickened. "Dad... Was that Mom?"

Henry gave a stiff nod. "Yes. She's back. I've arranged for you to meet her at The Grand View at noon."

Victoria had returned earlier than expected. Isabella had initially feared her arrival, but then a thought struck her—this could be an opportunity. Henry had never suspected her deception, so why would Victoria? With another mother doting on her, Isabella was certain her life would only become more luxurious.

"Now that Mom's here, I'm going to tell her how horribly you've treated me!"

Henry's lips pressed into a thin line.

"Don't spout nonsense in front of your mother. She has a temper. As the sole heir of the Lancaster family, she now controls all their enterprises."

Isabella's eyes widened in surprise. She hadn’t realized Victoria was that powerful—the head of the Lancaster empire.

The Lancaster family’s influence spanned the globe, particularly in jewelry, fashion, and entertainment. Victoria had been born with a silver spoon and a razor-sharp business mind, groomed for leadership since childhood.

Later, the Lancaster and Lancaster families had merged through marriage, forming an unshakable alliance.

Isabella’s heart soared. Everything Victoria owned would be hers too. After all, she was the only daughter of both families.

She glared at Henry and pouted. "Since you clearly prefer Charlotte, I’m moving out to live with Mom. At least she’ll treat me better. I refuse to stay here another second!"

"Isabella!" Henry snapped.

Eleanor couldn’t wait for Isabella to leave. She dreamed of taking Victoria’s place one day and giving Henry a child of their own.

"Henry, stop arguing," Eleanor said firmly. "She’s been through enough. Let her rest and get ready before meeting Victoria."

Henry locked eyes with Isabella. "You kidnapped Charlotte and Victoria. How do you plan to fix this?"

Isabella dodged the question entirely. "You’ll handle it for me, won’t you?"

"This is your mess. Clean it up yourself."

"If you won’t help, I’ll go to Mom. She loves me more! I’m done talking about this. I’m exhausted. I’m going to sleep."

Without another word, Isabella stormed upstairs.

Henry was left seething. He couldn’t fathom how he’d ended up with a daughter like Isabella—one who caused chaos without remorse, refused accountability, and still acted like the victim.

He had no idea how to get through to her anymore.


###Chapter 696

The return of Isabella sent Henry Lancaster into a tailspin of agitation. His temples throbbed with familiar tension.

"Darling, is your migraine returning? Let me ease your pain," Eleanor murmured, her fingers already reaching for his temples. Years of tending to Henry's stress-induced headaches had made her proficient in therapeutic massage.

Henry waved her off. "I must meet Isabella at The Grand View for lunch. Excuse me." He retreated to his study without another glance.

Eleanor's hands clenched into fists as she watched him ascend the stairs. The bitter taste of jealousy coated her tongue.

When the Lancaster and Brewer dynasties had united through marriage decades ago, the brilliant, tempestuous Isabella had captivated the reserved business magnate Henry. Though he maintained his composed demeanor, Eleanor had always recognized the fire in his gaze when Isabella entered a room.

Through all these years of Isabella's disappearance, Henry had never ceased searching for her and their missing daughter. Not once had he abandoned hope.

And Eleanor - who had remained faithfully by his side through every crisis - had received nothing but polite indifference in return.

This injustice burned in her chest.

Isabella's return signaled the beginning of their long-awaited rematch. Eleanor had bested her rival once before. She would do so again.

Meanwhile, Harrison brought Charlotte to the Falcon family estate. After warm baths and fresh clothes, Victoria and Charlotte emerged looking revitalized. Harrison carefully examined Victoria's pulse. "Your legs show remarkable improvement. With continued therapy, full mobility is within reach."

Victoria's face glowed with hope. "Thank you, dear."

Harrison's lips curved slightly. "No, thank you for protecting Charlotte. I'm forever in your debt."

Nathaniel observed the growing bond between his wife and mother with quiet satisfaction. Dominic approached and whispered urgent news in his ear.

Nathaniel turned to Harrison. "Isabella's mother has returned to Metropolia."

Victoria gasped. "Isabella is back?"

Harrison studied Victoria's reaction. "You were close?"

"Like sisters," Victoria confirmed, her eyes misting with memory. "We were pregnant simultaneously and made a pact that our children would marry. That's how Nathaniel and Isabella's engagement came to be."

So that explained the Falcon-Lancaster alliance.

"But why did she disappear? Why entrust Isabella to Theodore's care in Willowbrook?" Harrison pressed.

Victoria's expression darkened. "Eleanor's doing! Though Isabella and Henry's marriage appeared harmonious, Eleanor - Henry's first love - never left his orbit. Then, on Isabella's due date, someone poisoned her."

Harrison's breath caught. "Poisoned?"

"Precisely. Despite the toxin ravaging her body, Isabella fought to deliver her daughter. To protect the child, she entrusted her to her protégé Theodore, commanding him to flee Metropolia. The trauma of poisoning and childbirth plunged Isabella into a coma. I was delivering Nathaniel at the same time and only learned of her disappearance afterward. For over twenty years she vanished, but I never lost faith she'd return. And now she has."

The full horror of the situation became clear. Someone had attempted to murder both Isabella and her unborn child. She'd survived just long enough to secure her daughter's safety before disappearing.

Harrison turned to Nathaniel. "Where is Ms. Lancaster meeting Isabella?"

"Mr. Lancaster arranged their reunion at The Grand View," Nathaniel replied.

A spark of determination lit Harrison's eyes. "I want to meet her myself."
###Chapter 697

Nathaniel studied Harrison with keen interest. "What's sparked this sudden fascination with her?"

Harrison's thoughts instantly transported her back to that moment in Henry's study when she first glimpsed Isabella's portrait. An inexplicable connection had formed, an urgent need to meet this woman face to face.

A mysterious smile played on Harrison's lips. "She's practically a living legend. I must meet her."

Victoria gave a knowing nod. "Very well, we'll visit The Grand View tonight."

Just then, Charlotte's sweet voice interrupted. "Mommy, let's do finger painting!"

"Of course, darling," Harrison responded with maternal warmth. "We'll make beautiful art together."

As Harrison led Charlotte away to their art supplies, Nathaniel moved closer to his mother, his voice dropping to a confidential tone.

"Mother, I can't possibly marry Isabella. After what she did - kidnapping you and Charlotte, causing all this chaos... Surely you wouldn't force this marriage?"

Victoria's expression darkened with bitter disappointment as she remembered Isabella's actions.

"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine she could be capable of such cruelty. My heart breaks for my old friend. But this engagement was arranged between Isabella and myself years ago. If we're to dissolve it, we must consult Isabella first."

She still couldn't reconcile how her dearest friend could have raised such a morally bankrupt daughter.

Given Isabella's long absence and their deep history, both families would need to have a proper discussion about ending the engagement.

Nathaniel's gaze drifted to where Harrison and Charlotte were happily painting. "There's only one woman I'll ever marry - Harrison. She gave you back the use of your legs, Mother. That's a debt we can never repay. I need you to stop opposing our relationship."

"Don't be absurd!" Victoria chuckled. "When have I ever truly opposed her? As one accomplished woman to another, I admire her talents and strength. Our differences lie in perspective, not principle. My actions had purpose."

Nathaniel nodded; he'd always respected his mother's wisdom. Everyone operated from their own worldview, which shaped their decisions.

"Now that Isabella has returned, the final decision rests with her. But I'll admit - I've grown quite fond of Harrison. Her healing my paralysis has earned my eternal gratitude," Victoria confessed.

Nathaniel's eyes lit up with hope. It appeared Harrison had already won his mother's heart.

"Three years apart was torture. I won't lose her again. Even if she's currently with Oliver, that's merely a temporary situation."

Victoria hesitated, recalling Charlotte's earlier innocent remark. "Actually... Harrison and Oliver aren't legally married."

"What?" Nathaniel froze, stunned. "That's impossible! Harrison told me they were wed!"

"She lied. Charlotte revealed the truth - no marriage exists. At three years old, children don't fabricate such things."

Nathaniel stood speechless. He'd always assumed Harrison and Oliver were married - why wouldn't they be, with a child together? Surely they'd want to give Charlotte a stable family.

"This changes everything. I'll launch an investigation immediately," he declared.

Victoria nodded approvingly. "Yes, I've always sensed Harrison was keeping secrets. Discover the truth."

Meanwhile, Henry Lancaster arrived at The Grand View with Isabella in tow. Isabella had transformed herself into a vision of elegance - her designer gown flowing like liquid silver, her hair artfully arranged in cascading curls. Every detail was calculated to impress Isabella.

The restaurant manager personally greeted them. "Mr. Lancaster, Ms. Lancaster, welcome to The Grand View."

Henry, imposing in his tailored black overcoat, commanded respect. "Escort us to our private dining room."
###Chapter 698

"Mr. Lancaster, your private dining suite - the Sapphire Room - is ready for you and Ms. Lancaster. Please follow me."

The maitre d' guided Henry and Isabella through the opulent restaurant with polished professionalism.

Isabella's fingers twisted nervously in her silk gown. "Is Mother here already?"

Henry's face remained impassive. "We'll see when we enter."

"Mr. and Ms. Lancaster, your exclusive dining suite. After you."

The heavy oak door swung open. "Mother!"

Empty chairs greeted them - Victoria hadn't arrived.

Henry checked his platinum watch. "It's still early. Sit and wait."

"Of course."

A melodic chime interrupted them - Henry's phone.

"I need to take this."

"Go ahead."

Alone, Isabella fidgeted with her diamond bracelet before deciding to freshen up.

Meanwhile, a vision in crimson swept through the restaurant's grand entrance.

Victoria Lancaster had come alone, dismissing her entourage in her eagerness to reunite with her daughter.

The scarlet Valentino gown clung to her flawless figure. Blood-red lips contrasted against porcelain skin, raven hair cascading like liquid night. At forty-five, she moved with the grace of a woman half her age, turning heads as she glided between tables.

Rushing toward the private suite, Victoria rounded a corner just as Isabella emerged from the powder room.

Their collision sent Isabella stumbling back.

"My apologies-" Victoria began automatically.

"You clumsy cow!" Isabella shrieked, examining her dress. "Look what you've done!"

Victoria's concerned expression hardened at the venom in the younger woman's voice. "We both moved suddenly. Shared responsibility, don't you think?"

Isabella's eyes flashed. "Do you have any idea who you're speaking to? This is a fifty-thousand-dollar Givenchy! You'll pay for this!"

Victoria's manicured eyebrow arched. "Such impressive manners."

"You provincial nobody! In Metropolia, I make the rules. On your knees and apologize properly!"

A dangerous smile played on Victoria's lips. "How interesting. No one's demanded that of me in twenty years."

Isabella's gaze raked over the stranger. "You're not in our social registers. That dress? Clearly a sugar daddy's gift. Just another gold-digging mistress, aren't you?"

Having memorized every elite socialite's face, Isabella felt certain this stunning stranger was some rich man's plaything.

Victoria's laugh held winter's chill. "My first hour back in Metropolia, and I encounter such... character. Mistress? That's a new one."

Isabella crossed her arms. "Then enlighten me. Who exactly do you think you are?"
###Chapter 699

Isabella started to speak, "I am—"

But Harrison interrupted sharply. "Spare me your introductions. I couldn't care less who you are. You've ruined my designer gown, and now you'll get on your knees and beg for forgiveness!"

Isabella arched one perfectly shaped brow. "And if I refuse?"

Danger flashed in Harrison's eyes as she snapped her fingers. "Security!"

Two towering men in black suits materialized instantly. "Yes, Miss Lancaster?"

"Seize her!" Harrison pointed dramatically at Isabella. "Make this gutter trash grovel at my feet!"

The bodyguards advanced, but Isabella merely smirked. "Touch me, and you'll spend the rest of your lives regretting it."

Harrison let out a shrill laugh. "Listen to her! Once you learn who my father is, you'll piss yourself in terror!"

"Promises, promises," Isabella drawled.

"Enough chatter! Grab her now!" Harrison shrieked.

Just as the guards reached for Isabella, a melodious voice sliced through the tension. "My, my, Miss Lancaster. Still throwing your weight around, I see?"

Harrison whirled to face the newcomer—her least favorite person in Metropolia. Eleanor had arrived.

Harrison's face twisted in displeasure. "What are you doing here?"

Eleanor glided forward, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "I came for afternoon tea. Imagine my surprise when I spotted you making a spectacle of yourself from across the restaurant. Who's your latest victim?"

"None of your concern," Harrison spat. "This gutter rat needs to learn her place. Planning to interfere?"

Eleanor's lips curved into a feline smile. "What if I am?"

Isabella studied Eleanor. Compared to Harrison's brash vulgarity, Eleanor carried herself with effortless grace—the very picture of old money elegance.

Isabella extended her hand. "Pleasure."

Eleanor turned—and froze. Her breath caught when she saw Isabella's face.

The portrait. The one painted over two decades ago. The resemblance was uncanny.

"It's you," Eleanor whispered.

Isabella tilted her head. "Do we know each other?"

Before Eleanor could respond, Harrison sneered, "Oh, you know each other? How fitting! Trash always flocks together. You're both gold-digging whores clinging to wealthy men. My social circle consists exclusively of Metropolia's elite—daughters of nobility and old money families."

Eleanor's eyes widened. "What did you just call her?"

Harrison shrugged. "Did I stutter? Look at her—head-to-toe designer labels. Clearly some rich man's plaything!"

For a long moment, Eleanor simply stared. Then she burst into laughter—rich, melodic laughter that echoed through the restaurant. "Oh, this is priceless! If you knew who she really is, you'd collapse in hysterics!"

"Why would I—" Harrison began, then cut herself off with an exasperated wave. "Enough! Since you insist on meddling, Eleanor, you can kneel beside her!"

At that precise moment, a deep baritone voice rumbled through the space. "What's the meaning of this?"

Harrison's face lit up as she spotted Henry Lancaster. She rushed to his side, clinging to his arm like a lifeline.

"Daddy! Thank heavens you're here! These two have been bullying me mercilessly! Especially this one—she ruined my Valentino gown! Make them both apologize on their knees!"

Isabella's expression shifted dramatically. She stepped forward, disbelief written across her features. "Daddy?"

Harrison preened like a peacock spreading its feathers. "Now you understand, don't you? I'm Isabella Lancaster—heiress to the Lancaster fortune! Scared now, peasant?" Her laughter rang out, sharp and cruel.
###Chapter 700

Isabella stood frozen, her breath catching in her throat.

Henry Lancaster abruptly pulled his arm free from Arabella's grasp, his voice sharp as ice. "What do you think you're doing?"

Arabella blinked, taken aback. "Why are you snapping at me like that?"

Henry's gaze flickered toward Isabella. "Do you even realize who she is?"

"She's just some gold-digging—"

"Enough!" Henry cut her off, his tone dangerously low. "Not another word."

Arabella flinched, confusion flashing across her face. "What did I do wrong? Why are you yelling at me?"

Henry exhaled, his voice steady but firm. "She's your mother, Isabella."

The words struck Arabella like a physical blow. Her breath hitched. "What? She's my—my mother?"

Her wide eyes locked onto Isabella, disbelief written across her features.

Isabella stared back, just as stunned. This wasn't how she had imagined their reunion.

Henry turned to Isabella. "This is our daughter, Arabella."

Without hesitation, Arabella rushed forward, her voice trembling. "Mom, I'm so sorry! I didn't recognize you! I'm your daughter, Arabella."

Isabella's expression darkened with disappointment as she studied her.

Harrison smirked, crossing her arms. "Oh, now she's 'Mom'? A second ago, you were calling her a mistress."

"Shut your mouth!" Arabella shot Harrison a venomous glare.

She despised her. Why did Harrison always have to interfere?

Isabella's eyes narrowed slightly. "Are you really my daughter?"

Arabella's stomach dropped. This wasn't how this was supposed to go. She had ruined everything.

Thinking fast, she played her trump card.

"Yes, I'm your daughter. We've been apart for so long... Theodore raised me. He told me how much you loved me, but I never got to feel a mother's love. When Dad said you were coming back to see me, I was so happy. Finally, I wouldn't have to envy other kids anymore."

Isabella's expression softened instantly. Years of guilt weighed heavily on her heart.

She reached out and took Arabella's hand. "I only sent you to Willowbrook because I had no choice. From now on, I'll stay with you. We won't be separated again."

Arabella immediately threw her arms around Isabella, squeezing tightly. "That's all I've ever wanted, Mom. I love you."

As Arabella clung to her, Isabella caught the overwhelming scent of her perfume—synthetic and cloying.

A frown tugged at her lips. Why did she feel no warmth toward this girl? It unsettled her.

Just then, Henry stepped forward. "Let's put this behind us for now. I've reserved a private room. We can talk there."

Isabella nodded. "Alright."

Then, she remembered Harrison and turned to her. "Young lady, what's your name?"

Harrison smiled warmly. "Hello, Mrs. Lancaster. I'm Harrison Whitmore."

She extended her hand.

Isabella couldn't help but return the smile. She shook Harrison's hand. "Please, call me Isabella Brewer."

Harrison tilted her head slightly. "Then, it's nice to meet you, Ms. Brewer."
###Chapter 701

Isabella couldn't suppress her grin. She truly admired Harrison's razor-sharp intellect and perceptive nature.

"I returned to Metropolia today to visit my daughter, Isabella. Since we've bumped into each other, why not join us for dinner?"

Isabella's eyes widened in disbelief.

What? Her mother was actually inviting Harrison to their private family meal!

"Absolutely not!" she blurted out.

Harrison countered instantly, "I'd love to!"

Their voices clashed simultaneously.

Isabella's brow furrowed. "How can you be so shameless? First you invade our home as a guest, now you're inviting yourself to dinner? Did anyone ask if you're welcome here?"

Harrison relished watching Isabella's frustrated helplessness.

"Mr. Lancaster permitted my last visit. Now Ms. Brewer has extended this invitation. Why would I need your permission? Are you challenging both your parents' authority?"

The verbal jab made Isabella bite her lip in silent fury.

Isabella Brewer stepped between them. "That's enough, Isabella. I invited Harrison. End of discussion."

With her mother's command, Isabella dared not protest further. "Yes, Mother. As you wish."

The quartet arrived at The Grand View's private dining room. Harrison maintained perfect table manners while discreetly absorbing every word of conversation.

Isabella Brewer studied her daughter. "What exactly are you pursuing these days?"

"I trained in classical ballet, but I've lost interest. I want to join Lancaster Enterprises. May I?"

Harrison suppressed a smirk. Isabella's desperation to infiltrate the family business was almost comical.

"You wish to work at Lancaster Enterprises?" Isabella Brewer inquired.

"Yes! You're the CEO, and I've heard countless stories about your business brilliance. Everyone speaks of your formidable leadership. I want to learn directly from you. To become strong and independent like you," Isabella gushed with saccharine sweetness.

Isabella Brewer had no intention of nepotism. She strictly separated family from business. Her daughter lacked any corporate experience or qualifications.

Yet faced with the direct request, she offered no outright refusal. "Very well. Report to headquarters tomorrow. I'll arrange a suitable position."

Isabella beamed. "Thank you, Mother!"

Isabella Brewer then turned to Henry. "A word in private, please."

She led him into the corridor, standing with her back toward him, hands clasped behind her. The crimson evening gown clung to her curves, accentuating her slender waist before flaring over her hips.

Henry's lips curled coldly. No wonder his daughter failed to recognize her mother. Isabella Brewer hadn't aged a day since their separation - still the same tantalizing enchantress. She bore no visible traces of motherhood.

"You wanted to speak?" Henry prompted from behind.

Isabella Brewer turned. "Is Isabella truly our daughter?"

Henry stiffened. "What are you implying?"

"Something feels... off about her. Did you ever conduct a DNA test?"

Henry shook his head. "Unnecessary."

"Arrange one. I want to see the results personally."

Henry studied his ex-wife. The dim lighting accentuated his sharp, aristocratic features - a man molded by wealth, power, and decades of influence. The once most eligible bachelor of Metropolia now stood as one of the world's most formidable tycoons.

"I found Isabella in Willowbrook. Theodore raised her meticulously. That man who always carried a torch for you. How could there be any mistake?"

Their gazes locked in silent battle beneath the crystal chandelier's glow.
###Chapter 702

Isabella arched a perfectly sculpted brow, her crimson lips curling into a smirk. "Is that jealousy I detect in your voice?"

Henry Lancaster's piercing gaze locked onto her defiant expression. "Tell me where I'm mistaken. You gave birth to our child, abandoned her, and vanished for two decades without a single word. If I hadn't tracked you down, would you have ever returned?"

A bitter laugh escaped Isabella's lips. Eleanor had poisoned her back then, and that woman had remained by Henry's side all these years. That was precisely why their daughter could never have stayed in Metropolia.

The night Isabella gave birth, she had nearly died. Someone had whisked her away while she was unconscious, and the poison had kept her in a coma for years. She had only awakened recently.

"What's done is done," Isabella said coolly. "There's no point rehashing the past. Just inform me when the DNA results are ready. I have places to be."

She turned sharply to leave.

Fury ignited in Henry's chest. His hand shot out, gripping her wrist as he shoved her against the wall. His towering frame caged her in, his voice a low, dangerous growl. "What's with the attitude? You disappeared with Jessica all those years ago without so much as an explanation, and now you dare act like this?"

Isabella tilted her head, her icy gaze meeting his. "Why are you so agitated? Do you need a woman to help you relieve some tension?"

She lifted one slender leg, the pointed heel of her stiletto dragging slowly up the length of his tailored trousers. The high slit of her crimson dress revealed a tantalizing glimpse of flawless skin.

Henry's grip tightened on her shoulder, his eyes darkening with a mix of anger and something far more dangerous. "We're in public. What do you think you're doing?"

Isabella reveled in his reaction. "I assumed this was what you wanted when you pinned me against the wall. Was I wrong?"

Her fingers trailed over his chest, slipping beneath his black coat to trace the firm planes of his abdomen through the crisp fabric of his dress shirt.

His muscles tensed beneath her touch.

She couldn't help but admire the definition of his body, the sharp angles of his jaw. A playful glint lit her eyes. "You're past forty, yet you've maintained yourself well. Just like when you were younger."

Her fingertip pressed teasingly against his abs, and she let out a soft laugh.

"Impressive."

Henry's breath hitched. He leaned in, his lips seeking hers—

But she turned her face away at the last second.

His body went rigid. "Are you toying with me?"

Isabella withdrew her hand. "Have you forgotten our relationship? We're divorced. If you're aroused, find someone else to take it out on."

Henry's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Divorced? As far as I recall, we never actually filed the paperwork. Get your facts straight—you're still Mrs. Lancaster."

Isabella lifted her chin defiantly. "So what? It's just a piece of paper. We've been separated for over twenty years. Tomorrow, my lawyer will file for divorce, and that certificate will be mine before you can blink."
###Chapter 703

Henry Lancaster gazed at Isabella, his fingers lightly tracing her jawline.

"Twenty years apart? That doesn't sound like a statement—it sounds like you're complaining about being neglected." His voice dropped to a husky murmur. "Don't worry. Tonight, I'll make sure you don't feel empty anymore."

Isabella remained silent for a beat—then, a sharp smack echoed through the room. She slapped his hand away.

"Why don't you go find Eleanor instead? After all these years, I'm sure she's warmed my side of the bed just fine."

Henry's expression darkened, his voice laced with icy fury. "How many times must I repeat myself? There was never anything between Eleanor and me!"

Isabella arched a brow. "Really? Not even once?"

Henry gritted his teeth. "Stop twisting everything with your filthy imagination!"

Wait. So he hadn't slept with Eleanor?

Her lips curved into a mocking smile. "Then who have you been entertaining all these years? A secretary? A college student? Or did you just rotate through them?"

"Isabella!" His growl was a warning.

She laughed lightly. "Oh, did I strike a nerve? Or are you trying to convince me you've been celibate for two decades? Please. I wasn't born yesterday."

Henry's gaze dropped to her parted lips, crimson and tempting. Without hesitation, he closed the distance between them, capturing her mouth in a searing kiss.

"Mmph!" Isabella's eyes widened in shock. She shoved against his chest, but he caught her wrists effortlessly, pinning them against the wall as his kiss deepened—possessive, demanding, leaving no room for resistance.

Heat flooded her cheeks. They weren't young anymore, yet Henry kissed her with the same reckless intensity as before.

"Let me go!" she demanded.

When he didn’t relent, she bit down—hard.

Henry hissed in pain, pulling back. A drop of blood welled on his lower lip. He wiped it away with his thumb, his glare sharpening—

"Henry?"

A soft, familiar voice interrupted.

Isabella turned. Eleanor stood in the doorway, her delicate features etched with concern.

Without hesitation, Isabella shoved Henry back, putting distance between them.

Eleanor rushed forward, her eyes widening at the sight of blood. "You're hurt!" Then, she turned to Isabella with a fragile smile. "Isabella, it's so wonderful to have you back. You've misunderstood everything between Henry and me. We're just friends. He only kept me close out of pity. If I'm causing problems, I'll leave immediately—"

Isabella cut her off with a cold laugh. She knew Eleanor's game all too well. After all, she had been burned by this woman before.

"Save it. I don't care what your relationship is. He's not mine anymore—you can have him."

Henry's jaw tightened. "Isabella."

She stepped closer to Eleanor, her voice a silken whisper. "Twenty years, and you still haven't become Mrs. Lancaster? How... disappointing."

Eleanor's mask faltered. The barb struck deep.

Isabella pressed on, her smile razor-sharp. "You should try harder. You're not getting any younger—what are you now, forty-five? It was pathetic enough chasing another woman's husband at twenty, but at your age? That’s just sad."

Eleanor's hands clenched into fists, her composure cracking.

Isabella cast Henry one last glance. "Goodbye, Mr. Lancaster."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away.

Eleanor quickly composed herself, moving to Henry's side. "You still haven't explained things to her? She can say whatever she wants about me, but I don’t want to come between you two."
###Chapter 704

Henry Lancaster watched Isabella's retreating figure, her hips swaying with a deliberate, tantalizing rhythm that sent heat rushing through his veins. The sight was so infuriatingly alluring that he let out a bitter chuckle.

Eleanor reached out, her fingers brushing toward the corner of his lips. "Are you okay?"

Before she could touch him, Henry stepped back sharply. "I'm heading home."

Without another word, he turned and walked away.

Eleanor's hand hung suspended in the air. The moment he was gone, her carefully constructed mask shattered. Her expression twisted into something venomous—resentment and icy hatred burning in her eyes.

She despised Isabella.

Eleanor was the daughter of the Lancaster family's chauffeur. Years ago, her father had died saving Henry's father, and her mother had followed soon after.

Out of guilt, Henry had taken her under his wing. They had grown up side by side, and she had convinced herself that one day, she would become Mrs. Lancaster.

Then, without warning, the Lancasters and the Blackwoods forged a marriage alliance. Henry married Isabella instead.

Eleanor had tried to console herself—Isabella was just a pawn in a business arrangement, destined for a loveless marriage. But reality proved her wrong.

Isabella was a seductress. From the moment she married Henry, she wrapped herself around him like a serpent, refusing to let go.

Two years into their marriage, Eleanor had once lingered outside Henry’s study. The door was slightly ajar, and she had peeked inside.

Henry sat at his desk, buried in paperwork, but Isabella was perched shamelessly in his lap, her silk camisole slipping off one shoulder, revealing flawless skin.

Henry’s voice was rough. "I have a lot of work tonight."

"Don’t work tonight, darling. I need you..." Isabella purred, pressing closer.

Henry pulled her against him. "Fine. Let’s go to the bedroom."

But Isabella shook her head, her lips curving into a wicked smile. "No. Right here, in your study. Don’t tell me you don’t like it?"

Henry tilted her chin up and kissed her deeply, letting her hands slide beneath his tailored shirt, bold and teasing.

Breathless, Isabella murmured, "I heard there’s a new secretary at your company. A very pretty one."

"Who?"

"You know exactly who I mean. The one who looks at you like you’re her personal god."

Henry chuckled. "Honestly, I have no idea who you’re talking about."

"Really? Then I’ll have your assistant transfer her."

"Do whatever you want."

Isabella softened, her voice dripping with playful possessiveness. "You must think I’m being jealous. But with a man like you—handsome, powerful—I have to keep you on a tight leash, or else you’ll be handing out favors to every woman who bats her lashes at you."

Henry’s hand slid beneath her skirt, his gaze darkening. "You drain me dry every night. I have nothing left for anyone else."

Isabella kissed him again. "Let’s have a baby."

Henry stilled. "Why the sudden change of heart?"

"Don’t you want one with me?"

"I do."

Eleanor had stood frozen outside the door, jealousy searing through her veins as she watched. Isabella, still in her stilettos, looked utterly wanton, the sharp tip of her shoe tracing slow circles against Henry’s trousers.

What man could resist that?

Henry had been young, passionate.

Isabella was beautiful, cunning, and raised to be the perfect trophy wife of the Blackwood dynasty. She knew exactly how to command a man’s attention—and she had made it clear from the start that she wanted everything Henry had to give.

In those early years, he had been completely enthralled.

Not long after, Isabella became pregnant.

Eleanor had hoped, foolishly, that this might be her chance. But Isabella only tightened her grip.

Once again, Eleanor had found herself outside the door, peering in.

Henry sat on the couch while Isabella knelt before him, worshipping him with unwavering devotion.

No man could ever refuse a woman like that.
###Chapter 705

Eleanor seethed with a white-hot rage toward Isabella.

That woman had stolen everything rightfully hers—Henry and the prestigious title of Mrs. Lancaster should have been Eleanor's by birthright!

Meanwhile, Henry returned to the private dining suite at The Grand View.

Arabella glanced up, curiosity flickering in her eyes. "Where did Mom go?"

"She had urgent matters to attend to," Henry replied smoothly, his voice betraying nothing.

"What? She left?" Arabella's lower lip trembled in a practiced pout, her expression the perfect blend of wounded innocence and childish petulance. "Why didn't she say goodbye?"

Henry studied his daughter—or the girl he had believed to be his daughter—with newfound scrutiny. Before Isabella's return, he'd never questioned Arabella's parentage. But now, doubt slithered through his mind like a venomous serpent.

He should have demanded a DNA test years ago.

Yet his face remained an unreadable mask. If Arabella truly was his blood, he couldn't risk her sensing his suspicions. And if she wasn't... well, that was an even greater reason for caution.

Composure was paramount.

"Have you finished eating?" Henry asked gently. "If so, we should head home."

Arabella nodded, satisfaction curling through her. Tomorrow, she would officially begin her position at Lancaster Enterprises.

Her gaze flicked to Harrison, who had been silently picking at her meal in the corner since arrival, maintaining an artful invisibility.

"Are you done?" Arabella's voice dripped with false sweetness. "We're leaving now. Surely you're not expecting to come with us?"

Harrison set down her fork with deliberate calm. "Thank you for dinner. I'll be returning to my own home."

Arabella shot her a razor-sharp glare before turning back to Henry. "Let's go."

Henry nodded at Harrison. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

As they stepped into the Lancaster family's sprawling villa half an hour later, Arabella made for the grand staircase.

"Arabella." Henry's voice stopped her.

She turned. "Yes?"

He reached out, tucking an imaginary strand of hair behind her ear—his fingers lingering just long enough. "Nothing. Sleep well."

The moment Arabella disappeared upstairs, the head butler materialized at Henry's side like a shadow.

"Mr. Lancaster."

Henry opened his palm, revealing a single dark hair. The butler produced a sterile evidence bag without a word.

"Have this tested immediately," Henry commanded as he sealed the strand inside. "I want results by tomorrow morning."

"Understood, sir."

Dawn painted the sky when Arabella awoke, her mood buoyant. Isabella's return had gone precisely as planned, and today marked her triumphant entry into Lancaster Enterprises.

She imagined the power she'd wield—perhaps Isabella would hand her the reins of their premier jewelry division today itself.

After applying meticulous makeup and selecting a dress that whispered elegance, Arabella descended to find Eleanor waiting in the sunlit foyer.

"Good morning, darling. The chef prepared your favorite—"

"I'm not hungry." Arabella's voice was glacial. "I'm going to Mother's company. Save your pathetic attempts at bonding. I've never liked you, and I won't have Mother getting the wrong idea."

Eleanor stiffened as if struck. "What's come over you?"

A knife-edged smile curved Arabella's lips. "Mrs. Whitmore, drop the act. We both know you've been scheming to marry Father. But Mother's back now—and my loyalty lies with blood."
###Chapter 706

Eleanor's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I'm pleased to see you and your mother share such a close bond. It warms my heart."

Isabella scoffed, her expression dripping with disdain. "Spare me the theatrics."

Her sharp gaze swept across the room before landing back on Eleanor. "Where's Father?"

Eleanor didn't even glance at her. Instead, she settled gracefully into her chair at the dining table, picking up her silverware with practiced elegance. She took a deliberate sip of her tea before answering.

"He left at dawn."

Isabella stiffened. Something was off. Eleanor had never dared to start eating before her—she had always been the one to wait on Isabella hand and foot.

"Where did he go?"

Eleanor set her cup down with a soft clink. "His butler arrived with what appeared to be a medical report. I didn't pry."

A medical report?

Isabella's pulse spiked. "What kind of report? Father never mentioned anything about medical tests."

Eleanor's smile deepened, slow and deliberate. "Hmm, let me think... Could it have been a DNA paternity test?"

A DNA test?

No.

Isabella's breath hitched, her fingers tightening around the edge of the table. "He had a DNA test done? When?"

Eleanor tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Why so nervous? If Henry had you tested, there’s nothing to fear. You are his real daughter, aren’t you?"

Isabella's face drained of color.

Last night—Henry had tousled her hair, and she'd felt a sharp tug. He must have taken a strand then.

Eleanor studied her with cold amusement. "Interesting, isn’t it? The moment Isabella returned, Henry suddenly needed a DNA test. Almost as if he doubts who you really are."

She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper. "But of course, you have nothing to worry about... unless you're not who you claim to be."

Isabella's blood ran cold.

Eleanor’s smile was serpentine, her eyes gleaming with quiet triumph. She knew.

Panic clawed at Isabella’s chest. Henry must have gone straight to Isabella with the results. If he showed her the report—

She was ruined.

Without another word, Isabella turned on her heel and bolted for the door.

Henry Lancaster strode into Lancaster Enterprises, his butler trailing behind him. The receptionist—a strikingly handsome young man—immediately stood to greet him.

"Mr. Lancaster, welcome."

Henry’s frown deepened.

The receptionist gestured smoothly. "Ms. Lancaster is expecting you. Please, follow me."

As Henry stepped further inside, his expression darkened.

Every single employee in the building was an impeccably groomed, devastatingly attractive man. Tall, sculpted, with sharp jawlines and tailored suits that hugged their frames.

This wasn’t just a corporate office.

It looked like the VIP section of an exclusive high-end club.
###Chapter 707

The striking receptionist swung open the doors to the CEO's office, revealing Henry Lancaster standing at the threshold. Isabella sat poised in the executive chair, her manicured fingers flipping through documents with practiced ease.

"Ms. Lancaster, Mr. Lancaster has arrived," the receptionist announced.

Without glancing up, Isabella signed the final page with a dramatic flourish. "Take a seat. I'll be with you shortly."

Henry's gaze traced her silhouette. The ivory silk blouse clung to her frame, paired with a tailored ebony skirt that accentuated every curve. Her caramel waves were pinned carelessly, exposing the elegant slope of her neck. Breathtaking.

"Coffee, Mr. Lancaster?" the attendant offered.

"Dismissed," Henry clipped.

The attendant vanished, leaving palpable tension in his wake.

Isabella snapped the folder shut and leveled him with an expectant look. "Early. Do you have the results?"

His jaw tightened. "Must there always be an agenda between us?"

She arched a sculpted brow. "Someone woke up on the wrong side of the penthouse."

Truth burned in his chest. Since her return, every conversation revolved around their child. Nothing more. Nothing less.

His laugh was ice. "Surrounded by your personal harem, I'm sure every day is delightful."

She blinked. "My staff?"

"An all-male ensemble. Revolutionary hiring strategy."

Crimson lips curved. "Six feet minimum. Chiseled abs. Ivy League pedigrees. Non-negotiable qualifications."

A muscle ticked in Henry's jaw. "Is this a corporation or a dating service? Since when does competence require testosterone?"

"Personal preference. My company, my rules." She leaned back, eyes glinting. "Now I understand why men stock their offices with lingerie models. Aesthetics matter."

"You're impossible." His fists clenched. "My entire executive team is male."

The butler coughed discreetly. "Ms. Lancaster, it's true. Mr. Lancaster hasn't employed a female assistant in seven years."

Isabella smirked. "Your celibacy doesn't dictate my HR policies." She turned to the butler. "And it's Ms. Lancaster now."

"Understood, Ms. Lancaster."

"Overruled," Henry growled. "She remains Mrs. Lancaster."

"Try the divorce papers, darling."

"Which you haven't signed!"

The butler inched backward, mentally drafting his resignation.

Isabella exhaled through her nose. "Results. Now."
###Chapter 708

Henry finally steadied his breathing and spoke in a measured tone. "The results have arrived."

He extended his hand, and the butler placed the sealed paternity report into his palm.

Isabella shot to her feet, her gaze locked onto the envelope with barely contained dread. "Is Arabella truly our daughter?"

She had never warmed to Arabella. People claimed mothers and daughters shared an unbreakable bond, yet Isabella felt nothing but cold detachment from the girl.

It unsettled her.

She couldn't shake the suspicion that Arabella wasn't truly theirs.

"The DNA results just came in. I know how much this weighs on you—I didn’t even glance at them before bringing them straight here," Henry said.

When it came to their daughter, he understood Isabella perfectly. She had nearly died giving birth—there was no chance they would ever take their child’s identity lightly.

"Then stop stalling and open it!" Isabella demanded, her voice sharp with urgency. "I need to see the truth."

Henry gave a slow nod. "Very well."

His fingers moved to break the seal.

Just then, a shrill voice cut through the tense silence outside the door. "Where is Mrs. Lancaster? I demand to see her immediately!"

Arabella had arrived.

The receptionist blocked her path. "Do you have an appointment?"

"An appointment?" Arabella scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Do you even know who I am? I'm the daughter of Henry Lancaster—the wealthiest man in the world! Since when do I need an appointment to see my own mother? Move aside!"

The receptionist held her ground. "Ms. Lancaster, I understand, but your parents are currently in a private meeting. Please wait here while I inform them of your arrival."

Arabella stood frozen outside, her pulse racing as she processed the receptionist’s words.

Her father was here too.

What were they discussing? Were they reviewing the DNA results? Was her entire life about to unravel?

The thought of exposure sent a wave of terror through her.

This was Henry Lancaster—the titan of industry—and Isabella Lancaster, CEO of Lancaster Enterprises.

She couldn’t let them discover the truth.

Most importantly, she could never allow Harrison to reclaim her rightful place. Henry and Isabella must never learn that Harrison was their true daughter.

Arabella shoved past the receptionist. "I don’t need permission to see my own parents!"

"Ms. Lancaster, you can’t just—"

As the commotion escalated outside, Henry turned to Isabella. "Arabella’s here."

Isabella didn’t look up from the report. "Ignore her. Open it. Now. I need to know if she’s really ours."

Henry exhaled sharply. "Alright."

He tore open the envelope and pulled out the DNA results.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed as she scanned the document.

Then—

BANG!

The door burst open.

Arabella had forced her way inside.

After all, she was a Lancaster—the receptionist hadn’t dared to physically restrain her.

"Dad! Mom!" she cried, feigning distress.

The receptionist bowed her head. "I apologize. Ms. Lancaster insisted—"

Isabella didn’t even glance at Arabella.

She stood motionless, staring at the report in her hands—the irrefutable proof that Arabella was, without question, their biological daughter.
###Chapter 709

The DNA test results lay on the desk like a ticking bomb. The document confirmed without a doubt that Isabella was the biological daughter of Henry Lancaster and his wife, the renowned business magnate Victoria Lancaster.

Victoria's hands trembled as she stared at the report. Every maternal instinct in her body had screamed that this girl wasn't hers. The connection simply wasn't there.

Yet science didn't lie. The numbers didn't lie.

Isabella swept into the office without knocking, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "What's going on in here?" she demanded, glancing between her parents.

Henry swiftly tucked the report into his desk drawer. They couldn't let Isabella know they'd been testing her DNA - not now that the results confirmed she was their flesh and blood. "Just reviewing some merger documents, sweetheart."

Isabella smirked and immediately latched onto Victoria's arm with possessive familiarity. "Mom, your secretary tried to stop me from seeing you. Since when do I need an appointment to visit my own mother?"

Victoria gave her assistant a pointed look. "From now on, Isabella has unrestricted access to my office."

"Of course, Mrs. Lancaster," the assistant murmured.

Satisfaction curled through Isabella as she turned back to Victoria. "So, about our conversation yesterday... Now that I've officially joined Lancaster Enterprises, where will you place me?"

Victoria considered for a moment. "You'll start with an internship in our marketing division."

Isabella's grip tightened painfully on Victoria's arm. "Marketing? As an intern?" The words tasted like ash in her mouth. She'd expected to be handed the reins to their billion-dollar couture jewelry line, not relegated to some entry-level position.

"Where exactly did you imagine starting?" Victoria asked evenly.

"I want to run the Lancaster Jewelry brand."

Henry and Victoria exchanged a loaded glance. Henry's brow furrowed. "That division is worth twelve billion dollars. You have zero experience in luxury goods or management."

Victoria nodded in agreement. "This isn't a game, Isabella. I can't risk thousands of employees' livelihoods or our flagship brand's reputation. You need to learn the business from the ground up. Prove yourself, and you'll advance quickly."

Isabella wrenched her arm away, eyes blazing. "You're treating me like some common employee!"

Victoria stood firm. "I'm treating you like my heir apparent - which means ensuring you're properly prepared."

"You don't love me at all!" Isabella spun on her heel and stormed out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the framed degrees on the wall.

Victoria started after her. "Isabella, wait—"

Then the world tilted violently. Victoria's vision tunneled to black as her legs gave out beneath her.

Henry moved like lightning, catching her before she hit the ground. He cradled her against his chest, her body frighteningly light in his arms. "Victoria? Talk to me."

Her skin had gone corpse-pale. "My head..." she whispered weakly.

"The toxin?" Henry's voice was tight with controlled panic.

A barely perceptible nod.

Without hesitation, Henry carried her to the executive suite's private lounge. He laid her gently on the plush divan, but her entire body shook with violent tremors. The air conditioning's chill seemed to seep into her bones.

Henry immediately adjusted the thermostat, then wrapped her in a cashmere throw from the nearby sofa. "Better?"

Victoria's teeth chattered uncontrollably. Then she felt it - Henry's body heat radiating through his tailored shirt like a furnace. With a whimper, she reached for him. "Hold me."

Henry hesitated only a second before lying down beside her. The moment he did, Victoria burrowed against him, her icy hands slipping beneath his shirt to press against the scorching heat of his skin.

Gently but firmly, Henry caught her wandering hands. "Easy there, princess." His voice was rough with something that wasn't quite admonishment.
###Chapter 710

Isabella smirked, her fingers tracing lazy circles on his chest. "Really? After all these years, you're going to play the shy, untouched gentleman with me?"

Henry remained silent, his jaw tightening as her fingers slipped another button free. The crisp white fabric parted, revealing the sculpted planes of his torso.

Her palm flattened against his skin, absorbing the heat radiating from him. She curled into him like ivy clinging to stone, her body molding against his with practiced ease.

Henry exhaled sharply but didn’t pull away.

The warmth of him seeped into her, easing the tension coiled in her limbs, though her face stayed unnaturally pale. "What about Eleanor—"

"Don’t," he cut her off, voice low. "My team has eyes on her. She won’t be a problem."

Isabella scoffed. "She wants a seat at the table, fine. But she expects the whole damn boardroom on her first day. That’s not how this works."

Taming Eleanor was proving to be more exhausting than either of them had anticipated.

Henry’s hand settled at the small of her back. "I know."

Her gaze snapped up, sharp as shattered glass. "You’re hard."

His eyes darkened, pupils swallowing the cool gray of his irises. He didn’t hesitate—just bent and captured her mouth.

She twisted away.

In one fluid motion, he flipped her beneath him, pinning her wrists to the mattress.

Isabella shoved at his shoulders. "Henry!"

"You noticed the problem," he murmured, voice rough. "Now you’re going to help solve it."

Her hand dipped into his pocket, fingers brushing dangerously close to the evidence of his arousal.

"Christ, Isabella." He caught her wrist, his grip just shy of painful. Did she think he was some toy she could wind up and put away?

She wrenched free and pulled out his phone. "Since you’re so worked up, I’ll call Eleanor for you."

His brow furrowed. "Enough. There’s nothing between us."

Ignoring him, she tapped the screen. "Still using my birthday as your passcode?"

The phone unlocked.

Her eyebrow arched. "You never changed it?"

Years later, and he still used the code she’d set—like some sentimental fool.

Her thumb hovered over Eleanor’s contact, but Henry caught her wrist again, slamming her hand back against the sheets.

"Shouldn’t my wife be handling this?"

"The divorce papers are already drafted," she hissed. "I’m not your—mmph!"

He kissed her again, harder this time.

Isabella writhed, nails digging into his shoulders. "Let go!"

Henry didn’t relent. His mouth trailed down her throat, his fingers slipping beneath the silk of her blouse.

She’d clung to him, touched him without hesitation—did she really think he wouldn’t react? That he was just some convenient source of warmth?

The fabric slid open, revealing smooth skin. His hand disappeared beneath the silk, the glint of his watch the only sign of restraint in a man who usually had too much of it.

Color flooded her cheeks. She shoved at him. "God, are you sixteen? It’s the middle of the day—have some shame!"

His breath hitched. "Since when did that ever stop us?"

She hadn’t forgotten. Their marriage might have been strategic, but the chemistry was undeniable.

Henry had lived up to every whispered rumor about high-society husbands.

And why wouldn’t he? She’d chosen him, after all. Handpicked him for this alliance.
###Chapter 711

Isabella gazed up at Henry with sudden intensity, her slender arms encircling his neck like delicate vines. "I'm feeling rather unwell," she murmured, her voice laced with feigned weakness. "Would you be so kind as to let me go?"

Henry's jaw tightened. He recognized her game immediately - the way she played with fire, testing his control. The memory of her collapsing earlier flashed through his mind, the way her body had gone limp in his arms. That recollection alone stayed his hand.

"Are you deliberately provoking me?" His voice was a low growl, rough with restrained desire.

She batted her lashes, all wide-eyed innocence. "Whatever do you mean?"

This - this teasing, this maddening dance where she held all the power without even realizing it.

Isabella attempted to withdraw her hands, but Henry caught her delicate fingers in his firm grasp, drawing them downward with deliberate slowness.

She stiffened instantly. "Henry! What are you—"

"I require your assistance," he stated simply.

"Absolutely not!" Her refusal came swift and sharp.

"Did I give you permission to refuse me?"

Before she could protest further, Henry claimed her lips in a searing kiss that left no room for argument.

Meanwhile, Eleanor stormed through the grand foyer of Rosewood Manor, her heels striking the marble with angry precision. The cold dismissal she'd received at Isabella's residence still burned in her chest. With a violent sweep of her arm, she sent an antique vase crashing to the floor, the delicate porcelain shattering into countless fragments.

A maid rushed forward. "Ms. Lancaster, is everything—"

"Get out!" Eleanor snapped, her voice like cracking ice. "I don't wish to be disturbed!"

The maid froze, barely daring to breathe.

At that moment, Victoria appeared, her serene voice cutting through the tension. "That will be all," she told the maid with a gentle smile. "Someone will attend to this later."

The maid nodded gratefully and hurried away.

Victoria settled gracefully onto the sofa opposite Eleanor, her smile never wavering. "You went to see your mother, didn't you? Though I suppose we both know Isabella isn't truly your mother."

That morning, Eleanor had treated Victoria with disdain. Now, all that arrogance had evaporated, replaced by wary apprehension. Eleanor moved to sit beside Victoria, taking her hand with an ingratiating smile. "Ms. Olsen, I must thank you for today."

Victoria arched a perfect brow. "For what exactly?"

"If you hadn't altered those DNA results, my true identity would have been exposed."

The paternity test had been expertly falsified - Victoria's handiwork, prepared well in advance.

Victoria studied Eleanor with calculating eyes. "When Henry first brought you back from Willowbrook, I had my doubts. The moment he ordered that DNA test, I knew you were an impostor. You're not Henry and Isabella's child. Even I could see through you, so naturally they suspected as well. I intervened to protect you. Without me, your comfortable life would have ended today."

The realization of Victoria's machinations struck Eleanor with full force. Victoria had seen through her deception from the beginning, manipulating events from the shadows. She was completely at Victoria's mercy.

"Thank you," Eleanor breathed. "You saved me."

Victoria's lips curled into a cold smile as she withdrew her hand. "And how do you intend to repay this favor?"

Eleanor had always known Victoria's help came with strings attached. "What do you want from me?"

"I hold all the cards now. You'll do exactly as I say. Isabella is my enemy. I want you to help me destroy her. More than that, I want you to help me become Mrs. Lancaster."

Understanding dawned on Eleanor's face - they were allies now, bound by shared secrets. She nodded slowly. "Very well. I'll do as you ask."

Victoria's smile widened, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes.

Back in the lounge, Henry was carefully wiping Isabella's hands with a warm towel, his touch unexpectedly gentle. Isabella, still irritated, snatched the towel and flung it directly at his face.
###Chapter 712

Henry didn't release his hold. He allowed Isabella to pour out her emotions against his chest.

Stretching back onto the bed, he drew Isabella closer in a protective embrace. "Do you recall Harrison?" Isabella gave a small nod. "Yes, of course."

"She possesses extraordinary medical talents. The renowned Dr. Sinclair herself. She even restored Victoria's ability to walk."

Isabella's face brightened instantly. "Truly? That's marvelous! I never imagined her skills were so exceptional. Strangely enough, I always feel drawn to that young woman whenever we meet - unlike with Arabella."

Truth be told, Henry shared the same inexplicable connection. Yet the DNA results undeniably confirmed Arabella as their biological child.

Noticing the exhaustion in Isabella's pale eyes, Henry suggested, "I'll contact Harrison to examine you."

Isabella hesitated. "Do you think she'd agree? We've only met once."

Henry gave a casual shrug. "Let's find out."

He reached for his phone.

Isabella gazed up at him. "You're surprisingly concerned about me, considering I'm your ex-wife."

Henry's arm tightened around her. "For the final time, our divorce was never finalized. You're not my ex-wife - you remain Mrs. Lancaster!" Isabella responded with an eye roll.

The call connected after two rings. "Hello, Mr. Lancaster."

"Harrison, I need your assistance."

"Of course. You've helped me before - I'm happy to return the favor."

"Isabella's experiencing health complications. Would you be willing to examine her?"

Without pause, Harrison replied, "Certainly. Where are you? I'll come immediately."

"Lancaster Enterprises," Henry answered. "I can send a car."

"No need. I'll arrange my own transportation. See you shortly."

As the call ended, Isabella's expression brightened. "Is Harrison really coming?"

Henry confirmed with a nod. "Yes."

Isabella attempted to rise. "Then I should prepare."

Henry held her firmly. "Rest here. She'll examine you upon arrival."

Reluctantly, Isabella settled back. "Very well. But you should leave the bed."

Henry traced his fingers along her now-warm skin, shooting her a sidelong glance. "Moments ago you clung to me desperately - now you're kicking me out? How cold."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "You called me Mrs. Lancaster when grabbing my hand, yet now it's back to Isabella. Who's being cold here?"

Henry fell silent but made no move to release her. "Let me hold you a while longer. Harrison hasn't arrived yet."

"By the time she does, it'll be too late. Do you want her walking in on us like this?"

"And if she does? What's improper about a married couple sharing a bed?"

Their conversation was interrupted by a male voice outside. "Dr. Sinclair, please enter. Mr. Lancaster and Ms. Brewer are inside."

Harrison's gentle voice responded. "Thank you, though I don't see them."

"They must be in the lounge. You may check there."

"Understood."

As the lounge door began to open, Isabella panicked - Henry remained sprawled across her bed. Without hesitation, she planted her foot against his side and shoved him unceremoniously onto the floor.
###Chapter 713

Henry Lancaster crashed onto the hardwood floor with a resounding thud, his muscular frame hitting the ground with unexpected force.

Isabella Lancaster stood frozen in the doorway, her manicured nails digging into her palms as she witnessed the unbelievable scene. The formidable CEO of Lancaster Enterprises, the man who commanded boardrooms with a single glance, had just been unceremoniously kicked off the bed by his wife, Isabella.

A snort escaped her before she could stop it.

Henry pushed himself up, dusting off his tailored suit with deliberate movements. His stormy gaze flicked between the two women—one smirking, the other glaring. "Something amusing, Harrison?"

Harrison pressed her lips together, shoulders shaking. "My apologies—it's just—" Another laugh bubbled up. "I didn't expect to see you... dethroned."

Henry's jaw tightened.

Isabella smoothed the silk sheets beneath her fingers, offering Harrison a polite nod. "Dr. Whitmore, thank you for coming."

Harrison stepped forward, her demeanor shifting to professional warmth. "Please, call me Harrison. Formalities are unnecessary between us."

Isabella inclined her head. "Harrison, then."

"Let me check your pulse."

Isabella extended her wrist. The moment Harrison's fingers made contact, her expression darkened.

Henry stiffened. "What is it?"

Harrison's voice was grave. "Has Isabella ever been poisoned?"

Henry nodded sharply. "Yes. During her pregnancy with Eleanor."

Isabella added, "I fell into a coma the day she was born. The doctors couldn't identify the toxin."

Harrison exhaled slowly. "Isabella, you weren't just poisoned. You were cursed. This is the Frostholm Curse."

"The Frostholm Curse?" Henry and Isabella echoed in unison.

Harrison's grip on Isabella's wrist tightened. "One of the deadliest curses known. It latches onto its victim like a parasite. Do you know who did this to you?"

Isabella's eyes flashed toward Henry. "Isn't it obvious? Your precious Eleanor!"

Henry's voice turned icy. "Impossible. Eleanor wouldn't—"

"Of course, you'd defend her!" Isabella snapped. "To you, she's a saint, and I'm just the woman who stole the Lancaster name. Well, she can have it back!"

Henry's expression darkened. "You're being irrational."

"Enough!" Harrison cut in sharply. "Arguing won't help."

She studied them both—Henry's clenched fists, Isabella's defiant glare—and sighed. "I can break the curse."

Isabella's breath hitched. "You can?"

Henry stepped closer. "How?"

Harrison met his gaze steadily. "There's only one way. I need your cardiogen—an essence extracted directly from your heart."

Isabella recoiled. "You're saying... to save me, Henry has to die?"

Harrison nodded solemnly. "The Frostholm Curse demands a life for a life. Henry, are you willing to sacrifice yourself for hers?"

Isabella's voice cracked. "No!"

Henry didn't hesitate. "Yes."

Their responses overlapped—one desperate, one resolute.

Isabella stared at him, her chest heaving. "You can't—"

Henry cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheek. "I already decided. Take it."

Harrison watched, her expression unreadable. "Once I begin, there's no turning back."

Henry didn't look away from Isabella. "Do it."
###Chapter 714

Isabella's breath hitched sharply in her throat.

"Henry, have you lost your mind?" Her fingers dug into his forearm. "Giving up your cardiogen means certain death! I won't accept this—I refuse to let you trade your life for mine!"

Henry Lancaster didn't meet her panicked gaze. His steely eyes remained locked on Harrison. "Proceed with the treatment."

Isabella yanked his sleeve desperately. "Stop this madness! Harrison, ignore him—I don't consent to this!"

A knowing smirk played on Harrison's lips as she observed their heated exchange.

"Mr. Lancaster, there's no immediate urgency." She produced a vial from her coat pocket. "This will temporarily suppress the toxin. Since you're determined to make this... sacrifice..." Her gaze turned calculating. "Surely a man of your stature has affairs to settle? Business empires don't run themselves, and inheritances require proper documentation."

She was giving him time to draft his will.

The silence stretched between them before Henry gave a curt nod. "Three days. Then you'll have what you need."

"Agreed." Harrison pocketed the vial.

Henry turned to leave, but Isabella caught his wrist. "Wait—"

He pulled away without looking back, his broad shoulders rigid with resolve. The door clicked shut with finality.

Isabella whirled toward Harrison, her voice trembling. "I appreciate your help, but I won't be saved at his expense!"

Harrison's lips curved into a mischievous grin. "Darling, I may have... embellished the consequences."

"What?" Isabella's eyes widened. "You lied?"

"Necessary theatrics." Harrison winked. "Had to confirm his true feelings, didn't I? You've always believed Eleanor held his heart." She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Yet the moment I demanded his life force, he agreed without hesitation. What does that tell you?"

Isabella's throat tightened. "It was a moment of weakness. He and Eleanor share something unbreakable. She's—"

"Still clinging to that narrative?" Harrison interrupted gently. She grasped Isabella's icy hands, transferring warmth through their linked fingers. "Let's conduct a little experiment, shall we?"

Confusion flickered across Isabella's face. "I don't understand."

Harrison's eyes sparkled with cunning. "You claim his offer was impulsive? Let's see if he actually signs his fortune away to save you." She squeezed Isabella's hands. "The world's full of illusions, sweetheart. But when faced with mortality? That's when masks shatter."

A slow realization dawned on Isabella. "You want to see Eleanor's reaction when she learns he's willing to die for me."

"Precisely." Harrison's grin turned wolfish. "Imagine the fireworks when the golden heir prepares to martyr himself for another woman."

A strange warmth blossomed in Isabella's chest. Without thinking, she pulled Harrison into a fierce embrace.

"You're terrifyingly brilliant." Her voice cracked with emotion. "Sometimes I wonder if you're some sort of..."
###Chapter 715

The years-long feud between Isabella and Eleanor had reached an impasse, with Henry Lancaster caught in the middle like frozen prey between two predators. No progress. No resolution. Just endless tension.

Then Harrison arrived.

With her quiet elegance and razor-sharp mind, she unraveled the knotted threads between them effortlessly. Like a breath of fresh air in a suffocating room.

Isabella studied the young woman before her. "We've only met once, yet you're helping me like this. Why?"

Harrison's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Sometimes one meeting is enough to recognize kindred spirits. Though I should warn you—your daughter Isabella and I have... history. If she sees us together, her reaction won't be pleasant."

The contrast between the two young women couldn't be starker.

Isabella was spoiled rotten, throwing tantrums over designer handbags while Harrison had not only treated her illness but devised strategies to help her.

A bitter taste filled Isabella's mouth. This remarkable woman wasn't her daughter. The one who was? A constant disappointment.

"You've saved me," Isabella declared, gripping Harrison's hand. "As long as I'm here, that brat won't lay a finger on you."

Harrison's shoulders relaxed. "Then let the show begin."

The stage was set.

Henry returned to Rosewood Manor to find Eleanor waiting. "You're home."

Isabella rushed forward. "Daddy!"

Henry's gaze turned glacial. "Running away today was unacceptable. Your mother nearly collapsed searching for you."

Isabella's face twisted with contempt. "That woman doesn't care about me! Growing up motherless, I dreamed of her return—only to be betrayed all over again!" She pinched her wrist hard enough to draw tears.

Eleanor embraced her. "Shh, darling. You'll always have me."

Isabella clung to her. "Daddy, I want Ms. Eleanor to be my mother!"

Eleanor's cheeks flushed as she glanced hopefully at Henry.

Henry's expression darkened. "Enough! Your mother is Isabella. Never speak of this again!"

Both women froze.

Eleanor paled. "She didn't mean it—"

But Isabella wasn't finished. "Ms. Eleanor has stood by you for decades! She's given you her youth while Mother abandoned us! You owe her—"

CRACK!

Henry's palm connected with Isabella's cheek with brutal force.

Silence.

Isabella touched her stinging face in disbelief. After all her misdeeds, her father had never raised a hand to her.

Until now.

For Harrison.
###Chapter 716

Eleanor stood frozen in shock. "Henry, how could you strike Isabella? She's your own flesh and blood!"

Isabella pressed a trembling hand to her stinging cheek, her voice quivering. "You...you actually hit me? After everything, this is how you treat me?"

Henry's face turned deathly pale, his piercing gaze locked onto Isabella with icy precision.

"I've indulged you far too much. To think you'd dare speak against your own mother? Victoria gave you life—nearly lost hers bringing you into this world! And this is how you repay her? By demanding a replacement mother like some spoiled child? Have you no concept of family loyalty?"

Never before had Henry erupted with such fury.

Both Isabella and Eleanor were rendered speechless, the air thick with tension.

Tears spilled down Isabella's cheeks. "Father—"

"Don't call me that!" Henry snapped, his voice like a whip. "You've shattered my expectations." With that, he stormed upstairs, slamming the study door behind him.

Moments later, his butler arrived, slipping quietly into the study.

Panic clawed at Isabella's chest as she clutched Eleanor's arm. "I said everything you told me to, but why did he react like this? He never intended to marry you, did he?"

Eleanor didn't need the confirmation. The truth had been clear for years—if Henry had wanted her, he wouldn't have waited this long.

What stunned her was his fierce defense of Victoria. Could he truly...love her?

Steeling herself, Eleanor prepared a fresh cup of coffee and approached the study. She knocked softly. "It's me."

Henry's voice, though controlled, carried through the door. "Enter."

She pushed inside.

Henry sat behind his desk, the butler standing at attention nearby.

Eleanor set the coffee down carefully. "I've spoken with Isabella. She's your daughter—you shouldn't stay angry with her forever—"

Henry cut her off. "Eleanor, is there someone you wish to marry?"

Her spine stiffened.

His gaze never wavered.

"Your father died because of mine. I promised you a home here for as long as you desired. Over the years, I introduced you to countless suitable matches, yet you turned them all down. Time slipped through your fingers."

"I understand what you're implying," Eleanor interjected quickly. "Isabella misunderstood. You've sheltered me all these years, an orphan with nothing. I'm grateful."

"You were welcome here before. Now, you must leave."

Eleanor's breath hitched. "What? You're throwing me out?"

"I've transferred ownership of the Willowbrook villa to you," Henry stated calmly. "Along with sufficient funds to live comfortably for the rest of your days."

Confusion flickered across her face—until her eyes landed on the document atop his desk.

A will.

The word struck like a blade.

She stepped forward. "Why are you drafting a will?"

Henry's voice was steady, yet grim. "I've found a way to save Victoria. She carries the Frostholm Curse. Now, I will trade my life for hers—a life for a life."
###Chapter 717

Eleanor stood frozen, her entire body rigid as if struck by lightning. Her wide eyes locked onto Henry in utter disbelief.

"You—what?! You found a way to save Isabella, but it means trading your life for hers?"

Henry gave a slow, solemn nod. "That's correct."

Eleanor's breath hitched. She took an unsteady step forward, her voice trembling. "You're seriously willing to die for her?"

"I am. I didn't want to hide this from you," he said, his tone eerily calm. "Your father once did the Lancasters a great service. I owe it to him to ensure you're taken care of before anything happens. It's the only way I can repay that debt."

A debt. That was all this was to him? All their history, every moment between them—reduced to nothing more than an obligation?

Eleanor's hands clenched into fists at her sides. "This is insanity! You're at the peak of your power—wealth, influence, everything! And you'd throw it all away for Isabella? I won't allow it! There must be another way!"

To her, Isabella wasn't worth the dirt beneath Henry's shoes. How could he even consider this?

No. Never.

"My decision is final," Henry said, his voice firm. "There's no point arguing."

"Henry!"

"If there's nothing else, I'd like you to leave now."

Eleanor knew that tone. Once Henry made up his mind, no force on earth could change it.

Her gaze flickered to the will resting on his desk. "How are you dividing your estate? Isabella is your only daughter. Surely you're leaving everything to her?"

Right now, Isabella was her only bargaining chip. She needed to know its worth.

If Henry was willing to hand over his empire to Isabella, then maybe—just maybe—she could accept this madness.

She waited, pulse racing.

But Henry's lips pressed into a thin line. "I'm not leaving my fortune to Isabella."

Eleanor's breath caught. "What? She's your heir—your blood!"

"You're mistaken. My legal heir is my wife. Isabella and I are still married. She remains Mrs. Lancaster."

Eleanor's face drained of color. "So... everything... goes to Isabella?"

Henry nodded.

"Everything. Isabella is reckless, spoiled. She disrespects her mother when she doesn't get her way. I can't trust her with my estate. If she inherits it all, she'll have no reason to treat Isabella with dignity. That's why Isabella will control it. If our daughter learns to respect her mother in the future, Isabella will provide for her."

Eleanor's nails dug into her palms, drawing blood, but she barely felt it.

Everything. He was giving everything to Isabella.

He was worried their daughter would mistreat Isabella if she inherited directly.

Every last cent. Every asset. Every shred of power—all for Isabella.

His entire world revolved around her.

Rage burned through Eleanor's veins, but she forced it down, exhaling slowly. "Well... it's your estate. You have every right to decide. I'll leave you to it."

Henry gave a curt nod. "Good."

The moment Eleanor stepped out of the study, her expression twisted into something dark and venomous.

She had been the one to cast the curse on Isabella. The Frostholm Curse—the most merciless, the most cruel. It had been her weapon to break Isabella once before.

For years, she had held all the power. She had always been in control.

Even with Isabella back in the country, Eleanor had never once felt threatened.

Until now.
###Chapter 718

The tables had turned in the most unexpected way.

Henry Lancaster had discovered a method to save Isabella—one that demanded the ultimate sacrifice. His own life.

Eleanor stood frozen, her carefully constructed plans crumbling before her eyes. This wasn't supposed to happen. Henry belonged to her.

If he gave his life for Isabella, everything would be lost. The Lancaster fortune, the title of Mrs. Lancaster—all of it would slip through her fingers like sand.

A villa? A few million? Pathetic.

She wanted everything.

And she would not let Isabella take it from her.

Eleanor stormed into Arabella's room without knocking. The girl was admiring herself in a new designer gown, one of dozens she had ordered this month alone.

Living as Henry Lancaster's daughter had spoiled her rotten.

Arabella shrieked and clutched the dress to her chest. "What the hell? I'm changing!"

Eleanor's lips curled in disgust. "Get dressed. Your little shopping sprees are about to end."

Arabella frowned, hastily pulling on the gown. "What are you talking about?"

"Henry is drafting his will."

Arabella's face paled. "What? Why? He's perfectly healthy!"

Eleanor's voice was ice. "He found a way to save Isabella. A life for a life. He's planning to trade his own."

Arabella's breath hitched.

No.

She hated Isabella. The woman should have died years ago.

"And do you know what's in that will?" Eleanor pressed.

Arabella's pulse quickened.

She was Henry's only blood relative. The Lancaster fortune would be hers.

The thought nearly made her laugh. If this was the price, then let him die!

Eleanor saw the greed flicker in Arabella's eyes and smirked. "Don't get excited. You're not in it."

Arabella froze. "What?"

Eleanor leaned closer. "Henry and Isabella never divorced. She's still his legal wife—his primary heir. He's leaving everything to her. As for you?" She scoffed. "He said if you can somehow win Isabella's favor, she might share a crumb with you. But we both know that will never happen."

She let the words sink in.

"You'll get nothing."

The words struck Arabella like a slap.

All these years of pretending, of playing the perfect daughter—for nothing?

Panic surged through her. She grabbed Eleanor's arm. "You have to help me! There has to be a way! That money is mine—it belongs to us!"

Eleanor smiled slowly. "There is a way. But you'll do exactly as I say."

Arabella's eyes gleamed. "Tell me."
###Chapter 719

Eleanor produced a delicate sachet of powder and pressed it into Isabella's palm. "Use this."

Isabella examined it warily. "What is it?"

Eleanor's lips curved into a knowing smirk. "A love potion. Tonight, you'll prepare Henry's coffee and mix this in. Once he drinks it, he won't be able to resist a woman's touch. And tonight, that woman will be me."

She had spent hours preparing—softening her skin with rose-infused oils, perfuming herself with jasmine. If everything went as planned, she would conceive Henry's child.

With his heir growing inside her, she would reclaim her power and crush Isabella once and for all.

Isabella's brows shot up. "You made this yourself? Are you certain it works?"

"Absolutely." Eleanor's voice dripped with confidence. "I studied herbal remedies for years. This will not fail."

Isabella hesitated. "But what if he suspects something?"

Eleanor's gaze hardened. "He won't. Not if you serve it to him. Time is running out. If he sacrifices himself for Isabella, we both lose everything. Do you want to return to being a nobody?"

Isabella's grip tightened around the sachet. No. She couldn't go back. Not after tasting luxury, power, the life she was born to claim.

"Fine. I'll do it."

"Good. Hurry."

Isabella brewed the coffee with trembling hands, stirring in the powder until it dissolved completely. Then she knocked on Henry's study door.

"Father? May I come in?"

"Enter."

She stepped inside, placing the cup before him. "I made this for you."

Henry studied her. "Have you reflected on your behavior?"

Of course not.

"I have." She lowered her eyes, feigning remorse. "I was selfish. I shouldn't have spoken ill of Mother or caused her distress. I just... I missed you both so much growing up. I acted out because I needed to know you loved me."

Her voice cracked—just enough to sound genuine.

Henry's stern expression softened. Despite everything, she was still his daughter. His blood.

"I'm glad you understand. Your mother and I only want what's best for you."

Isabella nudged the coffee closer. "Please, try it. I made it just for you."

Henry took a sip.

"Well?" she pressed.

"Delicious."

"Drink it all. It's... my way of making amends."

He obliged, draining the cup.

A satisfied smile curled her lips. "I should go. I don't want to disturb you further."

Henry nodded. "Rest well."

The moment the door closed behind her, Eleanor materialized from the shadows. Isabella flashed a discreet thumbs-up.

Eleanor smirked. Just as planned.

She retreated to her chambers, shedding her robe as she stepped into a bath of warm milk and crushed rose petals. Though past her youth, her skin remained flawless—toned, supple, irresistible.

Tonight, Henry Lancaster would be hers.

And tomorrow?

The game would change forever.

###Chapter 720

Eleanor possessed an ethereal beauty, her delicate features glowing under the dim lighting.

She radiated confidence. Tonight would be the night she finally claimed Henry Lancaster's heart.

Upstairs, Henry sat buried in paperwork in his study. Having pledged his life to Isabella, endless responsibilities demanded his attention.

Suddenly, an unfamiliar heat surged through his veins. His fingers fumbled with his collar buttons, but the feverish sensation only intensified.

He staggered to his feet and retreated to his master suite, turning the shower to its coldest setting.

The icy water did nothing to quell the fire raging within him. If anything, it stoked the flames higher.

Wrapped in black silk pajamas, Henry collapsed onto his bed and reached for his phone to summon his assistant.

The duvet shifted.

Eleanor emerged from beneath the covers, her skin still dewy from her bath. A rosy flush colored her cheeks as she gazed at Henry with liquid desire.

"Henry..." Her voice was honeyed temptation.

A fresh wave of heat crashed over him. His throat worked as he growled, "What the hell are you doing here?"

Her lips curved. "Waiting for you."

Henry's jaw clenched. "Get out. Now."

He tried to stand.

Eleanor moved faster. She launched herself at him, her arms locking around his torso. Her voluptuous body molded against his back, warm and pliant.

"Don't go," she purred, her breath hot against his ear. "Do you really want me to leave?"

Henry's pupils dilated, crimson bleeding into his gaze. Years of celibacy meant nothing against the drug's potency. His last shreds of resistance crumbled.

Eleanor knew the aphrodisiac's power intimately. Sensing his weakening resolve, she traced the hard planes of his chest through the thin silk.

"You're burning up," she whispered, lips brushing his earlobe. "Why fight it? I'm right here. I've always been yours."

Henry shoved her onto the mattress. "This is wrong!"

He tried to retreat again.

Eleanor caught his neck, pulling him down. "Why? I love you. Don't you feel this too? I want to belong to you completely."

Henry trembled with restraint. Sweat slicked his forehead as veins corded his straining muscles.

The face beneath him blurred—transforming into Isabella's breathtaking features.

"Isabella..." His voice cracked.

Downstairs, Victoria Lancaster lounged on the velvet sofa, savoring her espresso.

She knew what was unfolding upstairs. Once Henry crossed that line with Eleanor, victory would be hers.

The maid's voice shattered her reverie. "Mrs. Lancaster! You're home?"

Victoria's cup froze mid-air.

Isabella stood in the foyer.

And she wasn't alone. Harrison stood beside her.

They'd arrived together.
###Chapter 721

Isabella's face clouded over instantly. The last people she expected to see at this crucial moment were Victoria and Harrison. Their presence threatened to ruin everything.

She stood abruptly, plastering on a practiced smile. "Mother? What brings you here?"

Victoria's sharp eyes scanned the room. "I wanted to see how you were doing."

Isabella's lips curved, though her icy gaze betrayed her irritation. "I'm perfectly fine. There was no need for you to check on me." Her voice took on a razor edge. "And why did you bring her?"

Harrison blinked with exaggerated innocence. "Hello, Isabella."

Isabella looped her arm possessively through Victoria's, fingers digging in slightly. "You know Harrison and I don't get along. She's always been cruel to me. I can't bear having her here!"

Victoria sighed wearily. "She's explained everything to me. Harrison is a good person. Perhaps there were misunderstandings before, but I expect you both to behave civilly from now on. Is that clear?"

Isabella stiffened, disgust churning in her gut.

Of course Victoria would take Harrison's side. Blood always won out in the end.

"But I'm your daughter," Isabella whispered, voice trembling with wounded pride. "Why do you never defend me?"

Victoria's patience snapped. "I know you're my daughter, but I care about Harrison too. Is basic decency really so difficult?"

Isabella fell silent, fists clenched at her sides.

Harrison smirked, delighting in Isabella's visible frustration. Her eyes darted around the room. "Where's Mr. Lancaster?"

Isabella's stomach lurched.

Victoria frowned. "Yes, Isabella. Your father should be home. Where is he?"

A slow, calculated smile spread across Isabella's face. "He's resting in his room. Did you need him for something? I can take you to him."

Victoria nodded. "Very well. Lead the way."

Isabella gestured sweetly. "Right this way."

The three women ascended the stairs, stopping outside Henry's bedroom door.

Isabella lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "He might be sleeping. Let's be quiet—we'll give him a lovely surprise."

Victoria agreed.

Isabella turned the knob and pushed the door open, then gasped theatrically. "Mother, Father is...!"

Victoria tensed. "What's wrong?"

Harrison craned her neck. "Is Mr. Lancaster alright?"

Isabella stepped aside, her face a masterpiece of feigned shock. "I-I can't explain. You need to see for yourselves."

Victoria and Harrison peered inside—and froze.

There, on the bed, Henry had Eleanor pinned beneath him. Both wore sleepwear, their movements intimate and heated. The air practically crackled with tension.

Henry moved in a drugged haze, but Eleanor was fully aware. She sensed the intrusion immediately. Turning her head, she locked eyes with Victoria in the doorway.

Perfect timing!

After flashing Victoria a triumphant smile, Eleanor arched into Henry, her voice dropping to a sultry purr. "I know you want me. Don't hold back. I'm yours."

She pressed a kiss to his cheek.

Henry groaned, his fingers tangling in the delicate fabric of her nightgown. With a rough tug, the fragile straps snapped, revealing smooth skin and the lace trim of her lingerie.

Eleanor let out a breathy moan. "Easy, darling..."

Victoria stood rigid, all color draining from her face.

Then, without a word, she turned on her heel and walked away.
###Chapter 722

Isabella rushed after her mother. "Mother, I swear I didn't know Father and Eleanor were... doing that in there! Please forgive me—I never meant for you to witness such a scene!"

Isabella Lancaster's fingers trembled with cold shock as she struggled to maintain composure. "This isn't your doing, Isabella. Truthfully, I'm not surprised. Eleanor has resided here for years. Their... entanglement was inevitable."

She had long suspected Henry Lancaster's infidelity with Eleanor, but seeing the physical evidence shattered her remaining illusions.

"Mother—"

"I need to leave immediately," Isabella declared, her voice brittle.

The opulent Lancaster estate suddenly felt suffocating—every gilded surface mocking her humiliation.

Watching her mother's retreating figure, the younger Isabella allowed a subtle smirk to play across her lips.

Her mother and Harrison's unexpected arrival tonight had been serendipitous. The timing couldn't have been more perfect!

Meanwhile, Harrison remained frozen at the threshold, her sharp gaze dissecting the compromising scene. Without hesitation, she flung the door wide and marched inside.

"Mr. Lancaster!"

Isabella spun around, eyes widening as Harrison invaded her father's private chambers. Was the woman insane?

She lunged forward. "Have you lost your mind? This is Lancaster property! Your uninvited presence is bad enough, but barging into the master bedroom? Remove yourself at once!"

Isabella attempted to physically eject Harrison, but the intruder deftly sidestepped her, advancing toward the canopied bed.

"Mr. Lancaster!" Harrison's voice cut through the heavy air.

Eleanor observed silently from the disheveled sheets, calculating whether Harrison had finally snapped.

Henry, still groggy from the sedatives, remained oblivious until Harrison's second shout pierced his haze. His bleary eyes focused on Harrison's porcelain features—an icy wake-up call.

"What—how did you—?" Henry stammered, struggling upright.

Harrison's gaze flickered to Eleanor's exposed form. "Do you comprehend what you're doing?"

Only then did Henry realize the woman beneath him wasn't Isabella—but Eleanor. He recoiled as if burned. "What witchcraft is this? Why are you in my bed?"

"I—I can explain—" Eleanor stuttered.

Both women paled. Their carefully orchestrated scene had unraveled spectacularly thanks to Harrison's interference.

Isabella stepped between them. "Enough! Get out before I call security!"

Henry's panicked eyes sought Harrison's. "This isn't what it seems—Eleanor and I—"

Harrison dismissed the sputtering women, addressing only Henry. "Save your explanations for your wife."

His head snapped toward the doorway. "Isabella was here?"

Harrison nodded grimly. "She witnessed everything from the hall. She's already departed."

Henry's face drained of color.

"If you hurry," Harrison added pointedly, "you might still catch her."

Without another word, Henry bolted from the room, shirt still unbuttoned.

"Henry!"

"Father!"

The two women stood frozen, their perfect trap sprung by the one variable they'd never accounted for.

Why did Harrison Whitmore always defy expectations?
###Chapter 723

Isabella's voice shook with barely contained fury as she pierced Harrison with a venomous glare.

"Who do you think you are?! This is Lancaster family business! What gives you the right to interfere?"

Eleanor slipped off the bed, her meticulously constructed scheme crumbling before her. Everything had been progressing perfectly until Harrison had stormed in like a hurricane.

The fragile pretense dropped from Eleanor's face as she leveled Harrison with an icy stare. "Ms. Whitmore, you certainly have a talent for inserting yourself where you don't belong."

Harrison's sharp gaze locked onto Eleanor's face.

"I understand why you're upset. Anyone with eyes can see you're interested in Mr. Lancaster."

Her words cut like knives. "But let me be blunt—Mr. Lancaster hasn't divorced Ms. Lancaster yet. You openly climbing into a married man's bed—doesn't that make you the other woman? Do you take pride in being a homewrecker?"

Eleanor froze like a statue. She'd once triumphed over the legal wife, but against Harrison's razor-sharp tongue, she found herself defenseless. "How dare you—"

Harrison turned her attention to Isabella.

"You're acting strange. I get why Ms. Whitmore is upset, but why are you angry? Ms. Lancaster is your mother. Do you actually want your father cheating on her with someone else?"

Her suspicious gaze darted between them.

"Unless...you knew Ms. Whitmore was trying to seduce your father and deliberately brought your mother here to witness it? Only someone truly twisted would do that, right?"

Isabella was speechless. Harrison's words struck like arrows, but more terrifying was how accurately she'd guessed their scheme.

Harrison was onto them.

Panicked, Isabella blurted, "Stop spouting nonsense! I had no idea what my father and Ms. Whitmore were doing! I'm angry because you're always hovering around my parents. I'm their daughter, not you! What's your game? Trying to steal my parents from me?"

Harrison regarded her calmly. "If they're truly your parents, why are you so insecure? So terrified I'll take them from you? If you're genuinely concerned, maybe focus on being a better daughter instead of staging dramas."

With that, Harrison turned and strode out.

Unbelievable!

Isabella grabbed the bedside lamp and hurled it to the floor with a crash.

Harrison was absolutely infuriating.

"What now? Father ran after Mother!"

Eleanor's face darkened. "I don't need the reminder! This is all Harrison's fault. Without her interference, my plan would've succeeded!"

"What do we do?"

"I'll devise another approach."

Meanwhile, Isabella barricaded herself inside Rosewood Manor, slamming the door behind her. The image of Henry and Eleanor tangled together on that bed kept replaying in her mind.

Over two decades had passed. She'd thought she'd moved on, that it no longer mattered.

Yet the pain felt fresh as yesterday.

Her eyes burned as if stabbed, her heart pierced just as sharply.

Henry, that wretched man! She must've been out of her mind to marry him all those years ago.

A maid's voice outside startled her. "Mr. Lancaster? What are you doing here?"

Henry had followed her.

A knock sounded at the door, followed by his deep voice. "Isabella!"

She froze, shocked he'd come.

What was he doing here? Shouldn't he still be in bed with Eleanor?
###Chapter 724

Henry Lancaster pounded on the door. "Isabella, it's me. Open up. We need to talk."

Isabella remained seated on the bed, deliberately ignoring him.

"I know you're inside. Open this door right now! I'll count to three—if you don't, I'm breaking it down!"

The maid hovering nearby gasped. "Mr. Lancaster, you can't just break the door! Let's handle this calmly!"

Henry ignored her, his voice sharp. "One... two..."

Isabella finally stood and yanked the door open.

Before her stood Henry, tall and imposing, his dark coat thrown over a black silk pajama top. His navy slippers were mismatched, as if he'd rushed out in a hurry. His face was lined with exhaustion.

She glared at him. "What do you want? You're not welcome here. Go back to Eleanor."

Henry's jaw tightened. "Listen to me. Nothing happened between us—"

"How many times will you say that? If nothing happened, then what was I supposed to think when I walked in on you two? You were in bed together! Don't lie to me now. If you cheated, just admit it. Don’t make me despise you even more."

She moved to slam the door shut.

But Henry wedged his hand against it, forcing it to stay open.

"Let go!"

Isabella shoved with all her strength, but he didn’t budge. His grip was unyielding, his expression dark.

"What do you think you're doing?"

Henry scoffed. "You're right. I should be honest. If I had done something, I wouldn’t deny it. But I swear, nothing happened."

Isabella opened her mouth to retort—

But Henry cut her off. "Are you really this blind? I chased after you. If I had been with Eleanor, do you think I’d be here this fast?"

Suddenly, her gaze raked over him from head to toe. "Are you losing your touch?"

Henry’s eyes narrowed. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

"You and Eleanor already finished? Hah. Guess age is catching up to you."

Henry exhaled sharply, then shoved the door open fully. In one swift motion, he scooped her up into his arms.

Isabella stiffened, thrashing against him. "Put me down! What are you doing?"

He carried her to the bed in three long strides and tossed her onto the mattress.

She scrambled to escape, but Henry caught her ankle and dragged her back effortlessly.

Kneeling beside her, he pinned her wrists down, his gaze burning into hers. "Still doubting me?"

Isabella’s breath hitched at the dangerous glint in his eyes. "I don’t know..."

"Then I’ll make sure you do."

He leaned down and captured her lips.

Isabella’s eyes widened. She twisted beneath him, shoving at his chest. "Get off me! You’re disgusting! You were just with Eleanor, and now you’re here? I don’t want whatever you picked up from her!"

Henry tightened his grip on her wrists. "I’ll say it one last time—nothing happened with Eleanor. You’re the only one I want."
###Chapter 725
What was Henry talking about?

Isabella shoved him forcefully. "Back off! You might want me, but I don't want you!"

Henry arched a brow. "Are you absolutely certain?"

"Completely," she snapped.

The mere thought of him entangled with Eleanor in bed made her stomach churn.

Henry didn't relent. "Well, you'll have to tolerate me anyway."

He crushed his lips against hers in a searing kiss.

Isabella fought with all her might when suddenly, a maid's voice echoed from the hallway. "Ms. Whitmore, good evening."

Harrison had arrived.

Isabella immediately pushed Henry away. "Harrison's here!"

Grudgingly, Henry released her and sat on the edge of the bed, his jaw tight.

A crisp knock sounded at the door, followed by Harrison's composed voice.

"Mr. Lancaster, Ms. Whitmore."

Isabella scrambled up, smoothing her disheveled clothes and tucking loose strands of hair behind her ears before opening the door. "Harrison."

Harrison stood poised in the doorway. "Good evening. Is Mr. Lancaster unwell?"

Isabella stepped aside. "He's inside."

Harrison entered and approached Henry. "How are you feeling?"

Henry exhaled sharply. "Like my blood is on fire. This isn't normal restlessness."

"Let me check your pulse."

Henry extended his wrist.

Within moments, Harrison's brows furrowed. "You've been drugged."

What?!

Isabella's eyes widened. "What kind of drug?"

"An aphrodisiac."

An aphrodisiac?

Isabella froze.

Harrison continued, "I suspected something was off when I saw him at the Lancaster estate earlier. Now it's clear—he was given a potent stimulant. That explains the scene with Eleanor."

So that's what happened?

Henry locked eyes with Isabella. "See? Nothing happened between Eleanor and me. I was out of control. Harrison can confirm it."

Isabella felt a flicker of relief but scoffed. "Fine, you were drugged. But why was Eleanor in your bed? You claim she's like a sister, but what about her? She climbed into your bed knowing your state."

Henry's lips pressed into a thin line. Eleanor had indeed taken advantage of the situation.

Isabella turned to Harrison. "You need to neutralize the drug in his system."

Harrison shook her head. "I can't."

What?

Isabella stared in disbelief. Harrison, the miracle doctor who could cure anything—was powerless now?

"I can't treat this, but there is someone who can."

"Who?"

"You."

Isabella stiffened, then caught the smoldering look Henry gave her. Understanding dawned.

The only antidote for an aphrodisiac was intimacy. And she was the one who could save him.

"No!" Isabella refused instantly.

Harrison arched a brow, unsurprised. Both Henry and Isabella were stubborn—exactly why Eleanor had manipulated them for years.

"If you won't help him, there are two options. First, find another woman for him. Second, watch as his blood vessels rupture and he dies."

She paused. "The choice is yours. I'll leave you to decide."

With that, Harrison turned to leave.

Isabella called out desperately, "Wait!"
###Chapter 726

Harrison vanished from view in an instant.

Nathaniel turned to Isabella with a raised brow. "Well? What's your brilliant plan now?"

Isabella crossed her arms. "I'll arrange a companion for you."

Nathaniel shot up from his seat. "We're still legally married, and you're pimping me out already?"

She met his glare without flinching. "You must be thrilled. This is exactly what you wanted, isn't it?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

He ground his teeth before spitting out, "Fine. Get me someone."

Isabella tilted her head. "Any preferences?"

A dangerous smirk curled his lips. "Someone like you."

"And what exactly am I like?"

"Do I need to spell it out?" Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice dropping to a growl. "Bold. Insatiable. The kind who climbs into my lap daily begging for more."

Isabella inhaled sharply before replying, "Consider it done. Top-tier. The most exquisite money can buy."

"Appreciate it," he bit out.

She made the call with icy precision. "Send someone to my suite immediately."

Hanging up, she gestured to the sofa. "Five minutes. You can wait here."

Nathaniel's smile turned predatory. "Actually, you should leave."

Isabella blinked. "Excuse me?"

"I plan to take her right here. In your bed. You don't mind, do you?"

The audacity.

Isabella snatched a velvet throw pillow and hurled it at him. "Have you lost your mind? This is my private suite! I'm not hosting your tawdry escapades!"

Nathaniel chuckled darkly. "You ordered the entertainment. Now play the gracious hostess and surrender your bedroom. Unless you want everyone to know how... possessive you really are."

Madman!

She began shoving him toward the door. "Out! Now!"

Nathaniel didn't budge. "Interesting logic. Last I checked, my name's still on the marriage certificate. That makes this my suite too, darling."

Isabella let out a frustrated laugh and yanked at his arm.

In one fluid motion, Nathaniel twisted her wrist, pulling her flush against his chest. She landed sideways across his lap with a gasp.

"Let go!" she demanded, squirming.

Nathaniel cupped her chin, tilting her face up. His mouth crashed down on hers in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

The more she resisted, the more possessive he became. Buttons popped as his fingers slipped beneath her silk blouse.

Isabella's body betrayed her, melting against him. "Nathaniel, stop—"

His lips trailed to her ear. "With you writhing against me like this? Impossible."

A crisp knock interrupted them.

"Ms. Lancaster? Your guest has arrived," a feminine voice announced through the door.

Isabella shoved at his chest, her clothing disheveled. "Wait outside!"

She scrambled off his lap. "Your companion's here. Go."

Nathaniel's eyes burned with intensity. "Last chance. Do you truly want this?"

Isabella studied his handsome face—the sharp jawline, the storm in his eyes. After a weighted pause, she whispered, "Yes."

The temperature in the room plummeted.

Nathaniel shoved away from her, straightening his jacket with sharp movements. Without another word, he strode past her and yanked the door open.

The woman waiting outside barely had time to smile before Nathaniel grabbed her wrist and dragged her down the hallway.

Isabella's knees gave out as the suite door slammed shut behind them.
###Chapter 727

Isabella's heart was torn in two.

Was Henry really leaving? Just like that?

Henry strode toward the grand oak door, his hand reaching for the polished brass handle.

A breathtaking young woman stood waiting outside. Her breath caught when she saw Henry, cheeks flushing pink. "G-Good evening, Mr. Lancaster."

Henry studied her with cold detachment. "Do we know each other?"

"Everyone in Metropolia knows you, sir. Though I doubt you'd remember someone like me."

This woman had been carefully selected by Isabella herself. She understood her role perfectly - to please this powerful man.

Any man connected to the Lancaster empire had to be extraordinary. Wealthy. Influential. Powerful beyond measure.

The woman had arrived prepared, but seeing Henry in person left her speechless. It felt like hitting the lottery. The legendary Henry Lancaster himself?

Henry noticed the naked desire in her gaze. His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Let's begin right here then."

"Here?" The woman glanced nervously at Isabella still standing in the room. "With Ms. Lancaster present?"

Henry's laugh was ice. "She arranged this. I'm sure she won't mind the show."

Isabella's fingers turned to ice. She should have known Henry wouldn't make this easy. Of course he'd take pleasure in humiliating her this way.

Henry's gaze never left the woman. "One chance only. Stay or leave."

"I'll stay." The answer came instantly. She stepped forward, hands trembling as they reached for Henry's belt. "May I?"

Henry offered no resistance.

Isabella watched as the woman's manicured fingers began loosening the silk tie of Henry's robe. The sight made her stomach churn.

She couldn't bear another second. Spinning on her heel, Isabella fled the room.

"Mr. Lancaster, she's gone."

Henry's eyes darkened as he watched Isabella disappear down the hallway.

Outside the mansion, Isabella collapsed into the leather seat of her Bentley. Tonight she'd surrendered her bedroom - her entire home - to Henry and his new companion. The engine purred to life.

But where could she go?

Her chest ached with a familiar bitterness. After all these years, the painful truth remained - she still loved Henry.

Two decades hadn't erased her feelings. The thought of him with another woman was unbearable.

Yet the ghost of Eleanor stood between them always. That woman's memory was a knife in Isabella's heart. As long as Eleanor's shadow lingered, there could never be reconciliation.

Hot tears spilled down Isabella's cheeks before she could stop them.

She was crying.

Crying for Henry. Again.

The car door suddenly wrenched open. A deep voice cut through her sobs. "What's this about?"

Isabella froze. Looking up through tear-blurred vision, she saw Henry looming over her, his expression unreadable.

Her mind went blank. How was he here? What about the woman? The questions tangled in her throat.

"Why aren't you—"

"Disappointed?" Henry's smirk was razor-sharp. "Did you actually think I'd touch her?"

Isabella gaped. "But you wanted—"
###Chapter 728

Henry Lancaster studied the tears shimmering on Isabella's cheeks.

"You're weeping like this when nothing even happened between me and that woman," he murmured. "What would you do if something actually occurred? Drown in your own tears?"

Isabella scoffed, wiping her face roughly. "Don't flatter yourself. These aren't for you. Let go—I'm closing the door!"

She yanked at her wrist, but his grip was iron.

The car door refused to budge.

In one swift motion, Henry hauled her out and shoved her into the backseat.

"What the hell—let me go!"

He climbed in after her, slamming the door shut. Before she could protest, he pulled her onto his lap.

"Stop squirming."

She twisted, trying to escape. "We're in a car, you lunatic!"

Henry smirked, tilting her chin up. "We've done worse in here. Don't pretend you didn't enjoy it."

Her retort died when she bit his lip—hard.

A metallic tang filled his mouth. He touched the blood, then cupped her face gently. "I've been drugged. Are you really going to let me suffer?"

Isabella hesitated.

"You'd let me die?" His voice dropped. "After I nearly sacrificed myself to break your curse?"

Guilt twisted her stomach. "That's not the same—"

Henry released her, slumping back. "Fine. Watch me die, then."

Her resolve shattered.

She hooked her arms around his neck. "You manipulative bastard."

His gaze burned into hers. "So? Will you save me or not?"

Isabella exhaled sharply. "If you'd save me, then yes."

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "Then take the lead."

Her eyes widened.

He wanted her to make the first move?

She glared.

Henry ripped her blouse open. "What's wrong? I thought you liked being in control."

Furious, Isabella silenced him with a searing kiss.

Meanwhile, Harrison lounged on the velvet sofa in the Lancaster estate, sipping tea as the maid gushed.

"Ms. Whitmore, you're a miracle worker! Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster have been at each other's throats for years—yet after one dinner with you, they're suddenly inseparable!"

Harrison smiled into her cup. "I merely reminded them of what they'd forgotten."

The maid beamed.

Just then, the woman Isabella had brought in earlier descended the stairs, her face ashen.

Harrison dismissed her with a wave. "Your services won't be needed tonight. Don't worry—you'll still be paid."

The woman's jaw clenched. Money wasn't what she wanted.

Henry had abandoned her the moment Isabella stormed out.

It had all been an act.

A performance staged solely to provoke Isabella.

Bitter tears welled as she stepped outside—only to freeze at the sight of the luxury car rocking violently on the lawn.

She fled, heart splintering.
###Chapter 729

The morning light filtered through the curtains as Isabella stirred awake. Every inch of her body protested with a dull ache, as though she'd been trampled by a stampede of wild horses.

Memories of last night's passionate encounter flooded her mind, painting her cheeks a deep crimson.

She lifted her gaze to find Henry Lancaster's chiseled features mere inches from her own. His strong arms still cradled her protectively against his chest.

Isabella couldn't resist tracing the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips. Even in sleep, he possessed that magnetic allure that made her pulse quicken.

Life truly wasn't fair, she mused. While women fought against time, men like Henry only grew more distinguished with each passing year.

Her wandering fingers were suddenly captured in a firm grip. Henry's dark lashes fluttered open, revealing those piercing eyes that always saw straight through her.

"Still not satisfied after last night?" His voice was rough with sleep, laced with amusement.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Honestly, Henry. Must you always be so insufferable?"

Henry studied the woman in his arms. The morning light illuminated her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes—she looked positively radiant, like a rose kissed by dawn.

He pressed a featherlight kiss to her lips. "You didn't seem to mind my 'insufferable' qualities last night. In fact, I recall you being quite enthusiastic."

Isabella stiffened before muttering, "It's late. We should get up."

Henry tightened his embrace. "Or we could revisit last night's activities."

She arched an eyebrow. "At your age? Shouldn't you be conserving your energy?"

A wolfish grin spread across his face. "When you've been starving for twenty years, one meal isn't nearly enough."

Isabella shivered. "You mean to tell me you haven't been with anyone else all this time? Not even Eleanor?"

"Even drugged out of my mind, I still found my way to you," Henry countered. "Does that answer your question?"

A warm feeling blossomed in Isabella's chest. She hadn't expected such unwavering loyalty from him, though part of her remained skeptical.

Before she could respond, the sharp buzz of a phone shattered the moment.

"Your phone," Isabella murmured.

With obvious reluctance, Henry released her to grab the device from the nightstand. The screen flashed with the name "Arabella."

He answered. "Arabella?"

"Father!" The panicked voice crackled through the speaker. "You need to come back immediately! It's Ms. Whitmore—something terrible has happened!"

"Eleanor? What's wrong? I'm on my way."

He ended the call and threw back the covers, already reaching for his clothes.

Isabella sat up, having caught enough of the conversation. "Eleanor's in trouble?"

"Yes. I have to leave now."

The warmth from moments ago evaporated. "Go then. Should I arrange a private jet?"

Henry hesitated, turning back to her. "Don't misunderstand—"

"Save it," Isabella cut him off as she dressed. "Just go."

His jaw tightened. Every mention of Eleanor drove an icy wedge between them.

Without another word, they finished dressing and descended the stairs.

Harrison stood in the foyer, watching them with knowing eyes. "Good morning."

Isabella took Harrison's hand. "Morning, darling."

Harrison glanced at Henry. "Mr. Lancaster, you're leaving?"

"Eleanor's in trouble," Henry replied tersely. "I must return immediately."

Harrison had already noticed the subtle shift between Isabella and Henry. At first she'd been uncertain, but now she understood perfectly.
###Chapter 730

The road of love was always meant for two. There was never space for a third. Harrison gave a slow, knowing nod.

Just then, the grand gates of Rosewood Manor swung open. Isabella's assistant strode in—a strikingly handsome young man with an easy confidence.

Harrison arched a brow. "Ms. Lancaster, you have company."

Isabella glanced up, her expression unreadable. "Good morning, Julian."

Julian stepped forward with a charming smile. "Morning, Belle. I brought the outfit you requested for today's meeting."

Belle?

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened instantly, locking onto Julian's face. That nickname—he'd heard it before, whispered over the phone. He hadn't forgotten.

Her company was filled with attractive men—fine, whatever. But now her personal assistant was a ridiculously good-looking guy calling her Belle?

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

Isabella reached for the garment bag. "Thank you."

"Anytime." Julian's smile was warm, effortless.

Nathaniel turned to her, voice low. "Who the hell is this?"

Isabella met his glare evenly. "My assistant, Julian."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Why is your assistant a man?"

The accusation in his tone made her stiffen. "Excuse me? What’s wrong with hiring Julian? He’s a grad student. His father passed last year, and he’s supporting his younger sister. He needs this job."

Nathaniel scoffed. "How noble of you."

Julian stepped forward hesitantly. "Sir, please don’t argue with Belle because of me."

Sir?

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "What did you just call me?"

Julian shrank back behind Isabella. "He’s terrifying..."

Nathaniel inhaled sharply, biting back a curse. He moved to step forward, but Isabella blocked him.

"Enough," she snapped. "Back off."

Julian looked pained. "Belle, don’t fight with him over me. It’s not worth it."

Nathaniel growled, "One more word, and I swear—"

Isabella cut him off. "He works for me. You will treat him with respect."

"Works for you?" Nathaniel’s voice turned icy. "Is that all he does?"

Her eyes flashed. "Unlike you, I don’t keep my past loves under the same roof."

Nathaniel’s face twisted. "You—"

Isabella turned to Julian. "We’re leaving."

Without another word, she strode out, Julian trailing behind.

Nathaniel moved to follow, but Harrison stepped into his path.

"Wait."

Nathaniel glared. "Get out of my way."

Harrison smirked, eyes glinting. "I’m not stopping you. But whether Ms. Lancaster hires a male or female assistant is her choice. You don’t get a say."

"I’m her husband," Nathaniel bit out. "I won’t tolerate some pretty boy hanging around her."

Harrison tilted her head, amused. "And yet you’ve been living with your first love for years. How do you think she feels about that?"
###Chapter 731
Henry Lancaster froze mid-step. His jaw tightened visibly.

"Absolutely nothing occurred—"

Harrison Lancaster sliced through his words like a knife. "Nothing happened between you and Eleanor. That's your rehearsed line, isn't it? You've repeated it so often it's lost all meaning. I could recite it in my sleep."

Henry's silence was deafening.

Harrison arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "Just as nothing transpired between Isabella and her assistant. Yet here you are, consumed by irrational jealousy. Tell me, Henry—doesn't that mirror exactly how Isabella feels about you and Eleanor?"

Henry's fingers curled into fists at his sides.

"I've done my research," Harrison continued smoothly. "Eleanor's parents' tragic demise connects directly to the Lancaster family legacy."

A humorless chuckle escaped Henry's lips. "You investigated her?"

Harrison's crimson lips curved. "I know you've been trying to atone. But there are countless ways to make amends. Perhaps... a less intimate approach?"

The grandfather clock ticked loudly in the heavy silence.

"Understood," Henry finally ground out before turning sharply toward the door.

Harrison's stilettos clicked urgently across marble. "Wait! I'm coming with you!"

The Lamborghini's tires screeched across the Lancaster estate's manicured lawns, coming to rest at a dramatic angle.

Inside the opulent drawing room, Isabella and Eleanor had already begun their carefully choreographed performance upon seeing the car arrive.

Eleanor sprang up dramatically. "I can't remain here another moment! I'm leaving immediately!"

Isabella clutched Eleanor's wrist with theatrical desperation. "You can't! Where would you go? After what our family did to yours—Father always said this is your home!"

Two perfect tears tracked down Eleanor's cheeks. "Don't you see? I'm a laughingstock here now! That woman will never accept me!"

Henry stormed in like a thunderclap. "What's this commotion?"

Isabella rushed to his side. "Father! Eleanor wants to leave!"

Henry's gaze locked onto Eleanor's trembling form. "Explain."

Eleanor lifted a tear-streaked face. "Just... let me disappear..."

Isabella interjected sharply. "Father, Eleanor's remained unmarried all these years—still untouched. Last night you left her alone in your bed! What will people say? And Mother would never—"

Henry's voice cut through the theatrics like ice. "If she wishes to leave, let her."

The room froze.

Eleanor's tears halted mid-track. Isabella's mouth hung open.

Their carefully constructed drama had backfired spectacularly.

Eleanor's voice shook. "You're... telling me to go?"

Henry's expression remained impassive. "You declared your intention to leave. I'm simply not stopping you."

Eleanor's carefully constructed facade cracked. "I didn't mean—"

"The Wintervale villa is yours," Henry continued calmly. "All paperwork is finalized. Move in whenever you choose."

The grandfather clock's pendulum swung relentlessly, marking the end of Eleanor's carefully laid plans.
###Chapter 732

Eleanor's heart plummeted as she stared at Henry. "Are you truly asking me to go?"

Henry's voice remained steady. "You've resided here for years. Initially, I saw no issue, but Isabella has always been uncomfortable with it. After our separation, I refuse to let this remain a point of contention. It's best if you relocate."

Eleanor froze. "So you're casting me aside for Isabella's sake! From the very beginning, she's been your priority, hasn't she?"

Henry didn't flinch. "She's my wife. Naturally, my loyalty lies with her."

The words struck Eleanor like a slap. First, his decision to send her away had felt like betrayal. Now, hearing him declare his devotion to Isabella twisted the knife deeper.

The man before her was no longer the Henry she knew.

Isabella grew restless. Now that she and Eleanor were allies, she couldn't stand by and watch Eleanor be discarded. "You're seriously forcing Ms. Lancaster out? She—"

Before she could finish, Harrison's crisp voice sliced through the tension. "You've misunderstood, Isabella. Mr. Lancaster isn't forcing Eleanor out. She's the one who expressed her desire to leave."

Isabella's head snapped up as Harrison strode into the room with her usual unshakable confidence.

Harrison again!

Wherever she appeared, chaos followed.

Harrison stepped forward, a knowing smile playing on her lips as she addressed Isabella and Eleanor. "Ms. Lancaster, didn't you just say you wished to depart? What changed? Having second thoughts now?"

Eleanor opened her mouth. "I—"

Harrison arched a perfectly sculpted brow, silencing her before she could utter another word. "If you don't want to leave, just admit it. No one will judge you."

Eleanor's breath hitched. She felt as if her chest might cave in. Harrison...!

Now she understood why Henry had transformed into someone unrecognizable—it was all because of Harrison's influence.

At this moment, Eleanor's hatred for Harrison eclipsed even her resentment toward Isabella.

She would make sure Harrison paid for this.

"Why do you insist on meddling in our family affairs?" Isabella snapped.

Harrison smirked. "Does my presence bother you? Unfortunately, your parents adore me, so you're stuck with me."

Isabella's face darkened. "You little—"

Harrison abruptly shifted her tone, addressing Eleanor. "Actually, you can't leave just yet."

Eleanor narrowed her eyes. "What game are you playing now?"

"Mr. Lancaster was drugged with an aphrodisiac. Shouldn't we determine who administered it?"

Isabella and Eleanor both paled.

Harrison's piercing gaze locked onto them. "Last night, only Mr. Lancaster and the two of you were in this house. He wouldn't poison himself. That leaves one of you."

She turned to Isabella. "You're his daughter. Surely, you wouldn't drug your own father? That would make you the most despicable daughter alive."

Then she shifted her attention to Eleanor, her voice dripping with mock sympathy. "And you, with your fragile, innocent facade—could you be the one who slipped him the poison?"
###Chapter 733

Henry Lancaster's piercing gaze locked onto the two women before him. "Last night, someone slipped an aphrodisiac into my drink. I demand to know what happened."

His attention shifted sharply to Isabella. "It's coming back to me now. You prepared that coffee for me yesterday evening. Within minutes of drinking it, my body started reacting abnormally. You're responsible for this, aren't you?"

Isabella's complexion drained of color. Her lips parted but no words came out.

Harrison turned toward Eleanor with calculated precision. "Ms. Lancaster, after being drugged, Mr. Lancaster went to shower. When he emerged, he found you waiting in his bed. This was clearly a coordinated scheme between you two, correct?"

Before either woman could formulate a response, Harrison spun back to face Nathaniel with dramatic flair.

"There's no doubt they planned this together. Isabella drugged your drink while Eleanor positioned herself as the prize. A perfectly staged seduction."

Nathaniel's expression darkened like a gathering storm as he glared at both women. "I want the truth. Now!"

Isabella hesitated, then confessed in a trembling voice, "Y-You're right. I did drug you last night."

"Why would you do such a thing?" Harrison pressed relentlessly. "You drugged Mr. Lancaster so Eleanor could compromise him, didn't you? But why? Isabella is your actual mother. How could you betray her like this?"

Isabella shot Harrison a venomous look. "That's enough! Keep your mouth shut!"

The sharp crack of Nathaniel's palm striking Isabella's cheek echoed through the room. Her head snapped sideways from the force of the blow.

Clutching her stinging face, she stared at Nathaniel in wounded disbelief. "You hit me again? This is the second time!"

Nathaniel's fury erupted like a volcano. "You remember this is the second time I've struck you, yet you've clearly forgotten why! Isabella is your birth mother. What possible justification could you have for this treachery?"

As Isabella opened her mouth to respond, Eleanor suddenly stepped between them.

"If anyone should bear the blame for this, it's me. I—"

Eleanor attempted to shoulder responsibility as a human shield, but Harrison cut her off with surgical precision.

"Why would you drug Mr. Lancaster? I thought you claimed to have no romantic interest in him. After all these years by his side, were you simply biding your time? Waiting for an opportunity to seduce him and replace Isabella as Mrs. Lancaster? Are you secretly in love with him?"

Each question struck Eleanor like a well-aimed arrow, leaving her pale and speechless.

Rage flickered in her eyes, but she dared not voice it. Instead, she settled for shooting Harrison a murderous glare.

Harrison's lips curled into a knowing smirk. She'd seen this act before—the faux innocence, the calculated vulnerability. Eleanor's performance didn't fool her for a second.

Isabella came from old money and genuine high society breeding, which explained why she'd been outmaneuvered by Eleanor's underhanded tactics.

But Harrison? She could play this game better than anyone.

Nathaniel fixed Eleanor with an intense stare. "Do you truly have feelings for me? Years ago, you swore you only saw me as a brother. I've always considered you family. I'm married to Isabella—she's my wife in every sense."

At this pivotal moment, Eleanor decided to lay all her cards on the table. "Yes, I love you! With all my heart!"

Nathaniel recoiled as if struck, staring at Eleanor in stunned disbelief—he'd never imagined she harbored such feelings.

"I love you!" Eleanor declared passionately. "Do you know why I've remained unmarried all these years? Because I've been waiting for you. I've devoted my prime years to you. Isabella may be your wife, but she doesn't cherish you—not the way I do! I love you!" Her voice rang with desperate conviction.
###Chapter 734

Henry Lancaster's brows knitted sharply as he confronted Eleanor. "You must abandon this notion. I've only ever regarded you as a sister."

"You're in love with Isabella, aren't you?"

Henry gave a firm nod. "Yes. I love her."

Eleanor staggered back, her voice thick with resentment. "Don't blame Isabella for this. I begged her to drug you. I was desperate enough to gamble everything—even if it meant burning myself in the process. If you must punish someone, punish me."

Harrison smirked.

Eleanor truly lived up to her reputation as the victor in the past love triangle between her, Henry, and Isabella. By taking the blame, she had shielded Isabella—knowing full well Henry wouldn't lay a hand on her.

Exhaustion lined Henry's expression as he regarded Eleanor. "Forget it. Just leave. Move out of this estate."

Her disappointment was palpable. "Fine. I'll go."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode away.

Isabella called after her, "Wait! Don't go! Dad, how can you be so cruel to Ms. Lancaster?"

Henry's voice turned icy. "You'd do well to watch your tongue. Isabella is your mother. Have you considered how devastated she'd be if she discovered you drugged me?"

Isabella paled. "I—"

"Enough! Not another word. Go to your room and reflect on what you've done!"

Isabella shot Harrison a venomous glare before storming upstairs.

Harrison smiled in satisfaction. Both Isabella and Eleanor had lost this round.

As Eleanor stepped out of the Lancaster estate, a sleek luxury car pulled up, and Isabella emerged.

Eleanor studied her—the silk gown clinging to her curves, the radiant glow of a woman well-loved.

Isabella had come precisely to stir the pot, eager to witness the chaos Eleanor had caused.

With a mocking smile, she called out, "Why are you out here? I expected tears, screams—maybe even threats of self-harm."

Eleanor clenched her jaw. She had done all three, but Harrison had ruined her performance.

That wretched mother-daughter pair.

She fired back bitterly, "Was Henry with you last night?"

Isabella's lips curved victoriously. "All night."

She stepped closer, sneering. "Pathetic. You crawled into his bed, yet couldn't keep him. He still came to me."

Eleanor's nails dug into her palms until they drew blood. The pain was nothing compared to the truth—she hadn't lost to Isabella.

She'd lost to Henry. To his unwavering love for Isabella.

What does she have that I don't?

Isabella stood tall. "Henry and I are lawfully wed. You're chasing a married man—your defeat was inevitable."

Eleanor closed the distance, a frosty smile playing on her lips. "This isn't over. We'll see who truly loses in the end."
###Chapter 735
Henry Lancaster's brows knitted sharply as he faced Eleanor. "You need to abandon this notion. I've only ever considered you a sister."

"You're in love with Isabella, aren't you?"

Henry's nod was firm. "Yes, I love her."

Eleanor staggered back, her voice thick with bitterness. "Don't blame Isabella for what happened. I begged her to drug you. I was desperate—willing to burn myself just for a chance with you. If you must punish someone, punish me."

Harrison smirked.

Eleanor had truly earned her reputation as the victor in the love triangle between her, Henry, and Isabella. By taking the blame, she'd shielded Isabella, knowing Henry wouldn't retaliate against her.

Exhaustion lined Henry's face as he regarded Eleanor. "Forget it. Just leave. Move out of the estate."

Her disappointment was palpable. "Fine. I'll go."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away.

Isabella called after her, voice trembling. "No, wait! Dad, how can you be so cruel to Eleanor?"

Henry's tone turned icy. "You should be more concerned about your own actions. Isabella is your mother. Have you considered how devastated she'd be if she discovered you drugged me?"

Isabella paled. "I—"

"Enough. I don't want to hear another word. Go to your room and reflect on what you've done."

Isabella shot Harrison a venomous glare before trudging upstairs.

Harrison smiled, satisfied. Both Isabella and Eleanor had lost this round.

As Eleanor stepped outside the Lancaster estate, a sleek black car pulled up, and Isabella emerged.

Eleanor studied her rival—the silk gown clinging to her curves, the radiant glow of a woman cherished by her man.

Isabella spotted Eleanor immediately. She'd come precisely to stir the pot, curious about the chaos Eleanor had caused.

With a mocking smile, she called out, "Leaving so soon? I expected tears, screams, maybe even threats of self-harm."

Eleanor clenched her jaw. She'd done all three, but Harrison had ruined her performance.

Bitterly, she fired back, "Was Henry with you last night?"

Isabella's lips curled triumphantly. "All night long."

She stepped closer, sneering. "Pathetic. You crawled into his bed, yet he still came to me."

Eleanor's nails dug into her palms. "You think you've won?"

Isabella laughed lightly. "The war isn't over, but last night? You lost. Thanks for the aphrodisiac, by the way. Henry and I had an unforgettable time. Oh, and he told me he's never wanted anyone else—just me."

Eleanor bit her lip until it bled, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the truth: she hadn't lost to Isabella, but to Henry's unwavering love for her.

What did Isabella have that she didn't?

Isabella stood tall. "Henry and I are married. You're trying to steal a husband. You were doomed from the start."

Eleanor closed the distance between them, a cold smile playing on her lips. "This isn't over. We'll see who wins in the end."

She walked away, leaving Isabella watching her retreating figure before turning back to the mansion.

Inside, Isabella spotted Harrison and forced a smile more painful than tears. "Mom, you're here."

Henry, though furious with Isabella, kept silent about the drugging to spare Harrison's feelings.

Harrison, ever the peacekeeper, greeted Isabella warmly. "Hello, Ms. Lancaster."

Isabella eyed Henry curiously. "I just saw Eleanor outside. Why did she leave?"

Harrison answered smoothly, "Mr. Lancaster asked her to."

Isabella blinked in disbelief. "You kicked Eleanor out? Impossible! You've always let her stay. You'd sooner banish me than her!"

Harrison chuckled. "Mr. Lancaster finally recognized his mistake. He realized her presence upset you, so he made her leave. Isn't that right, Mr. Lancaster?"

She guided Henry toward Isabella. Both were stubborn, their love masked by pride.

Henry met Isabella's gaze. "It's true. I told Eleanor to leave. I neglected your feelings before, but not anymore. I'll keep my distance from her."

Isabella stared, stunned. "You'd better mean that. Don't let one phone call from her change your mind again."

"I won't," Henry snapped. "What about you?"

Confused, Isabella frowned. "What about me?"

Henry's lips thinned. "Your male assistant, your receptionist, all those men around you."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "You're being ridiculous. There's nothing between us!"

"I don't like them. Replace them with women."

"No!"

Henry scowled.

Harrison interjected, amused. "Mr. Lancaster, Ms. Lancaster runs Lancaster Enterprises. She can hire whoever she pleases. If you want her to replace them, give her a reason. Are you... jealous?"

Isabella's eyes widened. Could the proud, unyielding Henry Lancaster actually be jealous?

Henry held her gaze and, after a beat, admitted, "Yes. I'm jealous. Is that reason enough?"

Isabella's lips curved into a sly smile.

Henry pulled her close, cupping her jaw. "What are you smiling about?"

She tilted her face up, eyes sparkling. "You? Jealous? Are we in high school?"

He scoffed. "You're enjoying this. Proud that I'm jealous over you, aren't you?"

Isabella didn't deny it. "Of course I am."

"Don't push it. Replace those men soon, or my jealousy will turn to anger," he warned.

Warmth flooded Isabella's chest. "Fine, I'll replace them."

Henry smirked. "Good."

Harrison fanned herself dramatically. "Should I leave? The love in here is suffocating!"
###Chapter 736

Harrison chuckled lightly before turning to Isabella. "Don't tease us like that!"

Standing apart, Gabrielle felt utterly invisible. The easy affection between Henry, Isabella, and Harrison was palpable. They looked like the ideal family unit, while she remained an outsider, an unwelcome intruder.

"Mother, Father, I'm retiring to my room," Gabrielle declared abruptly, already turning toward the staircase without awaiting permission.

Isabella instinctively moved to call her back, but Henry caught her wrist gently.

"Let her go," he murmured.

He believed some distance might do Gabrielle good - especially if she was planning further outrageous schemes.

With practiced ease, Harrison redirected the conversation. "Mr. Lancaster, that aphrodisiac you consumed isn't ordinary - it originates from Frostholm."

Henry stiffened. "Frostholm? You're certain?"

"Absolutely. Ms. Lancaster is suffering from a Frostholm curse, and now you've been dosed with their signature aphrodisiac. The perpetrator must be someone within your inner circle."

Henry's brow furrowed deeply. The powder had been administered in his own home, intended to force intimacy with Eleanor - logically, the culprit had to be either Eleanor or Gabrielle.

His gaze sharpened as he addressed Harrison. "We must identify this individual immediately."

Harrison arched an elegant eyebrow. "Patience. The guilty party will reveal themselves soon enough. The more they act, the more mistakes they'll make. We simply need to observe and wait for their misstep."

Both Henry and Isabella nodded in agreement.

"Very well. We'll follow your lead."

Harrison smiled warmly. "I should take my leave now. I've been here several days, and Charlotte misses me terribly. It's time I devoted attention to my own daughter."

"Allow me to arrange your transportation," Henry offered.

"No need," Harrison declined gracefully. "I drove myself. Until next time."

With that, Harrison departed, her figure soon disappearing from view.

Henry slid an arm around Isabella's slender waist. "She's gone, darling. Why do you still gaze after her? What occupies your thoughts?"

Isabella grinned playfully. "Are you actually jealous of Harrison?"

He pinched her cheek affectionately. "You truly adore her that much?"

"Completely," Isabella admitted without hesitation. "Sometimes I even wonder...why couldn't she have been our daughter?"

Her feelings for Harrison mirrored a mother's unconditional love.

Henry understood completely. Harrison was brilliant, fiercely loyal, and had sacrificed much for them. Who wouldn't cherish such a person?

Yet Gabrielle was their flesh and blood. Such thoughts seemed unfair to their actual daughter.

Henry chose not to voice this. Instead, he swept Isabella into his arms without warning.

Startled, she gasped. "Henry! What are you—"

He carried her toward the grand staircase without explanation. "What do you imagine?"

The smoldering look in his eyes answered her question more eloquently than words. She playfully thumped his chest. "You're not exactly a young man anymore! Are you certain your constitution can handle this?"

Henry captured her lips in a searing kiss. "The sight of you destroys my self-control. I intend to compensate for all those lost years."

Isabella's cheeks flushed crimson. "But it's broad daylight!"

He smirked roguishly. "If you admire Harrison so much, perhaps we should produce another daughter - one exactly like her."

Isabella gaped at him, momentarily speechless.

How had she never realized her husband possessed such shameless tendencies? At their age, discussing childbearing!

The audacity of the man took her breath away - in more ways than one.
###Chapter 737

Isabella quietly retreated to her bedroom and immediately reached for her phone. Her fingers flew across the screen as she dialed Eleanor's number without a second thought.

She needed to strategize with Eleanor immediately—before Harrison completely took over her family.

The line connected after just two rings.

Eleanor's voice was razor-sharp. "Speak."

"Ms. Lancaster, we have a serious problem. Brittany was here earlier, practically glued to my father's side. If we don't act fast, they might end up giving me a new sibling," Isabella hissed, deliberately twisting the knife. She knew exactly how this would provoke Eleanor.

As predicted, Eleanor's tone turned icy. "Everything was perfect before Harrison reappeared. Now everything's spiraling out of control. Our priority must be eliminating Harrison first. Once she's gone, Henry will return to us."

Isabella's grip tightened around her phone. "You're absolutely right! Harrison is the real threat now."

A cold laugh escaped Eleanor. "Relax. I've already devised a plan to handle her."

A slow smile curved Isabella's lips. "I knew I could count on you."

Meanwhile, at the Falcon family estate...

Nathaniel was reviewing documents in his study when a firm knock interrupted him.

"Mr. Falcon," came Dominic's voice from the other side.

"Enter," Nathaniel commanded.

Dominic stepped inside, his expression grave. "Sir, we've confirmed the truth about Ms. Harrison and Mr. Oliver."

Victoria had previously informed Nathaniel that Harrison and Oliver's marriage was a sham. Nathaniel had ordered a thorough investigation, and now the results were in.

"Report," Nathaniel demanded.

"After extensive verification, we've established that Ms. Harrison has never been legally married to Mr. Oliver. She remains single."

Harrison and Oliver had never wed?

Harrison was actually unmarried!

Nathaniel shot to his feet, stunned. He couldn't comprehend why Harrison would deceive him about this.

Why the lie? Why hadn't she married Oliver in all these years?

"They have Charlotte together, and she's already three! Why wouldn't Harrison give her child a complete family?" Nathaniel's voice thickened with suspicion. Then a startling thought struck him. "Unless... Charlotte isn't Oliver's daughter?"

He immediately dismissed the idea.

"Impossible. Charlotte is clearly Oliver's child."

Nathaniel refused to hope. Hope only led to greater disappointment.

Dominic suggested quietly, "A simple DNA test would confirm whether Miss Charlotte is biologically yours."

Of course. Scientific proof would end all speculation.

Without hesitation, Nathaniel strode from the study and descended to the main floor.

In the grand living room, Victoria sat with Charlotte, who was diligently coloring a picture of three figures.

"Who are you drawing, sweetheart?" Victoria asked gently.

Charlotte beamed up at her. "It's me, Mommy, and Mr. Gorgeous!"

Victoria chuckled. "Why didn't you include your daddy?"

Charlotte's eyes sparkled with innocence. "I want Mr. Gorgeous to be my daddy! Then we can be a happy family forever."

Nathaniel's chest tightened as he watched the rosy-cheeked child. Charlotte adored him, and he'd grown impossibly fond of her—so much so that he yearned to be her father.

Even if she wasn't his by blood, he would gladly claim her as his own.
###Chapter 738

Nathaniel's arms ached to embrace Harrison and Charlotte, to hold them both securely against his pounding heart.

The possibility that Charlotte might be his biological daughter sent electric currents of anticipation through his veins, quickening his pulse.

He took a decisive step forward. "Charlotte..."

The little girl spun toward his voice and launched herself into his waiting embrace. "Pretty Daddy!"

Nathaniel pressed a featherlight kiss to her forehead. "Give me your biggest hug, princess."

As he enveloped Charlotte in his muscular arms, his fingers deftly plucked a single golden strand from her curls.

Giggles bubbled from Charlotte's lips.

The bathroom door clicked open as Harrison reappeared. "Charlotte..."

"Mommy!" The child's face illuminated like sunrise.

Harrison's voice softened. "What have you been doing while I was gone?"

Victoria swiftly produced Charlotte's artwork. "She drew this family portrait. She wants Nathaniel to be her father permanently and for all three of you to live together forever."

Harrison's breath caught as she studied the crayon drawing. Her gaze lifted slowly to meet Nathaniel's.

A tender smile played on Nathaniel's lips. "I'd be honored to be Charlotte's father, but that decision belongs to her mother. What do you say, Harrison? Shall I become Charlotte's daddy?"

The little girl bounced on her toes. "Please Mommy? I want Pretty Daddy to stay with us always!"

Harrison's throat worked visibly. "Sweetheart, these matters are... complicated. Let's discuss this later, alright?"

Charlotte's lower lip trembled—

Victoria smoothly intervened. "Dinner's getting cold. Harrison, why don't you freshen up first?"

Nodding stiffly, Harrison retreated to the sink.

Victoria extracted Charlotte from Nathaniel's arms with a knowing smirk. "You've got mountains to move if you want your family back. Best of luck."

Nathaniel remained silent, staring at the golden strand coiled in his palm. If Charlotte shared his DNA, then Harrison was irrevocably his.

Dominic materialized at his elbow. "Mr. Falcon."

"Have this tested immediately." Nathaniel passed the hair with military precision. "I want chain-of-custody protocols and results before midnight."

"Understood." Dominic vanished as quietly as he'd appeared.

At the marble sink, Harrison scrubbed her hands mechanically. As water cascaded over her fingers, an unmistakable heat pressed against her back.

Nathaniel.

She gasped as his arms caged her against the counter. "Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"

Harrison twisted—left, right—but Nathaniel mirrored each movement, his powerful frame eliminating every escape route.

Her crystalline eyes locked onto his chiseled features. "You're in my way."

Nathaniel braced his hands on the sink, effectively trapping her. His grin turned wolfish. "Observant as ever. What will you do about it?"

When Harrison shoved against his chest, he didn't yield an inch. Instead, he dipped his head until his breath warmed her lips.

"Kiss me," he murmured, "and I'll let you pass."

Harrison scoffed. "Absolutely not."

Nathaniel captured her chin between thumb and forefinger. "Your refusal only makes me want to claim you more."

His mouth crashed down on hers in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

"Mmmph!"
###Chapter 739

Harrison's hands trembled as she pressed them against Nathaniel's broad chest, attempting to push him away.

But he caged her effortlessly against the marble sink, his muscular arms trapping her slender frame. His lips crashed against hers with possessive hunger, refusing to relent.

Frustration flared. She bit down sharply on his lower lip.

A hiss escaped Nathaniel as pain flickered across his chiseled features. He pulled back slightly, swiping the back of his hand across his mouth—streaked with a faint trace of blood.

Instead of anger, amusement curled his lips. "Still as feisty as ever, I see."

Harrison frowned. "What's wrong with you tonight? You're acting strange."

She could sense it—the restless energy thrumming through him, the uncharacteristic possessiveness.

Of course, Nathaniel wouldn't confess he'd secretly run a DNA test. The mere possibility that Charlotte might be his daughter had his pulse racing, his blood singing.

He needed her close. Now.

"Can't I kiss my woman?" His voice dropped to a rough murmur. "There's a lot more I'd like to do."

Harrison slapped a hand over his mouth. "Stop. I'm married to Oliver."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with disbelief. Still lying. Still hiding the truth from him.

With a growl, he captured her lips again, swallowing her protest.

Harrison shoved at his shoulders. "Let me—"

The bathroom door swung open.

Charlotte's small figure appeared, her bright eyes widening. "Mommy...?"

Then she saw them—Nathaniel's mouth fused to Harrison's. A tiny gasp escaped her before she clapped both hands over her eyes. "Eek! Kissing!"

Harrison jerked away, cheeks burning. "Charlotte, sweetheart, it's not—"

Victoria swooped in, scooping the giggling girl into her arms. "Let's give Mommy and Mr. Handsome some privacy, hmm?" She winked at Nathaniel. "Don't mind us."

With that, she whisked Charlotte away, shutting the door pointedly behind them.

Harrison stood frozen, mortification creeping up her neck.

Behind her, Nathaniel chuckled.

She whirled, glaring. "This is your fault! How am I supposed to explain this?"

He reached for her, pulling her flush against him. "You're mine. There's nothing to explain."

Harrison twisted free, storming out before he could stop her.

Nathaniel's smile faded as he followed.

Dominic appeared just then. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel halted. Harrison was already disappearing down the hall, her hurried footsteps echoing.

He turned to Dominic expectantly. "The results?"

Dominic nodded, extending a sealed envelope.

Nathaniel took it, his fingers uncharacteristically unsteady. "Is Charlotte...?"

Dominic opened his mouth to respond.

"Don't." Nathaniel cut him off, jaw tight. "I'll see for myself."

For a man who faced boardroom wars and billion-dollar deals with icy calm, his hands shook as he gripped that single sheet of paper.

Was Charlotte truly his blood? His daughter?

The answer lay in his hands.
###Chapter 740

"The DNA results are in this envelope. Open it and see for yourself," Dominic announced.

Nathaniel drew a sharp breath. "Very well."

With trembling fingers, he tore open the sealed envelope and extracted the report.

His eyes dilated instantly at the printed confirmation - Charlotte was biologically his daughter.

Dominic smiled. "The results confirm you're Miss Charlotte's father. Congratulations, sir."

Charlotte was truly his.

Nathaniel could scarcely process this revelation. He'd never allowed himself to hope she might be his. All these years, he'd believed Oliver was her father.

His gaze drifted to the dining room where little Charlotte sat beside Harrison, her tiny frame radiating warmth.

Now he understood. They both belonged to him. This was his family. Everything he'd ever wanted was right here.

Yet one burning question remained - what exactly was Harrison's relationship with Oliver?

A crucial detail he'd overlooked now demanded answers. He needed to confront Oliver immediately.

Nathaniel turned abruptly toward the exit.

"Mr. Handsome!" Charlotte's sweet voice called after him.

But Nathaniel was already striding out the door, deaf to her call.

Victoria frowned. "Where's Nathaniel rushing off to? He hasn't even touched his meal."

Harrison's eyes followed his retreating form. Something was definitely off about him today.

"Let's eat without him," Victoria suggested. "He probably has urgent business at Falcon Enterprises." Harrison nodded. "Of course."

Meanwhile, Oliver was relaxing in his penthouse when the doorbell chimed.

He swung the door open. "Who's there?"

Nathaniel stood imposingly in the doorway, his expression stormy.

Oliver raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Falcon? To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"

Nathaniel's voice was ice. "Charlotte is my daughter. Why did you let everyone believe she was yours?"

Oliver's face registered genuine surprise. "So you finally know the truth?"

"Yes. Harrison told me everything."

"Harrison actually admitted Charlotte is yours?"

Secretly, Oliver felt pleased. This confirmed what he'd suspected - Harrison had never stopped loving Nathaniel, which was precisely why he'd brought Charlotte to Metropolia.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "She did. She told me about Charlotte... and about your relationship."

Oliver studied him closely. "She told you that?"

Suddenly Nathaniel grabbed Oliver's collar, slamming him against the wall. "Why pretend to be Harrison's boyfriend? Why claim Charlotte as your own? You kept them from me for three damn years! Do you have any idea what you've done?"

Oliver smirked. "Perhaps you should look in the mirror first. You're the one who broke Harrison's heart. As her senior colleague, I merely taught you a lesson."

Nathaniel froze.

So Oliver wasn't Harrison's lover - just her senior from work.

All this time, he'd believed they were romantically involved. This changed everything.

"You're Harrison's senior colleague?"

"Obviously. Didn't you say she told you about us?" Oliver's eyes narrowed with realization. "Ah, I see now. She never said anything. You tricked me into confessing!"


###Chapter 741

Nathaniel had already pieced together Oliver's deception.

The moment he saw the DNA results, he'd known there was no romantic connection between Harrison and Oliver.

Now, discovering Oliver was merely Harrison's senior colleague, Nathaniel felt an electric shock of realization.

"So you're just her mentor!"

Nathaniel's laughter rang out, bright and slightly unhinged with relief.

Oliver's temper flared. His fist connected with Nathaniel's jaw before either man could blink.

Nathaniel didn't resist. The impact sent him crashing against the wall. He wiped his bleeding lip with his thumb, grinning through the pain. Oliver seized his collar. "You dare laugh after everything you've done?"

The punch couldn't dampen Nathaniel's euphoria. "I thought you were Harrison's husband! She's mine. Always has been, from the very start!"

Just the realization sent waves of joy crashing through him. He and Harrison shared a child. She belonged to no one but him.

That overwhelming sensation of something precious returned filled his chest like a rising tide. He'd never known such happiness.

Today, he'd reclaimed everything.

Oliver studied him with cold intensity.

"Exactly. I'm just Harrison's mentor, and Charlotte is your biological daughter. You should be on your knees thanking Harrison for giving you this! Do you have any idea how many exceptional men have pursued her these past three years? Yet she never glanced their way. I know she never stopped loving you."

Nathaniel's heart swelled.

So Harrison had carried his memory all these years, just as he'd carried hers.

Their love had endured.

"But you're unworthy of her!" Oliver continued mercilessly. "Have you forgotten how deeply you wounded her? Now you're engaged to the Lancaster heiress, chasing power through marriage. You're supposed to wed Isabella. You can't even clean up your own mess, yet you think you deserve Harrison?"

Oliver had always despised Nathaniel. Now his contempt spilled freely.

Nathaniel burned to explain the Lancaster engagement wasn't his choice, that he could dismantle it.

"I'm calling off the Lancaster marriage. That engagement ends today."

Oliver released him. However much he disliked Nathaniel, he recognized Harrison's love for this man. Her happiness mattered most.

"Save your explanations for someone who cares. Now that you know Charlotte is yours, your only responsibility is to Harrison and your daughter. Get out."

Nathaniel stepped back, moving toward the door.

At the threshold, he turned. "Thank you."

Then he was gone.

Outside, he slid into the waiting Bentley. Dominic glanced up from the driver's seat. "Where to, sir?"

"The Lancaster estate."

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. "May I ask why?"

"To terminate my engagement."

Meanwhile, Henry Lancaster lay entwined with Isabella amidst rumpled silk sheets.

Isabella traced idle patterns on Henry's chest before suddenly stiffening. "Isn't this the bed you shared with Eleanor? I refuse to stay here. It's revolting."

She tried to rise, but Henry's arm became an iron band across her waist.

"Relax, darling. Knowing your fastidious nature, I had that bed incinerated. This is fresh from Milan, selected to your exacting standards."
###Chapter 742

"To your liking? Have you been scheming to get me into your bed all this time?" Isabella teased Henry with a playful smirk. His dark eyes traced the rosy flush spreading across her cheeks before responding with a wolfish grin. "You're my wife. This is simply part of our marital agreement." The statement left her momentarily speechless.

Henry had banished Eleanor from their lives—a gesture that struck Isabella deeply. She recognized him as a man who prized loyalty above all. By cutting ties with his first love, he was extending an olive branch, retreating step by step to rebuild their fractured relationship.

Perhaps it was time she met him halfway.

Marriages required effort from both sides. They weren't getting any younger, and she refused to waste more precious time.

Henry leaned in, brushing his lips against her cheek.

Isabella shoved him back. "What do you think you're doing?"

"Isn't it obvious?" His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Round two."

She exhaled sharply. "Be reasonable. You need to pace yourself."

In one swift motion, Henry flipped her beneath him. "Now."

Their playful tussle was interrupted by three sharp raps at the door, followed by their maid's hesitant voice. "Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster...?"

Isabella immediately shoved Henry off. "She's calling for us!"

Annoyance flashed across Henry's face as he barked, "What?"

"You have a visitor, sir."

"Tell them I'm unavailable. Schedule an appointment." Dismissing the interruption, he recaptured Isabella's lips.

She retaliated by biting his lower lip—hard.

Henry jerked back, eyes darkening dangerously. "Playing rough, are we? You'll pay for that."

"Stop—ah!"

The maid's voice grew more urgent. "Mr. Lancaster, it's Mr. Hawk! He insists on seeing you immediately!"

Nathaniel was here?

Isabella pushed against Henry's chest. "Nathaniel's at the door!"

Right on cue, Nathaniel's voice boomed through the wood. "Where is he? I need to speak with Lancaster now! Is he in there? I'm coming in!"

Scuffling sounds indicated the maid physically blocking him. "Sir, you can't just—"

Panic shot through Isabella. If Nathaniel walked in on them like this, she'd never live it down. "Get up!" she hissed.

Grumbling, Henry rolled off the bed but suddenly winced, clutching his lower back.

"What's wrong?" Isabella asked, alarmed.

"Pulled something," he ground out through clenched teeth.

A giggle escaped her before she could stop it.

Henry's glare could've melted steel. "Something funny?"

"I warned you not to overexert yourself. You're not twenty anymore."

"Is that a challenge? I'll show you—"

Nathaniel's fist pounded against the door. "Lancaster! I know you're in there! This can't wait!"

With great reluctance, Henry dressed and yanked the door open to reveal a sharply dressed Nathaniel, who blinked in surprise at finding them together.

"Am I... interrupting something?"

Isabella shook her head too quickly. "No! We were just—"

"—discussing household matters," Henry cut in, shooting Nathaniel a withering look. "Young people these days have no sense of boundaries."

Isabella's cheeks burned as she looked away.

Nathaniel stood frozen, clearly unsure how to respond to the awkward situation.


###Chapter 743

Nathaniel hesitated for a brief moment, a pang of guilt twisting in his chest. He hadn’t come here to witness a public reunion between Henry and his wife.

While Henry had found his way back to Isabella, Nathaniel had spent three agonizing years apart from Harrison, unable to even share a bed with her.

"I came to discuss something important," Nathaniel said, his voice firm and unyielding.

Isabella tilted her head. "What is it?"

Before he could respond, Arabella burst into the room. She had been waiting inside, but the sound of Nathaniel’s voice had drawn her out like a moth to flame.

"Nathaniel! Perfect timing!" Arabella beamed, looping her arm possessively through his. "Now that Mom’s back, we should finally set a date for our wedding. When are you going to make me your wife?"

Isabella studied Nathaniel thoughtfully. "You and Arabella have been engaged since childhood. It’s time to settle down. Tomorrow, your mother and I will choose an auspicious date for the ceremony."

Henry remained silent, his piercing gaze fixed on Nathaniel.

Nathaniel’s icy stare locked onto Arabella. "Let go."

The command caught her off guard.

He yanked his arm free, his voice sharp as a blade. "Don’t touch me again."

Arabella’s smile faltered.

Isabella frowned, oblivious to the tension between them. "Why are you treating Arabella this way?"

"I’m here to formally dissolve the engagement," Nathaniel declared, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Dissolve the engagement?

Isabella’s eyes widened. "You’re breaking things off with Arabella?"

Arabella’s face drained of color. She had known this moment would come—but not so soon.

Nathaniel was ending it. Officially.

Panic clawed at her throat. "Our families arranged this marriage when we were children! The entire city knows about our union! You can’t just—"

"Are you deaf?" Nathaniel cut her off coldly. "I said I’m not marrying you. The engagement is over."

Henry’s expression darkened. Arabella was his daughter, after all.

"Think carefully, Nathaniel," he warned, his voice low and dangerous. "This isn’t a decision to make lightly. Are you truly calling off the engagement with my daughter?"

Nathaniel didn’t flinch. "Yes. Without hesitation."

"No!" Arabella’s voice cracked as she shook her head desperately. "I refuse! Mom, Dad, please! I have to marry him!"

She clutched Isabella’s arm, tears streaming down her face.

"Everyone in Metropolia knows I’m meant to be his wife! If he humiliates me like this, how will I ever show my face again? I’d rather die!"

Without warning, Arabella whirled and slammed her forehead against the wall.

Isabella gasped, lunging forward to grab her. "Have you lost your mind? Stop this!"

"Help me!" Arabella sobbed, her body trembling.

Isabella was at a loss. "I—"

Henry’s gaze turned glacial as he addressed Nathaniel. "Arabella is our only daughter. Look what you’ve reduced her to. Are you certain about this?"

Nathaniel met his stare unflinchingly.

"Marriage requires mutual consent. I don’t love Ms. Lancaster. Therefore, I won’t marry her."

Arabella collapsed into hysterics. "Dad, do something! He’s ruining everything!"

Henry’s voice turned deadly quiet. "If you walk away from this engagement today, there will be no turning back. And I swear, you will never have another chance with my daughter."

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate.

"Don’t worry, Mr. Lancaster. There will never come a day when I want her."
###Chapter 744

Nathaniel finished speaking and turned sharply on his heel, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor as he strode away.

"Mr. Falcon!" Isabella Lancaster called after him, her voice trembling.

But Henry Lancaster cut in sharply, "Nathaniel!"

Nathaniel paused mid-step, his broad shoulders tensing before he glanced back over his shoulder. "Is there something else?"

Henry's voice was firm, unyielding. "Since you've made it clear you don't wish to marry my daughter, I won't force the matter. However, our families signed a formal contract when this engagement was arranged. Bring it here, tear it up—then it will be officially dissolved."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Fine."

Without another word, he resumed his exit, his figure disappearing through the grand double doors.

"Nathaniel!" Isabella gasped, her face paling. She clutched at her mother's sleeve. "Mom, Dad, what am I supposed to do? He doesn't want me anymore!"

Isabella Lancaster turned to Henry, confusion knitting her brows. "What's happening? Doesn't Mr. Falcon love Isabella?"

Henry shook his head slowly. "No. He never did."

"Then who does he love?" Isabella pressed. "The way he spoke—it sounded like his heart belongs to someone else."

"I'll tell you who!" Isabella burst out, her voice sharp with bitterness. "He's in love with Harrison!"

What?

Nathaniel was in love with Harrison?

Isabella Lancaster froze.

Henry nodded grimly. "Yes. Nathaniel is in love with Harrison. They fell for each other back in Willowbrook."

The name caught Isabella Lancaster off guard, but the moment it settled in her mind, it made sense. Harrison was brilliant, poised—impossible not to admire. Though the revelation was unexpected, it wasn’t entirely surprising.

"Mom, you have to help me! I need to marry Nathaniel. I have to!" Isabella begged, her voice breaking.

Isabella Lancaster softened, reaching out to stroke her daughter’s hair. "But he loves Harrison, darling. And I know Harrison—she’s a remarkable woman. If they care for each other, we should respect that and let this engagement go."

Isabella recoiled as if struck. "What are you saying? Nathaniel wants to break our engagement, and instead of standing by me, you're siding with her? Some outsider?"

"Harrison—"

"Harrison, Harrison! It's always about her with you! Have you forgotten who your real daughter is? She’s nothing but a scheming seductress! She must have tricked Nathaniel into her bed!"

"Isabella!" Isabella Lancaster's face turned icy, her voice slicing through the air like a blade.

Isabella flinched. Since her mother had returned, she had never looked at her with such chilling disapproval.

Isabella Lancaster’s gaze was unrelenting. "How dare you speak about Harrison like that? Where is your dignity? You can’t just fling baseless accusations that ruin someone’s reputation."

Henry stepped beside his wife, his expression stern. "She’s right, Isabella. You went too far. Harrison isn’t that kind of person."

Isabella stared at them, standing united against her, and something inside her shattered. Blood was supposed to be thicker than water—yet here they were, choosing Harrison over her.

She was the outsider.

"What am I supposed to do, then?" Isabella cried, her voice raw. "Nathaniel wants to call off the engagement! Am I just supposed to accept this humiliation?"

"You can’t force love," Henry said gently. "It’s clear now—Nathaniel doesn’t have feelings for you. We should end this. There are countless accomplished men in Metropolia. I’ll find someone better, someone who truly cherishes you."

"Listen to your father," Isabella Lancaster added softly. "Let go of Nathaniel. Holding onto someone who doesn’t love you will only bring you pain."

Both of them were urging her to give up. They had already accepted the broken engagement.

Isabella couldn’t.

"No! I won’t! There’s no second Nathaniel in all of Metropolia! I will marry him—no one else is worthy of me!"

With that, she whirled around and stormed out, her heels striking the floor like gunshots.

"Isabella!"
###Chapter 745

Isabella cast a sideways glance at Henry. "Why is Gabrielle so obstinate? It's painfully obvious Nathaniel doesn't return her feelings. You can't force love like some cheap soap opera."

Henry understood Gabrielle all too well. In all of Metropolia, no man could rival Nathaniel's power and influence. Gabrielle had set her sights on marrying the most formidable man in the city, and surrender wasn't in her vocabulary.

Initially, as Gabrielle's father, Henry had hoped Nathaniel would choose her. But three years had slipped by, and Nathaniel's heart remained steadfastly devoted to Harrison.

Henry exhaled heavily. "I'll speak with her when the time is right."

Isabella gave a curt nod. "Very well. Let's retire to our chambers. That back of yours needs tending."

After supper, Harrison and Charlotte retreated to their suite. Harrison ran a warm bath for the giggling child.

Charlotte splashed playfully. "Mommy, Mr. Dashing left this morning and never returned. Is he truly that occupied?"

Harrison wasn't certain of Nathaniel's whereabouts. "Falcon Enterprises demands much of his attention. The weight of such an empire is considerable."

Charlotte's lower lip protruded. "Then he must be exhausted."

Harrison tapped the child's nose affectionately. "Do you only fret over Mr. Dashing? What about me? I'm beginning to feel slighted."

"You're my absolute favorite..." Charlotte planted a sloppy kiss on Harrison's cheek.

Wrapping the freshly bathed girl in a plush towel, Harrison settled her onto the bed. "Read your storybook while I bathe."

Charlotte nodded obediently.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut, the bedroom door creaked open. Nathaniel's imposing silhouette filled the doorway. Charlotte's face lit up. "Mr. Dashing! You're home!"

The room basked in golden lamplight. Charlotte, scrubbed pink and swathed in lemon-yellow pajamas, resembled a tiny sunbeam. That radiant smile dissolved Nathaniel's weariness instantly.

His daughter.

No wonder he'd been enchanted at first sight.

This precious child was Harrison's gift to him.

Nathaniel swept Charlotte into his arms. "And what are we reading tonight?"

"Mommy just bathed me. I'm reading about princesses."

The shower's steady patter continued behind the bathroom door. Nathaniel's lips curved. "Fancy an adventure?"

"But shouldn't we tell Mommy? She'll panic if I disappear."

"Our little secret. If she grows concerned, she'll call me immediately."

"Okay!"

Nathaniel spirited Charlotte away.

Harrison emerged from the steamy bathroom to an empty bed. "Charlotte? Sweetheart?"

Her well-mannered daughter never wandered off. Where could she—

Dropping the damp towel, Harrison dashed into the hallway. "Charlotte! Answer me! You're frightening me! Charlotte!"

A maid materialized. "Ms. Whitmore, Mr. Hawk took Miss Charlotte out moments ago."

What?

Nathaniel had returned?

And taken Charlotte without a word?

Unease prickled Harrison's spine. Nathaniel's behavior today had been erratic—vanishing abruptly, then reappearing to abscond with their daughter.

With trembling fingers, Harrison dialed Nathaniel's number.

The line connected instantly. That familiar baritone vibrated through the receiver.

"Darling."
###Chapter 746

"Nathaniel, what's the meaning of this? Why did you take Charlotte away?" Harrison's voice trembled with barely contained fury.

"Meet me at Falcon Enterprises. My office." His tone left no room for negotiation.

"I—" Harrison hesitated.

The hour was late, and their last encounter in his office had nearly spiraled out of control.

Going there again at night? Absolutely not.

Nathaniel cut off her protest. "Charlotte is here. If you don't come tonight, you won't see her again."

Her blood ran cold. "What are you implying? She's my daughter! What game are you playing?"

"Is she only yours?" His voice was deceptively calm, razor-sharp beneath the surface.

Harrison froze, fingers tightening around her phone. A dreadful realization crept in. "Explain yourself."

"Tell me first. Does guilt weigh on you?"

"Guilt? What nonsense is this?"

"Is Charlotte only your daughter? Who is her father?"

Her breath hitched—

"I'll be waiting."

The line went dead before she could respond.

Harrison stood motionless, pulse roaring in her ears. She had no choice. Nathaniel knew.

Within minutes, she was dressed and speeding toward Falcon Enterprises.

The CEO's office door swung open under her frantic push. "Where is she?"

Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, watching her. "You came."

"Charlotte. Now."

He reached for a remote. The lounge curtains parted with a whisper, revealing floor-to-ceiling windows.

There, curled beneath silk sheets, Charlotte slept soundly on the massive bed.

Harrison's panic eased—only for a sharp pang of jealousy to strike. Her daughter looked so peaceful here, so comfortable with Nathaniel.

Too comfortable.

He stood, closing the distance between them. "She's fine. Asleep."

"I'm taking her home."

"No." The refusal was absolute.

Harrison's eyes flashed. "She's my child. I have every right—"

"Let me ask again." His voice dropped. "Is she only yours?"

A folder slid across the desk.

Her hands shook as she opened it. The DNA report glared back, undeniable.

"It's true," she admitted hoarsely. "She's yours."

Nathaniel stepped closer, heat radiating between them. "Then why the lies? I deserved to know!"

"Isabella was always by your side. I didn't want Charlotte to become your burden."

Silence.

"I'm leaving with her."

His hand caught her wrist. "She's mine too. I'm keeping her."

Harrison recoiled as if burned. "What? You'd fight me for custody?"

The air crackled with unspoken threats.

Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Try me."


###Chapter 747

Nathaniel's jaw set in determination. "Yes, I want Charlotte. Full custody."

A fire ignited in Harrison's chest. Before she could stop herself, her hand flew up to strike his perfect face. But Nathaniel caught her wrist effortlessly, pulling her flush against his hard chest. "Trying to hit me, sweetheart?"

Harrison's voice was sharp. "You think you have any right to take Charlotte from me? I carried her, I raised her—what have you ever done?"

With effortless strength, Nathaniel lifted her and strode forward, depositing her onto his polished mahogany desk. He caged her in, palms flat on the surface, his towering frame blocking any escape.

"Who says I didn't contribute?" His smirk was infuriating. "Without me, Charlotte wouldn't exist. You stole my genes to make her."

Harrison's lips parted, then pressed into a thin line. He wasn't wrong—Charlotte did have his striking features, his sharp intellect. Gabrielle and Rosalind had joked that his genes were too good to waste.

But she'd be damned before admitting that now. "I don't want to discuss this!"

"Then what do you want to discuss?" His voice dropped, low and dangerous. "The fact remains—Charlotte is my daughter. If this goes to court, do you honestly think you can win? The judge will side with me."

Her stomach twisted. The power imbalance was undeniable. Judges favored stability, resources—things Nathaniel had in spades.

Her gaze locked onto his piercing eyes. Desperation clawed at her throat. "Please," she whispered, voice breaking. "Don't take her from me. She's everything to me. For what we once had—just let me keep her."

Nathaniel studied her, a predatory gleam in his eyes. His lips curved. "Is this you begging, Harrison?"

She swallowed her pride. "Yes. Nathaniel—Mr. Hawk—I'm begging you."

A dark chuckle rumbled from his chest. "This is a pathetic attempt. Where's the sincerity?"

She bit her tongue, mentally cursing him—sparing only Charlotte and Victoria. Externally, she forced her eyes to glisten. "You're the most brilliant, powerful man I've ever known. No wonder women fall at your feet."

His brow arched. "If I'm so irresistible, does that include you?"

"I—"

Harrison froze. Every answer was a trap.

Her mask slipped. "What do you really want?" Her voice turned icy. "If you're set on court, fine. I'll fight you with everything I have. I might not lose."

Nathaniel cupped her chin, his thumb brushing her jaw. "Marry me."

The words detonated in her skull.

"Marry me," he repeated, voice rough. "Give Charlotte the family she deserves. I've missed years of her life. She needs a father."

Harrison stared. "You're engaged to Isabella."

"I ended it today. Told the Lancasters I'd never marry their daughter."

She scoffed. "Isabella is the Lancaster heiress. What happens when you change your mind? How will you explain that to Charlotte?"
###Chapter 748

"That day will never come. I would never marry Miss Lancaster," Nathaniel declared firmly, his voice leaving no room for doubt.

Harrison crossed her arms, her eyes flashing with defiance. "And I would never marry you."

Nathaniel's lips curved into a teasing smirk. "Why not?"

Harrison opened her mouth to retort, but Nathaniel didn’t give her the chance. His fingers brushed against her chin, tilting her face up as he leaned in. "I know our past is complicated, but my heart has always belonged to you. I never strayed. Just give me one more chance—let’s rewrite our story."

Harrison’s breath hitched, but before she could protest, Nathaniel captured her lips in a searing kiss.

The moment their mouths met, every argument dissolved into heat.

"Mmph—!" Harrison shoved against his chest, but Nathaniel didn’t budge. His arms tightened around her, pulling her flush against him.

"Let go of me!" she demanded, though her voice lacked its usual bite.

Nathaniel chuckled darkly. "Not a chance. You can lie to yourself, but not to me. I know Oliver is just your senior."

Harrison stiffened. How did he know?

"All these years, neither of us moved on. You still love me, and I never stopped loving you."

Her resolve wavered, but she forced out the words anyway. "I don’t love you!"

Nathaniel nipped at her lower lip, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "Your body says otherwise."

His kiss deepened, demanding and possessive, as if he wanted to brand her with his touch. Harrison hated how easily he unraveled her. She wanted to resist, but her traitorous body arched into him, craving more.

Memories of their past—nights tangled in sheets, their bodies moving in perfect sync—flooded her mind. The way he could make her forget everything but his name.

She shoved at his shoulders. "Stop—"

Nathaniel ignored her weak protest, his lips trailing down the delicate curve of her neck. His fingers slipped beneath her blazer, pushing it open to reveal the thin strap of her dress.

"Your body is already surrendering," he murmured against her skin. "Stop pretending you don’t want this."

Heat rushed to Harrison’s cheeks. A reckless thought took hold—if she couldn’t escape tonight, she might as well enjoy it.

Nathaniel was, after all, an unforgettable lover.

Without hesitation, she tangled her fingers in his hair and kissed him back, taking control.

Nathaniel stilled for a heartbeat before a low laugh rumbled in his chest. His eyes darkened as she nipped at his lips, teasing him with the same fire he’d always adored.

"You little minx," he growled, pulling her closer. "You’re going to be the death of me."

Harrison broke the kiss, her lips trailing down to his throat. She smirked as she felt his pulse jump beneath her mouth. "You don’t seem to mind."

Nathaniel’s grip tightened, as if he wanted to fuse her to him.

With a boldness that surprised even herself, Harrison pushed him into his sleek leather chair and straddled him, settling herself firmly in his lap.

Nathaniel’s hands gripped her waist, his voice rough with desire. "You like being in charge?"

Harrison tugged at his collar, pulling him closer. "Tonight, you’re mine."

His lips curved into a wicked grin. "So I’m just a tool to you?"

She matched his smirk. "You’re whatever you want to be."

Nathaniel’s gaze burned into her. "Tell me, Harrison—did you miss me these past three years? On those lonely nights, did you think of me?"

The intensity in his eyes was dangerous, like he could set her aflame with just a look.

Harrison leaned in, her lips brushing his ear as she whispered, "Every night."

Nathaniel’s breath hitched. "And what did you imagine?"

She traced his jaw with her lips before capturing his mouth again, her voice a sultry murmur against his skin.

"I imagined devouring you whole."
###Chapter 749

Nathaniel's throat tightened as he realized his enchanting little minx had returned.

His hands gripped Harrison's slender waist possessively. "Such insatiable hunger, darling? Are you certain you can take all of me?"

Harrison gazed up at Nathaniel - the most formidable and devastatingly handsome man in all of Metropolia, exuding raw power and absolute confidence. She looped her arms around his neck with a sultry smile.

"Only one way to discover, isn't there?"

Hours melted away until Nathaniel finally carried his exhausted lover to bed. Harrison felt utterly unraveled, every muscle liquid fire, completely spent.

Little Charlotte slept peacefully beneath the silk sheets, her cherubic face flushed like a perfect peach, tempting enough to devour. Harrison leaned down to press a featherlight kiss to her daughter's forehead.

Just then, Nathaniel emerged from the shower, water droplets still glistening on his sculpted torso as he slid into bed and pulled Harrison against him.

She shot him a warning look. "You're not sleeping here. The floor looks comfortable."

Nathaniel nipped playfully at her earlobe. "Kicking me out after ravishing me so thoroughly? You were practically begging for more earlier!"

Harrison's eyes flashed dangerously. "Get. Out."

"Not a chance." His arms tightened around her. "Tonight, I'm holding my wife and daughter where they belong."

Charlotte curled on one side, Harrison nestled between them, and Nathaniel forming a protective barrier on the outside.

Gazing at his family, Nathaniel felt something profound click into place. After years of waiting, his world was finally complete.

"Wife? Don't flatter yourself!" Harrison hissed.

Nathaniel's grin turned wolfish. "You are my wife in every way that matters."

"You're impossible! Release me this instant!"

"Never."

In one fluid motion, Nathaniel rolled Harrison beneath him.

She recognized the predatory gleam in his eyes instantly. The man had the stamina of a damned immortal! They'd already christened the floor, the chaise lounge, and the shower, yet here he was, ready for round four!

Harrison squeezed her eyes shut. "I'm exhausted. Let me sleep."

Nathaniel brushed his lips against hers. "Then sleep, my love."

His fingers began inching up her negligee.

Harrison trapped his wandering hand. "Charlotte is right here! Have some self-control!"

"Relax. She's sound asleep." His breath was hot against her neck. "She won't hear a thing."

Harrison contemplated smothering him with a pillow. "Nathaniel!"

He nibbled her earlobe. "Hush now. You'll wake the baby."

She was utterly speechless.

Dawn broke with the sound of delighted giggles.

Harrison blinked awake to find Charlotte sitting cross-legged on the bed, her dark eyes sparkling as she stared at her parents.

"Mommy! You're cuddling with Mr. Gorgeous!"

Harrison realized with horror that she was still wrapped in Nathaniel's embrace, his arm draped possessively over her waist. Heat flooded her cheeks.

"Charlotte, darling..."

But Nathaniel only tightened his hold, smiling lazily. "Sweetheart, you need to call me something different now. Not Mr. Gorgeous - I'm your daddy."

Charlotte's entire face lit up. "Really? Mommy, is he really my daddy?"

Harrison couldn't lie to those hopeful eyes. She nodded. "Yes, my love. He's your father."

"YAY!" Charlotte bounced on the mattress. "I have a daddy! And he's the handsomest daddy ever! Now we can be together forever - Daddy, Mommy, and me!"

Nathaniel scooped up their daughter, pressing a kiss to her curls. "Exactly. Today, your mother and I are making it official. From this moment forward, nothing will ever separate our family again."
###Chapter 750

Harrison stared at Nathaniel, her heart pounding. "We're getting married today?"

Nathaniel sat up, his muscular frame casting a shadow over her. "Absolutely. After last night, you practically left me breathless. Don't you think you owe me some responsibility?"

Her cheeks burned. Him? Breathless? He had been the one who acted like an untamed predator!

"I don't want to get married!" she snapped. The idea of binding herself to Nathaniel again had never seriously crossed her mind.

Just then, Charlotte wrapped her tiny arms around Harrison’s neck. "Mommy, why won’t you marry Daddy?"

Guilt twisted in Harrison’s chest. For three years, Charlotte had yearned for a father, for a complete family. Harrison had failed her.

"Charlotte, I—"

"Oh! I know!" Charlotte gasped dramatically. "Daddy must have done something bad to make you sad. That’s why you won’t marry him! Daddy, this is all your fault!"

Harrison couldn’t help but smile. Her little girl was her fiercest protector.

Nathaniel’s gaze softened as he looked at Harrison. "She’s right. I made mistakes. I hurt you. But I’m asking for one more chance." His fingers tightened around hers. "Let Charlotte be my judge. If I fail again, she can punish me."

Charlotte’s eyes sparkled. "Mommy, Daddy messed up, so he has to fix it! Please give him another chance!"

Harrison laughed. This little schemer was too clever for her own good.

Nathaniel’s thumb brushed over her knuckles. "Stop running. I know you still love me—just as I love you. We’ve wasted three years. Let’s start over. Be my Mrs. Falcon. I’ll spend every day proving I deserve you."

Her resolve wavered.

She did love him. Despite everything, her heart had never truly let go.

And now, they had Charlotte. Maybe this was the right path.

Before she could answer, a sharp knock interrupted them.

Dominic’s voice carried through the door. "Mr. Falcon, Mrs. Victoria is here!"

Victoria.

Harrison stiffened. Nathaniel’s mother had always pushed him to marry Isabella Lancaster, the heiress to their family’s fortune. The Falcons and Lancasters had been allies for generations.

Would Victoria accept her as Nathaniel’s wife?

Nathaniel squeezed her hand. "Relax. My mother adores you and Charlotte. She won’t say no."

Charlotte beamed. "Mrs. Victoria is here! I want to see her!" She scrambled off the bed and dashed out before Harrison could stop her.

Victoria stood in the CEO’s office, her expression tense. The lounge door burst open, and Charlotte sprinted toward her.

"Mrs. Victoria!"

Victoria immediately knelt and gathered Charlotte into her arms. "Sweetheart! I was so worried when you disappeared! I couldn’t sleep—I had to find you!"

Charlotte giggled. "Daddy brought me here!"

Victoria froze. "Daddy?"

Charlotte nodded eagerly. "Yes! Mr. Handsome is my Daddy!"
###Chapter 751

Victoria froze, her expression one of utter disbelief.

Had Charlotte just said what she thought she'd said?

Victoria was certain she must have misheard.

"Charlotte, darling, could you repeat that?" she asked gently, kneeling to the little girl's level.

Charlotte's voice was pure innocence. "Mr. Nathaniel is my daddy. And you're my grandma..."

The words hit Victoria like a tidal wave.

At that moment, Nathaniel and Harrison emerged from the hallway.

"Mother, you heard correctly. Charlotte is my biological daughter," Nathaniel confirmed, his voice steady.

Victoria's hand flew to her chest. "How... when...?"

Nathaniel produced a DNA test report from his jacket. "See for yourself."

With trembling fingers, Victoria examined the document. The results left no room for doubt - Charlotte carried the Falcon bloodline. Suddenly, her instant connection with the child made perfect sense.

"Mother, there's much you don't know about Harrison and me," Nathaniel continued. "I made terrible mistakes in the past. Samuel isn't her lover - just a mentor from university."

He took a steadying breath. "I've already dissolved the Lancaster engagement. Yesterday, I personally informed Henry Lancaster. I won't marry Isabella. My heart belongs to Harrison."

Nathaniel's gaze never wavered. "Charlotte deserves both parents. I intend to spend my life making up for lost time. I need your blessing."

Victoria clutched the report tighter, emotions warring within her. "Blessing? Nathaniel Falcon, do you truly think I'd stand in the way of my own granddaughter's happiness?"

Nathaniel blinked in surprise. "But your friendship with Isabella Lancaster..."

Victoria's laughter rang through the foyer. "Oh, my dear boy! I've known Isabella Whitmore since she was in pigtails. That woman would never force a loveless marriage."

She crossed to Harrison, taking both her hands. "So this precious angel is my blood."

Harrison nodded, eyes shimmering. "She is. I should have told you sooner."

"Nonsense," Victoria chided gently. "If anyone should apologize, it's me. My actions three years ago..." Her voice broke. "I'll regret that interference until my dying day."

Harrison squeezed her hands. "As I've said before, everyone acts according to their conscience. You were protecting your son."

Tears spilled down Victoria's cheeks as she nodded.

"Initially, I pushed for the Lancaster match because of tradition. But the more time I spent with Isabella..." She shuddered. "That girl has her mother's manipulative streak."

Harrison's eyes widened. She hadn't anticipated such support.

"You've given our family the greatest gift," Victoria continued, stroking Charlotte's hair. "Please, give Nathaniel this chance. I've watched his suffering these past years. Marry him. Let me help with Charlotte while you build your lives together."

Nathaniel looked at his mother as if seeing her for the first time. "You've changed."

Victoria arched an elegant brow. "Did you think me incapable of growth? Even old hawks learn new tricks, darling."

Charlotte suddenly threw her arms around Victoria's waist. "Best grandma ever!"

The declaration shattered the remaining tension. Laughter filled the grand foyer of Rosewood Manor as three generations of Falcons embraced their new beginning.
###Chapter 752

Victoria beamed with maternal warmth. She took Nathaniel's hand and carefully placed it over Harrison's. "Harrison, for Charlotte's happiness, please give Nathaniel another chance—but if he ever breaks your heart again, I won't hesitate to intervene."

"At this point, I'm questioning if I'm actually your son," Nathaniel grumbled playfully.

Harrison's lips curved into a tender smile.

Nathaniel gazed at her, hope shimmering in his eyes. "Marry me, Harrison."

Her resistance crumbled. There was no point clinging to the past when their future beckoned so brightly.

Finally, she nodded. "Yes."

Nathaniel swept her into his arms, spinning her around with unrestrained joy. "Perfect! You're going to be my wife—officially mine!"

Charlotte clapped her tiny hands, giggling. "Yay! Mommy and Daddy are getting married!"

Victoria's smile deepened, her eyes glistening with happiness.

Nathaniel and Harrison had agreed to obtain their marriage license that very day. With the courthouse open, there was no reason to delay.

Nathaniel called Harrison, who was in the middle of sketching designs in her studio when she answered.

"You remember what today is, right?" Nathaniel asked, his voice laced with anticipation.

Harrison chuckled. "How could I forget? Today’s the day we make it official."

Now that she had chosen to rebuild their life together, she was all in—ready to meet him halfway and create the family they both longed for.

Nathaniel checked his watch. "I’ll come get you."

Harrison shook her head. "No need. I’m closer to the courthouse. I’ll drive myself. Let’s meet out front."

"Deal," Nathaniel agreed.

As soon as he hung up, Dominic entered. "Mr. Falcon, there’s an urgent contract requiring your signature."

Nathaniel grinned, unable to contain his excitement. "Clear my schedule. I’m getting married today."

Dominic snapped the file shut, grinning. "Congratulations, sir! You and Mrs. Falcon are finally making it official!"

Nathaniel arched a brow, his eyes dancing with amusement. "Mrs. Falcon—I like the sound of that."

Dominic chuckled. "As you should, sir."

Nathaniel grabbed his keys, ready to leave—until Isabella strode in, her expression stormy.

"Where are you rushing off to?" she demanded.

Nathaniel’s mood darkened. The last person he wanted to see today was Isabella. "What do you want?"

Dominic discreetly slipped out.

Isabella’s eyes burned with frustration. "After all these years, you’re treating me like a stranger? I refuse to believe you never cared for me."

Nathaniel’s voice turned icy. "I was with you because you pretended to be Harrison. I never loved you. She’s the only one who ever had my heart."

Her fists clenched, nails digging into her palms. How could he be so cruel?

Nathaniel’s gaze hardened. "Actually, you’re here at the right time. There’s something you should know."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. "What?"

"Harrison and I are getting married."

Her breath hitched as if struck by lightning. "She actually agreed?"

"Yes. She’s giving us a second chance. We’re starting over."

Isabella’s chest tightened. After everything she’d done, they were still ending up together?

"Soon, Harrison will be my wife," Nathaniel said coldly. "Don’t come looking for me again. I don’t want to see you—and I won’t let my wife misunderstand anything because of you."
###Chapter 753

Isabella's hands trembled as she clutched Nathaniel's sleeve, her voice barely above a whisper. "Nathaniel, you're really casting me aside like this?"

His response was like ice shattering against stone. "Get out. If you have any dignity left, don't ever show your face to me again."

With one brutal motion, he shoved her away, his expression devoid of any lingering warmth.

Isabella's heart splintered. No matter what she did, Nathaniel's love belonged to Harrison now—irrevocably, completely.

"I'm going to meet Harrison. We're getting married today."

Nathaniel snatched his car keys from the counter and turned toward the door.

In a desperate surge, Isabella threw herself forward, arms locking around his neck. "Wait!"

Nathaniel stiffened, then wrenched her off with a snarl. "Don't touch me!"

She stumbled, crashing to the floor in a graceless heap, humiliation burning through her.

Coolly adjusting his collar, Nathaniel didn't spare her another glance. "If I see you at Falcon Enterprises again, security will handle you."

Then he was gone.

Isabella remained on the floor, her gaze sharp as a blade as she watched Nathaniel disappear. Just then, her phone buzzed—Eleanor calling.

She answered, voice steady. "Yes, Ms. Lancaster?"

Eleanor's tone was smooth. "Well? Did you successfully place the Heartchain Curse on Nathaniel?"

A slow, victorious smile curled Isabella's lips. "Consider it done."

"Excellent. Once the curse takes hold, Nathaniel will suffer excruciating pain whenever he's near another woman. The only relief he'll find is in your presence. You'll become his only remedy—his only escape. He won't be able to leave you again."

Isabella's pulse quickened with satisfaction. When she'd grabbed Nathaniel's neck earlier, she'd discreetly woven the curse into his skin without him noticing.

Now, his wedding to Harrison would never happen.

"Where did you even learn the Heartchain Curse?"

Eleanor chuckled. "Since we're partners now, I'll tell you. In my youth, I trained under a master from Frostholm—a curse artisan of unparalleled skill. I studied under her until I mastered every technique she knew."

Isabella's breath hitched. The more powerful Eleanor was, the better it served her.

"Together, the Lancaster and Falcon families won't stand a chance against us."

"Precisely. I have no doubt of it."

Hanging up, Isabella rose from the floor, her fear replaced by cold determination. The game had only just begun.

Nathaniel strode out of Falcon Enterprises and slid into his sleek black car. His phone buzzed—Harrison calling.

He answered instantly. "I'm on my way. Where are you?"

"Already at the courthouse," Harrison replied, voice warm.

"I'll be there soon, Mrs. Falcon."

Harrison's soft laugh sent warmth curling through him.

Nathaniel's chest swelled with joy—and beneath it, a thread of unease. After everything, he was finally remarrying Harrison. He couldn't shake the fear that something might go wrong.

But so far, everything was perfect. Harrison was waiting.

He turned the key in the ignition—

A searing pain lanced through his neck. Then his skull erupted in agony, as if his head were splitting apart.

Nathaniel clutched his temples, bewildered.

What the hell was happening? The pain was unbearable.

He fumbled for his phone to call Harrison—

But the moment Harrison's name flashed on the screen, fresh torment exploded behind his eyes. He doubled over with a strangled cry.

Meanwhile, inside the courthouse, Harrison glanced at the number in her hand—18. A few couples still waited ahead.

She settled in to wait when suddenly, her phone rang.

Rosalind was calling.
###Chapter 754

Harrison answered the call, and Rosalind’s bubbly voice chimed through. "Still in Metropolia? Let’s grab lunch!"

"Can’t today," Harrison murmured. "I’m at the courthouse."

A beat of silence. Then—"The courthouse?"

"Yes," Harrison confirmed softly. "Nathaniel and I are getting our marriage license."

What?!

Rosalind’s squeal nearly shattered her eardrums. "You’re remarrying Nathaniel and didn’t tell me? Oh my god, you’re officially going to be family! I knew you two were meant to be!"

Harrison’s lips curved faintly. "We’ll celebrate another time."

After hanging up, a clerk’s voice echoed through the hall. "Number 18—Number 18, please step forward for registration!"

Harrison glanced at the slip in her hand—18. Her turn.

She scanned the entrance, but Nathaniel’s broad silhouette was nowhere in sight.

He’d said he was on his way. So where was he?

"Number 18! Is Number 18 present?"

Harrison hurried forward. "Yes, that’s me."

The clerk frowned. "Alone? Where’s your fiancé?"

"Delayed," Harrison said smoothly. "You can take the next couple first."

The clerk arched a brow. "This is a marriage license. Not exactly something you show up late for."

A cold prickle ran down Harrison’s spine. She had no idea why Nathaniel wasn’t here.

"Work must’ve held him up. I’ll wait."

The clerk sighed. "Fine. Take a seat. Number 19, you’re up."

Stepping outside, Harrison dialed Nathaniel. The line rang. And rang.

No answer.

She tried again. Nothing.

What the hell was going on?

Her phone buzzed—a flurry of messages in their group chat.

Gabrielle had written:
[Harrison, are you seriously remarrying Nathaniel Falcon?]

Rosalind replied:
[Yes! She’s at the courthouse right now. Probably already signed the papers!]

Gabrielle huffed:
[That man doesn’t deserve a second chance. But fine—if he screws up again, I’m dragging you away myself.]

Rosalind added:
[Same. One more mistake, and I’m disowning him as family.]

Gabrielle continued:
[Hey, why isn’t Harrison responding?]

Rosalind:
[Probably busy with Nathaniel. Let’s not interrupt the newlyweds.]

Gabrielle relented:
[Fine. Congrats, Harrison!]

Rosalind:
[Happiness to you both!]

Harrison stared at the screen, throat tight. How could she reply when Nathaniel hadn’t even shown up?

Back inside, she sat stiffly. She’d promised to marry him. She’d wait.

One hour. Two. Three. Four.

Finally, a staff member approached, voice gentle.

"Miss… is your fiancé coming? We’re closing soon."
###Chapter 755

Were they closing already?

Harrison rose from the stiff courthouse bench, her legs numb from hours of waiting for Nathaniel. The bustling crowd had dwindled to nothing, yet he still hadn't appeared.

She turned to the clerk with pleading eyes. "Just one more call?"

The clerk sighed sympathetically. "We'll stay a few more minutes. If he truly wants this, he'll come. But if not..." Her voice trailed off meaningfully.

Harrison swallowed hard. "Okay."

Her fingers trembled as she redialed Nathaniel's number.

The line rang endlessly before that same robotic voice taunted her. "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

The clerk arched a brow. "Still nothing?"

Harrison shook her head, throat tight.

Another employee approached. "We're locking up now."

Nodding mechanically, Harrison gathered her purse. "Thank you for waiting."

As she stepped into the bitter evening air, fragments of whispered conversation followed her.

"Waited all day for that no-show fiancé. Pathetic."

"Men who miss their own wedding licenses don't deserve second chances."

"Pretty girl like her? He's a fool."

The biting wind mirrored the ice spreading through Harrison's chest. Just when she'd dared to hope for a fresh start, Nathaniel had shattered it all.

Then—her phone chimed.

Her heart leapt. Nathaniel?

But the screen displayed Rosalind's name instead.

Disappointment curdled in her stomach as she answered. "Hello?"

"Did you get the license? Congratulations!" Rosalind's cheerful voice grated.

"Not yet."

Silence. Then— "What? Where are you? I'm coming!"

Nathaniel's skull exploded with white-hot pain as his luxury sedan idled at a red light.

Darkness swallowed him whole.

When consciousness returned, night had fallen. He sat up slowly, head throbbing. The medical mystery could wait—today was supposed to be his wedding license day.

Harrison. Was she still waiting?

Tires screeched as he raced toward the courthouse.

Thirty frantic minutes later, he pounded on the locked doors. "Harrison! Are you in there?"

A staff member appeared, frowning. "Sir, we're closed."
###Chapter 756


Nathaniel's voice cracked with urgency. "You're closed already? I had an appointment with my fiancée to get our marriage license today!"

The clerk gave him a disapproving look. "We closed hours ago. Was your fiancée that stunning blonde with emerald eyes?"

Harrison had made quite an impression.

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around his car keys. "Yes, that's her. My future wife."

The clerk crossed her arms. "You ought to be ashamed! That poor girl waited here from opening till closing. Getting married isn't some casual errand—it's a sacred commitment. How could you stand her up?"

Waited all day...?

Nathaniel's stomach dropped. "There was an emergency at Falcon Enterprises."

"Doesn't matter now. She left when we locked up." The clerk softened slightly. "You'd better go make this right, young man."

Nathaniel sprinted to his Lamborghini, the winter air biting his cheeks.

His phone screen illuminated with dozens of missed calls—all from Harrison. Each notification felt like a knife twisting in his ribs.

He wanted to punch the steering wheel. How could he have failed her like this? After everything they'd survived to be together?

The phone rang four times before going to voicemail.

"Harrison, baby, please—"

Silence.

Again. Again. Still no answer.

A leaden dread pooled in Nathaniel's chest. He'd fought through hell for this woman, and now—

A white-hot lance of pain split his skull.

Isabella materialized beside his car window, her crimson nails tapping the glass. "Darling, you look terrible."

Nathaniel recoiled. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Her lips curved like a satisfied cat. "Where else would I be? You're my compass, Nathaniel."

"Get lost!"

He shoved the car door open, but the pain returned with vengeance—a thousand needles stabbing his frontal lobe.

Isabella caught his arm. The agony instantly dulled.

"See?" she purred. "Your body knows what your stubborn mind won't admit. You need me."

Nathaniel wrenched free. "I need Harrison."

Three steps. That's all he managed before collapsing against the hood, vision swimming.

Isabella's stilettos clicked closer. "This isn't healthy obsession—it's self-destruction. Let me take you home."

Tears blurred Nathaniel's vision. "You don't understand. She thinks I abandoned her."

Each attempt to stand sent fresh waves of torment crashing through his nervous system. The harder he fought toward Harrison, the more his body rebelled.

Until finally—darkness.

His last conscious thought was of Harrison's tear-streaked face as his knees hit the pavement.
###Chapter 757
Rosalind and Harrison met at The Grand View, an upscale restaurant in Willowbrook. They were seated in an elegant private dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city skyline. Rosalind slid the leather-bound menu across the table.

"You've been waiting at the courthouse all morning—you must be famished. Order anything you like."

Harrison didn't hesitate. Her fingers traced the embossed lettering as she selected the most exquisite dishes.

Rosalind leaned forward, her manicured nails tapping the tablecloth. "What exactly happened today? Nathaniel was supposed to meet you."

Harrison's shoulders tensed. "I don't know. I tried calling repeatedly—it just kept ringing."

Rosalind slammed her palm on the table, making the silverware jump. "Unacceptable! Standing you up on your wedding day? I'm calling him right now!"

She yanked her phone from her clutch and dialed Nathaniel's number. The line rang endlessly before going to voicemail.

"This makes no sense," Rosalind muttered, tossing her phone onto the table. "He always answers. Where could he be?"

As their food arrived, Harrison picked at her seared scallops without appetite.

"Don't worry," Rosalind said firmly. "I'll drag him here by his tie if I have to."

Harrison's fork hovered mid-air. Nathaniel had been the one insisting on this courthouse wedding. Even if he'd changed his mind, he would've told her directly. This radio silence was completely out of character.

Rosalind studied Harrison's expression. "I'm not making excuses for him, but think about it—this isn't like Nathaniel at all. What if something's wrong?"

Harrison's breath caught. After hours of waiting alone, the possibility hit her like ice water.

Nathaniel would never ghost her like this. Not when he'd spent months convincing her to marry him.

Harrison pulled out her phone with trembling fingers. "His phone's been off all day. That never happens."

"I'm calling Falcon Estate," she announced. "Let's see if Victoria or Charlotte have heard from him."

Rosalind nodded approval as Harrison dialed.

At the Falcon family mansion, Victoria sat with Charlotte in the sunlit parlor. The little girl bounced excitedly on the antique sofa.

"Grandma Victoria! Mommy and Daddy are married now, right?"

Victoria smoothed Charlotte's hair with a tender smile. "Yes, darling. From today onward, our family is complete."

Charlotte shook her head, eyes sparkling. "Not complete—there's four of us!"

Victoria blinked in surprise. "Four? Is your mother expecting?"

Giggling behind her hands, Charlotte corrected, "No silly! I mean you, me, Daddy and Mommy—we're a family of four!"

Victoria's hands stilled. A lifetime of loneliness—her disastrous marriage, the years of isolation—all melted under the warmth of Charlotte's innocent declaration.

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes as Charlotte threw her small arms around her. "When I grow up, I'll take care of you forever, Grandma!"

In that moment, decades of heartache dissolved. Victoria clung to the child, her voice thick with emotion. "And I will love you forever, my darling..."

The grandfather clock chimed as the phone began to ring.
###Chapter 758

The golden afternoon light spilled through the windows as Victoria and Charlotte cuddled on the sofa, sharing a bowl of strawberries.

Suddenly, the phone shattered the peaceful moment.

Victoria gently disentangled herself. "Charlotte darling, I need to get that."

Charlotte's eyes sparkled with anticipation. "Do you think it's Father calling? Or Grandmother?"

"Let's see who it is."

Victoria answered the call, immediately recognizing the voice. "Mrs. Victoria, it's me."

"Harrison! Did you and Nathaniel get your marriage license today? You should start calling me Victoria now!" Her voice bubbled with excitement.

An uncomfortable silence followed.

"We... didn't get married today," Harrison confessed, her voice barely above a whisper.

Victoria's smile vanished. "What? Why not? Nathaniel was so determined to marry you today!"

Harrison's voice trembled. "He never showed up."

Victoria's grip tightened on the phone. "That foolish boy! Where could he possibly be?"

"I've tried calling repeatedly, but his phone goes straight to voicemail. Has he returned home?"

"No, I haven't seen him since breakfast."

"This isn't like him at all. Do you think... something terrible happened?"

Victoria's maternal instincts kicked in. "He wouldn't abandon you without reason. Stay calm - I'll have the staff locate him immediately."

"Thank you," Harrison murmured.

Without wasting a second, Victoria summoned the head butler. "Find Nathaniel this instant! I want to know his exact whereabouts!"

"Right away, madam."

Five tense minutes later, the butler rushed back, his face ashen. "Terrible news! Mr. Falcon has been in an accident!"

Victoria shot to her feet. "What kind of accident?"

Charlotte's tiny hands clutched her grandmother's sleeve. "Is Daddy hurt?"

The butler swallowed hard. "He's been admitted to Silver Pines Medical Center."

What?!

Meanwhile, Harrison and Rosalind remained in the private dining room at The Grand View. Rosalind asked quietly, "Did Mrs. Victoria send someone to investigate?"

Harrison nodded numbly. "Yes. She'll call back soon with news."

As if on cue, her phone rang - Victoria calling.

Harrison answered instantly. "Any news about Nathaniel?"

"Nathaniel's been hospitalized!" Victoria's voice cracked with panic.

Harrison's blood ran cold. How could this happen?

Rosalind stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. "What happened? Is he alright?"

"Mrs. Victoria, please stay calm. I'm heading to the hospital now." Harrison ended the call and turned to Rosalind. "I'm so sorry, but we'll have to postpone lunch. Nathaniel's been hospitalized."

Rosalind grabbed her purse. "I'm coming with you."

"Thank you."

The two women raced through the city streets toward Silver Pines Medical Center. In the sterile white hallway, Harrison approached the nurse's station. "Excuse me, could you direct me to Nathaniel Falcon's room?"

The nurse checked her records. "Mr. Falcon? He's in our VIP wing - Room 405."

"Thank you."

Harrison sprinted down the corridor, Rosalind keeping pace beside her. "Harrison, try to breathe. I'm sure he'll be fine."

Harrison burst through the door of Room 405, her voice breaking. "Nathaniel..."

Her words died in her throat.

Standing beside Nathaniel's hospital bed was Isabella.
###Chapter 759

Harrison stood frozen at the hospital room's threshold, her breath catching at the unexpected scene before her.

Isabella perched on the edge of Nathaniel's bed, her fingers tracing the sharp line of his jaw with unsettling tenderness. The man lay motionless in his hospital gown, still unconscious, while Isabella's gaze lingered with an intimacy that made Harrison's stomach twist.

Rosalind's sharp voice shattered the heavy silence. "Isabella, what are you doing here?"

The woman turned, her lips curling into a smirk as she spotted them. She rose gracefully, sauntering toward Harrison with deliberate steps.

"What a coincidence," Isabella purred. "Today was supposed to be your wedding day, wasn't it? Yet here Nathaniel is—with me. Did you wait at the courthouse all alone? How... pathetic."

Rosalind bristled, but Harrison silenced her with a glance. Her voice was ice. "You've been with him all day?"

"Of course," Isabella shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "We have history. He's never stopped caring for me. Does that bother you?"

Now Harrison understood. Love wasn't meant for three. There was no room for intruders, especially not ones like Isabella.

A cold laugh escaped her. "Jealous? Hardly."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked away, her expression unreadable.

Rosalind shot Isabella a venomous glare. "You're like a parasite. Can't exist unless you're ruining something beautiful. Disgusting."

She stormed off after Harrison, leaving Isabella seething.

"Excuse me?" Isabella snapped, but they were already gone.

Harrison's composure had been infuriating. No tears, no outburst—just calm dismissal. It wasn't the reaction Isabella had anticipated, and that only fueled her rage.

A soft groan came from the bed.

Nathaniel stirred, his eyelids fluttering open.

Isabella immediately softened her expression, rushing to his side. "Nathaniel! You're awake!"

He blinked, disoriented, before pushing himself upright with effort. "Why am I in the hospital?"

"You collapsed outside," Isabella explained smoothly. "I brought you here."

A sharp pain lanced through his skull, but one thought eclipsed it—

Harrison.

He threw off the covers, swinging his legs over the edge. "I need to find Harrison."

Isabella didn't move to stop him. Instead, she smiled. "She already came by."

Nathaniel froze. "What?"

"She saw me here and left. Didn't seem very pleased."

His stomach dropped. Of course she'd misunderstand. Any woman would after being stood up at the altar only to find her fiancé with another woman.

"I have to explain."

He rushed into the hallway, but a sudden, blinding pain sent him staggering against the wall.

Isabella was at his side instantly. "You need to rest. You're not well."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened as he studied her. Something felt... off.

She shifted under his scrutiny. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

He exhaled slowly. "No reason."
###Chapter 760

Nathaniel turned on his heel and strode back to his hospital room without another word.

Isabella hurried after him, her heels clicking against the sterile floor. "Aren't you going after Harrison?" she pressed, her voice laced with false concern.

Of course he intended to—just not yet. Something was undeniably wrong with him. The splitting headaches, the dizziness—none of it made sense. He needed answers first.

Once inside, Nathaniel summoned the doctor with a sharp command.

The physician stood at attention beside the bed. "Mr. Falcon."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto him. "What's happening to me? These migraines—they feel like my skull is being crushed. Explain."

"We've conducted every possible test," the doctor replied, handing over a clipboard. "All results indicate perfect health. No abnormalities detected."

Perfect health?

Then why did it feel like his brain was being torn apart?

The doctor flipped open the CT scan results. "Your brain scans are completely normal, sir."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. The pain was real, yet the evidence said otherwise.

"Perhaps you've been overworking yourself," Isabella interjected softly, stepping closer. "You should rest. I'll stay with you."

His eyes flicked to her. "You'll stay?"

She nodded, a confident smile curving her lips. "Of course. Harrison brings you nothing but misery. Every time you're near her, you suffer. But me? I'm your good fortune. With me by your side, everything will be alright."

Nathaniel considered her words. It was true—each time Harrison crossed his mind or stood before him, agony followed.

Yet when Isabella was near, the pain vanished.

He studied her in silence, his expression unreadable.

Beneath her composed facade, Isabella's pulse quickened. His scrutiny unnerved her. She touched her cheek self-consciously. "Is something wrong?"

Nathaniel's grip suddenly lashed out, seizing her wrist with bruising force.

She gasped as he yanked her forward, her knee slamming against the bed frame. Pain shot up her leg. "You're hurting me!" she cried.

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Did you do something to me? Did you tamper with my mind?"

Had he discovered the truth?

Panic flared, but she forced her features into confusion. "I don't understand! How could I possibly—? I've never had the opportunity!"

Nathaniel's dark eyes bored into hers, searching for cracks in her mask.

The door swung open abruptly.

Victoria entered with Charlotte in tow, her worried gaze darting between them. "Nathaniel, what's going on?"

Isabella straightened quickly. "Mrs. Victoria, hello."

Charlotte rushed to her father, small arms wrapping around him. "Daddy, why are you in the hospital? Are you sick?"

The tension in Nathaniel's shoulders eased slightly as he kissed his daughter's forehead. "I'm fine, sweetheart. Just a little tired. I promise I'll be here to watch you grow up."

Victoria's sharp eyes remained fixed on Isabella. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella smiled sweetly. "Just keeping Nathaniel company. He shouldn't be alone right now."

Victoria's lips thinned, but before she could respond, Nathaniel's phone buzzed.

A message from Dominic: Sir, we've found something you need to see.

The game was far from over.
###Chapter 761
Charlotte nodded gently, her small fingers clutching the hospital blanket. "You must recover quickly, Daddy."

Isabella's face darkened as she watched the tender moment between father and daughter. This child—this living proof of Nathaniel's bond with Harrison—was becoming an insurmountable obstacle in her carefully laid plans.

But Isabella wasn't worried. Once she secured Nathaniel's devotion, she knew exactly how to remove this little inconvenience from their lives.

Victoria turned to Isabella with a measured gaze. "Since you're here, there's something you should know."

Isabella immediately linked arms with Victoria, her voice dripping with honeyed remorse. "I deeply regret my previous actions. My mother reprimanded me severely, and I've learned my lesson. I acted out of love for Nathaniel—nothing more. Our mothers have been friends for decades. Wouldn't our union bring both families even closer?"

Her words were calculated, designed to exploit Victoria's friendship with her mother.

Victoria withdrew her arm, creating deliberate distance. "The engagement between the Falcon and Lancaster families is terminated."

Isabella froze. "What—"

"Harrison is the mother of Nathaniel's child," Victoria continued firmly. "Nathaniel loves her. They were supposed to register their marriage today. In my eyes, Harrison is already my daughter-in-law."

She added, "As for your mother, I'll speak with her personally. I'm certain she wouldn't force a marriage without affection."

Isabella's jaw clenched until her teeth ached. Victoria had completely sided with Harrison.

Harrison had won them all over!

"But Mrs. Victoria," Isabella protested, "Nathaniel and Harrison didn't actually register today!"

Victoria's eyebrows shot up as she turned to her son. "Is this true? You didn't complete the registration?"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line. "I became unexpectedly ill before we could proceed."

"How remarkably convenient," Victoria remarked dryly.

Too convenient indeed.

A cold smirk played on Nathaniel's lips as he wondered the same thing.

Charlotte's small voice piped up. "It's alright, Daddy. Rest and get better first. Then you can marry Mommy properly."

Nathaniel kissed his daughter's forehead. "My thoughtful little angel."

"I'll stay to care for you," Victoria offered.

Nathaniel shook his head. "Take Charlotte home. My assistant is already en route."

Victoria nodded. "Very well."

Isabella seized the opportunity. "Then I'll stay with Nathaniel!"

"No," Victoria said firmly, gripping Isabella's wrist. "You're leaving with me."

Isabella stiffened. "Why? I want to stay!"

"If Harrison sees you here, she'll misunderstand. I won't have you causing her distress."

Isabella's rage simmered beneath her polished exterior. Since when had Victoria ever treated her this way? This was blatant favoritism!

She turned pleading eyes to Nathaniel. "You want me to stay, don't you?"

After a deliberate pause, Nathaniel said, "Mother, take Charlotte home. Let Isabella remain."

Victoria looked stunned. "Nathaniel—"

She wanted to argue, but Charlotte's wide, innocent eyes stopped her protest mid-thought.
###Chapter 762

Charlotte was too young to comprehend the intricate dynamics between adults. Victoria hesitated to discuss such matters in front of the child.

"Charlotte, your father needs proper rest now. Come, let me take you home," she said gently.

The little girl pressed a featherlight kiss to Nathaniel's cheek. "Papa, I'm leaving now. Promise you'll sleep early?"

Nathaniel pulled Charlotte into another embrace. "I'll miss you terribly."

With that, Victoria led the child away, leaving only Nathaniel and Isabella in the hospital suite.

Isabella settled gracefully into the chair beside his bed. "I'm so grateful you allowed me to stay."

This felt like a significant turning point.

Nathaniel studied her face. "Strangely enough, I feel more at ease when you're near."

A triumphant smile curved Isabella's lips. "Because you've always loved me. I still hold a place in your heart—you were merely deceived by Harrison's charms."

One dark eyebrow arched. "Is that so?"

"Undeniably," she affirmed with conviction.

"Then remain here with me," Nathaniel said.

Isabella's pulse quickened. After all this time, she'd finally regained her position by his side.

The moment was interrupted as Dominic burst through the door. "Mr. Falcon! Are you alright?"

Nathaniel flicked a glance toward Isabella. "Fetch me some water, would you?"

Her eyes brightened. "Of course. It's rather chilly in here—I'll bring warm water."

Once she'd exited, Dominic frowned. "Sir, why permit Ms. Isabella to stay? If Mrs. Falcon discovers this—"

Nathaniel knew Harrison was already furious, but his current condition prevented reconciliation. He couldn't risk dragging her into danger until he solved this mystery.

"From this moment, have her followed constantly. Document every person she meets," Nathaniel ordered.

Dominic's eyes widened. "You suspect something?"

A weighted pause. "I believe she's connected to my condition."

"What? She'd dare? Shouldn't we confront her immediately?"

"Whenever I'm near Harrison, it feels like my skull is splitting open," Nathaniel explained grimly. "Yet with Isabella present, the pain eases. Knowing her limitations, someone more capable must be pulling strings. I intend to uncover who."

Understanding dawned. "I'll arrange surveillance immediately."

"Even the most cunning fox grows careless. We'll wait for her mistake."

"Understood."

"And Harrison's current whereabouts?"

"With Ms. Fairchild. She's perfectly safe."

The tension in Nathaniel's shoulders eased slightly. Once this situation was resolved, he'd make proper amends.

Isabella reappeared, holding a steaming glass. "Here's your water."

As she poured, a melodic chime sounded. Glancing at her phone, she saw Eleanor's name flashing.

"Excuse me, I must take this," she murmured.

Nathaniel waved a dismissive hand. "By all means."

Stepping into the corridor, Isabella answered. "Ms. Lancaster?"

Eleanor's voice crackled through. "Any developments with Nathaniel?"

A smug laugh escaped Isabella. "I provoked Harrison into storming off! Their marriage wasn't registered. And Nathaniel just asked me to stay with him."

The game was finally turning in her favor.
###Chapter 763

Isabella recounted her discoveries of the day to Eleanor.

Eleanor's lips curved in satisfaction. "Excellent. With this Soulbind Curse, Nathaniel won't be able to escape you."

A hopeful yet anxious smile touched Isabella's lips. "The Soulbind Curse...it won't fail unexpectedly, will it? After finally getting this chance to be near Nathaniel, I can't bear the thought of losing him again."

Eleanor chuckled softly. "Relax, darling. It's an ancient, unbreakable curse. Nathaniel's condition will only improve if he remains by your side indefinitely."

"Thank you...truly."

"Don't mention it. Harrison and Gabrielle are our shared enemies now. Neither of them will get away with what they've done."

Meanwhile, in the hospital room, Dominic approached Nathaniel discreetly. "Mr. Falcon, Isabella just left to take a call. I overheard part of the conversation—she was speaking with someone called Ms. Lancaster."

Ms. Lancaster?

Eleanor?

Could she truly be orchestrating all this?

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. He knew Eleanor—an orphan raised alongside Henry. Did she possess that kind of influence?

Was there something darker hidden beneath her poised exterior?

"Mr. Falcon, what's our next move?"

"I suspect Isabella and Eleanor are collaborating, but their exact scheme remains unclear. No matter. I'll test Isabella and uncover the truth."

"How?"

A smirk played on Nathaniel's lips. "By turning them against each other."

Watching Nathaniel's confident expression, Dominic couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for Isabella. Playing games with Nathaniel Falcon was nothing short of suicidal.

Just then, the door swung open, and Isabella strode in. "I'm back."

Nathaniel's gaze settled on her. "Finished your call? Who was it?"

Isabella had her lie ready. She smiled sweetly. "Just my mother."

Nathaniel mirrored her smile. "What did Mrs. Lancaster say?"

"She asked about us. The Falcon and Lancaster families have been allies for generations, and our mothers are dear friends. Naturally, she hopes we'll marry soon." Her eyes shimmered with expectation.

Nathaniel sidestepped a direct answer, instead offering a charming grin. "Thank you for staying with me. How about this—tomorrow evening, I'll take you out to dinner."

Isabella's face lit up. "Really? I'd love that!"

Nathaniel nodded. "It's a date."

Returning to the Lancaster estate, Isabella was met by Henry and Gabrielle. Gabrielle stepped forward, concern knitting her brows. "Where have you been?"

"With Nathaniel. I've been spending time with him."

Gabrielle froze. "What? Nathaniel made his stance perfectly clear the last time he was here. Your father and I want you to find someone who genuinely loves you. You need to let him go."

Isabella cut her off sharply. "He invited me to dinner tomorrow."

Gabrielle blinked in disbelief. "Dinner? What is he planning?"

Henry frowned. "Why would Nathaniel suddenly ask you out?"

Isabella's smile turned triumphant.

It didn't matter if Henry and Gabrielle disapproved—she had Eleanor's support, and with that, Nathaniel would be hers.

"His heart has always belonged to me. This dinner proves it!"
###Chapter 764

"But..."

Henry and Isabella hesitated, exchanging uncertain glances.

"I'm exhausted," Isabella interrupted sharply. "I'm retiring to my chambers. I need my beauty sleep for tomorrow's rendezvous with Nathaniel."

With a dramatic swirl of her designer gown, she swept out of the room.

Isabella's mother, Victoria, frowned deeply. "What game is Nathaniel playing? First, he breaks off the engagement, claiming his heart belongs to Harrison. Now he's entangled with Isabella again? This is unacceptable."

Henry's jaw tightened. "I'm calling him."

He snatched his phone and dialed Nathaniel's private line.

The line connected after three rings. "Mr. Lancaster," Nathaniel's velvety baritone resonated through the speaker.

Henry's voice was glacial. "Explain yourself, Nathaniel. What's this charade?"

"I'm afraid I don't follow."

"Isabella just informed us you've arranged a dinner date tomorrow."

"Correct."

"You terminated your engagement, declaring your devotion to Harrison. We respected that decision. Now you're toying with Isabella's affections? This back-and-forth is disgraceful. Do you realize the damage you're causing?" Henry's knuckles whitened around his phone.

Victoria's voice cut in, laced with disapproval. "Harrison is an exceptional woman. If you truly care for her, commit fully. Stop dragging Isabella into this messy triangle. Your actions are hurting everyone involved."

A weighted silence followed before Nathaniel responded, "Mr. Lancaster, how well do you actually know Eleanor?"

Henry stiffened. "Why bring Eleanor into this?"

Nathaniel's tone remained infuriatingly calm. "Some truths require more than a phone call. Join us tomorrow. Everything will become clear."

The line went dead.

Victoria turned to Henry, bewildered. "What did he mean by that?"

Henry pocketed his phone grimly. "We'll find out tomorrow."

Isabella slept like royalty and awoke at dawn, buzzing with anticipation. It had been ages since she'd had a proper date with Nathaniel. Today, she'd outshine that plain Harrison once and for all.

She slipped into a couture crimson dress that hugged her curves perfectly. Twirling before her gilded mirror, she admired her reflection—flawless makeup, cascading curls, and diamonds glittering at her throat.

Satisfied, she grabbed her phone and dialed Nathaniel.

The line rang. And rang. And rang.

No answer.

Her manicured nails dug into her palms. Why wasn't he picking up? Had he changed his mind?

Panic slithered down her spine. She redialed frantically, each unanswered ring amplifying her dread.

Just as despair threatened to consume her, the call connected.

"Hello?" Nathaniel's casual greeting floated through.

Her breath hitched with relief. "I've been calling endlessly! Why didn't you answer? I thought you'd stood me up!"

A faint chuckle. "Now why would I do that?"

"We have plans today. Dinner. Remember?"

"Of course I remember."

"Then come collect me immediately. I'm ready."

"Ah, slight complication—I'm detained at the office. Why don't you head to The Grand View first? I'll join you shortly."

The line disconnected before she could protest.

Isabella stared at her reflection, her earlier radiance dimmed by uncertainty. Something felt... off. But she'd be damned if she let Harrison steal Nathaniel away.

Squaring her shoulders, she grabbed her clutch. The game was far from over.
###Chapter 765

Nathaniel instructed Isabella to go to the restaurant alone first.

Isabella hesitated. She had envisioned Nathaniel arriving to escort her—that was part of the romance of a proper date.

"Can't you come get me? I—"

Nathaniel interrupted her. "I've already reserved a table. I'm in an important meeting. Go ahead and wait for me. Behave."

His tone was firm, authoritative.

Isabella, who adored dominant personalities, felt a thrill at his command. Without protest, she agreed. "Fine, I'll go first. But don't keep me waiting too long."

"Mm."

She left, having the chauffeur drive her to The Grand View.

A hostess greeted her warmly. "Ms. Lancaster, welcome. Your private booth is ready. Right this way."

She guided Isabella to an elegant window seat with a breathtaking cityscape view. Isabella smiled, pleased.

"Would you like anything to drink while you wait?"

"A cappuccino, please. I'll order properly when Mr. Hawk arrives."

"Of course. Enjoy your evening."

Isabella sipped her coffee gracefully, savoring the rich aroma.

Then—

"Isabella?"

A sharp voice cut through the ambiance.

Rosalind stood there, having just entered the restaurant alone.

Isabella looked up, lips curving. "Rosalind! What a surprise. We really can't escape each other, can we?"

Rosalind had come with Lillian, but her companion was running late.

Yesterday, Nathaniel had promised Harrison they would finalize their marriage at the courthouse—only to stand her up. Harrison had then caught Nathaniel and Isabella together in the hospital. Rosalind had taken Harrison home afterward.

Today, with Harrison occupied at the hospital, Rosalind had brought Lillian out for lunch.

Rosalind scoffed. "Don't flatter yourself. I'd rather never see your face again. People like you—stealing identities, breaking up marriages—are despicable. You should be hiding in shame."

Her words were as cutting as Harrison's, and they stung.

Isabella smirked. "If Harrison can't keep her man, that's her problem. But since you're so curious—Nathaniel invited me here tonight."

"What?" Rosalind's eyes narrowed. "Nathaniel asked you to dinner?"

"That's right. A date."

Rosalind's fists clenched. How could Nathaniel do this to Harrison?

"You're lying. Nathaniel would never—"

Isabella laughed. "Sit across from me, then. Wait and see for yourself when he arrives."

Rosalind refused to believe Nathaniel could be so cruel. She pulled out a chair defiantly. "Fine. Let's see whose pride gets shattered tonight."

Her glare never left Isabella.

Isabella merely smiled, anticipation curling in her chest. She couldn't wait to watch Rosalind's face when Nathaniel walked in—and proved her wrong.
###Chapter 766

Rosalind grabbed her phone and quickly typed a message to Harrison. [Harrison, you there?]

Harrison had just returned to Rosalind's apartment after completing an emergency surgery at the hospital, needing to retrieve her medical bag.

Her phone vibrated with Rosalind's incoming message.

She replied, [At your place now. What's going on?]

[Major development! I just spotted Isabella at The Grand View!]

The name "Isabella" made Harrison's slender fingers freeze mid-air. Instantly, Nathaniel's face flashed through her mind.

Before she could respond, another message popped up. [Isabella claims Nathaniel personally invited her to dinner here tonight!]

What?

Harrison's breath caught. Nathaniel invited Isabella to dinner?

Just yesterday he'd promised to accompany her to the courthouse for their marriage license. Now he was dining with Isabella? This made no sense.

Rosalind continued typing furiously. [What game is Nathaniel playing? If he's really here with that witch tonight, I swear I'm disowning him as my cousin!]

Harrison could practically feel Rosalind's rage through the screen, but maintained her composure. [Just eat your meal first.]

Setting down her phone, Harrison's mind swirled with images of Nathaniel's chiseled features. Truthfully, she couldn't fathom his motives either.

Suddenly, the sharp chime of the doorbell echoed through the apartment.

Who could be visiting at this hour?

Harrison rose gracefully and moved to answer the door.

Meanwhile at The Grand View, Isabella had already drained three cups of espresso.

A nervous waiter approached. "Ms. Lancaster, would you care for another coffee?"

Isabella's expression darkened. She'd been waiting a full hour with no sign of Nathaniel. Not even a text message.

The waiter suggested gently, "Perhaps you should call Mr. Falcon to confirm his arrival?"

A mocking laugh came from across the table. Rosalind, who'd been observing this spectacle for the past hour, smirked. "So let me get this straight - Nathaniel invited you, yet he's nowhere to be seen? Curious timing, don't you think?"

Isabella's face flushed with anger. She'd been so certain Nathaniel would appear, ready to witness Rosalind's humiliation.

But with Nathaniel's conspicuous absence, the power dynamic had shifted dramatically.

Rosalind had stayed specifically to watch Isabella's downfall.

The situation was becoming unbearable.

Isabella snapped at the waiter. "Are you implying Mr. Falcon won't honor his commitment?"

The waiter wiped his brow nervously. "N-No, madam, I merely suggested—"

"Enough!" Isabella's voice turned icy. "I know exactly what you're implying!"

"Give it a rest, Isabella." Rosalind's laughter cut through the tension. "Don't take your frustration out on the staff. Why don't you call Nathaniel yourself if you're so confident?"

Isabella's jaw clenched. Nathaniel had extended the invitation personally last night. Under the influence of the Heartchain Curse, he couldn't possibly resist her. There had to be an explanation.

"Fine," she hissed. "You'll see! I'll call him right now and he'll come straight here!"
###Chapter 767

Rosalind's lips curved into a knowing smirk. "Go ahead then, darling. I'll be right here enjoying the show."

Her eyes sparkled with anticipation, clearly relishing the drama about to unfold.

Isabella remained unshaken. There was no way Nathaniel would abandon her—not when the Heartchain Curse still bound him to her will.

With deliberate movements, she retrieved her phone, maintaining eye contact with Rosalind. "Watch closely, sweetheart. You're about to eat your words."

The dial tone echoed through the tense silence. Once. Twice. Five times.

No answer.

Only the robotic voice of the automated system responded. "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

Her perfectly manicured fingers trembled as she redialed. Again. And again.

Each unanswered call felt like another nail in her coffin.

He'd promised. Just last night, over champagne at The Celestial, he'd sworn to meet her here at The Grand View.

Where was he?

A melodic chuckle broke her spiraling thoughts.

Rosalind leaned forward, resting her chin on interlaced fingers. "Oh dear. No Nathaniel yet? Do tell—what did he say when you called just now? Is our dear CEO running late?"

The mock concern in her voice was sharper than any blade.

Isabella's crimson nails bit into her palms, yet she felt nothing.

"Cat got your tongue?" Rosalind continued, gesturing to Isabella's designer dress. "All this effort for nothing? How tragic. Oh wait—he's not coming at all, is he? And he's ignoring your calls! My, my... The great Nathaniel Lancaster standing up the mighty Isabella Whitmore. Delicious."

Peals of laughter spilled from Rosalind's lips.

The sight of Isabella's crumbling composure was sweeter than dessert. Deep down, Rosalind knew Nathaniel's character—this erratic behavior made no sense. Yet here they were.

Undeterred, Isabella kept dialing. The same infuriating silence answered each attempt.

Then Rosalind pulled out her own phone with theatrical flair. "Since he's ghosting you, let's see if he picks up for me."

Isabella's jaw tightened. "By all means."

The ringing pierced the air between them. Once. Twice. Five times.

Silence.

This time, it was Isabella's turn to laugh—a brittle, hollow sound. "See? He's clearly occupied. Probably finalizing that merger with Quantum Innovations. He'll be here."

Rosalind's smirk deepened. "Adorable how you cling to that fantasy. Let me enlighten you—there's only one person important enough to make Nathaniel ignore us both."

Isabella's champagne flute froze midway to her lips. "And who might that be?"

"Must I spell it out?" Rosalind's eyes glittered with triumph. "Harrison. He's with Harrison right now—and darling, you weren't even a passing thought."
###Chapter 768
Nathaniel was with Harrison?

Isabella's expression faltered momentarily before she vehemently shook her head. "You're mistaken! Nathaniel would never be with Harrison!"

"What makes you so certain?"

The truth was, Nathaniel was bound by the Frostholm Curse! Every time he approached Harrison, excruciating pain would sear through his skull.

Of course, Isabella kept this secret from Rosalind. Instead, she smirked confidently. "I'd stake my life on it—Nathaniel isn't with Harrison."

"Fine, let's wager. If Nathaniel isn't with Harrison, I'll address you as 'Your Majesty.'"

"Deal. But if he is with Harrison, you'll hear me call you 'Your Majesty.'"

Their stakes were set: The loser would bow to the victor with royal deference.

Rosalind snatched her phone again. "Truth time. I'm calling Harrison right now."

"Go ahead. I'll wait. Prepare your best regal tone for me."

The line connected after two rings, Harrison's crisp voice cutting through.

"Hello?"

"Guess who I'm with? Isabella! Nathaniel stood her up for dinner tonight. We've made a little bet—I say he's with you. So, is he there?"

"I... Ah!" Harrison's sudden gasp crackled through the speaker.

Rosalind bolted upright, fingers tightening around the phone. "What happened?"

Harrison's strained voice trembled in the background. "Nathaniel, stop—let go of me—"

Rosalind's eyes blazed with triumph. Not only was Nathaniel with Harrison, but something intense was unfolding between them.

"So he is with you—"

The call severed abruptly with twin beeps, leaving only hollow silence.

Isabella sprang up, face drained of color. "Did you just imply... Nathaniel's actually with Harrison?"

Rosalind's smirk widened. "Clear as daylight. You heard them yourself."

Isabella's world tilted. Why would Nathaniel abandon their plans only to chase after Harrison?

More inexplicable—how could he endure the Frostholm Curse's agony to be near her? The curse's potency was legendary; its hold should've been unbreakable.

Rosalind stepped closer, victory lacing her words. "Our bargain, Isabella. Say it—'Your Majesty.'"

"Never!" Isabella's composure shattered. "This is a trick! I refuse to believe it!"

"Need visual proof? Fine." Rosalind's challenge hung in the air. "I'll take you to them."

"Take me?"

"Seeing is believing. Once you witness them together, we'll see how defiant you remain."

Isabella's nails bit into her palms. She needed this illusion shattered.

"Now. I'll trust only my own eyes."
###Chapter 769

"Alright. We're leaving this instant!"

Isabella sprang to her feet, trailing behind Rosalind as they made their swift exit.

Meanwhile, inside her luxurious villa, Harrison swung open the front door—only to be met with the imposing silhouette of Nathaniel.

Her breath hitched. What was he doing here? Wasn't he supposed to be dining with Isabella tonight?

Two days had passed since he'd stood her up at the courthouse. No calls. No texts. Not even a single word of explanation.

Despite her unwavering faith in Nathaniel's integrity, resentment coiled in her chest like a venomous serpent. The last person she wanted to face right now was him.

Harrison's fingers curled around the door handle, ready to slam it shut.

But Nathaniel's palm shot out, pressing firmly against the mahogany surface. His stormy eyes locked onto hers. "Don't," he murmured, voice rough with unspoken emotion.

She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze head-on. "Mr. Falcon. To what do I owe this... unexpected visit?"

A ghost of a smile played on his lips. "Back to formalities? That's cold, darling. Especially for the woman I'm supposed to marry."

The audacity!

Harrison's nails bit into her palms. "Supposed being the operative word. You never showed, remember?"

"Let me explain—"

"By all means." She crossed her arms. "You have exactly sixty seconds."

His jaw tightened. "Not like this. Let me in."

After a charged silence, Harrison stepped aside.

They moved to the sunlit living room where Nathaniel reached for her wrist—his touch featherlight yet electric. "You're furious with me."

"I'm not." Her voice could've frozen hell.

One dark brow arched. "Liar. You waited at the courthouse all day. Of course you're angry."

Internally, Nathaniel reveled in her fury. This fire proved she still cared—that after all these years and hardships, her heart remained irrevocably his.

Harrison wrenched her arm free. "Am I some amusing diversion to you? Your personal puppet to jerk around?"

"Never." His expression sobered. "There were reasons I couldn't meet you that day."

"Enlighten me."

Nathaniel hesitated. The truth remained half-buried, and revealing fragments would only breed more questions.

His silence stoked her rage. "Nothing to say? Then get out."

She turned toward the hallway—that's when Nathaniel spotted the documents on the coffee table. He snatched them up.

"What's this?" His voice dropped an octave as he examined two first-class tickets. "You're leaving?"

"Charlotte and I are relocating to Santorina."

If he couldn't commit, she wouldn't linger like some pathetic lovestruck fool. Letting him in had been her final act of faith—one he'd clearly squandered.

Nathaniel's grip on the tickets turned lethal. "Over my dead body will you take my daughter abroad."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "How very dictator of you. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe Ms. Lancaster is waiting for her dinner date."

The tickets crumpled in his fist as Nathaniel stepped into her space, his cologne—woodsy with a hint of bergamot—washing over her. "Isabella means nothing. You're everything."

Harrison's pulse betrayed her, hammering against her ribs. But she refused to yield. "Prove it."

Nathaniel cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheekbone. "Marry me. Right now. Let's drive to the courthouse this instant."

Her breath caught. The raw desperation in his eyes unraveled her resolve.

Then the doorbell rang.

They froze.

Through the frosted glass, Harrison recognized Isabella's silhouette—and the towering figure beside her.

Nathaniel's entire body tensed. "No," he breathed. "Not him."

Harrison frowned. "Who—"

The door swung open, revealing Rosalind's ashen face. "Harrison... you need to see this."

Behind her stood a silver-haired man in an impeccable suit—and the carbon copy of Nathaniel standing beside him.

The stranger smiled. "Hello, sister. Long time no see."
###Chapter 770

Harrison turned to leave when her phone suddenly vibrated in her pocket. The caller ID showed Rosalind's name flashing across the screen.

She barely managed a greeting before Nathaniel's hand shot out, snatching the device from her grasp.

"Give that back!" Her voice remained steady despite the fire in her eyes.

Nathaniel's grip tightened on her shoulder. "I won't let you take Charlotte away. Not again."

Harrison stepped back, putting distance between them. "You don't own us. We're leaving."

The thought of losing them again sent waves of panic through Nathaniel. He'd barely survived their last separation.

A blinding pain suddenly lanced through his skull, far worse than the medication could suppress. His face drained of color.

Harrison seized the moment to push past him. "If you won't leave, then I will."

She secured the plane tickets in her purse and turned toward the door.

"Don't!"

Nathaniel caught her from behind, crushing her against his chest despite the agony screaming through his nerves. He buried his face in her hair, inhaling her familiar scent like a drowning man gasping for air.

The pain was excruciating - and yet, having her close brought him perverse relief.

"Release me!"

"Never." His voice cracked. "I can't lose you both again."

Without warning, Nathaniel spun her around and pressed her into the sofa cushions. His lips claimed hers in a desperate, punishing kiss.

Harrison shoved against his chest. "Stop this!"

But Nathaniel only deepened the kiss, drinking her in like a man starved. The taste of her momentarily dulled the relentless pounding in his skull.

Outside, tires crunched on the driveway.

Rosalind stepped out of a sleek black Mercedes, followed closely by Isabella.

"See for yourself," Rosalind said smugly, entering the security code. "They're together."

Isabella's lips curled in disbelief. "Impossible. The curse should prevent this."

The front door swung open to reveal Nathaniel pinning Harrison to the couch, their bodies tangled in passionate embrace.

Rosalind averted her eyes with a theatrical gasp. "Still can't keep their hands to themselves, I see."

Isabella froze, her carefully constructed world shattering. The Heartchain Curse was supposed to make physical contact unbearable. How was he touching her?

"Stanley!" The name tore from Isabella's throat. "What are you doing?"

At the sound, Harrison jerked away, her lips swollen from the kiss. Nathaniel reluctantly released her - only to immediately pull her back against his side.

His gaze locked onto Isabella's. "Isn't it obvious?"

The challenge in his voice sent Isabella stumbling back a step. Everything she'd planned was unraveling before her eyes.
###Chapter 771

Isabella's hands trembled as she faced Nathaniel. "W-why are you with her again?"

Nathaniel's arm tightened around Harrison's waist, his lips curling into a smirk. "Harrison has always been the one. We're getting married soon."

"But..." Isabella's voice cracked. "You invited me to dinner."

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow, feigning confusion. "That? Just idle chatter. Honestly, I'd forgotten all about it. Don't tell me you actually waited at The Grand View all day?"

The color drained from Isabella's face. His casual cruelty struck like a blade. This wasn't rejection—it was deliberate humiliation.

A melodic laugh cut through the tension. Rosalind stepped forward, her eyes gleaming with triumph. "See for yourself. Nathaniel's heart has always belonged to Harrison."

Isabella swallowed hard. "Is this true?"

Pain lanced through Nathaniel's skull like white-hot needles. His fingers dug into Harrison's shoulder as he fought to maintain his composure. Not here. Not in front of her.

His voice emerged steady. "Why ask questions you already know the answers to? Harrison is my everything."

Harrison's gaze lifted to meet his.

Ice flooded Isabella's veins. "But... being with her doesn't make you ill?"

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "What are you implying?"

"I..."

Realization struck Isabella like lightning. She'd nearly mentioned the Heartchain Curse. Yet Nathaniel showed no signs of distress. Had the curse broken?

She needed to find Eleanor immediately. Without another word, she spun on her heel.

"Wait!" Rosalind's voice rang out.

Isabella froze. "What now?"

"Our bet." Rosalind's smile turned predatory. "You lost. You owe me—say 'Your Highness.'"

Isabella's nails bit into her palms. Never.

"Don't even think about refusing." Rosalind waved her phone. "I recorded everything. Back out now, and every socialite in Metropolia will know you're a sore loser."

Isabella's breath hitched. The scheming witch had planned this.

"Choose—public humiliation or two simple words?"

Muscles trembling, Isabella forced the words through clenched teeth. "Your Highness."

Rosalind cupped her ear. "What was that? You must be faint from starving all day at that restaurant."

"YOUR HIGHNESS!" Isabella snarled.

"Perfect!" Rosalind clapped delightedly.

With a final glare, Isabella stormed away. The moment she disappeared, Nathaniel's mask shattered.

Harrison's grip on his hand tightened. "Nathaniel?"

His complexion had turned ashen. "I..."

Rosalind rushed forward, taking in his pained expression. "What's wrong?"

Nathaniel watched Isabella's retreating figure until she vanished. Then his hand slipped from Harrison's shoulder—only for her to catch it firmly.

Harrison's clear eyes searched his face. "Talk to me."

Pain twisted his features. "I..."

Rosalind stepped closer, alarm flashing across her face. "Nathaniel? Are you ill?"
###Chapter 772

Harrison's fingers pressed firmly against Nathaniel's wrist, checking his pulse with practiced precision.

Nathaniel attempted to withdraw his hand, but she held tight. "Stay still."

Almost instantly, Harrison's brow furrowed, a shadow of concern flickering in her eyes.

Rosalind noticed immediately. "Why that look? What's wrong with Nathaniel?"

No patient ever wanted to see their doctor worried.

Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze. "Tell me what's happening to you."

Nathaniel exhaled. "I don't even know myself. But I'm certain it's because of you."

"Because of Harrison? Explain," Rosalind demanded, confusion knitting her brows.

Nathaniel lowered his voice. "When I'm away from you, I feel fine. But the moment I get close, my head feels like it's being split open. Remember the day we were supposed to marry? I didn't abandon you intentionally. A sudden, excruciating headache hit me—I blacked out. By the time I woke and rushed to find you, you were already gone."

Rosalind's eyes widened. "What? That's what happened? Harrison, what's wrong with him?"

Harrison's expression darkened. "I believe he's been cursed. The Frostholm Heartchain Curse."

"The Heartchain Curse?"

"Exactly. A dark enchantment from Frostholm. That's why Nathaniel can't be near me."

"Frostholm witchcraft? How could Nathaniel have fallen victim to that? Who would do this to him?"

Harrison locked eyes with Nathaniel. "You already suspect someone, don't you?"

Nathaniel gave a slight nod. "You figured it out?"

A knowing smile curved Harrison's lips. "You deliberately asked Isabella to dinner, stood her up, and made sure she saw us together. You gave her hope only to crush it. She's your suspect, isn't she?"

Nathaniel arched a brow. Sharp as ever—Harrison had pieced it all together.

Between them, few words were needed. She understood him perfectly.

Without hesitation, Harrison retrieved a silver needle. "I'll ease the pain first."

Gently, she inserted the needle into his temple. "Better?"

Her soft hand lingered against his head. Nathaniel found himself drawn into her embrace, his face buried in the silk of her hair.

"With you here, the pain disappears."

Harrison hesitated. She knew the agony of the Heartchain Curse all too well. Her arms tightened around him. "You're such a fool."

"I know you waited at the courthouse all day for me. I'm sorry—truly," Nathaniel murmured.

Harrison smiled faintly. "You could have told me."

"The pain was sudden, unbearable. I was afraid you'd be dragged into danger. I couldn't risk it."

"I'm stronger than you think. No matter what happens, tell me immediately. Whatever comes, we face it together."

Nathaniel nodded. "Understood."

"Save the romance for later," Rosalind cut in impatiently. "Isabella's behind this, no question. But how would she have access to Frostholm witchcraft?"

Harrison and Nathaniel separated.

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line. "She must have an accomplice."

"Who?"

They exchanged a glance.

"We'll find out soon enough."
###Chapter 773

Rosalind's brow furrowed in confusion. "Where exactly are we headed?" Her voice carried a note of bewilderment.

Nathaniel and Harrison stood simultaneously, their movements synchronized.

Harrison's lips curved into a mysterious smile. "Just follow us. Everything will become clear soon enough."

Nathaniel's fingers intertwined with Harrison's as they moved toward the exit. Rosalind scrambled after them, her heels clicking against the marble floor. "Hold on! Don't leave me behind!"

Meanwhile, Isabella was racing toward Rosewood Manor - Eleanor's new residence since departing the Lancaster family estate. The luxurious property, gifted by Henry, occupied prime real estate in the exclusive Willow Heights neighborhood where property values were astronomical.

Isabella jabbed at the doorbell repeatedly, the incessant chime echoing through the grand foyer.

A flustered maid rushed to answer. "Coming! Goodness, such impatience... Ms. Lancaster!" Her expression shifted to deference upon recognizing the visitor.

Isabella brushed past without ceremony. "Where's Ms. Eleanor?" Her sharp gaze swept the empty living room. "Upstairs? I'll find her myself."

The maid intercepted her path nervously. "Ms. Eleanor is currently enjoying her afternoon beauty regimen - a jasmine milk bath followed by caviar facial. She's left strict instructions not to be disturbed."

Isabella's eyes flashed with irritation. "And? Since when do I need permission to visit?"

The maid lowered her eyes, at a loss for words.

Isabella's frustration mounted. Here she was, consumed by urgency, while Eleanor lounged upstairs pampering herself. Henry certainly provided Eleanor with every material comfort - this palatial estate, an army of servants, a life of leisure.

"I have urgent business with her," Isabella declared. "I'm going up!"

Without waiting for approval, she ascended the grand staircase, stopping before Eleanor's bedroom door. The anxious maids trailed behind, wringing their hands.

"Ms. Eleanor becomes quite cross when her treatments are interrupted," one ventured timidly. "Perhaps if you'd allow me to announce you first?"

"Absolutely not!" Isabella snapped. "This can't wait."

The injustice burned - she'd just been humiliated by Nathaniel, Harrison, and Rosalind, while Eleanor lived like royalty in this gilded cage. How amusing that Eleanor actually believed herself important simply because she resided in an expensive house.

Isabella's hand closed around the crystal doorknob. She pushed the door open decisively.

Inside, Eleanor had just emerged from her bath, clad in a silk chemise, meticulously massaging argan oil into her skin. At her age, such rigorous beauty rituals were essential - she couldn't risk losing Henry to younger women, especially not to that upstart Brittany.

The abrupt intrusion made Eleanor's head snap up, displeasure darkening her features. "Who dares... Isabella?!" Her gaze locked onto the figure in the doorway.

Isabella wasn't ready for outright confrontation yet. "Ms. Eleanor."

The maid trembled as she spoke. "My deepest apologies, Ms. Eleanor. Ms. Lancaster insisted it was urgent. I couldn't deter her."

Isabella stepped fully into the room. "We need to talk."

Eleanor draped a satin robe over her shoulders, regarding Isabella with icy detachment. "I'm in the middle of my treatments. Next time, you will wait for permission to enter. Consider this your only warning."

Isabella suppressed a bitter smile. All this pampering for Henry's benefit, yet she was about to lose Nathaniel.

She advanced another step. "That Heartchain Curse of yours - has it failed?"

Eleanor froze, confusion flickering across her face. "Explain yourself."

Isabella pressed forward. "I mean exactly what I said. You claimed once Nathaniel was cursed, he couldn't physically approach Harrison. Yet today I saw them together again. He shows no interest in me. Your precious curse doesn't work on Nathaniel!"
###Chapter 774
That couldn't be happening!

Eleanor would never question her dark arts. She'd used them successfully against Isabella before. How could her Heartbound Hex possibly fail on Nathaniel?

Eleanor gripped Isabella's shoulders. "You're mistaken. Once cast, the Heartbound Hex doesn't just vanish. Its power doesn't dissipate so easily."

Isabella shook her head violently. "But it did! Nathaniel was with Harrison again!"

Eleanor's mind whirled, searching for where she'd gone wrong. Then movement caught her eye.

The doorway framed five figures.

Nathaniel stood tall beside Harrison, with Rosalind hovering behind them.

But what froze Eleanor's blood was seeing Henry Lancaster and Isabella's biological mother standing there too.

The entire truth squad had arrived.

Eleanor's nails dug into her palms. She couldn't let this exposure happen.

Henry still didn't know about her Frostholm witchcraft.

She turned to Isabella with forced calm. "You seem unwell. Perhaps we should continue this discussion later?"

Her eyes flashed a warning, but Isabella—facing away from the door—missed both the look and their audience.

"Later?" Isabella shrieked, grabbing Eleanor's wrists. "We're settling this now! Why did your hex fail on Nathaniel?"

Eleanor's composure cracked. This foolish girl was unraveling everything!

"You're distraught over Mr. Lancaster," Eleanor said loudly. "But love can't be forced—"

"Don't play dumb!" Isabella shouted. "You hexed Nathaniel for me! The Heartbound Hex!"

"Enough!" Eleanor snapped. "I don't know what you're—"

"The hex you learned in Frostholm! Just like the curse you placed on Isabella that nearly killed her during—"

"Silence!" Eleanor's scream echoed off the walls.

Isabella recoiled at the venom in Eleanor's voice.

Then the door crashed open.

Henry Lancaster's voice cut through the room like winter wind. "Let. Her. Speak."

Isabella whirled around. The color drained from her face as she registered the gathered witnesses.

She stood frozen, a deer in hunting sights.

The reckoning had arrived.
###Chapter 775

Isabella whirled around to find Henry, Victoria, Nathaniel, Harrison, and Rosalind standing at the threshold. Her pupils contracted then dilated in shock, rooting her to the spot.

Her breath hitched. "How did you all—"

Nathaniel strode forward, his lips curling into an arctic smile. "We've been tracking you."

A maid scurried in, trembling. "Forgive me, Ms. Lancaster and Ms. Eleanor. Mr. Lancaster and Mr. Falcon arrived. I couldn't stop them."

This was Lancaster property after all. Every servant answered to Henry, the true master of the house.

Isabella's face contorted with rage as she glared at Nathaniel. "You set me up!"

Eleanor paled, astonished by Isabella's lack of subtlety. The trap had been obvious—Nathaniel had orchestrated everything to catch them in the act.

Harrison stepped forward, crimson lips twisting. "Still don't understand?"

Isabella's throat worked before realization dawned. "The Frostholm Binding...it was never broken!"

Nathaniel inclined his head. "Correct."

"You still feel agony with Harrison."

"Indeed."

"You suspected me from the start. That dinner invitation—false hope. Making me watch you with Harrison to drive me to despair, knowing I'd seek out the curse caster. And you brought my parents to witness our disgrace!"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Not entirely hopeless, I see."

Isabella stumbled backward, the truth crashing over her. She and Eleanor had woven the Frostholm Binding around Nathaniel, believing it would shackle him eternally.

Instead, he'd turned their dark magic against them.

Harrison's piercing gaze pinned Isabella as she spat, "You're monstrous. Using forbidden witchcraft to enslave someone's heart. Do you possess any humanity? Creatures like you are the stuff of nightmares."

Rosalind added venomously, "I knew you were manipulative, but this is pure evil!"

Isabella's mouth opened and closed soundlessly. Her last hope lay with Henry and Victoria. "Father! Mother!"

Henry's voice cracked like thunder. "Silence! We disown you!"

Isabella recoiled, turning desperately to Victoria.

Victoria's glacial stare froze her in place. "So you knew Eleanor cursed me years ago?"

Isabella shook her head wildly. "I didn't—"

Harrison cut in sharply, "Liar! We heard your confession! You betrayed your own mother to side with her poisoner!"

"Every damning word!" Rosalind hissed. "Stop lying!"

Now five pairs of merciless eyes—Henry, Victoria, Nathaniel, Harrison, Rosalind—bore into Isabella with identical condemnation.

Cornered, Isabella felt the abyss yawn beneath her feet.
###Chapter 776

Henry's piercing gaze locked onto Eleanor. "Don't you think you owe me an explanation for everything?"

Eleanor knew the game was up. There was no use pretending anymore.

She met his stare with icy composure. "What exactly would you like me to explain?"

Her detached tone only stoked Henry's fury. In two swift strides, he closed the distance between them, his fingers closing around her throat with bruising force.

Eleanor gasped for air as Henry loomed over her, his handsome features twisted with rage. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "That naive, kind-hearted girl you once knew? She died a long time ago."

Henry's eyes darkened to crimson, his entire body radiating a bone-chilling wrath. He looked positively terrifying.

"What are you talking about? Your father died because of my family. We took you in, raised you as one of our own. I treated you like a sister—wasn't that enough?"

"Enough?" Eleanor spat, her voice dripping with venom. "You gave me a mansion, yes, but that was never what I wanted. All I've ever wanted was you!"

Henry recoiled as if struck.

"We grew up together—childhood sweethearts. If it weren't for Isabella, I would have been your wife. I should have been Mrs. Lancaster!"

Her voice cracked with raw emotion. "But you married her instead. Do you have any idea how much that destroyed me? It hurt worse than dying! Watching you two together after the wedding—so close, so in love—it was unbearable. Why should Isabella take everything from me? She's nothing but a nuisance. If she were gone, you'd finally see me! I want her dead!"

The sheer intensity of her jealousy and hatred contorted Eleanor's delicate features into something monstrous. Henry took an involuntary step back. "Eleanor, you're unrecognizable. The girl I knew is gone."

"I changed because of Isabella! Because of you!"

Her gaze lingered on his face with disturbing reverence. Slowly, she reached out, her fingers trembling as they neared his cheek.

"Why can't you understand? I love you. More than she ever could."

Just before her fingertips could make contact, Henry jerked away with a look of disgust. With one forceful shove, he sent her sprawling to the floor.

Eleanor landed in an undignified heap, her carefully styled hair now a tangled mess.

Henry stared down at her, his expression colder than she'd ever seen.

"Let me make this clear. I never had feelings for you—not then, not now, not ever. My only regret is being blind to your true nature for so long. My family's debt to yours is paid in full. From this moment on, you mean nothing to me. If you ever lay a finger on my wife or anyone I care about again, I swear you'll regret it."

The venom in his voice sent a visible tremor through the room. The realization that he'd been sheltering the very person who'd tormented Isabella all these years made his blood boil.

Eleanor's face drained of color. In that moment, she knew—Henry would never be hers. Not in this lifetime.
###Chapter 777

Eleanor's eyes burned with venom as she stared at Isabella.
"Are you satisfied now? You stole Henry from me! You took my rightful place as Mrs. Lancaster! Everything you possess should have been mine!"

Isabella's lips curled into an icy smirk. "You've truly lost touch with reality. Obsessing over my husband, resorting to Frostholm witchcraft to harm me—you orchestrated your own downfall!"

Eleanor rose slowly, her movements deliberate. "What if I did? Your own daughter despises you. She chooses me over you!"

Her gaze shifted to the young girl. "Do you want Isabella as your mother?"

The moment of truth had arrived.

Without hesitation, the girl moved to Eleanor's side. "Never."

Isabella felt her world fracture. This child—her and Henry's flesh and blood—kept shattering her heart with every betrayal.

Years of separation haunted Isabella. She carried the guilt of failing as a mother, of losing precious time she could never reclaim.

Now, watching her daughter align with this scheming woman—

"Enough!" the girl snapped.

"Victoria!" Isabella's voice broke as she reached out.

Henry's strong arms encircled his trembling wife.

"You're my birth parents, yet you've never loved me properly. Ms. Eleanor has always been there for me. If anything happens to me now, it's your fault. Your neglect pushed me to this," Victoria declared coldly.

"Victoria!" Isabella's face drained of color.

Eleanor's satisfaction swelled at Isabella's devastation. This was precisely her goal—to make Isabella suffer through the ultimate betrayal.

"Who do you choose as your mother?" Eleanor pressed.

Victoria answered immediately. "You."

"Good girl," Eleanor purred victoriously. "Say it properly now."

Isabella tried desperately to intervene. "Victoria!"

Henry fixed their daughter with a grave look. "Think carefully. This choice has permanent consequences."

Yet Victoria met Eleanor's gaze steadily. "Mother."

That single word shattered Isabella completely. Her knees buckled.

Henry tightened his embrace, feeling her body tremble violently against him. He pressed his warmth into her icy skin, willing strength into her broken spirit.

Rosalind glared at Victoria. "How could you betray your own mother?"

"You disgust me!" Beatrice spat.

Victoria remained unmoved. In her mind, survival meant clinging to Eleanor. Every move had been calculated—she wouldn't surrender now.

Eleanor's triumphant laughter filled the room. "Isabella, you've lost your daughter. Karma is beautiful, isn't it?"

Rosalind turned her fury on Eleanor. "You orchestrated everything! Twenty years ago you targeted Ms. Lancaster. Now you're after Nathaniel. You're pure evil. How did you learn Frostholm witchcraft?"

Eleanor's smirk widened. "I met a Frostholm master years ago. She recognized my potential and taught me everything."

Rosalind's expression darkened. "Just as I suspected. Break the curse now!"
###Chapter 778

Nathaniel's hand sliced through the air in a sharp command.

Instantly, a dozen black-suited security operatives flooded the room, forming an impenetrable circle around Eleanor and Isabella.

Nathaniel's voice was steel wrapped in ice. "This ends now. Break the curse or face the consequences."

Henry Lancaster's piercing gaze locked onto Eleanor. "Your time has run out. Remove the curse immediately."

Eleanor merely smirked, her eyes flicking to Harrison. "Ah, the famous Dr. Sinclair. Surely you understand—if I die, Nathaniel's curse becomes permanent. So really, you should be begging for my survival."

Harrison's fingers curled into fists.

Rosalind Fairchild snarled, "Enough talk! Take her down!"

The operatives lunged forward.

Isabella stiffened, her breath hitching.

But Eleanor remained eerily calm. As hands reached for her, she whispered ancient words under her breath.

Nathaniel's knees buckled. A strangled cry tore from his throat as he collapsed, sweat drenching his shirt.

"Nat!" Harrison rushed to him, pressing trembling fingers to his pulse. His heartbeat was erratic, his skin clammy. The dark magic was spreading too fast—even she couldn't stop it.

Henry and Isabella dropped beside him, panic lacing their voices.

"Nat, stay with us!"

Nathaniel clawed at his temples, his voice raw. "It's like... knives... in my skull..."

"Hold on!" Harrison's silver needles flashed as she drove them into pressure points.

Nathaniel's body went limp.

She caught him, cradling his unconscious form. The needles would grant him temporary relief—but not a cure.

Henry's glare could have melted stone. "How dare you practice forbidden magic? Do you not fear the consequences?"

Eleanor's laugh was poison. "Now you see its power. Touch me again, and he dies screaming."

Harrison met Henry's eyes and gave a subtle shake of her head.

Henry raised a hand. "Stand down."

The operatives retreated.

Henry's voice was deadly quiet. "Name your price."

Eleanor's smile turned predatory. "Isabella is my daughter now. She loves Nathaniel. So here are my terms—he marries her in two weeks. Or he dies where he stands."

Rosalind exploded. "Over my dead body!"

Eleanor shrugged. "Your choice. But choose wisely." She turned to leave, Isabella trailing behind.

Isabella hesitated, glancing back at Henry.

Eleanor paused beside him, her voice dripping with triumph. "Oh, Henry... After all these years, you finally lost. And I? I get everything."

With that, she swept from the room, leaving silence and fury in her wake.
###Chapter 779

Isabella's voice cut through the air like shattered glass. "You'll regret this!"

Eleanor merely smirked, her laughter icy. "Come along, Arabella," she commanded, turning on her heel without a backward glance.

"Arabella!" Isabella cried out, her voice cracking with desperation.

Watching Arabella obediently follow Eleanor, Isabella clutched her chest, her face contorting in pain.

Henry Lancaster rushed forward, pulling her into his arms. His voice shook. "Isabella! Stay with me!"

Harrison stepped forward immediately. "Lay her down. I need to check her vitals."

Both Nathaniel and Isabella had collapsed—Nathaniel unconscious from the needle's venom, while Isabella struggled against the curse's resurgence.

As Harrison pressed his fingers to her wrist, Henry's expression darkened. "Is it the curse again?"

Eleanor's curse on Isabella differed from the Heartchain Curse affecting Nathaniel, leaving Harrison with treatment options.

Isabella's face was ghostly pale, but she managed a weak smile. "I'll be fine."

Henry gripped her hand tightly. "This is my fault. I never imagined Eleanor could become this monstrous. Keeping her close hurt you. All these years, I was blind to the truth. I let you suffer. Forgive me."

His apology was raw, stripped bare of pride.

For years, Isabella had harbored resentment toward Henry for defending Eleanor, allowing her cruelty to flourish. Yet, she understood he had been deceived.

Now, seeing him acknowledge the truth and beg for forgiveness, the bitterness inside her softened.

She gave him a teasing look. "Enough of the past. Just promise me—no more Eleanors."

Henry nodded solemnly. "You have my word."

A faint smile touched Isabella's lips.

Watching them reconcile, Harrison felt a rare warmth. "Mr. Lancaster, take this as a lesson. A woman's intuition is rarely wrong. If Lady Lancaster distrusts someone, trust her judgment. Never keep that person near."

Henry dipped his head. "Understood."

Then, steeling himself, he added, "Isabella's condition keeps worsening. Last time, you mentioned using my cardiogen to save her. Do it. Take it now."

Harrison arched a brow. "Are you certain? Removing your cardiogen means death."

Henry met his gaze unflinchingly. "I've prepared for this."

He pulled out a document and handed it to Isabella. "Read this."

Isabella accepted the papers—Henry's will.

He had left everything to her.

They say a man's wealth reveals his heart. Henry, whose fortune rivaled kingdoms, had entrusted it all to her.

Isabella blinked in disbelief. "You're giving me everything?"

Henry nodded. "You're my wife. All I have is yours. I considered leaving something to Arabella, but she's betrayed us too deeply. I won't risk her turning against you with my resources."

Tears glistened in Isabella's eyes. Henry had thought of everything—his love, unwavering through the years, was more precious than any fortune.

Harrison studied Henry with newfound respect. "You're truly ready."

Henry didn't hesitate. "Take it."
###Chapter 780

"Very well." Harrison swiftly drew a gleaming surgical scalpel from her medical kit. "I'll proceed immediately."

Nathaniel gave a composed nod. His breathing remained steady despite the gravity of the situation. "Do what you must."

His eyelids fluttered shut.

Harrison positioned the instrument with precision, its sterile point hovering centimeters from Nathaniel's chest.

"Wait!"

Isabella launched herself from the hospital bed with surprising agility. She threw her body between them, wrapping protective arms around Nathaniel's torso.

Nathaniel's dark eyes blinked open, focusing on Isabella's distraught face. "What troubles you, my love?"

Tears streaked down Isabella's cheeks as she shook her head violently. "I can't let you sacrifice yourself!"

Nathaniel traced a thumb along her jawline. "There's no price too high for your survival."

Her entire frame trembled. "Why show me such devotion? Our union began as a political alliance between the Lancasters and Blackwoods. I always believed... you felt nothing for me."

Nathaniel cradled her face between his palms. "True, our marriage started as a business arrangement. When we exchanged vows, I viewed you as just another social obligation."

As heir to the Lancaster empire, matrimony had always been a strategic maneuver rather than a romantic pursuit. Any suitable bride would have sufficed.

Isabella's shoulders slumped, the familiar ache of unrequited love settling in her chest. This painful truth she'd carried for years.

She began to withdraw from his embrace.

But Nathaniel continued, his baritone voice wrapping around her like velvet.

"At first, you meant nothing to me because we were strangers. But year after year, you carved yourself into my very being. Your relentless pursuit, your stubborn refusal to leave my side - you broke through every defense I erected. Before I realized it, you'd become my every thought, my every desire. Isabella... I've been yours for longer than you know."

Isabella's breath hitched. He loved her?

Nathaniel's gaze softened as decades of concealed emotion surfaced.

"During those endless years of your disappearance, do you have any idea how I suffered? I scoured continents searching for you and our child. Countless nights I lay awake imagining our reunion. And now I must ask... how could you be so cruel as to take our daughter and vanish? The emptiness you left nearly destroyed me."

The typically reserved billionaire had never bared his soul to any woman. Now his carefully constructed walls lay in ruins, revealing years of silent torment.

His heart had belonged to Isabella for longer than either could remember.

Tears blurred Isabella's vision before spilling over in torrents. All her resentment, all her bitterness toward Nathaniel stemmed from one terrible misconception - that he'd never cared.

She'd envied Eleanor. Coveted the affection Nathaniel supposedly showed her.

Now the devastating truth crashed over her - he'd loved her all along.

Nathaniel tenderly brushed away her tears. "Hush now, my heart."

Isabella rose on her toes, twining her arms about his neck, and pressed her lips to his in a kiss that held years of pent-up emotion.

Nathaniel stiffened momentarily in surprise.

She smiled through her tears. "And I love you, my impossible man."

His expression transformed.

Isabella's tear-streaked face glowed with joy as she confessed,

"As the Blackwood heiress, I was raised knowing I'd marry for advantage. But my parents always promised I could choose my groom. The moment I saw your photograph, I knew. I declared to my family I would wed no one but Nathaniel Lancaster. That's how our 'arranged' marriage truly came to be. Our first meeting? That scarlet gown wasn't accidental. I meant to captivate you, to make you love me as desperately as I loved you from that very first glimpse."
###Chapter 781

Isabella gazed up at Henry, her emerald eyes shimmering with unspoken devotion. "I love you."

Henry didn't hesitate. His arms encircled her waist, pulling her against his chest with a force that threatened to merge their heartbeats.

She loved him too.

The realization sent electric waves through his veins. His voice was rough with disbelief. "Say it again. Please."

Tears spilled down Isabella's cheeks as she clung to him. "I love you, Henry Lancaster! I loved you yesterday, I love you today, and I'll love you until the stars burn out!"

Her lips found his in a kiss that tasted of salt and promises.

Henry responded with equal fervor, pouring years of longing into the embrace. His fingers tangled in her hair as if anchoring himself to this moment.

Nearby, Harrison let out a delighted laugh, clapping her hands. "About time!"

When they finally parted, breathless, both turned to Harrison with matching expressions of gratitude. "We owe you everything," Henry said hoarsely.

Harrison waved a dismissive hand, her silver-blonde hair catching the light. "Don't exaggerate. I merely removed obstacles."

Isabella stepped forward, taking Harrison's hands. "You exposed Eleanor's lies. You brought us back together. That's not 'nothing'."

A warmth spread through Harrison's chest. She'd grown fond of Isabella—so different from that scheming Isabella. If only...

Henry's voice broke her reverie. "Now, about that curse?"

"Ah yes." Harrison's demeanor shifted to professional focus. "Let's begin the treatment."

Henry immediately offered, "Take my cardiogen. Whatever you need—"

Harrison chuckled. "Relax. I never actually needed it."

Both froze. "What?"

"It was a test," Harrison admitted with a sly smile. "To see if you'd truly sacrifice for her. You passed spectacularly."

Isabella swatted Henry's arm playfully as comprehension dawned.

Henry exhaled sharply. "So you can cure her?"

"Easily." Harrison gestured to the bed. "Ms. Lancaster, if you'll lie down?"

The treatment commenced with Harrison's signature silver needles glinting under the lights. Two painstaking hours later, the sickly pallor had vanished from Isabella's complexion, replaced by rosy vitality.

As Harrison withdrew the final needle, Henry surged forward. "Is she—?"

"Completely healed," Harrison confirmed, wiping her brow.

Henry crushed Isabella in another embrace while she murmured thanks through happy tears.

Harrison smiled tiredly. "Don't mention it. Healing is my—"

Her vision blurred. The room tilted.

"Harrison!"

Strong arms—Henry's—caught her as her knees buckled. Isabella's panicked voice sounded distant. "Get her to the bed! Now!"

The attending physician rushed in, checking Harrison's pulse. "Overexertion," he diagnosed. "Her energy reserves are depleted. She just needs rest."

###Chapter 782

Henry and Isabella finally exhaled in relief. "Thank you, doctor."

As the physician departed, the couple remained seated beside the bed, watching over Harrison who had collapsed from sheer exhaustion.

Isabella reached out, her fingers brushing lightly against Harrison's porcelain cheek. "She spent two full hours administering my acupuncture treatment. She pushed herself beyond limits for a stranger. We've only just met, yet she's shown me such kindness. How can I ever repay this debt?"

Henry squeezed his wife's shoulder. "She'll recover."

"There's something inexplicable," Isabella murmured, her gaze lingering on Harrison's peaceful face. "I feel this... profound connection to her. As if I want to keep her close forever."

Henry nodded silently. The sentiment resonated deeply within him too.

Isabella's thoughts drifted to Eleanor. "Our daughter is completely under that woman's control now. Watching Eleanor become a pawn in her schemes... it shatters my heart. Why couldn't she be more like Harrison?"

Truthfully, Henry had recognized Eleanor's manipulative nature long before Isabella. But as parents, they'd clung to hope. This time, however, Eleanor had crossed an unforgivable line by aligning with their enemy.

He pulled Isabella closer, feeling her tremble. "We'll get through this."

Isabella studied Harrison's sleeping form with sudden determination. "Let's adopt her."

Henry blinked. "Adopt?"

"Yes. I want her as our goddaughter. She's parentless, isn't she? We could give her the family she deserves."

Before Henry could respond, Harrison's long lashes fluttered open, revealing those striking emerald eyes.

Isabella immediately brightened. "You're awake!"

Harrison sat up gingerly. "Did I faint?"

"You gave us quite the scare," Isabella chided gently.

A tired smile touched Harrison's lips. "Just temporary exhaustion. I know my limits."

Internally, Harrison steeled herself. Brittany's treatment was complete, but Nathaniel still needed her. Every second counted.

Isabella clasped Harrison's slender hands. "We have... an unusual request. You're free to decline."

Harrison tilted her head. "Please, speak freely."

After a hesitant pause, Isabella asked softly, "Is it true you have no living parents?"

A shadow crossed Harrison's normally composed features. "Yes. My father passed when I was young. I never knew my mother."

The raw vulnerability in those words made Henry's chest tighten. For all her strength, in this moment Harrison seemed heartbreakingly young.

Isabella leaned forward urgently. "Would you allow us to be your parents?"

Harrison froze. "I... don't understand."

"We want you as our goddaughter," Henry clarified, his deep voice unusually tender.

Harrison's eyes widened—this was the last thing she'd anticipated from the powerful Lancasters.

"Do you dislike the idea?" Isabella pressed. "We've grown terribly fond of you. You'd want for nothing as our daughter."

The offer hung between them, charged with unspoken emotions. Harrison's medical training had taught her to analyze situations clinically, but this defied logic—why would these strangers offer her such a priceless gift?

Yet when she met Isabella's hopeful gaze, Harrison felt something unfamiliar stir in her chest. A longing she'd buried long ago.


###Chapter 783

Harrison's heart swelled with emotion. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined Henry Lancaster and Isabella Lancaster offering to adopt her as their goddaughter.

The truth was, she'd grown deeply fond of them. Watching how they doted on Arabella always stirred a quiet longing in her chest. The absence of loving parents had left an eternal void within her.

Now, they were offering to fill that emptiness.

Tears shimmered in Harrison's pale eyes like morning dew. "I'd be honored! I want nothing more than to be your daughter!"

Henry and Isabella exchanged a glance, their faces alight with pure joy.

Isabella pulled Harrison into a warm embrace that smelled of lavender and comfort. "Our family is complete now. Welcome home, darling."

Harrison nodded eagerly, her voice thick with emotion. "I wasn't silent earlier because I hesitated. I just... couldn't believe this was real. I'm so incredibly happy!"

Henry chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Harrison, you can't keep calling us Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster anymore. That won't do at all."

Isabella stroked Harrison's hair gently. "Yes, sweetheart. From now on, we're Mom and Dad to you."

Harrison looked between them, tears spilling freely down her cheeks like liquid diamonds. "Mom... Dad..."

"Our precious girl!"

The three of them shared a quiet moment of laughter, the sound wrapping around them like a cozy blanket.

Henry clapped his hands together, his voice brimming with excitement. "Now that you're officially our daughter, we must celebrate properly. I'll arrange a grand ball at Lancaster Manor!"

Isabella nodded enthusiastically. "We'll invite all of high society! The world should know our beautiful daughter."

Harrison hesitated. Lavish parties weren't really her scene. "I'm not sure..."

"Nonsense!" Henry declared. "This isn't up for discussion. We've made our decision."

Seeing their determined expressions, Harrison finally acquiesced. "Alright."

Then she remembered Nathaniel. "What about Nathaniel?"

Henry's expression darkened. "Still unconscious, I'm afraid. Only Eleanor can break the Shadowheart Curse binding him."

The Shadowheart Curse proved far more stubborn than anyone anticipated.

Harrison threw back the covers and rose from the bed. "I need to see him."

She entered the adjacent room where Nathaniel lay motionless, his normally vibrant features pale as moonlight.

Harrison reached out, her fingers trembling as they brushed his cheek—

Suddenly, Nathaniel stirred, his dark lashes fluttering open.

Harrison's face lit up like the dawn. "You're awake."

Nathaniel sat up slowly, rubbing his temples. "How long was I out?"

"Hours," Harrison breathed. "I was terrified."

Nathaniel studied her youthful face before pinching her cheek playfully. "So you do care? Not planning to abandon me with Charlotte again, are you?"

Harrison wrapped her arms around Nathaniel's waist, pressing her ear against his chest. The steady rhythm of his heartbeat grounded her.

She nuzzled against him softly. "I just want you safe."

In this moment, she was all softness and warmth—a stark contrast to her usual fiery self—and it unraveled Nathaniel completely. He pulled her closer. "Silly girl, I'm fine now. Stop worrying."

Harrison tilted her face up, her luminous eyes searching his.

Nathaniel was powerless against that gaze. He leaned down, drawn like a moth to flame—

A sharp pain lanced through his skull. He clutched his head with a grimace.

Harrison's expression shifted to alarm. "Is the curse reacting again?"

Nathaniel tried to wave it off. "It's nothing..."

Harrison stood abruptly. "Every time I'm near you, the pain returns. I should go—you'll recover faster without me here."

Before he could protest, she turned toward the door, her heart breaking with every step.
###Chapter 784

Harrison's heart ached for Nathaniel, longing to remain at his bedside. Yet she understood the cruel necessity of departure. Her presence would only intensify his suffering.

Without a backward glance, she turned to leave.

"Stay!"

Nathaniel flung aside the blankets, his muscular frame surging forward. His arms encircled her waist in a desperate embrace from behind.

He buried his chiseled face in her cascading chestnut hair, his voice raw with emotion. "Don't walk away. Please...I can't lose you."

Harrison trembled, his anguish mirroring her own. "You must release me. The curse worsens with every moment we're together."

His grip only tightened. "The pain means nothing. Only your absence would destroy me."

Without warning, a violent spasm wracked his body. His vision darkened as his powerful legs gave way. Harrison barely caught his collapsing form. "Nathaniel!"

When consciousness returned, moonlight streamed through the windows. Henry and Isabella stood vigil beside his bed.

"Welcome back," Isabella murmured, helping him sit upright.

Nathaniel's gaze darted across the room. "Where's Harrison? Has she gone?"

Henry exchanged a glance with his wife. "She's..."

"Tell me she hasn't left with Charlotte!" Nathaniel threw off the covers, his bare feet hitting the floor.

Isabella blocked his path. "She's right next door. The Heartchain Curse prevents physical contact."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze searched their faces. "Swear this isn't a lie."

"On our lives," Henry vowed. The guilt weighed heavily—this curse was Eleanor and Isabella's doing, and they bore responsibility.

But Nathaniel wasn't satisfied. "I need to see her!"

"Your body can't—"

Meanwhile, Harrison sat in the adjacent chamber. After administering acupuncture, she'd withdrawn, though every fiber of her being yearned to return.

Had the treatment eased his suffering?
Was he resting comfortably?
Did the pain still grip him?

Her thoughts shattered at the commotion outside.

"Nathaniel, you must conserve your strength!" Henry's voice carried through the walls.

"I don't care! Take me to Harrison!"

Her pulse skyrocketed at his voice. Then—three soft knocks.

"Harrison?" His voice, rough yet tender, seeped through the door. "Are you there?"

Her hand flew to the knob, fingers trembling. One turn would reunite them.

But the curse's poison would flow stronger with each shared breath.

She recoiled as if burned. "I'm here."

Separated by mere inches of wood, their souls reached for each other.

Hearing her voice, Nathaniel's frantic heartbeat steadied. A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "When I woke alone...I feared you'd taken Charlotte and vanished from my life forever."
###Chapter 785

Harrison's lips curved into a tender smile. "I haven't gone anywhere."

Nathaniel's voice trembled with barely concealed fear. "But will you? When I can't see you, I'm terrified you'll take Charlotte and disappear from my life again."

Silence stretched between them.

Nathaniel pressed forward, his voice breaking with raw emotion. "I know you're trying to protect me from the Heartchain Curse. But losing you and Charlotte would hurt far worse than any curse. Whatever comes our way, we'll face it together. Please don't push me away. Don't leave me again. We've already wasted three years—I can't bear to lose you both for another three, or longer."

Touched by his words, Harrison raised her hand, pressing it against the cool wood of the door. She ached to see him, but for his safety, this barrier had to remain between them.

Her lips curved gently. "I promise I won't leave you."

No matter how impossible the odds seemed, as long as they stood united, she believed they could overcome anything.

A faint smile tugged at Nathaniel's lips. "That's all I needed to hear."

Outside, Henry and Isabella watched the exchange with quiet warmth.

Henry stepped forward. "We share responsibility for this curse. Harrison is our goddaughter now. You have our full support."

Nathaniel blinked in surprise. "Wait—Harrison is your...?"

Isabella chuckled. "We adore her, so we made it official. We're even throwing a grand celebration to announce it. From now on, we'll look after her as our own."

Nathaniel's chest swelled with gratitude. Knowing Harrison had two more people who cherished her filled him with quiet joy.

Henry clapped Nathaniel on the shoulder. "Never thought after all these years, you'd still wind up as my son-in-law."

Then Henry's expression turned mischievous. "Though if I recall, you once swore you'd never marry a Lancaster—"

"Enough!" Nathaniel cut him off, realizing how thoroughly he'd trapped himself. "I'm honored to be your son-in-law."

The words slipped out before he could stop them.

Inside the room, Harrison stifled a quiet laugh. If not for the curse, they would have been married by now.

Henry grinned. "Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll only earn that title once you've officially made Harrison your wife."

Isabella nodded in agreement. "Harrison calls the shots here. You'll have to win her over first."

The lighthearted moment shattered as Nathaniel suddenly paled. A sharp, familiar pain lanced through his skull.

"Nathaniel!" Henry caught him before he could stumble.

Inside, Harrison sensed his distress instantly. "Nathaniel, what's wrong?" she called anxiously.

He steadied himself. "It's nothing."

Harrison's voice turned firm. "You can't keep enduring this. We need to take control of the situation."

Henry frowned. "Do you have a plan?"

Isabella smiled knowingly. "You've always been resourceful. I'm sure you've thought of something."

Harrison exhaled slowly. "I do."

Nathaniel leaned closer to the door. "Tell me."

She hesitated, then asked softly, "Will you trust me?"

"Always."

Harrison drew a steadying breath. "Then you need to marry Isabella."

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 786
What?!

Outside the door, Nathaniel, Henry, and Isabella froze simultaneously.

Harrison and Eleanor had departed. Though Eleanor's Frostholm witchcraft had been exposed, they hadn't lost the battle.

Isabella's eyes glittered with excitement. "Do you truly believe Nathaniel will marry me?"

Eleanor sipped her tea calmly. "Without question. Prepare your bridal gown. Only I can undo the Heartchain Curse within him."

Isabella linked arms with Eleanor. "You're the only one who genuinely cares for me."

Eleanor smiled. "Now that you're my daughter, naturally I'll look after you."

"Thank you, Mother!" Isabella cooed.

In Isabella's world, anyone useful or kind earned the title of "Mother."

A maid rushed in breathlessly. "A delivery has arrived."

Eleanor arched a brow. "What is it?"

The maid produced a gilded invitation. "An invitation, madam."

Eleanor took it. "To what occasion?"

As she unfolded the gold-embossed card, Isabella peered over her shoulder. Both women's expressions darkened instantly.

The maid trembled. "Rumors say Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster have adopted Ms. Harrison as their goddaughter. The Lancasters are hosting a grand celebration, inviting all Metropolia's elite families. This invitation... requests your attendance."

What?

Isabella shot up, fury contorting her features. "How dare they?! They actually made Harrison their goddaughter?"

Eleanor's face turned icy. She'd believed victory was hers when Isabella called her "Mother," but Henry and Isabella had moved shockingly fast to claim Harrison.

The truth remained—Harrison was Henry and Isabella's biological daughter.

Eleanor locked eyes with Isabella.

"I've long suspected Henry and Isabella favored Harrison. Even believing you're their child, their affections have shifted. Now with this adoption... if the truth surfaces, you'll become worthless to them!"

Isabella's stomach plummeted.

Despite her elaborate schemes to pose as the Lancasters' daughter, despite blocking Harrison at every turn—Harrison had waltzed straight into the family.

If Harrison's true identity emerged, Isabella would lose everything.

She collapsed onto the sofa. "Impossible! The DNA test confirmed it. They won't suspect a thing."

Eleanor nodded grimly. "Then we must act swiftly. We'll attend this farce of a celebration."

Isabella's lips curled. "Even as their goddaughter, Harrison won't keep Nathaniel. This round is still ours to win!"

Their matching wicked smiles spoke volumes.

On the event night, Lancaster Manor blazed with light. Metropolia's crème de la crème arrived—billionaires, power brokers, influencers. Tonight's gala was the ultimate battlefield of prestige and influence.
###Chapter 787

Harrison sat in serene silence within the lavish dressing room. The makeup artist carefully swept brushes across her porcelain skin, each stroke enhancing her ethereal beauty. Her complexion glowed with natural radiance that no cosmetic could truly improve.

Victoria entered with little Charlotte, whose face lit up as she dashed toward her mother. "Mama! You're the prettiest lady in the whole world! Well...you always are, but today you're extra special pretty!"

Charlotte's adorable compliment melted Harrison's heart. She leaned down to press a kiss against her daughter's flushed cheek. "I've been counting the minutes until I could see you, my darling."

Victoria approached with a warm expression. "Congratulations, my dear."

Harrison returned the smile gratefully. "These past weeks have been so hectic. Thank you for watching over Charlotte."

Victoria's eyes shone with grandmotherly affection as she gazed at the child. "This precious girl carries the Falcon bloodline. Caring for her isn't duty - it's my greatest joy."

Charlotte giggled with delight.

"Who could have imagined Henry and Isabella would officially welcome you as their goddaughter?" Victoria continued. "The bond between our families grows stronger than ever. My heart overflows with happiness for you."

The sincerity in Victoria's voice filled Harrison with warmth. She offered a soft,

Meanwhile, in the grand ballroom glittering with crystal chandeliers, Henry and Isabella stood together in perfect harmony. Henry looked dashing in his bespoke midnight suit, exuding quiet authority. Isabella dazzled in a flowing silver gown that accentuated her timeless elegance. They made a striking pair.

Several executives clustered around them, offering congratulations. "Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster, what an honor to gain such an accomplished goddaughter."

"We've heard remarkable things about Ms. Whitmore. She's fortunate to have your patronage."

Isabella's lips curved knowingly. "Harrison is family now. Anyone who disrespects her answers to us."

"Naturally! We consider ourselves privileged to know her."

"Perhaps she might join us for cocktails when her schedule permits."

The lavish celebration clearly demonstrated the Lancasters' esteem for their new goddaughter. In this world of power and privilege, everyone sought to align themselves with Harrison's rising star.

Rosalind arrived with impeccable timing. As Harrison's closest confidante, she wouldn't have missed this milestone for anything.

She brought Lillian along. Three years had transformed the girl into a stunning young woman, her striking features and cool demeanor turning heads. The Sinclair genes were undeniable - her brother Everett was campus royalty, and Lillian reigned as the university's undisputed beauty.

Rosalind smiled. "Lillian, it's been ages since you've seen Harrison, hasn't it?"

Lillian nodded. "Far too long."

"She talks about you constantly. We'll make sure you two have proper time to reconnect."

"I'd like that."

A sudden murmur rippled through the crowd. Someone whispered, "Look - Ms. Lancaster has arrived!"

Isabella made her entrance with Eleanor at her side.

Though Harrison was tonight's honored guest, Isabella commanded equal attention as the Lancaster heiress. With Harrison's new status, the unspoken tension between these two powerful women electrified the room.

This gala was, in truth, a stage for their quiet rivalry.

All eyes turned as Isabella appeared.

She wore a sleek crimson gown that hugged her curves perfectly. Her glossy chestnut waves cascaded over bare shoulders, drawing every gaze.

Eleanor looked equally refined in an emerald gown that complemented her graceful bearing.

Together, they made a breathtaking entrance.

One executive near Henry nodded knowingly. "Ah, Ms. Lancaster graces us with her presence."
###Chapter 788

Henry and Isabella Lancaster moved forward, their faces etched with disappointment toward their daughter—as though she had failed to meet their lofty expectations once again.

"Good evening, Isabella."

Isabella shot them a venomous glare, her irritation palpable. "Don't speak to me!"

The room fell into stunned silence.

Rosalind Fairchild smoothly intervened. "Ms. Lancaster, this is meant to be a joyous occasion. Perhaps you could try to control your temper."

Isabella scoffed loudly.

"Joyous? You mean the day my parents officially adopt Harrison as their goddaughter? Now I have to compete for their affection too?"

Her piercing gaze locked onto Henry and Isabella's faces.

"Do I even matter to you anymore? Where do I stand now that Harrison has taken my place?"

Murmurs rippled through the gathered executives nearby.

"What's happening? Is Ms. Lancaster upset about the adoption?"

"Clearly she came here to make trouble."

"This isn't a celebration for her—she's already causing a scene."

Isabella had no intention of playing nice. When Henry and Isabella handed her the embossed invitation, she accepted it—but her purpose was unmistakably disruptive.

Eleanor observed Isabella's outburst with hidden satisfaction and feigned concern. "Perhaps you should let this go. They're entitled to choose their own goddaughter."

"Let it go? I'm their blood daughter, the rightful heiress! Mother, Father, I refuse to accept this adoption today. I forbid it!"

Isabella's rejection rang out sharply across the ballroom.

A collective gasp swept through the crowd.

Henry's brow furrowed deeply. "The decision is final. This wasn't up for discussion."

Isabella Lancaster added coldly, "Your objections change nothing. Honestly, you could learn from Harrison. Look at all the damage you've caused recently!"

Isabella's expression darkened. "I said no, yet you're proceeding anyway?"

"Indeed," Henry and Isabella responded simultaneously, "Harrison is our daughter now."

Isabella's fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms. Her own parents were publicly humiliating her—making her feel like an outsider in her own family.

Rosalind smirked. "Kindness attracts admirers, while cruelty repels them. Instead of making a spectacle, perhaps you should focus on self-improvement. Learn what it means to be a proper daughter and decent human being."

Isabella detested Rosalind. That sharp tongue reminded her too much of Harrison.

She turned back to her parents with blazing eyes. "You'll choose today."

"What choice?"

Isabella raised her voice defiantly. "I loathe Harrison! I've made my position clear—I won't tolerate her as your goddaughter. Now choose: me or her? Will you keep your real daughter or replace me with her?"

Henry and Isabella's faces turned stormy.

Isabella pressed ruthlessly, "If you pick Harrison, you lose me forever! The choice is yours."

Now Isabella had forced her parents into an impossible decision.

The whispers intensified around them.

"Who expected Ms. Lancaster to disrupt the gala like this?"

"A direct ultimatum between blood and chosen daughter—how will the Lancasters decide?"
###Chapter 789

Eleanor feigned concern with practiced ease.

"Henry, Harrison is just an outsider, while Isabella is your one true daughter. You must consider this carefully. Don't break Isabella's heart for someone who doesn't belong—or you'll lose your real child."

Rosalind's patience snapped. "After everything you've done, you still refuse to show remorse? Instead, you corner others. Have you no shame?"

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smirk. "No matter what I've done, I am the Lancaster heiress. That will never change."

Rosalind was rendered speechless. "You—"

Victoria caught Rosalind's gaze and shook her head subtly. "Let it go."

With a frustrated huff, Rosalind crossed her arms.

Isabella turned back to her parents, her voice sharp. "Well? Have you decided? Who will it be—Harrison or me?"

A murmur rippled through the crowd. "Look, Ms. Harrison is coming down."

All eyes lifted toward the grand staircase, where the evening's true star descended.

Tonight, Harrison wore an ethereal white satin gown that draped flawlessly over her figure, accentuating her delicate collarbones. Her hair was elegantly swept up, revealing the graceful curve of her neck. She moved with effortless poise, as if floating on air.

Gasps of admiration followed her.

"Goodness, she's breathtaking!"

"Like a goddess untouched by the world."

"No wonder the Lancasters adore her. Beauty, grace, talent—she has it all."

"Compared to her, Ms. Lancaster seems... ordinary."

The whispers stung Isabella like a thousand needles. Once, she had been the undisputed jewel of high society. But Harrison's arrival had eclipsed her entirely, reducing her from a radiant rose to a mere shadow.

She couldn't accept it.

She despised Harrison.

Rosalind beamed. "Here she is!"

Harrison glided down the steps, the chandelier's glow casting a soft halo around her.

Henry and Victoria moved to her side.

"You look absolutely divine tonight," Victoria murmured.

Henry nodded approvingly. "Like royalty."

Harrison's natural beauty needed little enhancement—just a touch of makeup to highlight her luminous features.

She smiled warmly. "Thank you, Mom and Dad."

She had already begun calling them by those names.

Isabella's fists clenched. "Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?"

Harrison met her gaze, her clear eyes unflinching. "Ms. Lancaster, Ms. Eleanor, welcome."

Eleanor's smile was saccharine. "I knew you were special from the moment we met. And now, here you are—climbing your way into the Lancasters' favor."

The barb was obvious, but Harrison remained unshaken.

She arched a delicate brow. "If climbing is a skill, then you must be the master—after all, you've clung to this family for over twenty years."
###Chapter 790

Eleanor's smile froze instantly. "What did you just say?!"

Rosalind stepped forward with unwavering confidence. "With Harrison's exceptional talent and capabilities, she doesn't need to rely on anyone's name. The Lancaster family merely complements her already remarkable achievements."

Eleanor's expression darkened.

Henry spoke with firm conviction. "Harrison is now a Lancaster. Anyone who dares disrespect her will be removed from this estate immediately."

His words carried clear warning, showing no regard for their shared history.

Eleanor's fists clenched at her sides as she shot Isabella a meaningful glance.

Isabella moved toward her parents without hesitation. "It's time you made your decision."

Harrison asked calmly, "Decision? What decision?"

Isabella smirked triumphantly. "Haven't you heard? I demanded our parents choose between you and me—their real daughter."

Harrison nodded slowly. "I understand now."

Isabella's voice turned razor-sharp. "I know you've helped our parents, and they took you in out of gratitude. But blood runs thicker than water. Surely you won't make them abandon their own flesh and blood?"

Harrison looked at Henry and Isabella. Though she genuinely cared for them, she recognized the unbreakable bond between parents and their biological child.

She wouldn't force them into an impossible position.

With a gentle smile, Harrison said, "Mother, Father, I understand Isabella is your only daughter. We can cancel tonight's ceremony. It won't change how I feel about you."

Harrison's selflessness irritated Rosalind deeply. She grabbed Harrison's arm and hissed, "Why are you yielding to Isabella? She's done nothing but cause chaos while hiding behind the Lancaster name! If this continues, there's no limit to what she'll do."

Harrison gave Rosalind a reassuring glance before turning back to Henry and Isabella. "Mother, Father, I—"

Henry interrupted firmly. "No need to explain. We've already made our choice."

Isabella and Henry exchanged a meaningful look. "Yes, our decision is final."

Isabella's eyes sparkled with anticipation. "Well? Who have you chosen?"

At that moment, the head butler approached. "Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster, the Celestial Diadem has arrived."

The Celestial Diadem was an exquisite masterpiece crafted from rare diamonds and precious gems, its value beyond measure—a coronet worthy of royalty.

Henry nodded. "Present it."

A security guard in black appeared, carrying an ornate velvet case containing the legendary diadem.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Under the dazzling chandeliers, the diadem's brilliance was breathtaking, its radiance commanding absolute attention.

"The Celestial Diadem is magnificent!"

"This is the crown Mr. Lancaster acquired at the royal auction specifically for the Lancaster heiress. Tonight it will grace its rightful owner."

"But now there are two heiresses—Ms. Whitmore and Ms. Lancaster. Who will wear the diadem?"

The guard presented the open case before Henry and Isabella.

Isabella's eyes gleamed with certainty. As the biological Lancaster heir, the diadem undoubtedly belonged to her.

Harrison could never compete with her rightful claim!
###Chapter 791

Isabella's gaze locked onto Henry and Victoria Lancaster with uncontainable excitement. "I absolutely adore the Celestial Diadem. Put it on me now."

Her fingers trembled with anticipation as she practically vibrated on the spot.

Victoria lifted the glittering heirloom with reverence. "Tonight, we will personally crown the true heir of the Lancaster family."

Isabella's impatience spilled over. "Hurry up! What are you waiting for?"

She could barely stand still as Victoria approached.

The murmurs in the grand hall grew louder. "Lady Lancaster is about to bestow the Celestial Diadem upon Miss Isabella!"

"Naturally. Blood always comes first."

"An adopted daughter could never compare to their real child."

Preening like royalty, Isabella tilted her head forward expectantly.

But Victoria didn't move.

"Isabella," Victoria said carefully, "this diadem isn't meant for you."

A deafening silence fell.

Isabella's head snapped up. "What did you say? If not me, then who?"

Victoria's gaze never wavered. "This belongs to Harrison."

The blood drained from Isabella's face. "You can't be serious—"

"Isabella," Henry's deep voice cut through the tension, "we've tolerated your behavior long enough. You forced us to choose. Our decision is made."

A cold dread slithered down Isabella's spine. "Who did you pick?"

Victoria answered without hesitation. "We choose Harrison."

Gasps rippled through the elite crowd like wildfire.

Isabella's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms. "I'm your flesh and blood! And you're choosing some charity case over me?"

"Harrison is our daughter in every way that matters," Henry stated firmly.

Without another glance, Victoria turned toward Harrison. "The ceremony will proceed—unless you no longer wish to be part of this family."

Harrison's breath caught. When forced to choose, she'd braced for rejection. After all, how could she possibly compete with their biological daughter?

Yet they'd chosen her.

The weight of that unconditional acceptance brought tears to her eyes. "I would be honored to remain your daughter."

Henry's stern expression softened. "This diadem was always meant for you."

Victoria lifted the masterpiece of platinum and diamonds, settling it gently upon Harrison's upswept hair.

Tonight, Harrison's raven locks were elegantly coiled, framing her delicate features. Now crowned with the legendary Celestial Diadem, she glowed with an ethereal radiance that commanded the room.

Henry and Victoria flanked their chosen heir, their voices ringing with finality:

"From this moment forward, Harrison Lancaster stands as our sole heir. Any opposition to her will be considered opposition to the entire Lancaster dynasty!"

The announcement sent shockwaves through high society. "The Lancasters actually disinherited their own daughter!"

"Harrison must have them completely enchanted."

Victoria turned her steely gaze across the stunned assembly. "Are we understood?"

A chorus of obedient replies echoed through the marble hall: "Yes, Lady Lancaster!"
###Chapter 792

Isabella felt the sting of public humiliation as if Henry Lancaster and her own mother had physically struck her.

The ballroom buzzed with whispers as dozens of eyes locked onto her. Some guests hid smirks behind champagne flutes, others openly sneered, while a few offered pitying glances she didn't want. The air thickened with judgment.

Once, she'd basked in the golden glow of being the Lancaster heiress. Now that crown lay shattered at her feet.

How had everything unraveled so completely?

Bitter resentment coiled in her chest like a venomous snake.

"Mr. Falcon's arrived!" someone announced.

Nathaniel had come.

Isabella lifted her chin to see the crowd parting like the Red Sea. His imposing figure emerged through the gap, commanding attention without effort.

Dressed in a bespoke midnight suit that hugged his broad shoulders, Nathaniel moved with the predatory grace of a panther. Every step radiated power and privilege.

Isabella's breath caught. This was the man she loved, the only one worthy of her.

Eleanor whispered urgently, "This isn't over. Nathaniel is our ace. If you can't be a Lancaster, you'll still be Mrs. Falcon."

A slow smile curved Isabella's lips. Of course. Marriage would secure her position just as well.

As Nathaniel approached, Henry and her mother greeted him warmly. "Nathaniel, glad you could make it."

He nodded curtly, then his gaze found Harrison. The breath visibly left his lungs. Harrison looked ethereal tonight, a vision in emerald silk that made his fingers twitch with the need to touch.

Rosalind smirked. "Close your mouth, Falcon. You're drooling."

Under Nathaniel's heated stare, Harrison allowed herself a small, knowing smile.

"Mr. Falcon!" Eleanor interjected sharply. "The Falcon and Lancaster families have an engagement agreement. Isabella is your rightful fiancée. When will you make an honest woman of her?"

Rosalind snorted. "In his dreams maybe."

"That's not for you to decide!" Isabella snapped.

Eleanor turned to Nathaniel. "Well? What's your answer?"

Silence stretched.

With narrowed eyes, Eleanor muttered an ancient incantation under her breath.

A faint hiss slithered through the air.

Nathaniel suddenly clutched his head, face draining of color as invisible knives seemed to stab through his skull.

"Nathaniel!" Henry steadied him as he swayed.

Harrison's hands twitched toward him instinctively before she forced them to her sides. She couldn't intervene.

Isabella smiled coldly. "Why endure this pain? Just say yes and it stops. Harrison is your torment. You need to cut her from your life!"

Rosalind's fists clenched, ready to strike, but Harrison stopped her with a look. Turning to Nathaniel, she said calmly, "Marry her."

She was telling Nathaniel to wed Isabella.

His head snapped up, searching her face. "You truly want this?"

Harrison nodded. "I'm telling you to marry her. It's over between us."

Rosalind opened her mouth to protest, then remembered the Heartchain Curse binding Nathaniel. There was no way out.

Eleanor pressed, voice turning dangerous. "Decide now. We won't ask again. If we can't have this, we'll destroy everything."

Isabella gazed at Nathaniel with naked adoration. "I love you! Marry me."

Nathaniel's eyes flicked to Harrison one last time before settling on Isabella. He nodded.

"Fine. I'll marry you."
###Chapter 793

Nathaniel agreed to marry Isabella.

Henry and Isabella Lancaster stepped forward in shock. "Nathaniel!"

Rosalind's face darkened instantly.

Meanwhile, Isabella curled her lips into a triumphant smirk. She exchanged a knowing glance with Eleanor, and they both grinned.

Mission accomplished.

Isabella's dream had come true. Even though she had been cast out by the Lancaster family, she was about to become Mrs. Hawk. To her, a woman's worth wasn't defined by her actions, but by the man she married. With the Heartchain Curse binding Nathaniel, she would effortlessly secure her position as his wife for life.

She looped her arm through Nathaniel's and smiled sweetly. "I'm so glad you've reconsidered. Let's get married as soon as possible. Being your wife has always been my greatest desire."

Nathaniel glanced at her but remained silent.

Eleanor observed Henry, Isabella Lancaster, and Harrison's defeated expressions with immense satisfaction. Tormenting them, ensuring they never knew peace—that was her ultimate goal.

"Congratulations, you two," Eleanor said, smiling at Isabella and Nathaniel.

Just then, Victoria arrived with Charlotte. "Nathaniel, are you truly going to marry Isabella?"

Charlotte ran to Harrison's side. "Mommy..."

Harrison scooped her up and kissed her cheek. "Charlotte..."

Isabella turned to Victoria. "Mrs. Victoria, you'll soon be my mother-in-law."

Victoria frowned and looked at Nathaniel. "Marriage is a lifelong commitment. You must think this through carefully."

Nathaniel pressed his lips together. "I'm marrying Isabella."

His tone left no room for argument.

Eleanor smiled. "Victoria, let's choose a date. The fifteenth of this month would be perfect. We'll host a grand wedding so Mr. Hawk and Isabella can officially unite."

She turned to Henry and Isabella Lancaster. "Henry, Isabella, you must both attend to bless the happy couple."

"Your blessings would mean everything to me," Isabella said, smirking at Harrison.

Harrison's expression remained icy. "Don't worry. I wouldn't miss it."

Charlotte, in her tiny voice, called out, "Daddy..."

At just three years old, she couldn't comprehend the adult conversations swirling around her.

Nathaniel stepped forward and kissed her forehead. "Be good for Mommy, okay?"

Charlotte nodded. "Okay..."

Isabella beamed. "Charlotte is absolutely precious! I adore her. From now on, I'll treat her as my own."

Harrison tightened her grip on Charlotte. "That won't be necessary. I'm her mother."

Isabella wasn't fazed. "Of course. After Nathaniel and I marry, we'll have our own children anyway. Nathaniel doesn't have a son yet. I'll give him one."

She made sure Harrison heard every word.

Around them, guests began offering congratulations.

"Congratulations to Mr. Hawk and Ms. Lancaster! They've been engaged since childhood. It's wonderful they're finally tying the knot."

"Fate works in mysterious ways. Mr. Hawk and Ms. Lancaster are truly meant to be."

"We'll all be at the wedding. Can't wait to witness the union of the century!"

"Today is doubly joyous—Ms. Harrison becoming the Lancaster heiress, and Mr. Hawk marrying Ms. Lancaster. Congratulations!"

Isabella gazed at Nathaniel with pure delight, then threw a victorious glance at Harrison.

Nathaniel's handsome face remained impassive.

"I'm leaving," he said quietly.
###Chapter 794

Nathaniel turned on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

"Goodbye, Charlotte." Harrison waved at their daughter before rushing after him. "Nathaniel, wait!"

Eleanor glanced at Henry. "I'll catch up with you later."

She hurried after the departing figures.

Little Charlotte tugged at Harrison's sleeve, her big eyes filled with confusion. "Mommy, why did Daddy leave with that scary lady? She's always so mean to you..."

Harrison's gaze lingered where Nathaniel and Isabella had vanished. She smoothed Charlotte's hair with a gentle smile. "Adult relationships can be complicated, sweetheart. But remember—your daddy and I love you more than anything."

Charlotte beamed. "Okay!"

Isabella studied Harrison with concern. "Are you alright?"

Worry laced her voice as she searched Harrison's face.

Harrison shook her head. "I'm fine."

Rosalind scowled. "Isabella knows exactly how to push buttons. Claiming she'll bear Nathaniel's heir? As if she could dictate fate!"

Suddenly, Harrison doubled over, retching violently.

Having eaten little that day, only bile rose, but the nausea was relentless.

Henry and Isabella exchanged alarmed glances. "What's wrong? Are you ill?"

"Was it something you ate?" Victoria asked.

Harrison pressed trembling fingers to her wrist, counting pulses. A shiver ran through her delicate hands.

Rosalind leaned in urgently. "What is it?"

Harrison whispered, "I'm pregnant."

The word sent everyone into motion. Within minutes, they'd rushed her to the hospital despite her medical expertise—prenatal care was non-negotiable.

When the doctor emerged, the group swarmed forward.

"Well?"

"Congratulations," the doctor beamed. "Ms. Whitmore is indeed expecting. And it's twins!"

Twins.

Victoria gasped. "Twins? Good heavens! We've never had twins in our lineage. Harrison is truly blessed!"

As Harrison exited the examination room, Isabella caught her arm, radiant. "You're carrying twins!"

Harrison wasn't surprised. Her pulse diagnosis had already hinted at the miracle.

That night with Nathaniel—no protection, no morning-after pills. One child would've been unexpected enough, but twins?

Even Harrison hadn't foreseen this twist.

"Twin pregnancies are high-risk," Victoria fretted. "You must rest. I'm calling Nathaniel immediately—he'll be overjoyed!"

She reached for her phone, but Harrison stopped her. "Don't."

Victoria hesitated. "He deserves to know. This could change everything—he'd never marry Isabella if—"

Harrison's expression hardened. "Precisely why he can't know. For his survival, this must remain secret." The Heartchain Curse would kill Nathaniel if he returned.

Rosalind protested, "This isn't fair to you!"

Harrison cradled her abdomen, feeling the twin sparks of life within. Two tiny miracles.

"I'll handle Nathaniel when the time is right. Until then, this stays between us."
###Chapter 795

With Harrison's decision firmly made, everyone respected her choice without question.

"Alright then."

Harrison left the hospital. Rosalind, accompanied by Lillian, came to bid farewell. "I'll take Lillian home first. We'll reconnect soon."

Harrison nodded. "Understood."

Lillian waved enthusiastically. "See you later, Harrison."

Harrison responded with a gentle smile. "Take care."

Rosalind and Lillian walked home together. As they strolled, Rosalind inquired, "After witnessing Harrison's situation, what are your thoughts?"

Lillian paused thoughtfully. "Her romantic journey has been quite turbulent. Is this what love typically entails?"

Having never experienced romance herself, she was genuinely curious.

Rosalind reflected on her past with Everett. Love was indeed a bittersweet cocktail of joy and sorrow, laughter and tears. Yet she didn't wish to frighten Lillian or make her apprehensive about love.

With a knowing smile, Rosalind reassured, "It varies by individual, but I'm confident you'll encounter someone who genuinely comprehends and cherishes you—a companion for life's unpredictable journey."

Lillian offered a faint smile, her disinterest evident. "I believe my true calling lies in scientific pursuits."

Rosalind chuckled. Lillian epitomized the quintessential science enthusiast—more captivated by equations and experiments than matters of the heart.

Taking Lillian's hand, Rosalind declared, "You're an adult now. It's time to embrace your youth. Come, I'm treating you to an adventure."

Lillian arched an eyebrow. "What sort of adventure?"

Rosalind flashed a mysterious grin. "Patience—you'll see!"

Thirty minutes later, Rosalind guided Lillian to the entrance of The Velvet Lounge.

Lillian blinked in surprise. "A nightclub?"

"Exactly," Rosalind confirmed with excitement. "This is your first time, correct? Tonight, I'm initiating you. Let's enjoy some drinks."

Rosalind ushered Lillian inside.

Over the past three years, Rosalind had truly embraced her role as Lillian's surrogate sister—mentoring her academically and professionally. Now that Lillian had matured, Rosalind found herself concerned about her romantic prospects.

They settled at the bar. The venue pulsed with energy—bass-heavy music reverberated through the space while the dance floor teemed with gyrating bodies.

"What would you like to drink?" Rosalind inquired.

"Fruit juice," Lillian replied.

Rosalind laughed. "No juice here. How about a Sapphire Martini instead?"

Soon, two shimmering blue cocktails arrived before them. They sipped their drinks, gradually relaxing.

Suddenly, murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Check out the VIP section—completely reserved tonight," someone whispered. "Rumor has it Julian Blackwood's celebrating his birthday with elite company."

"Not just elites—a bevy of stunning models too. All here to celebrate Julian's special night."

Rosalind hadn't anticipated encountering Julian here. The Blackwood family's influence had skyrocketed in recent years, and Julian now commanded attention wherever he appeared.

Her gaze drifted toward the VIP area—indeed, the entire section was cordoned off. Imposing security personnel stood guard, permitting entry only to approved guests.

Rosalind soon spotted Julian.

No longer merely a high school heartthrob, Julian had fully embraced his role as heir apparent. Tonight, he wore an impeccably tailored black ensemble, presiding over the central sofa. Surrounding him were prominent young figures from Metropolia's elite, all gathered to honor his birthday.

Suddenly, a procession of models appeared—each clad in revealing attire with playful bunny ears adorning their heads.

Youthful and radiant, their admiring gazes fixed upon Julian with unmistakable fascination.
###Chapter 796

The affluent heirs surrounding Julian Blackwood erupted in laughter, nudging him playfully. "Julian, those bunny girls can't stop staring at you! Your magnetism is truly something else!"

"With your wealth and striking looks, no wonder they're practically swooning," another chimed in, eliciting more raucous cheers from the group.

Julian lounged against the plush velvet sofa, swirling his merlot with practiced elegance. A mischievous smirk played across his lips as he commanded, "Well? Don't keep us waiting. Let's see those dance moves."

The privileged crowd erupted in encouragement. "That's right! Show us what you've got! Let Julian judge who's the most graceful!"

"Best performer might just win a special prize tonight," someone teased suggestively. "Maybe even a private audience with our host here."

The scantily clad performers exchanged shy glances before beginning their seductive routine. Each movement was calculated perfection - these weren't ordinary bar girls but professional models and social media stars. Their toned bodies undulated like silk ribbons in the dim lighting, drawing wolf whistles from the intoxicated spectators.

The entire spectacle made Rosalind Fairchild's stomach churn. This was the grotesque display of wealth and privilege she'd tried so hard to escape.

She averted her gaze sharply. Julian Blackwood belonged to a different world now - one she wanted no part of.

"Here's to us," Rosalind declared, raising her cosmopolitan toward Lillian Sinclair.

Their glasses clinked gently. "How do you like it?" Rosalind inquired as her companion took a tentative sip.

Lillian's nose wrinkled adorably. "It's... electrifying. Like swallowing starlight that burns and sweetens at once."

Rosalind's laughter sparkled brighter than the chandeliers overhead. "That's the spirit! Bottoms up."

Their moment shattered when an unwelcome presence materialized beside them - Arabella Blackwood, Julian's venomous cousin.

"What are you doing here?" Arabella sneered, her skintight latex dress leaving little to imagination.

Rosalind's grip tightened around her glass. Of all people to encounter tonight, it had to be Arabella - second only to Isabella Delacroix on her list of despised individuals.

"Enjoying the ambiance," Rosalind countered coolly. Her gaze swept over Arabella's revealing outfit. "Though clearly not as much as you are. Which billionaire heir are you hunting tonight?"

Arabella's philosophy mirrored Isabella's - marriage was merely a financial transaction. Since her breakup with Julian three years prior, she'd been circulating through elite social circles like a shark in bloody waters.

A cruel smile twisted Arabella's lips. "My business is my own. Unlike you, wasting your prime years babysitting Everett's little sister."

For three years, Rosalind had dedicated herself to Lillian's wellbeing while others chased fleeting pleasures.

Rosalind immediately positioned herself as a shield before Lillian. "She's family. A brilliant researcher at Westfield University. I couldn't be prouder."

Arabella's laugh was razor-sharp. "Still just Everett Sinclair's sister at the end of the day, isn't she?"

The name struck like a physical blow. Rosalind's composure faltered for just a heartbeat.

"Everett discarded you years ago," Arabella pressed her advantage mercilessly. "Yet here you are, playing mother to his sister. Pathetic. Tell me, does he even know about your little charity project?"

Rosalind's eyes darkened dangerously. Everett was her Achilles' heel - but Lillian was completely off-limits. "My life is none of your concern. Though judging by that outfit, you're clearly hoping to catch Julian's eye tonight, aren't you?"
###Chapter 797

Arabella's face transformed in an instant.
Rosalind's piercing gaze swept over her from head to toe.

"Julian left you three years ago, yet you're still obsessed with him. I suppose that's understandable. With his meteoric rise these past few years, what other man could possibly compare? But he's moved on, darling. All this primping tonight - you're hoping to lure him back, aren't you? Those Instagram models swarming around him must have you positively green with envy."

Arabella's expression darkened completely. She hadn't anticipated Rosalind knowing all her secrets.

Rosalind smirked, "I'm not the one starting drama here, so don't test me. Your little games don't interest me. Try to humiliate me, and I'll return the favor tenfold."

Arabella trembled with rage. She'd always despised Rosalind - born into privilege, effortlessly beautiful, and most infuriatingly, the only woman Julian had ever truly loved despite his string of flings these past three years.

Julian still carried a torch for Rosalind.

The bitter jealousy consumed Arabella.

Clenching her manicured nails into her palms, she hissed, "Don't get too arrogant! Julian and I will reconcile."

Rosalind rolled her eyes. "Please. I'm not your relationship counselor. If you two make up, it's no skin off my nose."

Arabella's mouth opened and closed wordlessly. Frustrated by her constant verbal defeats, she stomped her stiletto and stormed away in a cloud of expensive perfume.

Rosalind settled back into the plush booth, tilting her head to slowly sip her cosmopolitan.

The alcohol burned hotter than expected, scorching her throat with its spicy bite. The fire spread through her chest like liquid heartbreak.

As she reached for another drink, Lillian's delicate hand gently intercepted hers.

"Rosalind," Lillian murmured, concern shadowing her features. "Are you thinking about Everett again?"

Rosalind remained silent.

Lillian's expression fell. "Three years since he married that woman and vanished. Three whole years without a single word."

Her voice trembled slightly.

Rosalind shook off the melancholy. "No sad stories tonight, Lil. Come on - let's dance."

She grabbed Lillian's wrist and pulled her toward the pulsating dance floor.

Lillian hesitated, eyes wide. "I don't know how!"

Rosalind flashed a wicked grin. "I'll show you."

With fluid, hypnotic movements, Rosalind began dancing - her body moving with the music like liquid fire, every motion radiating confidence and grace.

Meanwhile, Arabella seethed with barely contained fury, but she hadn't forgotten her true objective tonight - Julian.

Rosalind was right; Julian had become untouchable these past three years. No other man came close.

Devilishly handsome, thrillingly unpredictable, and legendary between the sheets - she simply couldn't let him go.

Rumors said dozens of models had come to celebrate Julian's birthday tonight. Sitting idle wasn't an option - she needed to make her move before someone else did.

Smoothing her scandalously tight dress, Arabella marched toward the roped-off VIP section.

A broad-shouldered bodyguard in all black materialized before her. "Private event. Mr. Blackwood's reserved the entire area."

"I know Julian," Arabella insisted. "We used to date. Let me through."

"Invitation?" the guard demanded.

Arabella faltered. "I don't have one."

The guard shook his head. "Then I can't help you. We've turned away dozens trying to crash Mr. Blackwood's party tonight. You'll need to leave."

Arabella's blood boiled.

Through the glass partition, she spotted Julian lounging on a velvet sofa, swirling a glass of burgundy while watching a parade of lingerie-clad models dance before him.
###Chapter 798

A daring bunny girl twirled through the air with effortless grace, completing two perfect spins before landing directly in front of Julian. Without hesitation, she perched herself on his lap, her fingers tracing the edge of his suit jacket.

Julian’s arm slid around her waist, his lips curving into a roguish smirk. "Tired already, sweetheart? My lap’s all yours."

Wild, untamed, and utterly magnetic—Julian had a way of making women forget their own names.

The bunny girl’s cheeks flushed pink. "You’re impossible."

The group of wealthy socialites around them erupted into laughter. "Oh, Julian, you never change! Always the charmer!"

Her gaze remained locked onto Julian’s striking features, as if hypnotized.

Arabella’s blood simmered. That was her man.

She raised her voice sharply. "Julian!"

His head tilted lazily in her direction.

Arabella flashed a knowing smile. "It’s me."

Julian lifted a hand. "Let her through."

The bodyguard in black stepped aside.

Arabella strode forward, chin high. "Told you. I’m not just any ex."

She stopped in front of Julian.

His brow arched. "What brings you here?"

The rich crowd snickered. "Arabella! Here to crash Julian’s party?"

Her eyes flicked to the bunny girl still draped over him. "Must you have her glued to you while we talk?"

Laughter exploded around them.

"Looks like the ex isn’t happy!"

"More like jealous."

"Damn, Julian. Your ex showing up? Best birthday ever."

Julian glanced between Arabella and the bunny girl. "She wants you to move."

The girl tightened her grip around his neck, pouting. "But I like it here..."

She wasn’t giving up this spot without a fight.

Julian’s grin turned wicked. "See? She’s not budging. What now? Should we settle this with a little... competition?"

The crowd howled with amusement.

"Julian, you’re evil—making them fight over you!"

"What can I say? Supply and demand."

His playful taunt had both women bristling.

"Arabella!" someone cheered. "You’ve got this!"

She glared at the bunny girl. "What kind of woman just plants herself on someone else’s man?"

The girl smirked. "Your man? Newsflash—he’s not yours anymore. If he wanted me off, he’d say so."

She emphasized "your" with a mocking lilt.

Arabella’s temper flared. She’d met her match.

These girls were sharp—just like her. They knew exactly what they wanted: power, wealth, and a man who could give them both. They’d seen every trick in the book, including catfights over a billionaire’s attention.

"Get. Up." Arabella bit out. "I need to talk to him."

The girl leaned back, smug. "Talk all you want. I’m not moving."

Arabella’s hand shot out, fingers tangling in the girl’s hair—
###Chapter 799

"Get your hands off him!" Arabella shrieked, grabbing a fistful of the bunny girl's platinum blonde locks and yanking her violently off Julian's lap.

The girl let out a piercing scream as she crashed onto the marble floor.

But she wasn't about to take this lying down. Scrambling up, she shot Arabella a venomous glare, crimson lips curling in fury. "You little bitch! Who do you think you're dealing with?"

Like a feral cat, she launched herself forward, razor-sharp nails slicing across Arabella's porcelain cheek, leaving three angry red trails.

"You ruined my face!" Arabella howled, clutching her stinging cheek. Blood seeped between her fingers. "I'll make you pay for this!"

The two women became a whirlwind of flying hair and scratching nails, knocking over crystal glasses that shattered across the VIP lounge. Champagne sprayed like golden rain.

The heirs of Willowbrook's elite families erupted in cheers, forming a raucous circle around the catfight.

"Julian! Two stunners brawling over you!"

"Place your bets, gentlemen! I've got fifty grand on Arabella!"

"The bunny's got claws - my money's on her!"

Their laughter and jeers filled the air as the women rolled across the floor, tearing at each other's designer dresses.

Julian merely lounged against the velvet couch, swirling his whiskey with disinterest. His bored gaze drifted past the spectacle, scanning the pulsating dance floor below.

Then he saw her.

Rosalind moved with liquid grace between the strobe lights, her emerald silk dress clinging to every curve as she danced with Lillian. Every step was poetry, every sway hypnotic. The crowd had instinctively formed a circle around them, men's eyes glued to the mesmerizing pair.

She was radiant. Untouchable.

Julian's whiskey glass hit the table with a sharp crack as he stood abruptly.

"Julian? Where—"

Without a word, he shoved past his confused friends, his entire being laser-focused on the dance floor.

"Hey! Your birthday party—"

"Fuck off," Julian growled without breaking stride.

The heirs exchanged bewildered glances.

"What's gotten into him?"

"Damn. Arabella and Bunny are still going at it like animals, and he just walks away?"

Julian didn't hear them. His entire world had narrowed to the vision in green silk.

Memories flashed—Rosalind at sixteen, laughing under willow trees. Rosalind at eighteen, blushing when he'd pinned her against his sports car.

Now, bathed in the club's ethereal lighting, she was a goddess among mortals. That effortless elegance, the quiet confidence of true aristocracy—it made the Arabellas of the world look like cheap imitations.

For three years, Rosalind had stayed out of society's spotlight, quietly building her couture empire. And the more she ignored him, the more she haunted him.

As he watched her hips sway to the rhythm, something primal stirred in his gut.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea as Julian stalked forward, his eyes never leaving his prey.
###Chapter 800

Rosalind was twirling gracefully with Lillian across the dance floor when Julian's iron grip suddenly clamped around her wrist.

"Rosalind!"

Her laughter died instantly. She spun to face him, shock flashing in her emerald eyes.

"Julian?" She twisted her arm violently. "Release me this instant!"

His voice cut like ice. "Who gave you permission to dance here?"

"What business is it of yours?" Rosalind snapped. The mere sight of him made her skin crawl. With a sharp jerk, she wrenched free from his grasp.

Julian's lips curled into a cruel smirk. "So you enjoy dancing? Perfect. I'll be your partner."

Watching Rosalind laugh and sway before a crowd of admirers had set Julian's blood on fire. She offered them smiles freely, yet for three endless years, she'd vanished without a trace despite his relentless search.

Rosalind shot him a glacial look. "Who said I wanted to dance with you?"

She seized Lillian's hand. "Let's leave, Lily."

Julian's sudden appearance had shattered her joyful mood. She needed to escape before he ruined everything.

But Julian moved faster, his strong arm snaking around her slender waist, pulling her flush against his chest.

Rosalind gasped as she collided with his hard body. Her eyes blazed with fury. "Have you lost your mind? Take your filthy hands off me!"

His fingers dug into the soft curve of her waist. Instead of releasing her, he tightened his hold. "If dancing brings you such pleasure, why stop when I arrive? Dance with me."

Julian began steering her across the floor, his body moving against hers.

Rosalind couldn't fathom why Julian had appeared tonight. Shouldn't he be surrounded by adoring women at his birthday gala? Weren't those scantily-clad models and Arabella enough to satisfy him?

She shoved against his chest with all her strength. "Let go of me!"

A broad-shouldered man nearby stepped forward. "The lady clearly doesn't want your company."

Julian turned, his gaze freezing the man in place. "This doesn't concern you."

Recognizing Julian's power and status, the man retreated with a nervous swallow.

Seizing the moment, Rosalind broke free. "You're deranged!"

She grabbed Lillian's wrist again. "We're leaving!"

Julian stalked after them. "Running again? Why do you always flee from me?"

"I have nothing to say to you. Stay away!"

Her icy dismissal ignited a wildfire of rage within Julian. At his level of wealth and influence, only Rosalind dared treat him with such contempt.

Without warning, he bent and tossed Rosalind over his shoulder like a sack of flour, striding away.

Rosalind shrieked, pounding his back with her fists. "Put me down this instant!"

Lillian chased after them. "Release her!"

Julian ignored the protests, carrying his struggling burden down the corridor.

Rosalind's stomach pressed painfully against his shoulder as he marched forward. The strength disparity left her powerless, and genuine fear prickled down her spine.

"You're hurting me!" Her voice softened to a plea. "My stomach - please put me down, it really hurts!"

At her distressed tone, Julian finally lowered her to her feet.
###Chapter 801
Rosalind's sneakers slammed against the pavement as she bolted.

Julian let out a dark chuckle, having anticipated her escape. With lightning reflexes, he seized her wrist and pinned her against the brick wall. His grip on her shoulders was ironclad. "Where do you think you're running to?"

"This isn't about me—what the hell do you want?" Rosalind spat, her chest heaving. "Three years, Julian. Three years of nothing. We were never even a thing. Just let me go."

His gaze burned into hers. "I don't accept that. Give me one more shot. Be with me."

"Not in this lifetime," she hissed.

"Why not?"

"You really need me to spell it out?"

His jaw tightened. "Still hung up on Arabella? Yeah, I slept with her. Don't act all high and mighty—you gave yourself to Everett. So why the double standard?"

The mention of Everett ignited something feral in Julian. He knew—everyone knew—how deeply Rosalind had loved him. How she'd given him everything.

Rosalind's eyes flashed. "Shut up. Don't you dare say his name."

"Why? What makes him so special? Open your eyes! Three years, Rosalind. He never came back. He's probably married with kids by now. And you? Still playing big sister to Lillian like some pathetic—"

"Lillian is family!" Rosalind snapped. "Say another word about her and I swear—"

"Or what?" Julian's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Why defend her so hard? Still carrying a torch for him?"

Jealousy twisted his features. Just the name "Everett" was enough to unravel him.

"Whether I love him or not doesn't matter," Rosalind said coldly. "The truth? You'll never measure up."

Julian's pupils dilated. "Oh, I'll show you exactly how I measure up."

He crushed his mouth toward hers.

Rosalind jerked her face away. "Get off me!"

In one brutal motion, she kneed him between the legs. Julian gasped, doubling over—just as a wooden chair leg cracked against his skull.

He whirled to see Lillian, weapon still raised.

The stick clattered to the ground as Lillian grabbed Rosalind's arm. "Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine—run!" Rosalind yanked her toward the exit.

Julian's roar echoed behind them. "Rosalind, you've just signed your own damnation! Three years of indulgence—tonight, you learn your place!" He snapped his fingers. "Bring her to me. Now."

Black-suited figures materialized from the shadows. "Yes, sir."

Rosalind and Lillian burst onto the neon-lit street, pursuers closing in.

"Stop them!"

Rosalind flung her arm out, desperately flagging taxis. "Stop! Please!"

Not a single car slowed.

Lillian glanced back, panic rising. "They're gaining on us!"

"Please!" Rosalind's voice cracked.

The street remained mercilessly empty.

Julian's silhouette emerged from the darkness. "You can't run forever, Rosalind."

Lillian's grip tightened. "What now?"

Rosalind's pulse hammered in her throat. The answer came in the screech of tires—a sleek black sedan skidding to a halt beside them.

The tinted window rolled down. A familiar voice cut through the chaos: "Get in. Now."

Recognition flashed in Rosalind's eyes.

Everett.
###Chapter 802
Rosalind's heart pounded against her ribs.
Was Julian truly going to capture her tonight?

Tires screeched as a taxi swerved to the curb beside Rosalind and Lillian. The driver's window rolled down, revealing piercing eyes beneath a black cap. "Get in. Now."

Hope flared in Rosalind's chest. She yanked open the rear door. "Lillian, hurry!"

As Lillian scrambled inside, Rosalind dove into the front passenger seat.

"Go!"

The taxi lurched forward just as Julian's polished dress shoes hit the pavement.

"Stop that car!" Julian's roar faded behind them as the taxi merged into traffic.

Fury twisted Julian's aristocratic features. He snatched the keys from his bodyguard. "Find out who that driver is. I want his license revoked by morning!"

His Ferrari purred to life. Tonight, he'd reclaim what was his.

Inside the taxi, Rosalind turned to thank her rescuer—then froze.

The scar cutting through his stubble was unmistakable. Everett Sinclair.

Dressed entirely in black with a mask covering his lower face, only those intense gray eyes were visible. Eyes that haunted her dreams.

A horn blared.

Lillian gasped. "He's gaining on us!"

Rosalind's stomach dropped as the Ferrari's headlights filled the rearview mirror. Julian was relentless.

"Can you lose him?" Rosalind gripped the dashboard.

Everett's gloved hands tightened on the wheel. Without a word, he floored the accelerator.

Julian's manic laughter carried through his open window. "Pull over! That woman belongs to me!"

Rosalind's nails bit into her palms. "Don't listen to him! I'll triple your fare!"

Everett's response was a sharp turn that sent the taxi careening onto a side street. Tires screamed as Julian rammed their bumper.

The impact threw Rosalind sideways. Her cheek pressed against Everett's thigh, heat radiating through the fabric.

Another collision sent her sliding lower. Her face brushed against something hard and searing beneath his waistband.

The taxi spun, sparks flying as metal scraped concrete.

Somewhere in the chaos, Everett's hand clamped around her wrist—not to push her away, but to anchor her against the storm.
###Chapter 803
What the—?

Rosalind's face burned crimson when she realized where her cheek had been pressed moments ago. She jerked back into her seat with such force that the seatbelt locked, then turned to glare at the masked driver.

"Creep!"

The man behind the wheel—face obscured by a sleek black mask—merely arched one visible brow. His piercing gray eyes glinted with silent laughter. "That's quite the accusation. Care to explain?"

His tone dripped with feigned innocence.

Rosalind's ears turned the shade of overripe cherries. "You know exactly what you—"

"What?" He tilted his head, the leather steering wheel creaking under his grip.

She clamped her mouth shut. Some things were too mortifying to voice aloud.

Behind them, Julian Blackwood's Ferrari roared like a caged beast as he tailgated their taxi. The billionaire heir couldn't fathom being outmaneuvered by some random cabbie in Metropolia's backstreets.

"Pull over!" Julian's shout carried through his rolled-down window, veins bulging at his temples. "Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? I'll have your license revoked before sunset!"

Rosalind massaged her throbbing temples. "Step on it!"

The driver's smirk deepened. "Thought you wanted out after that... unfortunate misunderstanding."

"I take it back!" She gripped the door handle as they took a sharp turn. "Just lose him!"

Ahead, the taxi swerved into a narrow service alley. Julian followed with a string of curses—only to slam the brakes when an eighteen-wheeler materialized from the opposite direction.

Horns blared. Tires screeched.

The Ferrari's hood stopped inches from the truck's grille.

Julian's knuckles whitened on the wheel. When he looked up, the alley yawned empty—no taillights, no engine sounds. Just shadows swallowing shadows.

His phone hit the dashboard with a crack. "Find that driver," he barked at his head of security. "I want his name, his route, his damn blood type within the hour."

Five minutes later, the callback came.

"Well?"

"Sir... there's no record of that taxi or its driver in our systems."

Julian's champagne leather seats creaked as he leaned forward. "What do you mean no record? It was a yellow cab with—"

"No such vehicle exists in Metropolia's registered fleet."

The phone shattered against the pavement. Somewhere in the city's labyrinthine streets, a masked man adjusted his rearview mirror—and smiled.
###Chapter 804

Julian's subordinate stuttered anxiously, "S-Sir, we've exhausted all resources. The ride-share company shows no record of this driver. His profile appears completely erased."

Julian couldn't fathom such incompetence in his own city. His voice turned icy. "Pathetic."

The line went dead.

His mind replayed Rosalind's exquisite features—the way her body had moved with such effortless grace across the dance floor. The memory ignited something primal within him. The more elusive she became, the hotter his blood burned.

Rosalind had awakened something dangerous inside him.

Julian scrolled through his contacts and pressed call. After three rings, his mother Beatrice answered.

"Darling?"

"Mother, arrange a dinner with the Whitmores tomorrow. Since our families have an engagement agreement, we should formalize my marriage to Rosalind."

"But the Whitmores seem reluctant—"

"I don't care!" Julian's knuckles whitened around the phone. "I will marry Rosalind. No one else."

As the sole heir to the Blackwood empire, Beatrice could never refuse him. Her tone softened immediately.

"Very well. I'll contact Patricia Whitmore. Our families have decades of friendship—they won't risk a public scandal. We'll settle this properly tomorrow."

Julian ended the call, marginally pacified.

Just then, stiletto heels clicked toward him. The bunny girl from earlier approached, her face marred with scratches—evidence of her brutal catfight with Arabella. Neither woman had emerged victorious, only mutually wounded.

By the time their hair-pulling spectacle ended, Julian had already vanished, chasing after Rosalind's departing cab.

The bunny girl's eyes brightened at spotting him now. Hesitantly, she stepped forward. "Julian...?"

He glanced up with vacant disinterest. "Do I know you?"

Her smile faltered. "I... I danced for you tonight. At your birthday celebration?"

"Ah." His acknowledgment held all the warmth of a December wind.

Hope flickered in her eyes. "You remember?"

"No."

"Could you possibly—"

The Ferrari's engine roared to life, spewing exhaust in her face as Julian peeled away without a backward glance.

All those claw marks for nothing.

Meanwhile, the cab arrived at the Whitmore estate. Rosalind helped Lillian out, studying the girl's pale face.

"Are you alright? That must have been terrifying."

Lillian shook her head bravely. "I'm fine."

Rosalind turned to the driver, suddenly realizing her predicament. "Thank you for tonight. What do I owe you?"

Her hands patted empty pockets. No purse.

The man arched an eyebrow. "Don't tell me I drove you halfway across Metropolia for free."

"I'm good for it! I live here, for heaven's sake." Rosalind bit her lip. "Give me your number—I'll transfer the funds immediately."

After a considering pause, he recited digits. "Don't make me hunt you down."

As the cab began pulling away, Lillian suddenly darted forward, calling out urgently—

"Everett!"
###Chapter 805

Rosalind froze when she heard Lillian call the man "Everett."

She knew Lillian was mistaking him for her brother. Days ago, when Rosalind first saw him, she had nearly made the same mistake.

"He's not Everett," Rosalind said quickly.

"Yes, he is! I can't be wrong! That's definitely Everett! Everett—!"

Lillian hadn't seen Everett in three years. He was the only family she had left, and she was certain she wouldn't confuse him with anyone else.

"Lillian, listen to me. He isn't your brother," Rosalind said gently.

The man in the driver's seat turned his cold, piercing gaze toward Lillian. His voice was calm but distant. "You're mistaken. I'm not your brother."

"I don't believe you! Take off your mask! Let me see your face!" Lillian demanded, desperation lacing her words.

"Lillian!" Rosalind tried to stop her.

But the man merely sighed. "Fine."

He lifted the mask, revealing a face marred by deep scars.

Lillian gasped, her breath hitching. "Your face—"

The mask slid back into place. "Still think I'm your brother?"

Lillian hesitated. "I—"

"I have places to be. Goodbye."

The car engine roared as he sped away.

"Everett!" Lillian cried out, taking a step forward.

Rosalind pulled her back, holding her tightly. "I know how much you want to believe it, but he isn't Everett."

Tears spilled down Lillian's cheeks. "Where is he? Why hasn't he come back in three years? Did he forget about us?"

Rosalind's own eyes burned with unshed tears. The pain inside her was sharper than Lillian could imagine.

Lillian sobbed. "I miss him so much! Why did he just disappear? Where could he possibly be?"

Rosalind could only hold her tighter, offering silent comfort.

Lillian was shattered.

Since she was leaving for the research base tomorrow, Rosalind guided her inside to shower and rest. Standing by the window, Rosalind gazed at the city lights—beautiful but distant, just like the man she was searching for.

Everett had been missing for three years.

Her thoughts drifted back to the cab driver. Was he really just a driver? Those sharp, clear eyes—they had looked so much like Everett's.

On impulse, Rosalind pulled out her phone and found the driver's WhatsApp. His profile picture was a plain black square—mysterious, unreadable.

She scrolled through his status updates, but they were blank.

What had happened to his face? Who was he? She didn't understand why she was so fixated on this stranger.

She sent him a transfer of 70 dollars. [Thanks for tonight.]

Ding!

A reply came instantly. [You're welcome.]

Brief. Distant.

Rosalind exhaled, shaking her head at herself.

She slipped her phone back into her pocket and left Lillian's room, heading to the living room.

Just then, Victoria Whitmore appeared. "Rosalind."

Victoria was Rosalind's mother. Despite being from the Whitmore family, Rosalind carried her mother's surname.

Victoria was elegant, youthful, and always impeccably dressed. She and Alistair had a strong marriage, and Rosalind was their cherished only daughter.

"Is Lillian asleep?" Victoria asked.

Rosalind nodded. "Yes. She just went to bed."

Victoria sighed. "I need to talk to you. The Blackwoods just called. They want to meet to discuss your engagement with Julian."
###Chapter 806

Rosalind felt a visceral disgust toward Julian. After finally escaping him tonight, here he was again, demanding a family gathering.

"Mother, I refuse to see him! Yes, we were engaged, but he betrayed me with Arabella. He's the one who broke it off—that should void any agreement. I won't marry him, not ever!"

"Rosalind, your father and I stand with you," Victoria assured, her voice firm. "We want you to marry someone worthy. Julian never truly cared for you—he only saw you as a means to our family's influence. We haven't forgotten that."

"But the Blackwoods have grown powerful. Our families have decades of intertwined interests. They just called, begging for a meeting. I couldn't refuse. Let's meet tomorrow and settle this engagement once and for all."

As the Fairchild heiress, Rosalind understood privilege came with duty. She couldn't risk tearing their families apart.

She exhaled sharply. "Fine. Tomorrow. I'll make my stance clear."

"Good."

The next day, after dropping Lillian at the research facility, Rosalind returned home.

Victoria escorted her to The Grand View, the upscale restaurant where both families would meet.

As they entered the lavish private dining room, Beatrice and Julian were already waiting.

Beatrice rose with a practiced smile. "Mrs. Fairchild, Rosalind. How lovely to see you."

Julian's gaze locked onto Rosalind. She wore a sleek Chanel dress, her hair cascading freely—radiating an effortless elegance that always drew attention.

A spark lit in his eyes. After chasing her for so long, here she was, appearing before him as if summoned.

Soon, he thought, she'd be his.

"You look stunning," he murmured, lips curving.

Rosalind shot him an icy glance before turning away.

Julian wasn't fazed. Her resistance only fueled his obsession—a twisted mix of desire and resentment. Once they married, he'd break that defiance in the most intimate way.

"Please, sit," Victoria said smoothly.

They took their seats.

Victoria addressed Beatrice directly. "We're here to discuss the engagement, but as I recall, Julian called it off three years ago. That agreement is void."

Beatrice chuckled. "Julian was young and impulsive back then. Our families' alliance is vital for our futures, don't you agree?"

Victoria remained composed. "Marriage is serious. The children's wishes matter most."

Rosalind turned to Julian. "Do you want to marry me?"

He hesitated. "I—"

She cut him off. "I once considered it. But after you cheated with Arabella and ended things, that door is closed. Forever."
###Chapter 807

Since Julian was adamant about holding a family gathering to address their engagement, Rosalind resolved to make her stance crystal clear - she would never become his wife.

Beatrice shifted uncomfortably in her seat. She cast a worried glance at her son. "What in the world..."

Julian's gaze remained fixed on Rosalind. Her declaration didn't surprise him; he'd anticipated her rejection from the start.

"I acted foolishly before," he admitted, his voice low. "I was impulsive and childish. But now I've come to recognize my true feelings. I've loved you for years, Rosalind. Give me this opportunity to prove myself. I swear I'll treasure you properly this time."

Rosalind's lips curled into a bitter smile internally. His belated realization meant nothing. What did it matter if he finally understood his heart? She owed him nothing, and whatever bond they once shared had dissolved long ago.

"Julian, we-"

Before she could complete her sentence, Victoria's phone buzzed insistently. She glanced at the screen, her brows knitting together. "It's your father."

Alistair had been unusually occupied lately. Though renowned in academic circles, Whitmore Holdings demanded his full attention as CEO. Business affairs never appealed to him, but the family legacy rested on his shoulders.

Moreover, Alistair had only one heir - Rosalind. His daughter pursued fashion design, showing no interest in corporate matters.

"Take the call, Mother."

"Of course."

Victoria answered. Her face paled as she listened, then abruptly stood. "What did you just say?"

Rosalind sprang to her feet. "What's happened?"

"Your father's been hospitalized!"

Rosalind's blood ran cold. "How? We need to leave immediately!"

"Yes." Victoria turned to Beatrice apologetically. "We must go at once."

Beatrice nodded understandingly. "Naturally."

As Rosalind followed her mother toward the exit, Julian's voice stopped her in her tracks. "Rosalind."

She turned reluctantly.

Julian approached with a confident smirk. "Should you require assistance, you know where to find me."

Rosalind's frown deepened. "I appreciate the thought, but your help won't be necessary."

"Never say never," he countered smoothly. "Circumstances may change. I'll be waiting regardless."

His cryptic words puzzled her, but her father's condition took precedence. "Mother, let's hurry."

"Right away."

As they departed, Julian watched Rosalind's retreating figure with unwavering determination.

"You'll return to me, Rosalind. Eventually."

The hospital corridors blurred as Rosalind and Victoria rushed to Alistair's room. They found him propped up in bed, his forehead swathed in bandages with ominous red stains seeping through.

Victoria rushed to his side. "Darling! What happened? How were you injured?"

Rosalind's hands trembled as she gripped the bed rail. "Father, what's going on?"

Alistair attempted a reassuring smile. "There was no need for you to come. I specifically told my assistant not to alarm you."

"You're hospitalized!" Victoria's voice cracked. "Why wouldn't you want us to know?"

"I wished to spare you unnecessary worry."

Rosalind pressed urgently, "Father, tell us exactly what occurred."

Alistair's expression darkened. "There's trouble at Whitmore Holdings."

"What? Everything was stable last week! What could have gone wrong?"
###Chapter 808
Alistair took a deep breath before speaking.

"Just last week, Whitmore Holdings launched a joint venture with an international corporation. Everything was progressing smoothly until one of our construction workers collapsed on site. The man suffered a severe leg injury requiring hospitalization."

He ran a hand through his hair. "We immediately dispatched our HR team with compensation offers, but the worker's family refused all contact. Then the situation escalated."

Rosalind's pulse quickened. She hadn't realized Whitmore Holdings was facing such a crisis.

"I made multiple attempts to negotiate," Alistair continued, his voice tight. "We were prepared to meet any demands. But they kept avoiding us. Today, six of the worker's sons ambushed me outside the hospital." His fingers brushed the bandage on his temple. "One of them struck me with a brick."

Victoria's face darkened with anger. "This is outrageous! Our construction sites exceed all safety regulations. Every worker has comprehensive insurance coverage. Instead of discussing compensation, they're deliberately causing trouble and damaging our reputation!" She clenched her fists. "Attacking you? This goes beyond reasonable behavior - we're dealing with criminals."

Alistair nodded grimly. "The entire family has underworld connections. Full-body tattoos, known gang affiliations. This isn't just about an accident."

Rosalind felt ice slide down her spine. The timing was too perfect - during critical negotiations with their international partners. This reeked of sabotage.

"Someone's orchestrating this," she said aloud, voicing her suspicion.

Alistair's jaw tightened. "My thoughts exactly. This is a targeted attack on our family."

Victoria paled. "Who would dare? The Whitmores are one of Metropolia's most prominent families! This level of planning... it's not the work of amateurs."

She was right. Only a handful of power players in the capital could execute such a scheme.

Rosalind already knew the answer. "I need to make a call."

Stepping into the hospital corridor, she dialed a familiar number. The line connected after two rings.

Julian Blackwood's smooth voice filled her ear. "I was wondering when you'd call."

Her grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. Of course it was him.

"Are you behind this?" she demanded, barely containing her fury. "What's your game?"

His chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "It's... complicated. Why don't we discuss this in person?"

"Where?" she snapped.

"The Celestial Hotel. Presidential Suite."

Rosalind's stomach churned. He'd already booked the most expensive room, clearly expecting her to come crawling to him.

"Not happening," she hissed.

"Suit yourself," Julian replied lightly. "But if you don't come, say goodbye to Whitmore Holdings."

She could hear the smirk in his voice.

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. "You bastard! Fine. I'm on my way."

The line went dead. She stared at her reflection in the hospital window - pale-faced, with dark circles under her eyes. Julian Blackwood wanted to play games? Fine. She'd play. But this time, she'd make the rules.
###Chapter 809

Julian let out a dark chuckle. "Of course. I'll be expecting you. The Celestial, Penthouse Suite. Don't make the mistake of going to the wrong floor." Rosalind hung up without another word.

He was already lounging in the opulent penthouse of The Celestial, having arrived hours before her call. He'd known she would come.

As the sole heiress of the Whitmore dynasty, Rosalind had been coddled and adored since birth. Every whim catered to, every desire fulfilled. Sheltered like a rare orchid, yet fiercely devoted—she would never abandon her family or Whitmore Holdings.

No one lives just for themselves in this world. We all have our burdens to bear.

Julian poured himself a glass of burgundy, swirling the rich liquid absently. He wasn't drinking it—just watching the crimson waves lap against crystal.

Then—a chime. The doorbell.

She was here. Rosalind.

His lips curved. Faster than he'd anticipated.

Draining the glass in one smooth motion, he rose and crossed to the door.

When it swung open, Rosalind stood framed in the doorway, her sapphire eyes blazing with fury.

Julian smirked. "You're earlier than I expected."

"Move," she hissed through clenched teeth.

Amused, he stepped aside. She strode past him without hesitation.

With an entertained quirk of his brow, he shut the door behind her.

Rosalind whirled to face him, her glare scorching.

"So eager to enter my domain?" Julian's grin turned wolfish. "Aren't you worried about what might happen? Just the two of us here... things could get dangerous."

Her voice didn't waver. "I came knowing the risks. Now tell me—did you sabotage Whitmore Holdings?"

God, he loved her directness. No games, no pretenses. Straight to the heart of the matter.

Closing the distance between them, he nodded. "Yes. That worker belongs to me."

Silence.

Julian continued, "I know about your multinational deal. It'll tie up all your liquid assets—critical timing. One misstep and everything collapses."

He took another step closer. "So I paid a laborer handsomely to take a fall. Had him break his leg, stir up trouble, tarnish your reputation. Made sure your partners got cold feet. Even your father's accident today—that was me."

Every confession matched her suspicions exactly.

No surprise—only white-hot rage. "Our families go back generations! My father practically raised you! How could you do this? Have you no conscience?"

Julian closed the final distance between them, stopping just inches away. "I never wanted to hurt your family. You gave me no choice."

"How did I leave you no choice?"

"Three years," he growled. "Three years of you ignoring me, acting like I didn't exist. You knew I wanted to marry you, yet you refused every overture. So I found another way to make you say yes."

CRACK!

Rosalind's palm connected sharply with his cheek.
###Chapter 810

Julian's chiseled jaw snapped sideways from the force of Rosalind's slap.

Her fingers curled into tight fists, trembling with barely contained fury.

"I always thought you were just another spoiled heir playing games," she spat, her voice laced with venom. "But this? Threatening my family's legacy? You've shown me exactly how low you'll sink to get what you want."

To her astonishment, Julian merely chuckled as he turned back to face her. A dangerous smile played on his lips. "Darling, whether we marry isn't your decision to make. It's mine."

Rosalind's breath hitched. "What game are you playing now?"

"Reginald Blackwood from Quantum Innovations arrived in Metropolia yesterday," he said smoothly, adjusting his cufflinks. "Old family friend. Refuse me, and Whitmore Holdings loses their biggest contract. Without that cash flow..." He trailed off meaningfully.

She felt the blood drain from her face. The century-old Whitmore empire crumbling because of her?

Julian closed the distance between them, his fingers tracing her jawline. "You think I'm cruel? Sweetheart, you hold all the power here." His thumb brushed against her parted lips.

"Three years," he murmured, his breath warm against her skin. "Three years I've waited, obsessed with the woman who rejected me. That foolish infatuation with Arabella is long gone. Marry me."

"And if I refuse?" she challenged.

His grip tightened imperceptibly. "You don't have that luxury."

The air between them crackled as his touch grew rougher, his fingers pressing into the softness of her mouth. His darkened gaze dropped to her lips.

With sudden force, he pushed her backward onto the silk duvet, his body caging hers. "Tonight, you'll finally be mine," he growled, lowering his head.

Rosalind twisted away at the last second, her cheek pressed into the pillows.

Again he tried to claim her mouth, and again she evaded him.

Frustration flashed across Julian's features as he seized her chin. "Still pining for Everett?" he sneered. "After all this time?"

Everett Sinclair's ghost might as well have been lying between them.

Rosalind met his glare unflinchingly. "If I am? He was ten times the man you'll ever be."

Something savage flickered in Julian's eyes. "Really?" His mouth descended to her throat. "Let's test that theory."

She shoved against his chest. "Don't bother. I already know he'd ruin me in ways you couldn't imagine."

A dark laugh escaped him as he loosened his tie. "You've never given me the chance to prove otherwise." Arabella had sung praises of his prowess between the sheets—untamed, masterful, addictive.

Rosalind fisted his shirt, yanking him down until their lips nearly touched. "Everett was wilder," she breathed. "More skilled. More attentive. The only man I'd ever let wreck me."
###Chapter 811


No man could tolerate such blatant defiance—especially Julian, who had always seethed under Everett's lingering influence.

Julian's lips curled into a frosty smirk as he glared at Rosalind. "You'll regret this tonight."

His fingers clawed at her collar, ready to rip the fabric apart.

But Rosalind was faster.

In one fluid motion, she whipped out the pepper spray concealed at her waist and blasted it directly into Julian's eyes.

He hadn't anticipated her to be armed.

The searing liquid ignited his vision. "Agh!" he roared, staggering back in agony.

Rosalind shoved him away, her voice dripping with contempt. "Did you really think I'd walk into this unprepared? This was bought specifically for you."

The last time Julian had cornered her, only the taxi driver's timely intervention had saved her. Since then, she never left home without her defense.

Julian wiped furiously at his eyes, his gaze burning with rage. "You're testing my limits! Is this your final answer? Think carefully—Whitmore Holdings won't survive without my mercy!"

Rosalind met his fury with glacial calm. "If my parents knew I was sacrificing my happiness just to save Whitmore Holdings, they'd disown me themselves."

Julian barked out a bitter laugh. "Fine! Don't say I didn't warn you. I'm heading straight to Reginald Blackwood. You'll pay for this!"

With a violent slam of the door, he stormed out.

Rosalind watched him leave, her jaw tight. Did he truly believe she'd crumble? Never.

She'd find another way to salvage Whitmore Holdings.

Pulling out her phone, she dialed Alistair's assistant, Oliver. The line connected instantly.

"Ms. Fairchild," Oliver greeted politely.

"Where's Reginald Blackwood right now? I need to see him immediately."

Even if Julian had the advantage of friendship with Reginald, Rosalind refused to surrender—she couldn't let Whitmore Holdings collapse.

Oliver responded swiftly. "Mr. Blackwood is at The Celestial Club for a golf match today."

"Perfect. Send me the address. I'm on my way."

"Right away."

Within minutes, the location buzzed on her screen. Rosalind left the hotel and hailed a cab.

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at the exclusive club, determined to intercept Reginald.

A polished receptionist blocked her path. "Good afternoon. Do you have a reservation?"

Rosalind faltered. "Reservation? I just need to speak with Mr. Blackwood."

The receptionist smiled apologetically. "This is a members-only establishment. Access requires prior arrangements."

Her stomach dropped. "Please, it's urgent. Could you at least inform him I'm here? Rosalind Fairchild of Whitmore Holdings."

The receptionist hesitated. "Mr. Blackwood is currently engaged with his private guests. He's instructed no interruptions."

Rosalind's fingers tightened around her purse. She didn't have Reginald's direct contact.

But time was running out. If Reginald dissolved their partnership today, everything would be over.

"Please," she implored, voice low with desperation. "Just one exception. This concerns a multi-million dollar deal."
###Chapter 812

The concierge offered Rosalind a regretful smile. "I apologize, Ms. Fairchild, but our exclusive club maintains stringent membership policies. We must adhere to protocol, so I kindly ask you not to press the matter."

Just then, a voice dripping with arrogance cut through the air. "Well, well, if it isn't Rosalind."

Rosalind spun around to face Julian Blackwood, who had swapped his usual tailored suits for a designer golf shirt. His gleaming black Lamborghini sat parked nearby, reflecting the afternoon sun.

Julian's lips curled into a mocking grin. "Here to see Mr. Blackwood? What an amusing coincidence. He personally invited me for a round of golf." His eyes raked over her with deliberate slowness. "Though it appears you're having some...access issues. Perhaps if you asked nicely, I might consider granting you entry."

Rosalind's eyes flashed with defiance. "Don't flatter yourself."

"Oh, but I do," Julian purred, stepping closer. "And I intend to keep doing so. This is merely the beginning." The underlying menace in his tone was unmistakable.

At that moment, Reginald's personal assistant materialized. "Mr. Blackwood, right this way. Mr. Blackwood is expecting you."

Julian's smirk widened. "Perfect timing." He deliberately brushed past Rosalind. "Still want to play the proud card? Your stubbornness only makes this more entertaining for me."

"Go to hell," Rosalind spat.

Julian threw his head back with a laugh. "Mark my words - the day will come when you'll be begging at my feet. I'll be counting the hours."

With that final taunt, he disappeared into the club's lavish interior, leaving Rosalind seething at the entrance. Her fists clenched at her sides as she weighed her limited options.

Frustrated, she reached for her phone to call Oliver for assistance.

Inside the club, Julian found Reginald waiting near the first tee. "Mr. Blackwood, always a pleasure."

Their handshake was firm, the grip of two powerful men acknowledging each other's status.

Reginald nodded. "Julian, it's been too long."

"Indeed," Julian agreed smoothly. "My overseas ventures kept me occupied longer than anticipated."

His gaze flickered toward the entrance where Rosalind remained barred from entry. The fire in her resistance only fueled his determination to break her.

"Shall we begin our game?" Julian suggested, already calculating when to steer the conversation toward Whitmore Holdings.

Reginald waved a dismissive hand. "Patience. We're expecting another guest."

Julian's eyebrows lifted in genuine surprise. "You've invited someone else today?"

A knowing smile played on Reginald's lips. "An old friend - someone quite special."

The distinction wasn't lost on Julian. Where he was merely a business associate, this mystery guest held personal significance to Reginald.

"May I ask who this esteemed individual is?" Julian inquired, curiosity piqued.

"Lucian Graves," Reginald revealed. "The visionary behind Quantum Innovations."

Quantum Innovations?

Julian certainly knew of the tech giant. Despite being founded only three years prior, the company's meteoric rise had become business legend. Its IPO in Sterling two years ago had sent shockwaves through the market, with valuations doubling repeatedly to cement its status as an industry titan.

The founder remained an enigma - no public appearances, no interviews. Only a name whispered in corporate circles: Lucian Graves.

Julian repeated the name silently, recalibrating his understanding of Reginald's connections. To count such a powerful recluse as a personal friend spoke volumes.

"We met during my time abroad," Reginald continued. "Found myself in a rather delicate situation, and Lucian...well, let's just say he has a particular talent for resolving complicated matters. Beyond that, his business acumen is unparalleled. We've maintained a close friendship ever since."

Reginald checked his platinum wristwatch. "He should be arriving any moment now."

The implication was clear - whatever business Julian had planned would need to wait for this more important guest. Julian schooled his features into polite interest, even as his mind raced with possibilities about the mysterious Lucian Graves' impending arrival.
###Chapter 813

Lucian was arriving?

Julian Blackwood arched an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued to finally encounter this enigmatic figure in person.

Meanwhile, Rosalind Fairchild remained in the private club's lavish lobby, her phone pressed to her ear as she conversed with Oliver.

"Whitmore Holdings has been drowning in negative publicity recently," Oliver explained. "Mr. Blackwood refuses all meetings. And since he's playing here at the club today, there's absolutely no chance he'll grant us an audience."

"Is there truly no way to reach Mr. Blackwood?" Rosalind pressed, her fingers tightening around her phone.

"Nothing comes to mind at the moment."

"Very well. I'll keep searching for a solution."

Ending the call, Rosalind's brow furrowed with determination. She needed to meet Reginald Blackwood today - it wasn't optional.

Just then, the deep purr of a high-performance engine announced an arrival. A sleek black Maybach glided to a stop at the club's entrance, immediately drawing the attention of security personnel who snapped to attention.

Who could command such respect?

Nearby, two receptionists exchanged excited whispers.

"Who is it? Why all the fuss?"

"Don't you know? That's Lucian Graves from Quantum Innovations!"

"You're joking! The reclusive tech billionaire who took Wall Street by storm last quarter?"

"I checked the guest list earlier. Today Mr. Blackwood is hosting—"

Lucian Graves?

Though not immersed in business circles, Rosalind had heard society women gushing about this rising star. To them, he represented the ultimate fantasy.

Never had she imagined crossing paths with this legend here.

A security detail in black suits opened the car's rear door, revealing a towering figure whose commanding presence instantly dominated the space.

"Good heavens!"

The receptionists gasped, their eyes sparkling with admiration.

"Look at his stature! Those shoulders!"

"Perfect proportions - broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist. He moves like a runway model!"

"But... why is he wearing that mask?"

Rosalind's bright eyes fixed on Lucian, recognition dawning.

Him...?

The same man she'd encountered twice before.

But hadn't he been driving a cab?

Now he stood revealed as Lucian Graves, tech mogul?

The man before her wore an exquisitely crafted black mask with intricate latticework, concealing his features. Only his piercing, ice-blue eyes were visible - cool and inscrutable, radiating an aura of mystery that only amplified his commanding presence.

Rosalind couldn't tear her gaze away. The tailored suit draped over his frame was perfection - the most striking she'd ever seen on any man.

Everett Sinclair never wore suits. Though he looked equally striking in shirts, just like Lucian...

Lost in thought, Rosalind barely registered Lucian striding into the lobby with effortless confidence, where the club manager and Reginald's assistant waited.

"Mr. Graves, Mr. Blackwood is expecting you. Right this way."

Lucian gave a single nod. "Proceed."

He moved to follow.

Rosalind blinked, shaking herself back to reality. Something about Lucian always reminded her of Everett - an inexplicable connection she couldn't define.

Quickly, she stepped forward. "Mr. Graves, hello."

Lucian paused, turning to face her.

Rosalind's eyes shone with hopeful energy. Seeing Lucian here felt fortuitous, especially when all avenues to Reginald seemed blocked.

"Do you remember me? We've met twice before. Last time, you were driving a cab - you even helped me escape an uncomfortable situation," she reminded him.
###Chapter 814

Rosalind Fairchild held her breath as Lucian Graves studied her. His piercing gaze made her pulse quicken.

"You remember me?" she asked hesitantly.

Lucian gave a slight nod. "Yes, I recall our encounter."

Relief flooded through her. "Wonderful! Let me reintroduce myself properly—I'm Rosalind Fairchild of Whitmore Holdings."

"Ms. Fairchild," Lucian acknowledged, his voice smooth yet unreadable.

Rosalind bit her lip. This man was an enigma—a tech mogul who still drove taxis in his spare time. What was his game?

She had to try. Even the slimmest chance was worth taking. She couldn't let Julian Blackwood dismantle her family's legacy.

"Mr. Graves, I have... an unconventional request." She steadied her voice. "I need to meet with Reginald Blackwood. Since you're acquainted with him, might you escort me?"

Lucian's expression remained neutral. "Your purpose?"

"Whitmore Holdings has a partnership with Blackwood Industries," she explained. "Recent complications have jeopardized our agreement. I must appeal to Mr. Blackwood directly. Will you assist me?"

"Very well," Lucian agreed simply.

Rosalind nearly gasped. "Thank you! This means everything—"

"However," Lucian interrupted, "as his associate, I'll determine when to broach the subject. You'll remain silent unless addressed. Understood?"

She nodded vigorously. "Absolutely."

"Follow me."

Lucian moved with purposeful strides through the exclusive club, Rosalind trailing closely.

Hope flared in her chest. Lucian Graves might just be her miracle. She'd repay this kindness properly later.

They arrived at a private lounge where Reginald Blackwood immediately rose to greet Lucian with a bear hug. "Graves! Finally gracing us with your presence!"

Julian Blackwood stood, eyeing the masked newcomer with open curiosity. "Mr. Graves, what an unexpected pleasure."

Reginald beamed. "Lucian, meet Julian Blackwood of Blackwood Industries."

Lucian inclined his head. "Mr. Blackwood."

Julian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "The elusive CEO of Quantum Innovations. Though I must ask—why the mask?"

"Personal preference," Lucian replied smoothly.

Julian chuckled, then froze as his gaze landed on Rosalind. His expression darkened instantly. "What is she doing here?"

Before Rosalind could speak, Julian snapped his fingers. Two security personnel materialized.

"This establishment has strict entry protocols," Julian hissed. "Remove this trespasser immediately!"

The guards advanced as Rosalind's heart plummeted. Would Lucian's protection prove insufficient after all?
###Chapter 815

Rosalind shot Julian a frosty glare. He was practically itching to throw her out.

Without hesitation, she seized Lucian's sleeve, her voice dropping to a hushed whisper. "Mr. Graves, please don’t let them take me away."

Lucian glanced down at her slender fingers gripping the pristine black fabric of his tailored suit. The stark contrast between her delicate skin and the dark material was impossible to ignore.

Reginald turned to Lucian with a raised brow. "Lucian, who is this?"

Since Rosalind stood slightly behind him, the question was naturally directed at Lucian.

Julian, too, had noticed Rosalind entering with Lucian. His jaw tightened. "Mr. Graves, do you know Rosalind? What exactly is your relationship with her?"

Lucian regarded Julian coolly. "Why does it concern you?"

Julian’s voice turned sharp. "You should know—she’s my fiancée."

Lucian’s gaze flickered to Rosalind. "Is that true?"

Rosalind shook her head vehemently. "It’s complicated. But one thing’s certain—I’m not marrying him!"

Hidden behind his mask, Lucian’s expression remained unreadable. Then, unexpectedly, he slid an arm around Rosalind’s shoulders, pulling her close.

She stiffened in surprise, while Julian’s face darkened.

Lucian addressed Reginald smoothly. "This is my girlfriend, Rosalind Fairchild. I brought her along tonight."

Reginald’s eyes widened with delight. "You finally have a girlfriend?"

Rosalind’s breath hitched. She hadn’t expected Lucian to claim her as his girlfriend.

He leaned in, his voice a low murmur against her ear. "It’s the only way to keep you here. Just play along."

Rosalind didn’t hesitate. "Oh, I don’t mind at all. In fact, I’m getting the better deal."

Being Lucian Graves’ "girlfriend" would give her the leverage she needed.

She looped her arm through his and flashed Reginald a dazzling smile. "Mr. Blackwood, it’s an honor to meet you. I’m Lucian’s… well, girlfriend. I’ve heard so much about you."

Reginald chuckled warmly. "The pleasure is mine, Ms. Fairchild."

He waved off the two security guards lingering nearby. "You may leave. Ms. Fairchild is my guest."

The guards bowed and retreated.

Julian looked like he’d been struck. Rosalind—Lucian’s girlfriend? Since when?

For the past three years, Rosalind had shown no interest in dating. Countless men had pursued her, yet she’d rejected them all.

Julian knew this better than anyone. So how had she suddenly become involved with Lucian Graves, the rising tech mogul?

"Mr. Graves, is this some kind of joke?" Julian demanded. "Rosalind is my fiancée!"

Rosalind scoffed. "I’ve told you—I’m not marrying you! I’m with Lucian now."

Julian’s eyes narrowed. "I don’t believe this. You’re faking it, aren’t you?"

Rosalind’s pulse spiked. He was too perceptive.

"Mr. Blackwood, they’re lying!" Julian turned to Reginald, his voice rising. "She’s just pretending!"
###Chapter 816
"Mr. Blackwood, I swear I'm Lucian's girlfriend. Don't believe his lies," Rosalind protested urgently.

Julian's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Prove it then."

"How?"

"Kiss him."

The demand was outrageous—Julian actually expected her to kiss Lucian in front of everyone!

Rosalind's gaze flickered to Lucian. His piercing gray eyes held hers, unreadable yet intense. A flush crept up her neck.

"Having second thoughts? I knew you were faking it!" Julian sneered. "Mr. Blackwood detests liars. When he finds out you're a fraud, you'll be tossed out on your pretty little—"

"Who said I'm hesitating?" Rosalind shot back, lifting her chin. "Lucian is mine. I'll kiss him whenever I please."

Rising on her toes, she leaned close enough to catch his sandalwood cologne. "No choice here," she whispered against his jaw. "May I?"

Lucian's thumb brushed her waist. "Commit to the role, darling."

His permission shouldn't have made her pulse spike.

Before she could overthink, Rosalind wound her arms around his neck and pressed her lips to his. The contact was electric—his mouth soft yet demanding, igniting memories of Everett's stolen kisses three years ago.

Everett had been her first everything. The way he'd traced constellations along her bare skin, whispering promises between heated breaths—

A sharp inhale brought her back. Rosalind broke the kiss, stepping away with trembling fingers.

"Satisfied?" she challenged Julian.

Julian's knuckles whitened around his whiskey glass. He'd been certain she'd balk at the dare. Instead, she'd kissed Lucian with a passion that made his gut twist.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

"Enough, Julian." Reginald Blackwood's voice cut through the tension. "Miss Fairchild is clearly Lucian's companion. Let's not ruin the afternoon."

The billionaire's verdict was final.

Julian's glare burned into Rosalind as she linked arms with Lucian, her smirk victorious.

"Shall we begin our game?" Lucian suggested smoothly.

"Excellent idea." Reginald turned to Rosalind. "Do you play, my dear?"

"Occasionally with my father," she admitted. "Though I'm hopeless compared to professionals."

Reginald chuckled. "Lucian here could outplay PGA champions. How about a wager? If you two win, I'll host dinner at The Celestial tonight."

Perfect. An intimate dinner would give her ample time to discuss Whitmore Holdings' hostile takeover.

Rosalind's eyes gleamed. "You're on. Don't expect mercy."

Reginald's booming laugh echoed across the emerald fairway. "I'd be disappointed otherwise!"
###Chapter 817

Rosalind, Lucian, Julian, and Reginald gathered for a round of golf. Rosalind partnered with Lucian, while Julian naturally teamed up with Reginald. The stakes were set—best two out of three.

Julian gripped his club with practiced ease. As the heir to Blackwood Industries, he had been swinging clubs since childhood, his reputation on the green well-earned.

A smirk curled his lips as he glanced at Rosalind. "Don't expect me to go easy on you. Prepare to lose."

Rosalind arched a brow. "Big words. Let's see if you can back them up."

Julian's confidence didn't waver. He adjusted his stance, took a smooth swing, and sent the ball soaring—straight into the hole on the first try.

Reginald clapped. "Impressive."

Golf was second nature to Julian. He turned to Rosalind with a triumphant grin. "One point to me. Now, let's see what Mr. Graves can do."

Rosalind knew Julian was skilled, but she wasn’t sure about Lucian’s abilities. She shot him a nervous glance. "How good are you at this?"

Lucian’s expression remained unreadable. He met her gaze, a flicker of amusement in his eyes. "Nervous?"

"Obviously. I’d like to win."

Lucian began undoing the buttons of his tailored black jacket. His fingers moved with deliberate precision, revealing the crisp white shirt beneath. The motion was so familiar—it reminded her of Everett.

His deep voice pulled her back. "What are you staring at?"

Rosalind flushed. "Nothing. Is that button stuck?"

Lucian’s lips quirked. "Maybe you could help?"

She understood—he wanted to play unhindered. Grateful he hadn’t refused, she stepped closer. "Of course."

Her fingers brushed against the cool silver buttons, undoing them carefully. Standing this close, she suddenly realized how intimate the act felt. Heat crept up her cheeks.

Lucian noticed. "You're blushing."

"I am not."

His chuckle was low, teasing. "Liar."

The words echoed something Everett had once said. Rosalind pushed the thought away, focusing on the last button.

"Done."

"Thanks."

Lucian shrugged off the jacket and handed it to her. "Hold this."

She took it, the fabric still warm from his body. The weight of it in her hands felt strangely personal—more so than she’d expected.
###Chapter 818

A dark, intense gaze suddenly pinned Rosalind where she stood. She lifted her chin to meet Julian's piercing eyes.

He had witnessed every playful exchange between her and Lucian moments ago, and his fury was palpable. The stark contrast in how she treated him versus Lucian only fueled his rage further.

Rosalind had initially felt awkward, but under Julian's scorching glare, her defiance flared. She met his stare head-on. "It's Lucian's turn now. He won't lose to you!"

Julian's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "I'll be watching very carefully."

Lucian accepted the golf club from Julian with quiet confidence.

Rosalind immediately cheered from her spot. "You've got this, Lucian!"

Their eyes met briefly before Lucian focused on the distant hole. With one fluid motion, he swung - the ball arced perfectly through the air and dropped straight into the target.

Rosalind's breath caught. She hadn't anticipated such skill. His form was impeccable, more refined even than Julian's - who had been golfing since childhood. The effortless grace of his movements was mesmerizing.

Her excitement bubbled over. "That's one point for us! Lucian, you're incredible!"

A subtle smile touched Lucian's lips in response.

Reginald applauded. "Your technique has improved remarkably. Now you're tied."

Initially, Julian hadn't considered Lucian a threat. But the undeniable chemistry between him and Rosalind changed everything. Lucian was boldly crossing into Julian's territory without hesitation.

As a man, Julian recognized the danger immediately.

He resolved to investigate Lucian thoroughly upon returning. This mysterious man's origins needed uncovering.

"Mr. Graves," Julian said coolly, "since we're tied, the next point decides everything. Let's leave it to Mr. Blackwood and Rosalind."

"Agreed."

Reginald stepped forward with the club. His swing sent the ball veering off course.

"Close attempt," Lucian remarked with amusement.

Reginald turned to Rosalind. "I may have missed, but honestly, Ms. Fairchild's golf skills are worse than mine. I'm genuinely curious to see her attempt."

Now under pressure, Rosalind felt nervousness creeping in.

Lucian moved to her side. "Feeling anxious?"

She nodded honestly. "If I'd known this would happen, I would've practiced properly. I really don't want to lose now."

Lucian studied her delicate features. "Golf is simpler than it appears. I can teach you."

"Really? Thank you!"

As Rosalind lifted the club, Lucian positioned himself behind her, his arms encircling her.

The sudden proximity froze her completely. Aside from Everett, no man had ever held her this way. Cradled against his chest, her petite frame seemed to fit perfectly. Every muscle in her body tensed.

Then, his warm breath brushed her ear as his deep voice murmured, "Focus on learning, not thinking."

The gentle reminder snapped her to attention. "Right."

Lucian guided her small hands with his own, beginning the lesson.
###Chapter 819

Lucian's deep, velvety voice brushed against Rosalind's ear like silk.

"Stand firm, shoulders back. Keep your gaze locked on the target. Channel your strength through your arms—swift but controlled." His instruction carried the precision of a master archer teaching form. "Concentration is everything. Where your mind goes, the ball follows."

Rosalind's fingers tightened around the club. For a fleeting moment, Everett's face surfaced in her thoughts.

"You remind me of someone," she murmured.

Lucian stilled. "Who?"

She exhaled, shaking her head.

His dark eyes studied her. "An ex?"

A nod.

"Still in contact?"

Her lips curved without humor. "Three years of silence."

"And yet you're thinking of him now." His voice dropped. "Do you still care?"

Rosalind met his gaze. "I think I've got the hang of this. Thanks for the lesson."

She shut down the conversation like closing a book.

Lucian released her, stepping back. "Show me what you've learned."

As she adjusted her grip, that familiar prickle of awareness crept up her neck. She glanced up—Julian stood at the edge of the green, jaw clenched.

He'd been watching. Again.

First the jacket adjustment. Now this. Julian's knuckles whitened around his own club.

Rosalind turned away.

Reginald's voice broke the tension. "Your turn, Ms. Fairchild."

She flashed a quick smile. "Let's see if I can embarrass myself less this time."

Planting her feet, she visualized Lucian's guidance—posture, focus, follow-through. The club swung in a clean arc.

Thwack.

The ball dropped into the cup with satisfying finality.

Rosalind whirled, beaming. "Did you see that? We won!" Without thinking, she threw her arms around Lucian. His woodsy cologne enveloped her as his hands steadied her waist.

Reginald chuckled. "Well played. Lucian, your protégé is a natural."

Reality crashed back. Rosalind sprang away, cheeks flaming. "Sorry, I got carried away—"

Lucian's smile softened the sharp angles of his face. "You were brilliant."

Julian materialized beside them, voice dripping ice. "Color me impressed."

Rosalind tilted her chin. "Turns out I'm full of surprises."

Reginald clapped his hands. "Dinner's on me, as promised. The chef here does miracles with truffles."

Her pulse jumped. Whitmore Holdings isn't lost yet.

Lucian's fingers brushed her elbow. "Looks like you're stuck with me a while longer."

"Guess I'll survive," she teased.

A staff member approached. "Your suite is ready, Mr. Graves. Will Ms. Fairchild be joining you?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. "Wait—we're sharing a room?"

Lucian's thumb traced idle circles on her wrist. "Problem?"

The air between them crackled.

Somewhere behind them, Julian's glass shattered against a stone planter.
###Chapter 820
Lucian gave a firm nod. "Absolutely."

Rosalind hesitated, biting her lower lip. "Perhaps we should request separate rooms."

She turned toward the door, her fingers brushing the handle.

In one swift motion, Lucian caught her wrist and guided her backward until her shoulders met the cool wall. His towering frame caged her in.

"W-what are you doing?" Her breath hitched as she stared up at him.

He braced one hand against the wallpaper, his lips curling into that infuriating smirk she knew too well. "We're supposed to be lovers, darling. If you go out there demanding two rooms and William catches wind of it, our cover is blown. Do you really want to be sent packing?"

Rosalind shook her head vehemently. "Of course not! But sharing a bathroom feels... inappropriate."

Lucian's grin widened. "Why? Were you hoping to join me?" He deliberately lowered his voice on the last words, watching with satisfaction as her cheeks flushed crimson.

"Absolutely not!"

"Then what's the issue? We'll take turns. Unless..." He arched a brow, "you're imagining something else?"

Rosalind pressed her lips together. Damn him for being logical.

Lucian checked his watch. "William's expecting us for dinner. Who showers first—you or me?"

"You go," she muttered.

"Excellent."

He pushed off the wall, releasing her, and strode toward the bathroom without a backward glance.

When the door clicked shut, Rosalind exhaled sharply. The lingering scent of his cologne—something expensive with notes of sandalwood and bergamot—still clung to the air.

It was nothing like Everett's natural warmth that reminded her of sun-drenched meadows. Lucian smelled like polished leather and midnight secrets.

Yet sometimes, when the light caught his profile just right...

The shower turned on, snapping her from her thoughts. Rosalind pulled out her phone, scrolling through design concepts for her upcoming collection.

A melodic chime interrupted her.

Lucian's sleek phone vibrated insistently on the duvet. She hesitated—it felt intrusive to answer. But after the fifth ring, concern won out.

Knocking lightly on the bathroom door, she called, "You're getting persistent calls. Might be important."

"Bring it here," came his muffled reply.

Assuming he'd finished, Rosalind turned the knob—

And froze.

Her gasp echoed off the tiles as she whirled away, heart hammering. "You—you're not—!"

Steam curled around Lucian's bare torso, water glistening down his sculpted shoulders. He didn't even have the decency to look surprised.

"Problem, darling?"
###Chapter 821

Lucian moved silently behind Rosalind. "Lower your voice," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "These walls have ears. Wouldn't want anyone getting the wrong idea about us."

Rosalind felt heat rush to her cheeks. She'd assumed he'd finished dressing, but the man stood half-clothed before her.

To be precise, he wore tailored black trousers while his sculpted torso remained bare.

That fleeting glance had seared itself into her memory - golden skin stretched over broad shoulders, tapered waist leading to those hypnotic V-lines disappearing beneath his waistband. After three celibate years, the sight short-circuited her brain.

Now with his deep voice vibrating against her back, her knees threatened to buckle.

"My apologies," she stammered.

"Did you need something?" Lucian inquired.

Turning slowly, Rosalind kept her gaze lowered, unable to meet his eyes. "Your phone."

He accepted the device and answered. "Graves speaking."

"Mr. Graves, we have an urgent contract requiring your signature at headquarters..."

Rosalind recognized the female voice as his assistant reporting business matters.

She watched as Lucian transferred the phone from left to right hand - and froze.

Everett had possessed that identical habit of switching hands during calls. Why did Lucian mirror Everett's mannerisms so precisely?

Faces could be altered, but ingrained habits never lied.

A daring suspicion ignited in her mind.

Ending the call, Lucian caught her staring. One corner of his mouth lifted. "See something you like?"

"What happened to your face?" The question burst from her lips.

He stilled. "That's rather personal."

"Were your injuries severe? What did you look like before?"

Silence stretched between them before he replied, "That's private history. Your curiosity borders on inappropriate."

Rosalind knew she trespassed on painful memories, yet pressed on. "Why won't you tell me? What was your original appearance?" Her voice held desperate urgency.

Lucian chuckled darkly. "Why this sudden interest in my past? Hoping to audition as my girlfriend?"

Her breath hitched. "I-"

"Careful, darling. Some doors shouldn't be opened." He turned to leave.

Rosalind seized his wrist. When he glanced back, she met his gaze squarely.

"You remind me so strongly of someone."

"Who?" His eyes darkened. "You've mentioned this before yet refuse to name him."

"I need to know if you're him," she insisted, fingers tightening around his wrist.
###Chapter 822
"How exactly do you intend to verify this?" Lucian inquired, his voice laced with skepticism.

Rosalind's gaze traveled downward from his sculpted torso, lingering hesitantly before she stammered, "Would you... remove your trousers?"

Lucian's eyes darkened instantly, the intensity in them making her pulse race.

Was it the audacity of her request or the terrifying possibility that Lucian might truly be Everett that made her heart hammer against her ribs?

"The man I knew... had a distinctive birthmark there. I need to see it."

Lucian's throat worked as he swallowed. "And if I refuse? I'm not inclined to undress for you."

No—she couldn't back down now. She had to know the truth.

Rosalind stepped closer, desperation bleeding into her voice. "Please. Just one look."

When Lucian turned to leave, she darted in front of him, blocking his path. "If you won't do it yourself, then I'll—"

Her fingers closed around the sleek, expensive belt at his waist, the cool leather foreign against her skin. "Don't hate me for this."

She fumbled with the intricate buckle, her hands trembling.

Three years ago, Everett had never worn belts. The weight of this one felt alien, a stark reminder that even if this man was Everett, he wasn't the same person anymore.

He had risen to power in the corporate world.

Was his refusal to acknowledge his past because he no longer cared for her?

Her inexperience betrayed her—no matter how hard she tugged, the belt wouldn't yield.

Lucian observed her struggle with an unreadable expression. "Was he your lover?"

Rosalind's lashes fluttered.

"You know such intimate details about him. Did you share a bed?" His voice was low, probing.

Heat flooded her cheeks, staining her pale skin crimson. She pulled harder, her fingers accidentally brushing against something firm and searing—so hot it sent a jolt through her.

With a gasp, she recoiled, stumbling back.

But Lucian caught her chin, tilting her face up to his. "Why stop now?"

Their breaths mingled, lips barely apart.

Rosalind searched his eyes—those familiar, piercing depths—and her knees nearly buckled. "Is it you? Tell me. I need to know."

His voice softened, almost tender. "Does it truly matter that much?"

"To me, it does," she whispered. "Everett... Is that really—mmph!"

Without warning, Lucian crushed his lips to hers.

The kiss was sudden, electrifying. Rosalind's eyes flew wide in shock. She hadn't expected this.

Her palms pressed against his chest, pushing weakly. "Stop—"

But Lucian spun her around, pinning her against the wall. His body burned against her back as his mouth trailed along her hair, then her ear.

"You can't even undo a belt," he murmured, his breath hot against her skin. "Tell me, Rosalind—has your fiancé Julian never touched you in all these years?"

Her breath hitched, tears pricking her eyes. "Everett... Is it you?"

Lucian nipped at her earlobe, the sharp sting making her gasp.

The sound seemed to unravel something in him. His arms tightened around her waist, pulling her flush against him, his desire unmistakable.

In a rough, heated whisper, he demanded, "Do you want me?"
###Chapter 823

Rosalind pressed her back against the cool tiles, her fingers digging into the grout lines. "Who are you really asking about?"

Lucian's lips brushed the delicate shell of her ear. "What do you mean?"

"Are you asking if I want Everett...or Lucian?"

Instead of answering, Lucian countered, "Who do you want it to be?"

A mischievous smile curved Rosalind's lips. In one swift motion, she turned her head and captured his mouth with hers.

Lucian froze momentarily, startled by her unexpected boldness. Then his hands cradled her face as he deepened the kiss with desperate intensity.

They poured three years of longing into that kiss—Rosalind's fingers clutching his shoulders, Lucian drinking her in like a man starved.

She twisted back around, her fingertips tracing the ridges of his toned abdomen. Lucian buried his face in the crook of her neck, inhaling her familiar scent.

"It's you," Rosalind whispered against his skin.

Lucian pressed his lips to her cascading hair.

Tears glistened in Rosalind's eyes. "Truthfully, I didn't need to see that birthmark. I always knew."

From their very first encounter at Westfield University, some part of her had recognized him. She'd simply been too afraid to trust her instincts.

Now, all doubt had vanished. This was undeniably him.

The only remaining question—should she call him Everett, or Lucian?

Strong arms encircled Rosalind's waist as Lucian lifted her onto the marble countertop. His darkened gaze held hers before claiming her lips again with bruising intensity.

Rosalind reached up and tore away his mask.

The scarred visage that greeted her made Lucian stiffen. He started to pull away, but Rosalind seized his wrist. "What happened to you?"

The handsome face she remembered was now a landscape of healed wounds and twisted tissue.

Lucian studied her reaction, his mouth quirking bitterly. "I know I'm hideous now. Does it frighten you?"

Tears spilled down Rosalind's cheeks as she answered by pulling him into another searing kiss. Her lips conveyed everything words couldn't—her grief, her longing, her unwavering devotion.

Lucian's breathing grew ragged. His fingers worked at her buttons as he rasped, "Tell me you want this. I need you." Rosalind responded by tugging at his belt buckle with renewed urgency.

Lucian stilled her hands. "Like this." He guided her fingers to the release mechanism.

The metallic click of his belt unfastening seemed deafening in the charged silence.

Garments fell away as years of pent-up desire threatened to consume them. After three agonizing years apart, they ached to become one again.

Then—the shrill ringtone sliced through the moment. Lucian's phone lit up with Reginald Blackwood's name.

Reality came crashing back. Rosalind hadn't forgotten why she'd come tonight—Whitmore Holdings still needed saving.

She nudged him gently. "It's Mr. Blackwood."

Lucian's voice was rough with desire. "Later."

"You should answer."

"I said later."

"Please...just take it now."

That single whispered "please" unraveled Lucian completely. She sounded exactly like the Rosalind he'd fallen for—the vibrant heiress who'd clung to him with such fierce love.

With a frustrated groan, Lucian broke away to answer. "Yes?"

Even as he spoke, his burning gaze never left hers. Rosalind worried her lower lip between her teeth, her hands restless against his chest.

Lucian struggled to steady his breathing as Reginald's voice came through: "Are you and Ms. Fairchild ready? I've secured the private dining room at The Grand View. When shall we depart?"
###Chapter 824

Lucian's breaths came in short, uneven gasps.

Through the phone, Reginald's voice carried confusion. "Lucian? Why the silence? What's happening? Your breathing sounds..."

Lucian's vision blurred with unshed tears. "We'll be ready shortly..."

A knowing chuckle echoed through the line. "Ah! I always pegged you as the monastic type. Color me surprised when you actually got involved with someone..."

The words dissolved into static as Lucian's world narrowed to a single point of white-hot intensity. Then - fireworks. A supernova behind his eyelids.

His forehead dropped onto Rosalind's bare shoulder.

"Lucian?" Reginald's voice pierced through again.

Gravel scraped Lucian's throat as he gripped the phone. "Later."

"Understood."

The call ended. Lucian's lips found Rosalind's skin - tracing constellations across her cheekbones, charting courses down to her parted lips.

She was his first. His only. The delicate socialite with steel in her spine. He'd been a boy when they met. Three years apart had forged him into something hungrier, more dangerous. The craving bordered on violence.

Rosalind matched his hunger. Her fingers tangled in his hair, pulling him closer.

But duty called. With Herculean effort, Lucian broke away. "Reginald's waiting."

Rosalind nodded. "There's something I must ask him."

"Whatever you need," Lucian rasped, "it's yours."

She understood Everett Sinclair, the scholarship student. But Lucian Graves - the tech titan with blood on his hands - remained an enigma.

Another nod. "I know."

They dressed in silence. The restaurant hummed with discreet luxury when they arrived.

Reginald had chosen a Francais-inspired establishment. As servers presented the third course, Rosalind straightened her spine.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'll be frank - tonight isn't purely social."

Reginald's fork paused mid-air. "Whitmore Holdings, I presume?"

Rosalind's lashes fluttered. "You're aware?"

"Lucian briefed me." A knowing smile. "The Whitmore heiress, correct?"

She shot Lucian a startled glance. He'd laid all their cards on the table.

Reginald continued, "Whitmore's instability concerns me. By all rights, I should terminate our merger."

Rosalind's knuckles whitened around her wineglass. "Please, if you'd just-"

"No need for dramatics, Ms. Fairchild." Reginald swirled his Bordeaux. "Lucian made a compelling case. We'll proceed."

Hope ignited in her chest. No termination?

"That's... incredible! Thank you!"

"Don't thank me yet." Reginald's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Clean house quickly, or we all drown."

"Absolutely. We'll safeguard your interests."

"Excellent." Reginald raised his glass. "To partnerships."

Crystal chimed as Rosalind joined the toast. "Thank you!"

Reginald chuckled. "Save your gratitude for Lucian. I wondered why he suddenly developed a passion for golf."

The unspoken truth hung between them - every favor came with strings attached. Rosalind just hoped the price wouldn't destroy them both.
###Chapter 825
What?

Rosalind froze, utterly stunned.

Lucian had come to play golf... for her?

At this critical moment when Whitmore Holdings teetered on the edge of collapse, its funds dangerously depleted, he stood firmly by her side.

Her heart swelled with overwhelming gratitude. Those luminous eyes shimmered as they met his. "Thank you."

She meant every syllable.

Lucian's lips curved into that faint, knowing smile she'd grown to recognize. "Don't mention it."

The evening concluded with warmth lingering in the air. After Reginald's departure, Rosalind found herself walking alongside Lucian beneath the restaurant's golden awning.

She turned to him, the city lights reflecting in her gaze. "I can't possibly express how much this means. Without your intervention, Mr. Blackwood would have severed ties with Whitmore Holdings completely."

Lucian shook his head, the movement almost imperceptible. "The pleasure was mine. Consider it repayment for everything you've done for Lillian these past years."

At the mention of his sister, Rosalind's entire demeanor brightened. "You should see her now—absolutely brilliant these past three years. Truthfully, I barely guided her. She achieved everything through sheer determination. Just got accepted into a prestigious research program—only comes home fortnightly now. When she returns, we must arrange a reunion."

Lucian observed the genuine pride radiating from Rosalind. He knew better than anyone that without the Whitmore family's protection, even Lillian's brilliance could have been extinguished long ago. They'd been her unshakable fortress.

Rosalind's smile turned playful. "I've compiled years of Lillian's photos—wait until you see how she's blossomed—"

Mid-sentence, strong arms enveloped her.

She stiffened in surprise.

Lucian held her firmly, his voice a velvet murmur against her ear. "Rosalind... thank you."

A smirk tugged at her lips. "That didn't sound particularly heartfelt."

He loosened his grip just enough to cradle her face. Then his lips claimed hers in a kiss that sent tremors down her spine.

That same liquid weakness from their hotel encounter flooded her senses. Her fingers tangled in his hair for balance as her knees threatened to buckle.

When they parted, Lucian's darkened gaze held hers. "Must you return tonight?"

Dazed, Rosalind barely registered the question. "What?"

His thumb traced her swollen lower lip. "If your parents wouldn't object... come home with me."

The implication ignited her cheeks. "Y-Your place? Why would I—" She cut herself off, mortified.

Lucian's chuckle vibrated against her skin. "What do you imagine?"

Before she could formulate a response, an approaching voice interrupted. "Lucian."

Rosalind sprang back as if scalded. Turning, she recognized Reginald—Lucian's longtime friend—accompanied by a striking woman she'd never seen before.

Genevieve.

The name clicked into place. The refined doctor who'd been overseeing Lucian's care.

Reginald's gaze flickered between them with barely concealed amusement. "Ms. Fairchild? What a... pleasant surprise."

Rosalind smoothed her dress with practiced composure. "Reginald. It's been too long."

His grin turned razor-sharp. "Well, you are the Whitmore heiress. People like us rarely merit your attention."

The ice in his tone crystallized the air between them. Rosalind's smile faltered as the unspoken hostility settled over the group like frost.
###Chapter 826

Rosalind's fingers trembled slightly as she recalled how different things had been three years ago. Back then, Reginald had adored her. In fact, everyone close to Everett had treated her with warmth.

But now? The hostility radiating from Reginald was palpable. And then there was Genevieve—a woman Rosalind had never met before, yet who clearly held a significant place in Lucian's life.

Genevieve's attentive gestures spoke volumes. She knew exactly how Lucian liked his coffee, when he needed his documents organized, even the way he preferred his ties knotted.

Rosalind curled her hands into fists, nails biting into her palms. Words failed her.

Reginald shot Lucian an impatient look. "We're starving. The fondue ingredients are ready—Genevieve prepared everything. We've been waiting for you."

Genevieve turned to Rosalind with polite detachment. "Would you care to join us, Ms. Fairchild?"

Before Rosalind could respond, Reginald cut in sharply. "She's busy. Let's go, Lucian."

He tugged at Lucian's sleeve.

Lucian hesitated, his gaze lingering on Rosalind. "Let me take you home first."

Rosalind forced a smile. The message was clear—she wasn't welcome. "Don't worry about me. My driver's waiting. You should go."

Reginald scoffed. "See? She's fine. Let's go already."

With a final nod, Lucian let himself be pulled away. "I'll see you soon."

Rosalind's lips curved in a brittle imitation of a smile. "Of course."

She stood frozen as the sleek black car swallowed them whole, tires whispering against the pavement before vanishing around the corner.

The distance between them wasn't just physical. Three years had carved a canyon she didn't know how to cross.

She knew nothing about what had happened to Everett during that time—nothing about the scars marring his face, nothing about the wife he'd married three years ago, nothing about Genevieve's role in his life.

She had imagined their reunion a thousand times. Explanations. Apologies. Reconciliation.

Instead—silence.

A familiar voice sliced through her thoughts. "He's gone. Why are you still staring?"

Rosalind turned to face Julian Blackwood.

Of course. He just couldn't resist twisting the knife.

She lifted her chin. "Mr. Blackwood already agreed to maintain the partnership with Whitmore Holdings. Your little scheme failed."

Julian's lips curled into a smirk. "You think you've got Lucian wrapped around your finger? That woman—Genevieve? She's been his girlfriend for three years."

Rosalind's breath hitched.

Girlfriend.

Julian stepped closer, savoring her reaction. "They're inseparable. While you were pining, he moved on."

The words landed like a physical blow.

All this time, she'd believed Everett was waiting, just as she had. That their love had been suspended in time.

But he'd had someone else. First his wife. Now Genevieve.

She was the only one who'd stayed frozen in place.

Rosalind's vision blurred. A hot, suffocating pressure built behind her ribs.

Julian studied her with cold amusement. "Does it hurt that much?"

She met his gaze, voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "You already had Lucian investigated. You know exactly who he is."

Julian's jaw tightened.

Oh, he knew. His men had dug through every layer of Lucian Graves' identity until they hit bedrock—the truth that Lucian was Everett Sinclair.

That bastard had survived everything. The acid attack. The car plummeting off the cliff.

And now he'd returned, reborn as Lucian Graves.
###Chapter 827

Rosalind met Julian's gaze without flinching.

"You already know Lucian's true identity. Why ask? Of course I'm devastated—I love him!"

Julian's expression darkened instantly. "What—"

Rosalind shoved him away with surprising force and turned on her heel.

Julian remained frozen, his piercing cold stare fixed on the direction where Rosalind and Everett had vanished.

Three years ago, he had torn them apart effortlessly. Now, he wouldn't let them reunite.

The sleek black limousine sped through the city streets. Everett and Genevieve sat in the back while Reginald drove.

Reginald smirked through the rearview mirror. "So, you finally told Ms. Fairchild who you really are?"

Everett shot him a warning glance. "Drop the hostility toward her."

"After everything she did to you? Have you forgotten? You nearly died searching for her after that mission, and what did she do? Betrayed you for Julian. They were engaged! She saw you as nothing but a mistake—sent men to disfigure you, pushed your car off a cliff! Do you even remember those three years of hell?"

Reginald's voice burned with fury.

Everett's jaw tightened. "She didn't know. I don't believe she ordered any of it."

"Even if not her, it was Julian. They're both poison! You clawed your way back from death—why throw yourself into the war between Whitmore Holdings and Blackwood Industries? Why risk everything for her again?"

"She raised Lillian these past three years," Everett murmured.

"Enough excuses! The truth is, you never stopped loving her. Now that you're a tech mogul and Whitmore Holdings is crumbling, she's clinging to you. One kiss and you forget everything. Wake up—she's using you!"

Everett remembered Rosalind's warmth in the dim bathroom light. It didn't take much to undo him.

Reginald's worry ran deep. Three years ago, he'd found Everett—then Dwight—at the cliff's base, barely breathing, his face mutilated, body broken. A miracle he'd survived.

He'd never understand why Everett still wanted Rosalind.

Through the mirror, Reginald studied Everett—immaculate in his tailored black suit, every inch the untouchable billionaire.

But Dwight had been part of Everett, and Rosalind had been Dwight's entire world.

That refined heiress had been the brightest firework in Dwight's life. Forgetting her was impossible.

Yet Reginald would never accept them together again.

Genevieve spoke softly, "Everett, as your physician these past three years, my orders stand. Your health comes first. Nothing else matters."

She'd grown up with Everett and Reginald—brilliant, dedicated.

When Reginald had brought Everett to her, half-dead, she'd worked miracles to save him. Never left his side since.

Reginald adored her. He saw her devotion clearly.

Smirking, he said, "Forget Ms. Fairchild. Maybe consider Genevieve instead."

Genevieve flushed. "Reginald! Stop that."

Three years ago, when Reginald had carried Everett's broken body to her, she'd poured everything into saving him. Never left his side.

Reginald loved her for it.

"She's not right for you," he pressed. "Think about Genevieve."

Genevieve's cheeks burned. "Oh, stop teasing!"

###Chapter 828

The tension in the car thickened instantly.

Lucian's voice cut through the silence like a blade. "Reginald, that's not something to joke about."

Genevieve froze in her seat, her fingers tightening around the edge of her coat.

His tone turned icy. "I appreciate everything Genevieve has done for me these past three years, but she is only a friend. I don’t find humor in remarks like that."

The warmth drained from Genevieve's face, leaving her pale. She had always known Lucian didn’t return her feelings—he had never given her false hope.

But she refused to surrender. A man like Lucian was rare. How many marriages were built on love alone?

She was certain she was the perfect match for him.

Reginald lifted his hands in mock surrender. "Alright, alright. No more jokes. I’ll keep my eyes on the road."

Silence settled over them again. Lucian pulled out his phone, his thumb hovering over the screen.

He wanted to message Rosalind, but the words wouldn’t come. What could he even say?

Rosalind stepped through the front door of her family’s estate.

Alistair, now recovered, sat in the living room with Victoria.

He rose when he saw her. "You’re home late. Where were you?"

She hurried to his side. "Sit down, Dad. I met with Mr. Blackwood today. He confirmed he won’t terminate our partnership."

Victoria’s face brightened. "Really? That’s wonderful! Did you go alone?"

Rosalind shook her head. "No. I ran into Mr. Graves. He helped me."

"Mr. Graves?" Alistair’s brows lifted. "You mean Lucian Graves, the tech prodigy?"

The business world was small, and Lucian’s name carried weight. Taking a company public in three years was no small feat.

Rosalind nodded. "Yes, that’s him."

Alistair frowned. "But you two never crossed paths before. Why would he intervene?"

She hesitated only a moment before answering. "Because… Lucian is Everett."

"What?"

Alistair stiffened.

Victoria’s eyes widened. "Everett? Your ex from three years ago?"

When Rosalind had been dating Everett, Victoria had been abroad. She’d rushed home to meet him—only for him to vanish before she could.

Rosalind confirmed quietly, "Yes."

Alistair chuckled, shaking his head. "No wonder. I wondered where this rising star came from. It’s Everett. I always knew he was extraordinary."

Victoria, however, focused on her daughter. She reached for Rosalind’s hand. "Are you two back together?"

Rosalind tensed, then shook her head. "No."

"Why not?" Victoria pressed. "I know you never stopped thinking about him."

A beat of silence. Then, softly, Rosalind admitted, "He’s with someone else now."

Victoria’s breath caught. "What?"

Rosalind stood abruptly. "I’m exhausted. I’m going upstairs."

"Of course," Victoria murmured.

Upstairs, Rosalind stepped into her bathroom and turned on the shower.

As she shed her coat, her reflection caught her eye—the marks on her neck, left by Lucian, stood out starkly against her skin.

Memories of their heated encounter in the shower flooded back.

Her legs gave way. She slid down the wall until she sat on the cold tiles, arms wrapped around her knees.

Three years ago, he had walked away without a word.

She had watched him marry another woman.

And now, without explanation, he had moved on again.

What had she done wrong?
###Chapter 829
Rosalind felt utterly foolish.

In this twisted dance between them, she had been the only one running forward with open arms.

She burned to demand answers from him: Why? Why did he treat her this way?

Her fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone, navigating to Lucian's chat.

Words poured from her fingertips—raw, unfiltered questions.

[Why did you vanish three years ago? What happened to the woman you married? Are you with Genevieve now? If she’s yours, why did you kiss me? Why touch me like that?]

Her mind was a storm of unspoken accusations.

Meanwhile, Lucian had just arrived at his penthouse. He stood in the bathroom, steam curling around him as he prepared to shower.

His phone buzzed in his hand. He glanced down, noticing Rosalind’s typing indicator flickering.

His pulse quickened. Was she finally going to speak her mind? He waited, anticipation coiling tight in his chest.

But the typing stopped. Started again. Then—nothing.

Frustration gnawed at him. He typed a single line.

[Talk to me.]

Rosalind’s breath hitched. What right did she even have to ask? What position was she in? The questions choked her, but sending them felt impossible.

Then, his message appeared.

[Talk to me.]

So like him—blunt, yet unreachable.

Her fingers hovered before she forced out a reply. [Thanks for today.]

Lucian’s lips quirked at her evasion. [That’s all you have to say?]

Confusion tangled her thoughts. Was he with Genevieve now? Or Reginald? Once, Reginald had called her by her first name. Now it was always "Ms. Fairchild."

[Am I interrupting? Don’t feel obligated to reply.]

He caught the dismissal and chuckled darkly. [Going to bed?]

[Yes.]

His response came swiftly. [I won’t be sleeping anytime soon.]

He couldn’t. Not with her haunting his thoughts.

Rosalind’s stomach twisted. If he were with Genevieve, he wouldn’t be going to bed early.

What were they doing together?

Earlier, in the dim bathroom, his body had been desperate, hungry. She had assumed he’d been alone all these years.

Clearly, she was wrong.

Without another word, she closed the app and turned off her phone.



Lucian set his phone on the marble counter, staring at his reflection. Slowly, he peeled off the sleek black mask, revealing the scars beneath.

Would she still want this ruined face?

She had once traced his features with worship. Now, she flinched.

Since the accident, he hadn’t cared what anyone thought—except her.

That flicker of fear in her eyes when she first saw him had nearly destroyed him.

He stepped under the icy spray, but the water did nothing to cool the fire in his veins. His mind replayed Rosalind’s boldness, her passion, the way she’d melted against him.

Sleep was impossible.

She had kept him awake for three years.

Every. Damn. Night.

With a rough exhale, he gave in, his hand sliding down.

Did Rosalind still love him?

Across town, Alistair was handling the fallout from the incident. Rosalind, withdrawn and despondent, was dragged out by Victoria for dinner.

They settled into a secluded booth at an upscale bistro.

Victoria pinched Rosalind’s chin. "Smile, darling. The world hasn’t ended."

But it sure felt like it had.
###Chapter 830
Rosalind didn't want her mother to worry, so she painted on a bright smile. "Alright, Mother."

"That's my girl. Let's get some lunch."

Just as they turned, a familiar voice called out. "Rosalind?"

She looked up to see Julian Ashford, heir to the Ashford fortune and a childhood friend.

Julian was the epitome of aristocratic refinement. He bowed slightly. "Lady Whitmore, Rosalind. What a pleasant surprise! Here for lunch?"

Victoria nodded gracefully. "Indeed. Are you dining with your family?"

Julian gestured ahead. "Just my mother—she's waiting by the fountain."

Victoria turned to Rosalind. "Why don't you catch up with Julian? I'll go greet Lady Ashford."

Rosalind acquiesced. "Of course."

Once alone, Julian studied Rosalind with concern. "You've grown thinner. Has something been troubling you?"

She shook her head. "Nonsense. If anything, I've put on weight."

Julian's lips curved into a knowing smile. "True beauty needs no adornment to captivate."

This drew a genuine laugh from Rosalind. Among their social circle, Julian stood apart—the youngest tenured professor at an Ivy League institution, his words always laced with poetic elegance.

"Flatterer," she teased.

Her gaze then caught on a nearby display. Among the leather-bound volumes sat Julian's latest publication.

"Is this your new work?"

He nodded modestly. "Just an academic treatise on ancient civilizations. Probably too dry for your tastes."

"I'll be the judge of that," Rosalind countered.

She stretched for the book.

The shelf proved just beyond her reach, even on tiptoe.

Julian effortlessly retrieved it. "Allow me."

Rosalind accepted it with a smile. "Thank you."

Suddenly, the hairs on her neck prickled.

She turned toward the restaurant's entrance.

There stood Lucian Graves.

Dressed in his signature all-black ensemble, the Quantum Innovations CEO cut an imposing figure. The partial obsidian mask he wore added an air of dangerous mystique, drawing every eye in the room.

Rosalind hadn't noticed his arrival. Now those piercing silver eyes locked onto her and Julian with unsettling intensity.

Her breath hitched.



A group of executives materialized around Lucian. "Mr. Graves, your table is ready."

They began moving through the narrow corridor.

Julian protectively pulled Rosalind aside. "Careful."

She clutched the book tighter as they stepped back.

The entourage passed by.

One executive recognized them. "Professor Ashford, Miss Fairchild."

Julian inclined his head. "Mr. Pembroke."

Lucian paused, eyeing Julian. "A professor so young?"

Lawrence Pembroke nodded obsequiously. "The brightest mind of his generation. And might I say, he and Miss Fairchild make quite the striking pair."

Rosalind's jaw tightened. Last night's "thank you" had been her silent farewell.

If Lucian had moved on, so would she.
###Chapter 831

Perhaps Rosalind and Everett's story had truly ended three years ago.

Yet destiny had its own twisted sense of humor—no matter how far Rosalind tried to distance herself, their paths kept crossing. She had come here for a simple meal, and there he stood, Lucian Graves, right before her.

When the executives remarked how perfectly she and Julian complemented each other, Rosalind offered nothing more than a polite, practiced smile.

But Lucian interpreted that smile differently. Silence could be mistaken for agreement, and with both Rosalind and Julian unattached, speculation was inevitable.

Julian chuckled lightly. "Mr. Whitmore, let's not tease Rosalind like this. I don’t mind, but she might get flustered."

The other businessmen exchanged knowing smirks.

"Didn’t realize you were so protective, Professor Ashford."

"You and Ms. Fairchild seem quite close."

"Enough joking," one executive interjected. "Are you two here for lunch?"

Julian nodded. "Yes. Mrs. Whitmore and my mother are here as well."

He glanced toward the entrance. Lucian followed his gaze and spotted a group of elegantly dressed women—Rosalind’s mother Victoria, Julian’s mother Margaret Ashford, and several high-society socialites—laughing together.

Lucian’s expression remained unreadable as he averted his eyes.

Then, one of the executives spoke up. "Mr. Graves, I noticed you looking at Ms. Fairchild earlier. How do you know each other?"

Instead of answering, Lucian turned his piercing gaze to Rosalind. "Ms. Fairchild, do we know each other?"

He redirected the question to her, forcing her to respond.

Rosalind’s lashes flickered briefly before she answered smoothly, "Yes, we’ve met. He once helped me, and I remain grateful."

Her words were gracious, yet carefully measured to maintain distance.

A shadow of something unreadable flickered in Lucian’s cold, sharp eyes.

"Ah, what a coincidence!" someone remarked. "Mr. Graves actually assisted Ms. Fairchild?"

"Let’s go," Lucian cut in abruptly.

"Right, we’re here today to discuss business with Mr. Graves. His time is valuable, so we shouldn’t keep him waiting."

The executives followed as Lucian strode away without another glance.

Julian watched his retreating figure. "So that’s the prodigy of Quantum Innovations—Lucian Graves. He looks young, probably around our age."

Rosalind nodded. "Yes, he is."

"Rumor has it he built his empire from nothing. Self-made men like him are rare these days. Truly remarkable," Julian mused, admiration clear in his voice.

Rosalind’s gaze lingered where Lucian had disappeared. Three years ago, he had been a struggling nobody. Now, he was a titan of industry. The journey between those two lives must have been brutal.

Just then, Victoria called from the private dining room. "Rosalind, come along. We’re waiting."

Rosalind turned to Julian. "I should go."

He smiled. "Of course. See you later."

Inside the dining room, Victoria studied her daughter over the meal. "What do you think of Julian?"

Rosalind considered her words. "He’s kind, intelligent, and refined. A man of excellent character."

Victoria’s lips curved knowingly. "Perhaps you should give him a chance."
###Chapter 832


Rosalind nearly spat out her wine. "Mother! What on earth? I don't see Julian that way at all!"

Victoria dabbed her lips with a napkin. "Darling, time isn't kind. You were stuck on Lucian for years, but he's clearly moved forward. Shouldn't you? The Whitmores adore you, and your father and I think Julian is quite the catch."

Julian Ashford was the golden boy of their social circle - brilliant, kind, and impeccably mannered. Alistair and Victoria couldn't praise him enough.

Rosalind's fork clinked against her plate. "That's not my priority right now."

"Make it one," Victoria pressed. "Youth fades, sweetheart. We only want you settled with someone worthy."

Not wanting to argue, Rosalind conceded, "I understand. Just... give me space."

Victoria slid a perfectly seared scallop onto Rosalind's plate. "Eat. You've gotten too thin lately."

Later, Rosalind escaped to the powder room. Icy water splashed against her flushed cheeks. The marble counter felt grounding beneath her palms. She just needed to get through tonight.

Her phone chimed as she stepped into the hallway. Lillian's name flashed on screen, bringing an instant smile.

[Returning home in two days!]

Rosalind's fingers flew across the screen. [Perfect! I'll have Cook prepare your favorite desserts. Don't be late.]

She hesitated before adding, [I have exciting news when you arrive.]

Lillian responded instantly: [Can't wait! Miss you terribly.]

Rosalind was still smiling when she collided with something solid. The crisp scent of bergamot and sandalwood hit her first. Then the heat.

She stumbled back, apology ready - until she saw those piercing gray eyes.

Lucian Graves stood before her, immaculate in his tailored suit. "Do I need to reintroduce myself? Or are we playing strangers now?"

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. "My fault. I wasn't watching..."

He'd seen her smiling at her phone, that much was clear. The ghost of amusement played on his lips. "I'd hate to think you'd forgotten me."

"Of course not," she said too quickly. "After your help last month, how could I?"

His silence was heavier than the chandeliers above them. That quiet intensity that once made her weak now only unsettled her.

"I should go," she murmured, stepping around him.

Without warning, his hand shot out, fingers circling her wrist like a manacle. Rosalind gasped as he yanked her forward, her body colliding with his.

Heat flooded her cheeks as she struggled. "Release me this instant!"



His grip only tightened, pulling her closer until she could feel his breath against her temple. "Not until you tell me why you're avoiding me, Rosalind."

The way he said her name - low and deliberate - sent shivers down her spine.

"Let. Go." Each word was sharp as broken crystal.

But Lucian never did what he was told. Especially not by her. Not anymore.
###Chapter 833

Lucian's obsidian eyes darkened as he observed Rosalind's futile resistance. Without warning, he demanded, "What game are you playing?"

Rosalind's lashes trembled like fragile butterfly wings. "I don't know what you're talking about."

A humorless chuckle escaped him as he seized her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "You weren't so reluctant when you needed my help. I remember exactly how eager you were that night. Shall I refresh your memory?"

The recollection of their heated encounter in that dimly lit VIP lounge flooded her mind. Her porcelain skin flushed pink. "Release me!"

His smirk turned predatory. "Now that your problems are solved, you discard me like yesterday's news? Ready to chase after your next conquest?"

Rosalind gaped at him. "Next conquest? Must you be so vulgar?"

"Did I misjudge?" Lucian's grip tightened, pulling her closer until their breaths mingled. "Is Julian Ashford your new obsession? First a wealthy playboy like Julian Blackwood, now an intellectual professor? Your tastes change faster than the seasons. Tell me, how many men have warmed your bed these past three years?"

Her pupils dilated in shock. Each word was a dagger twisting in her chest.

"Stop it!" she snapped.

Lucian went silent.

Seizing the moment, Rosalind shoved him away. "My life is none of your concern."

She turned on her heel, heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. How could he think so little of her? What kind of woman did he believe her to be?

Before she could take three steps, Lucian caught her wrist, spinning her back to face him.

"What now?" she hissed.

In answer, he cradled her face and crushed his lips against hers.

The kiss was a storm—unrelenting, possessive, punishing. The heady aroma of aged Bordeaux clung to him, intoxicating as it flooded her senses. Against her will, her lips parted, and her knees nearly buckled.

She had always been weak to his scent. As Everett Sinclair, he'd smelled like sunlight and cedar—safe and addictive. But Lucian Graves carried the richness of sandalwood cologne and expensive wine, a combination that unraveled her resolve.

Without breaking the kiss, he maneuvered her backward into an unlit room. The door clicked shut behind them as he pushed her onto a plush bed, his body following hers.

The world tilted. Rosalind's hands flew to his chest, nails digging into his tailored shirt. "Let me go! Stop this—I said no!"

At her refusal, his eyes burned crimson. "You'll take anyone but me?"

The sharp crack of her palm against his cheek echoed in the dark. His mask slipped off, revealing the face she knew too well.

Even in shadow, their proximity allowed her to see every detail. Her feline eyes gleamed with defiance. Lucian moved to cover them.

"Don't look."

She batted his hand away. "I said release me!"

His chest heaved. Ignoring her protests, he reclaimed her mouth, then trailed kisses down her throat, her collarbone—

Each touch was a brand. A claim.

And heaven help her, she was losing the will to fight it.
###Chapter 834

Rosalind's skin glowed with an ethereal radiance that was utterly irresistible. Lucian's hands moved with predatory intent—one sliding beneath her dress while the other worked at his belt buckle. His voice dropped to a husky growl.

"You wanted to show your gratitude, didn't you? This is how I want it. What do you say?"

Rosalind twisted away, her breath coming in sharp gasps. "Stop! I don't want this!"

His lips curled into a mocking smirk. "One time. That's all I'm asking. Then we're even."

Her mind reeled. Lucian had a girlfriend—why was he doing this to her? The thought of being with him like this made her stomach churn.

"No! I said no!" Her voice cracked as she shoved against his chest. "You're hurting me... It's too much... Please, stop!"

The raw pain in her voice sent an unexpected pang through Lucian's chest.

He crushed his mouth to hers, silencing her protests with a bruising kiss. "Quiet," he murmured against her lips.

Rosalind's nails bit into his forearm, tearing through the fine fabric of his suit until she drew blood.

Lucian buried his face in the curve of her neck, inhaling the intoxicating sweetness of her skin. His lips traced the delicate shell of her ear.

"Tell me you haven't been with anyone since we last did this. You're acting like a virgin all over again..."

She was unraveling him, just like the first time.

Rosalind lay frozen beneath him, every slight movement sending waves of pain through her body. She balled her fists and struck his shoulders. "Get off me! Why are you doing this?"

Lucian's voice was rough with barely restrained desire. Ever since their encounter at the private club, she had haunted his thoughts. Countless sleepless nights had been spent craving her.

When his assistant tracked her to this restaurant, he'd come immediately—only to find her laughing with Julian Ashford, clearly on a date.

The sight had ignited something primal in him.

While he suffered in solitude, she moved on without a second thought. It was unbearable.

Why could she give herself to others but deny him?

He needed her.

Needed her desperately.

Lucian pressed her deeper into the mattress, his throat working. "Were you planning to see Julian again? What did you text him? You looked so happy with him."

Rosalind shook her head violently. "I didn't text him anything!"

"Liar," he growled, attempting to pull away.

Her arms locked around his neck, holding him in place. "Don't—it hurts too much..."

A sudden chime cut through the tension. Rosalind's phone, discarded on the bed, lit up with a new message.

Lucian's gaze sharpened. "Julian messaged you."

"It's not him!" she insisted. "I was texting Lillian!"

His eyes flicked to the screen. The message was indeed from Lillian Sinclair. Two simple words glowed on the display:

[Love you!]

Lucian went still.

Rosalind met his gaze steadily. "My mother and I had lunch here today. We ran into Julian at the entrance—you know how small these social circles are. We just exchanged pleasantries. Then you showed up. That's all there is to it. If you want to know more, ask me."

So he'd been wrong.

Misjudged her completely.

"Rosalind, I..." His voice was barely a whisper.

She shoved at his chest. "Just leave me alone!"

Instead of pulling away, Lucian captured her lips again. Her explanation hadn't doused the fire in his veins—it had only stoked it higher.

His mouth brushed her ear as he murmured, "Please... I need you."
###Chapter 835

Rosalind scoffed, "Well, I certainly don't!"

Lucian let out a bitter laugh, cupping her face and pulling her into a searing kiss. Within moments, the salty taste of tears met his lips.

She was crying.

Lucian froze instantly, releasing her and sitting upright.

Though the pain had subsided, Rosalind still felt unsettled. She hastily adjusted her disheveled clothing. Her blouse was wrinkled beyond recognition, yet his trousers remained perfectly fastened—only his belt had been loosened.

After smoothing her appearance, Rosalind slid off the bed and turned to leave.

But a strong hand suddenly clamped around her wrist. Lucian held her firmly, tilting his head back to meet her gaze. "Do you find me repulsive now?"

Rosalind hesitated, her lips parting to respond.

Then, without warning, Lucian released her. "I understand. You may go."

Understand what?

But Rosalind wasn't in the mood to decipher his words. She pushed open the door and stepped into the hallway.

Leaning against the corridor wall, she drew a shaky breath. Everything that had transpired in the darkness left her mind in turmoil... Just then, the door creaked open, and Lucian emerged as well. He secured his mask back in place, instantly regaining his usual aristocratic demeanor.

Without a word, Rosalind turned on her heel and walked away.

At that moment, an executive approached. "Mr. Graves, you've been absent for quite some time."

Lucian's gaze lingered on Rosalind's retreating figure before replying, "Just needed some air."

The executive noticed Rosalind too. "Isn't that Ms. Fairchild?"

Lucian nodded curtly. "Indeed."

"Oh, by the way, Mr. Graves," the executive continued, "since you're still unmarried, many society daughters are vying for your attention. Someone asked me to inquire about your ideal type."

Rosalind hadn't gone far. Naturally, she overheard the question.

Seconds later, Lucian's deep, velvety voice carried down the hall. "Ms. Fairchild is exactly my type."

Others had asked Everett the same question years ago, and his answer had been identical: "Ms. Fairchild is my type."

Three years had passed, yet his preference remained unchanged. He had a type, alright—and it was Rosalind.

Rosalind's pulse quickened. She rounded the corner and vanished from sight.

Back in her apartment, Rosalind sank into the steaming bath, hoping to soothe her exhausted body.

Ding!

Her phone lit up.

She unlocked it to find a message from Lucian.

[Still in pain?]

She left it unanswered.

Ding!

Another notification. [I lost control earlier. I'm truly sorry for hurting you. I mean it.]

Still no reply.

Lucian stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows in his Quantum Innovations office, staring at his phone.

He knew she wanted space. Knew she was ignoring him.

Yet he typed another message. [Are you planning to see Julian?]

Silence.

Frustration coiled in his chest. His fingers flew across the screen. [There's still a slim chance my face could be restored. If I looked like my old self again... Would you still—]

He deleted the words before sending them.

Just then, a knock interrupted his thoughts.

"Enter," Lucian called.

The door opened, revealing his assistant, Nathaniel.

"Mr. Graves, we contacted the world's top reconstructive surgeon. He reviewed your case but... the damage is too extensive after three years. He declined the procedure."

Another rejection.

Lucian wasn't surprised anymore. Countless specialists had examined his scars, only to shake their heads in resignation.
###Chapter 836

Lucian Graves had come to terms with the fact that he would never be the man he once was.

Rosalind Fairchild had loved him deeply before, but now, whenever she looked at his face, he could see the hesitation in her eyes. That was why she recoiled from his touch, why she stiffened whenever he reached for her.

Tonight, he had lost control.

"Understood. You may go."

"Very well."

Nathaniel bowed slightly before exiting the office.

Left alone, Lucian stared at his phone screen. Rosalind hadn't responded to any of his messages.

A bitter smile twisted his lips. Still, he typed out one last word. [Goodnight.]

Rosalind spent the next two days resting. Today, Lillian Sinclair was finally returning home, so she rose early, preparing all of her sister’s favorite things.

Just then, Victoria burst into the room, her face pale. "We have a problem!"

Rosalind froze. "What is it?"

"That troublesome worker—the one who was about to settle—he was ready to take the money and sign the agreement. The whole mess would have been over. But your father just called. The man has vanished! No one can find him."

Rosalind’s stomach dropped. "Vanished? What do you mean vanished? If something happens to him, this scandal will explode all over again!"

"Exactly what your father fears. That man was our key witness, and now he’s gone."

This wasn’t a coincidence. Someone had orchestrated this.

Only one name came to mind.

She stepped away and dialed a number.

The call connected, and a familiar, mocking voice answered. "Rosalind. To what do I owe the pleasure? I didn’t think you’d have time for me."

Julian Blackwood.

Her grip tightened on the phone. "Did you take that worker? What have you done to him?"

Julian laughed, cold and cruel. "I have no idea what you're talking about. The man disappeared? What a shame. What if he’s dead? Then Whitmore Holdings will never clear its name, and you—well, you’re finished. Haha!"

Rage burned through her veins. "You’re despicable!"

"I heard the Whitmores are arranging a marriage alliance with the Ashfords. You refuse me, but you’ll marry Julian Ashford? Why? Let me make one thing clear—if I can’t have you, no one will. I’ll destroy you myself!" His voice was wild, unhinged.

There was no doubt now. Julian had taken the worker.

"You’re insane!"

"Haha—"

The line went dead.

Rosalind’s hands trembled. She had never imagined Julian would go this far. If that worker died because of him, everything would be ruined.

She had to find him.

She turned to Victoria. "Double the search efforts. We can’t let anything happen to him!"

"We’ve looked everywhere. Nothing."

Then there was only one person left who could help.

"I’m going out," Rosalind said, already rushing toward the door.
###Chapter 837

Rosalind Fairchild stood before the gleaming glass towers of Quantum Innovations, her breath catching at the imposing structure that pierced the sky. The afternoon sun reflected off the mirrored surfaces, creating a dazzling effect that matched the turmoil in her heart.

Her fingers trembled as she pushed through the revolving doors. The marble-floored lobby echoed with the click of designer heels and hushed corporate conversations. The scent of expensive leather and freshly brewed espresso filled the air.

"Excuse me," Rosalind approached the reception desk where a perfectly coiffed woman in a tailored suit gave her a practiced smile. "I need to see Mr. Graves. It's urgent."

The receptionist's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Do you have an appointment with Mr. Graves?"

Rosalind's throat tightened. "No, but-"

"Then I'm afraid that won't be possible." The woman's manicured fingers hovered over her keyboard. "Mr. Graves doesn't accept unscheduled visitors."

Rosalind pulled out her phone with shaking hands. The call rang endlessly, each unanswered tone like a knife twisting in her chest. She tried three more times, her hope dwindling with each failed attempt.

"Please," Rosalind leaned across the polished counter. "I know Lucian personally. If you could just tell him I'm here-"

The receptionist's expression hardened. "Miss, we hear that claim at least twenty times a day. Unless you have a confirmed appointment-"

A smooth voice interrupted them. "Is there a problem here?"

Rosalind turned to see Genevieve approaching, her designer heels clicking rhythmically against the marble. The receptionist's demeanor instantly transformed.

"Ms. Blackwood! What a pleasure." The receptionist practically tripped over herself. "Mr. Graves is expecting you. Shall I escort you upstairs?"

Genevieve's gaze slid to Rosalind. "Ms. Fairchild. What an unexpected surprise."

Rosalind forced herself to meet those calculating eyes. "Ms. Blackwood."

Genevieve tilted her head, a strand of honey-blonde hair falling perfectly over her shoulder. "Here to see Lucian?" Her lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her cold blue eyes. "I'm afraid he's moved on, darling. Three years is a long time to wait for someone who never looked back."

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. The scent of Genevieve's expensive perfume suddenly felt suffocating.

Genevieve stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Let me be perfectly clear. I've stood by Lucian through his darkest days. I won't have some ghost from his past disrupting what we've built." She brushed an invisible speck from her sleeve. "Take the hint, darling. No one likes a desperate ex."

The words hit like physical blows. Rosalind felt the blood drain from her face as the truth settled over her like a shroud.

"I see." Rosalind straightened her shoulders, summoning every ounce of dignity she possessed. "Then I wish you both every happiness."

She turned on her heel before they could see the tears threatening to fall, the click of her own heels against the marble echoing like a final goodbye.
###Chapter 838

With those words, Rosalind turned on her heel and walked away.

Genevieve watched Rosalind's retreating figure with a knowing smile curling her lips.

"Ms. Graves, would you like me to escort you upstairs? Mr. Graves is still in his board meeting," the receptionist offered politely.

Genevieve waved a manicured hand dismissively. "No need. I know my way. Actually..." She leaned in conspiratorially. "Lucian has been swamped lately. Don't bother him with trivial matters—like that woman who just came by. No need to mention her visit at all."

The receptionist nodded eagerly. "Understood, Ms. Graves."

Genevieve reached into her designer bag and produced a sleek gold tube. "I picked up this limited edition shade today. It would complement your complexion perfectly—consider it a token of appreciation."

The receptionist's eyes sparkled as she accepted the gift. "You're too kind! If there's anything I can do for you..."

Genevieve's smile deepened, her crimson lips curving like a satisfied cat.

Rosalind returned to the Whitmore estate where Victoria immediately intercepted her. "Where have you been?"

"I went to see Lucian," Rosalind admitted.

"And?"

"I never got past the lobby. He's made it clear he doesn't want to see me."

Victoria's brow furrowed. "Then it's settled. You need to move on. The Ashfords just called—Julian heard about our situation and offered assistance."

It was an obvious overture. Julian's help would come with strings attached—namely, Rosalind's hand in marriage.

Rosalind shook her head vehemently. "I won't accept Julian's charity. Isn't Alistair still tracking down that factory worker? I'm going with him."

Before Victoria could protest, Rosalind was already striding toward the door.

Victoria sighed heavily. "That stubborn girl..."

Just then, the front door swung open, and Lillian breezed in.

"Mother, I'm home—"

Victoria enveloped her in a warm embrace. "Welcome back, darling! You must be starving. Rosalind made sure the kitchen prepared all your favorites. Look at you—working at that research facility has made you too thin!"

As Lillian's godparents, Alistair and Victoria doted on her as if she were their own daughter.

Lillian glanced around expectantly. "Where's Rosalind?"

"She went out."

"Where?"

Normally, Rosalind would be waiting with open arms whenever Lillian visited.

Victoria hesitated. "There's something... perhaps I shouldn't mention it."

Lillian straightened. "I'm not a child anymore. If it concerns me, you must tell me."

Victoria relented. "Your brother has returned."

Lillian froze, then her face lit up like fireworks. "Everett's back?!"

Victoria nodded. "He goes by Lucian Graves now—founder of Quantum Innovations. You have another protector now."

Tears shimmered in Lillian's eyes. "My brother's alive! Is Rosalind with him now?"

Victoria's expression turned complicated. "Actually... Rosalind and Everett are finished."

Lillian recoiled. "That's impossible! They were inseparable! I'm going to see him myself—right now!"

Without another word, Lillian spun toward the door.

"Wait!" Victoria called after her. "At least let the driver take you!"
###Chapter 839

Lillian Sinclair rushed toward Quantum Innovations headquarters with desperate urgency, her heart pounding against her ribs. She needed to see her brother immediately.

The sleek glass lobby doors slid open as she entered, only to be halted by an impeccably dressed receptionist.

"Good afternoon," the woman said with practiced politeness, though her eyes assessed Lillian critically. "Who are you here to see?"

Lillian swallowed hard. "Lucian Graves."

The receptionist's perfectly arched eyebrow lifted slightly. These days, women constantly appeared claiming connections to their illustrious CEO.

"Do you have an appointment?"

"No," Lillian admitted, shaking her head. "But please inform him I'm here. My name is Lillian Sinclair. Tell him it's his sister."

The receptionist's polished facade cracked momentarily. "Mr. Graves' sister?"

"Yes. He'll want to see me immediately. It's urgent."

A smirk twisted the receptionist's lips. "First a woman claiming to be his close friend, now his sister? Should I declare myself Mrs. Graves next?"

Lillian's hands clenched at her sides. "I'm telling the truth. Lucian is my brother."

"Without an appointment, you're not seeing anyone," the receptionist dismissed with a flick of her wrist.

Lillian's temper flared. "Listen—"

Before she could continue, a cool voice interrupted. "Is there a problem here?"

The receptionist's demeanor transformed instantly, her posture straightening. "Ms. Genevieve! You shouldn't be down here—Mr. Graves is still in his meeting."

Genevieve Blackwood glided forward, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "I needed some air." Her sharp gaze landed on Lillian. "And who is this?"

The receptionist gestured dismissively. "Another woman asking to see Mr. Graves."

Genevieve's eyes narrowed as she scrutinized Lillian. Every unknown woman seeking Lucian triggered her defenses. Though he'd remained unattached these past three years, ambitious women never stopped trying.

"You want to see Lucian?" Genevieve's voice dripped with icy politeness.

Lillian met her stare head-on. "Who are you? What's your relationship with my brother?"

Genevieve's lips curled into a humorless smile. "I believe that's my question. What exactly is your connection to Lucian?"

Lillian squared her shoulders. "If he knew I was here, he'd come immediately."

A mocking laugh escaped Genevieve. "Rosalind Fairchild was here earlier without half your confidence."

Lillian's stomach twisted. So Rosalind had encountered this woman too.

"I don't care to chat with you," Lillian stated firmly. "I need to see Lucian."

The receptionist gasped. "How dare you speak to Ms. Blackwood that way!"

Lillian's eyes flashed. "And who exactly is Ms. Blackwood that I can't? Isn't this Lucian's company?"

The receptionist smirked. "Mr. Graves owns Quantum Innovations, but Ms. Blackwood here is practically his right hand."

Lillian's breath caught.

She turned her full attention to Genevieve. "What are you to my brother?"

Genevieve's smile turned victorious.

"I'm closer to Lucian than any of you could ever hope to be," she purred. "For three years, women have thrown themselves at him. But as long as I'm here?" She leaned in, her perfume cloying. "None of you stand a chance. Save yourself the humiliation and leave now."
###Chapter 840

Lillian couldn't comprehend why this woman was suddenly clinging to Lucian. Her lips curled into a cold smirk. "And what if I refuse to leave?"

Genevieve arched a perfectly sculpted brow, mirroring her disdain. "Then I'll have security escort you out."

"Is that so?" Lillian challenged.

Genevieve's eyes narrowed. "Absolutely." She raised her voice sharply. "Security!"

Within seconds, three broad-shouldered men in tailored black suits materialized, bowing slightly toward Genevieve. "Yes, Ms. Blackwood?"

Lillian's blood ran cold. The entire company clearly deferred to Genevieve. No wonder Rosalind had ended things with Lucian—if it were Lillian, she wouldn't tolerate this either.

Genevieve gestured dismissively. "This woman is causing a disturbance. Remove her."

"Right away!"

Two guards seized Lillian's arms with practiced efficiency.

She thrashed violently. "Unhand me! Do you have any idea who I am?"

Genevieve scoffed. "Just another gold-digger trying to sink her claws into Lucian. As long as I'm here, you won't get within ten feet of him."

"You'll regret this," Lillian hissed. "When you find out who I am—"

Genevieve had no patience for empty threats. She flicked her wrist. "Out with her."

The guards began dragging Lillian toward the exit despite her furious protests.

"Release me this instant! You'll pay for this!" she shouted.

Suddenly, a commanding voice cut through the chaos. "Hold it right there!"

Lillian's head snapped up to see Reginald striding through the glass doors.

His attention initially landed on Genevieve. "What's happening here?"

Genevieve's demeanor instantly softened into a saccharine smile. "Nothing important, just handling a minor disruption."

Reginald nodded approvingly. "You and Lucian make an excellent pair. I fully support this match."

A delicate blush colored Genevieve's cheeks. "I'll do everything to deserve him."

Lillian's stomach twisted. She hadn't anticipated Reginald taking Genevieve's side.

The guards tightened their grip. "Let's go."

Desperation clawed at Lillian's throat. "Reginald!"

Hearing that voice—that achingly familiar voice—Reginald froze mid-step toward the elevator. He whirled around.

Their eyes locked. "Lillian?"

He barely recognized the graceful woman before him—the gangly girl had blossomed into stunning maturity.

She nodded. "It's me."

Genevieve's smile faltered. "You... know her?"

Lillian's lips curved into a triumphant smirk. "Who do you think I am?"

Genevieve's pulse stuttered. She'd been carefully cultivating Reginald's favor. Could this woman actually be—

She forced a nervous laugh. "Oh! You're Reginald's friend? My apologies—had I known, I never would have—"

Reginald cut her off. "You truly don't recognize her?"

Genevieve shook her head. "Should I?"

Before he could respond, a deep, resonant voice interrupted. Lucian emerged from the executive corridor, his presence commanding immediate silence.

"Explain this commotion."

Genevieve instantly brightened. "Lucian, darling—"

Tears welled in Lillian's eyes as she gazed at her brother.

"Lucian," she whispered.
###Chapter 841

Lucian froze. "Lillian!"

Without hesitation, Lillian sprinted toward him.

His arms opened instinctively, pulling her into a crushing embrace.

Tears soaked through his shirt as she buried her face against his chest. Her voice trembled. "It's really you... I knew it was you that day. Why didn't you tell me?"

That day, he had disguised himself as a cab driver. She had recognized him instantly, but he had denied it.

Lucian held her tighter, his scarred face hidden against her hair. He wished she could remember him as he once was—the brother from before the fire, before the scars.

"Where were you all these years?" Lillian choked out between sobs. "Why didn't you come home? Rosalind and I—we missed you so much!"

His grip tightened. "I thought of you both every day."

Their parents were gone. In this world, he only had Rosalind and Lillian left.

One was the woman he loved. The other, his blood.

He would never let go of either.

Genevieve stood frozen, her mind blank. She hadn't realized Lillian was Lucian's sister.

This was disastrous. She had just insulted his sister!

Reginald smiled warmly. "Come now, Lillian, don't cry. This is a happy day—you've found Lucian again."

Lucian wiped her tears away. "If you keep crying, your eyes will swell."

Lillian sniffled. "I almost didn't get to see you!"

His brows furrowed. "What do you mean?"

She shot a glare at the receptionist. "She wouldn't let me in! Just a receptionist, but she acts like she owns the place—too busy sucking up to actually do her job!"

The receptionist's legs buckled. Now that she knew Lillian was Lucian's sister, she knew she was finished.

"Mr. Graves, I can explain—"

"Don't bother." His voice was ice. "Security. Remove her."

The guards moved instantly.

The woman turned desperately to Genevieve. "Ms. Blackwood, help me! I was just following your orders!"

Genevieve snapped, "Shut your mouth!"

Lucian's gaze darkened. "Explain."

Genevieve forced a smile. "It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't know she was your sister."

Lillian scoffed. "Misunderstanding? Then why did you have your people throw me out?"

Genevieve opened her mouth, but Lillian cut her off.

"Lucian," she said firmly, locking eyes with him. "Tell me—what is she to you? Your girlfriend?"

He hesitated. "She's—"

"If she is, then I won't acknowledge you as my brother ever again."

Reginald interjected quickly. "Lillian, you're overreacting! There must be some mistake."

Lillian shook her head. "No mistake. The only woman I'll accept as my sister-in-law is Rosalind."

Reginald sneered. "Do you even know what Rosalind did to him three years ago? She abandoned him! Genevieve has been by his side all this time—"
###Chapter 842

"Stop it!" Lillian snapped at Reginald, her voice cutting through the air like a whip.

"Absolute rubbish! Rosalind would never abandon Lucian! Sure, Genevieve has been by his side these past three years, but Rosalind took care of me when no one else would. When I lost my mother and my brother wasn't there, she gave me a home.

She brought me from Willowbrook to Metropolia and enrolled me in school. Every single day, she drove me there and back. For three years, she poured her heart into raising me. And it wasn't just her—her parents treated me like their own daughter, showering me with nothing but kindness.

Rosalind isn't just my sister—she's my future sister-in-law. I love and respect her with everything in me, and I won't let any of you speak ill of her!"

Reginald fell silent.

It was true—Rosalind had done so much for Lillian. Without her, Lillian wouldn’t be the woman she was today.

Lucian placed gentle hands on Lillian’s shoulders. "You've misunderstood. Genevieve and I are just friends."

Lillian searched his eyes. "Really? You don’t have feelings for her?"

His answer came swift and firm. "None. She’s only ever been a friend to me."

Genevieve’s fists clenched at her sides. She had always known Lucian didn’t return her feelings. In all these years, he had never given her false hope. Yet she loved him anyway—helplessly, hopelessly.

Lillian pressed further. "If you don’t love her, then why do you let Rosalind suffer because of her?"

A shadow flickered in Lucian’s eyes. It wasn’t him causing Rosalind pain—she was the one who had hurt him.

"I know you care deeply for Rosalind, but she doesn’t love me anymore. She won’t be your sister-in-law," he said quietly.

"Who says she doesn’t love you? She came looking for you today."

What?

Lucian blinked in shock. "She did?"

Lillian nodded. "Yes, but she never got to see you. Genevieve and that receptionist stopped her at the door and humiliated her."

Lucian’s expression darkened. He turned to Genevieve. "Is this true? Did Rosalind come here? Why wasn’t I told?"

Genevieve paled. "She did come, but you were in a meeting. I didn’t think it was appropriate to interrupt."

"Since when do you decide who I see?" His voice was ice.

Genevieve shrank back under his glare, fingers twisting nervously.

Lucian turned to his assistant. "Where’s my phone?"

The assistant hurriedly handed it over. "Right here, sir."

Lucian unlocked it and saw multiple missed calls from Rosalind. He had been in that meeting, his phone left behind—

Just then, the assistant spoke again. "Mr. Graves, I heard Whitmore Holdings is in trouble. Ms. Fairchild came to ask for your help."

Lillian’s voice turned urgent.

"When our family was struggling, Rosalind and her parents never abandoned us. Have you forgotten their kindness in our darkest hour? Now that she needs you, how can you not be there for her?"
###Chapter 843

Lucian had been trapped in back-to-back meetings all day, completely oblivious to Rosalind's visit to his office.

His stormy gaze locked onto Genevieve. "Did you know about Whitmore Holdings' crisis and intentionally prevent Rosalind from seeing me?"

Genevieve's hands trembled as she shook her head. "I had no idea—I swear I can explain—"

Reginald stepped forward to defend her. "I'm certain Genevieve wouldn't deliberately—"

Lucian silenced him with a single glare before turning back to Genevieve. "You're banned from Quantum Innovations. Don't ever set foot here again."

He snapped his fingers at his assistant. "Track Rosalind's location immediately. Prepare my car—I'm leaving now."

The assistant nodded briskly. "Right away, sir."

Without another glance at the stunned room, Lucian bolted toward the elevators, his entire being focused on finding Rosalind.

Genevieve stood frozen, watching helplessly as the man she loved chased after another woman. The public humiliation burned through her like acid. Three years of devotion, erased in one brutal moment.

Reginald reached out hesitantly. "Don't take it to heart—"

Lillian cut him off with a sharp glare. "Stop making excuses for her!"

Reginald hesitated. "She genuinely cares for Lucian—"

"Do you even understand what my brother wants?" Lillian countered. "You claim to be his friend yet keep pushing him toward the wrong woman. Is that what friendship means to you?"

Before Reginald could respond, Lillian spun on her heel and marched out.

"Lillian, wait—"

Genevieve's nails dug into her palms. Everything had spiraled out of control since Lucian's sister arrived. That meddling woman had shattered whatever fragile understanding she'd built with Lucian over the years.

Three years. She'd given him three years of her life. She couldn't walk away now.

Desperation colored her voice as she grabbed Reginald's sleeve. "Rosalind will destroy him again. You saw what happened last time. Help me protect him."

Reginald met her pleading gaze, conflict flashing across his face—

Then he too walked away.

Genevieve's breath came in short gasps. She wouldn't accept this. She couldn't lose him. Not like this.

Meanwhile, Rosalind combed through the city with relentless determination, checking every possible location twice.

Her assistant offered a water bottle. "Ms. Fairchild, you should rest."

Rosalind shook her head. Every second counted. That missing worker held the key to saving Whitmore Holdings.

Julian Blackwood's pressure tactics wouldn't work on her. Neither would the Johnsons' hollow olive branch. She needed to find that witness herself.

But as hours slipped by, the trail remained cold.

Suddenly, Rosalind paused. "Have we checked his childhood home?"

The assistant nodded. "Completely empty."

Rosalind's mind raced. If Julian didn't have the worker, then he must be hiding—somewhere no one would think to look.

Somewhere even Julian's men wouldn't find him.

The realization struck like lightning. She knew exactly where to look next.
###Chapter 844

They had combed through over sixty percent of Metropolia's districts, yet the missing worker remained frustratingly elusive.

A sudden realization flashed through Rosalind's mind. "I know where he is!"

Her assistant leaned forward eagerly. "You've figured it out?"

Rosalind's pulse quickened with excitement. "We need to move immediately - I'm certain he's hiding at one specific location."

"Understood. We'll leave right away."

She had been catching her breath on a nearby bench, but now sprang to her feet, anxiety coiling in her stomach.

As she turned to leave, her ankle twisted violently on the uneven pavement, sending her stumbling forward.

"Ah!" she cried out, instinctively bracing for impact.

Instead of meeting cold concrete, strong arms encircled her waist, pulling her against a solid chest that smelled faintly of sandalwood and mint.

Looking up through her lashes, Rosalind found herself staring into Lucian's striking features, partially obscured by his signature black mask.

Lucian had arrived.

He'd just exited his car when he saw her losing balance and moved with lightning reflexes to catch her.

His unexpected appearance left her momentarily speechless before she quickly righted herself. "What are you doing here?"

Those piercing eyes held hers captive. "Did you visit Quantum Innovations looking for me earlier?"

She forced a tight smile. "Yes."

"Why?"

"There was something I needed to discuss, but it's irrelevant now. I'm in a hurry, so if you'll excuse me."

She attempted to step away.

Lucian's grip tightened around her slender wrist. "Where are you rushing off to?"

Rosalind tried to pull free. "That's none of your concern! Release me - I have urgent matters to attend to."

Instead of letting go, he drew her closer, his lips curving in that infuriating half-smile. "You sought me out at my office. Now I'm here, yet you refuse to explain yourself. Are we playing games?" Her clear blue eyes met his dark ones. "Visiting your company was a mistake. Rest assured, it won't happen again."

Lucian tilted his head. "Did Genevieve say something to you?"

Hearing that name made Rosalind recall the woman's cutting words earlier.

A bitter smile touched her lips. "She merely stated facts."

Lucian pressed, "What exactly did she tell you?"

Rosalind exhaled sharply. "Nothing significant. Just that I should stop seeking you out, and that she's your current girlfriend. I really shouldn't be disturbing your relationship. The last thing I want is to cause misunderstandings-"

Lucian abruptly pulled her flush against him, cutting off her words with an amused smirk. "Would you like to know the truth about Genevieve and me?"

Rosalind blinked in surprise. "What do you mean?"

"If you wanted to understand my relationship with her, you should have asked me directly. Why listen to outsiders?"

But would his version differ significantly from what Genevieve had claimed?

Rosalind struggled against his hold. "Please let me go. I don't want anyone getting the wrong impression-"

Before she could finish, Lucian stated firmly, "Listen carefully. There is absolutely nothing between Genevieve and me. She is not my girlfriend."
###Chapter 845

Lucian claimed Genevieve wasn't his girlfriend.

Rosalind froze, her eyes widening in disbelief. "That can't be true. She introduced herself as your-"

A slow smile curved Lucian's lips. "Whose word carries more weight - mine or hers?"

She bit her lip, uncertainty flickering across her delicate features.

Reading Lucian had always been like deciphering an ancient cipher - a lesson painfully learned three years prior.

"If she means nothing to you, why has she shadowed your every step for years?" Rosalind countered, crossing her arms. "Why should I take your word over hers?"

A bitter chuckle escaped him. In one fluid motion, he encircled her slender waist, pulling her against his solid frame. "What exactly do you think of me? Some spineless liar who can't own up to a relationship?"

Rosalind placed trembling hands against his chest, creating precious inches between them. "Not now. I have... obligations." Her voice wavered. "Please, let me go."

Whitmore Holdings needed her - every second counted.

Instead of releasing her, Lucian guided her toward his gleaming sports car with unyielding determination. "Get in."

She dug her heels into the pavement. "I told you, I have urgent matters-"

"Don't you want to find that construction worker?"

Her breath hitched. "You know about that?"

Lucian gave a single nod. "Get in. I'll take you to him."

He opened the passenger door with a quiet click. When she hesitated, his hand settled on the small of her back, propelling her gently into the butter-soft leather seat.

As he slid behind the wheel, Rosalind studied his profile. "You've located him?"

"Every bounty hunter in Metropolia is scouring the city." Lucian snapped her seatbelt into place, his fingers brushing her collarbone. "He's hiding in the last place anyone would check... the accident site itself."

Rosalind's lips parted in surprise. The abandoned construction zone had been her first suspicion too.

After the worker's mysterious fall, authorities had cordoned off the area. No one would consider it a hiding place.

That Lucian had deduced the same sent an unexpected warmth through her chest.

"Hold on."

The engine roared to life as they sped toward the derelict site.

Soon, the car purred to a stop before chain-link fences marked with DANGER signs. Lucian emerged, offering his hand.

Rosalind ignored it, stepping onto cracked concrete. "I can manage."

His fingers closed around hers with startling possessiveness. "Behave," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "Don't make this difficult."

That familiar command unraveled her resistance instantly.

When he'd been Everett, she'd hung on his every word. Now, as Lucian Graves - tech mogul and Metropolia's most eligible bachelor - his authority carried even greater weight.

As they picked their way through debris, Rosalind stole glances at his sharp profile. The years had honed him into something formidable - wealth and power radiating from every pore.

"Enjoying the view?"

His sudden question made her cheeks flame. She whipped her head away. "Don't flatter yourself."

That rich, knowing laugh of his sent shivers down her spine.

Focus, she chastised herself. The worker - find the worker.

Then she saw it - a furtive movement near scaffolding. Her pulse leapt.

There he was!
###Chapter 846

Rosalind parted her lips to speak, but Lucian swiftly pressed his palm against them. "Hush, darling. We don't want to startle him."

She exhaled sharply, frustration simmering beneath her skin. "We found him. What are we waiting for?"

Lucian's grip tightened subtly. "Julian already got to him first. If we drag him back now, who's to say he won't turn on us? One wrong move, and Whitmore Holdings collapses completely."

Rosalind clenched her jaw. He wasn't wrong. The company's stocks had already nosedived, teetering on the edge of ruin. Another scandal would be catastrophic.

This man was a viper—unpredictable, dangerous.

"So what's your plan?" she demanded.

A slow, knowing smirk curled Lucian's lips. "Asking for my help now, are you?"

"Obviously."

He leaned in, his breath warm against her cheek. "Then answer me this first."

"What?"

"Did you get my messages?"

Rosalind stiffened. "...Yes."

Lucian's gaze darkened. "And you ignored them. Why?"

"Because I had nothing to say to you."

Anger flashed in his eyes. In one fluid motion, he yanked her against him, his arms locking around her waist. "I'll handle this for you."

Her pulse jumped. "How?"

This wasn't just about some rogue employee. Powerful players were involved—shadows with influence and agendas. But if Lucian said he could fix it, she believed him.

His lips brushed her ear, voice dropping to a velvet murmur. "On one condition."

Her breath hitched. "Which is?"

"One night. With me."

Her stomach flipped. "Doing what?"

Lucian chuckled, the sound rough and intimate. "What do you think? I'm not some chivalrous knight, Rosalind. You and me. Alone. All night."

Heat flooded her cheeks. "You're blackmailing me?"

His teeth grazed her earlobe, sending shivers down her spine. "You left me hanging last time. Didn't even let me—"

Rosalind slapped a hand over his mouth, silencing him.

Lucian's eyes gleamed as he studied her—flushed, flustered, utterly captivating. Like a deer caught in headlights, all wide-eyed and breathless. His chest tightened.

"Tick-tock, sweetheart. Three seconds. Three... two..."

"Fine!" she blurted.

His smirk deepened. "I'll hold you to that."

"After you deal with him."

"Ordinary methods won't work here."

"What does that mean?"

"Watch and learn."

With a sharp gesture, Lucian signaled his men. Shadows detached from the alleyways—black-clad figures moving like ghosts.

The worker, dozing against a dumpster, bolted upright. He took one look at the approaching figures and ran.

"Stop him!"

They tackled him to the pavement. He thrashed, wild-eyed. "Let me go! I'm nobody! What do you want?!"

One guard crouched, gripping his collar. "Mr. Blackwood sends his regards."
###Chapter 847

The worker stiffened, his complexion turning ashen. "Mr. Blackwood? Julian Blackwood?"

One of the masked men gave a solemn nod. "Correct. He sent us to eliminate you. Today's your last day."

Terror made the worker's voice crack. "This must be a mistake! Why would Mr. Blackwood want me dead? Call him—ask him yourself! There's no way he'd order this!"

"Enough with the lies," a guard snapped.

"I'm telling the truth!" the worker pleaded. "Just contact Mr. Blackwood. We're partners. Has he forgotten already?"

A chilling laugh came from one of the guards. "Oh, he remembers everything. He says you know too much. Dead men tell no tales. And right now, you're worth more to him dead than alive."

The worker's hands shook. "What... what do you mean?"

"Still don't get it? Once you're gone, all the public outrage will land on Whitmore Holdings, crushing them. Mr. Blackwood says your life is worthless anyway, so he's using you to take them down. At least your death will mean something."

One guard exchanged a glance with another and jerked his chin. "What's the delay? Finish him. Mr. Blackwood's waiting."

"On it!"

Two men stepped forward with a thick hemp rope, looping it around the worker's neck and pulling taut.

The worker had been skeptical at first. He doubted Julian would actually want him dead. But now, with the rope cutting into his throat, the crushing reality hit him all at once. Panic surged through his veins.

He clawed desperately at the noose.

"Let me go! Why is Mr. Blackwood doing this? We had a deal! He told me to fake an injury on-site and blame Whitmore Holdings. He even recruited my sons to stir up chaos. I did everything he asked! Now Whitmore Holdings is drowning in scandal—just like he wanted. I followed orders! Why does he want me dead? He won't get away with this!"

The guards exchanged a look, then abruptly loosened their grip.

Seizing the moment, the worker wrenched free and kicked one guard down.

Then he bolted like a man possessed.

The masked men stood, dusting themselves off before approaching Lucian and Rosalind. "Mr. Graves, the worker escaped. He was so terrified he pissed himself."

Lucian's lips curved into a knowing smirk. "Now he despises Julian with every fiber of his being."

He turned to Rosalind. "He'll contact your father soon and turn on Julian."

Rosalind's eyes widened in surprise. She hadn't expected Lucian to stage this—having men impersonate Julian's enforcers.

Julian was cunning, but even he wouldn’t have anticipated this move from Lucian.

Noticing her gaze, Lucian smiled. "When dealing with snakes, you have to think like one. Fight fire with fire."

Rosalind exhaled in admiration. "You're incredible."

Just then, one of the masked men handed over a voice recorder. "Mr. Graves, here's the recording from earlier."

Lucian took it and placed it in Rosalind's palm. "Keep this. Every word he said is proof. It's enough to clear Whitmore Holdings."

Rosalind clutched the recorder tightly.

Lucian had thought of everything.

She knew, without a doubt, that coming to him had been the right choice.
###Chapter 848

Rosalind gazed at Lucian with genuine gratitude shimmering in her eyes. "I couldn't have devised such a flawless strategy without you."

Lucian's lips curved into that familiar teasing smirk. "Is that gratitude I hear?"

"Absolutely," she affirmed, her fingers nervously twisting the strap of her purse.

He closed the distance between them in one fluid step, his cologne wrapping around her like an intimate embrace. "Then I'll be expecting my proper thank-you present."

The implication sent heat rushing to Rosalind's cheeks. She could practically feel them burning.

With effortless grace, Lucian opened the car door. "Hop in. I'll take you home."

The leather seats embraced her as Lucian slid behind the wheel. The powerful engine roared to life, carrying them through the city's glittering nightscape. Thirty minutes later, the luxury vehicle glided to a stop before the Whitmore estate.

Rosalind unfastened her seatbelt with slightly trembling fingers. "Thank you for the ride."

"My pleasure." His fingers drummed a slow rhythm on the steering wheel. "Don't forget our arrangement."

That promise of a "gift" hung between them like unspoken electricity. Rosalind practically fled from the car, yet she could feel his predatory gaze tracking her every step until she disappeared behind the grand oak doors.

The moment she entered, Victoria and Lillian descended upon her like guardian angels.

"Rosalind! We've been worried sick!"

She pressed the recording device into Victoria's palm. "Give this to Father. He'll understand what needs to be done."

Victoria examined the device with a frown. "Where did you get this?"

"Lucian Graves. He... intervened." Rosalind's voice caught on his name.

Without another word, Victoria swept away toward the study.

Lillian studied her sister with knowing eyes. "You saw Lucian?"

Rosalind's lips twitched. "You've discovered he's your brother then?"

Lillian nodded vigorously. "I stormed right into Quantum Innovations! That wretched Genevieve tried to block me, but Lucian appeared like some dark knight and tore into her. Told her never to darken his company's doorstep again!" She grinned triumphantly. "I may have given him an earful too. He had no idea you'd gone searching for him. The moment he found out, he vanished - probably raced straight to you."

Rosalind's heart clenched. Had Lillian not intervened, Genevieve might have successfully kept Lucian in the dark about Whitmore Holdings' crisis.

She pulled Lillian into a fierce embrace. "I don't deserve you both. Lucian saved our family's legacy tonight."

Lillian laughed, the sound like wind chimes. "That's what brothers are for! And if he ever dares hurt you, I'll skin him alive!"

Rosalind's smile turned wistful. "You should know... things can never return to how they were between us."

"Why ever not?"

"Because we're different people now. I'm not that naive girl anymore, and your brother... he's not Everett Sinclair."

Lillian cupped Rosalind's face with surprising wisdom. "People change, darling. That's called growing up. But real love? That stays. And anyone with eyes can see you two still burn for each other."

Rosalind's breath hitched. Did Lucian still love her? The question haunted her.

Three days later, Whitmore Holdings emerged victorious. The corrupt employee faced justice, the company's reputation was restored, and their stocks skyrocketed.

Alistair returned home beaming. "That Graves boy worked miracles. We must properly express our gratitude." His meaningful glance at Rosalind spoke volumes.
###Chapter 849

Victoria tenderly grasped Rosalind's hand.

"Whatever happened between you and Mr. Graves, we'll never forget his kindness. Why don't you call him? Your father and I would like to invite him for dinner to express our gratitude."

Alistair nodded in agreement. "Indeed, we should take Mr. Graves out. It's been years since I last saw him."

Lucian had once been Alistair's student under his former identity, Everett, and Alistair had always held him in high regard. Given everything Lucian had done for the Whitmore family, this dinner was the least they could offer.

Lillian hadn't attended university for the past three days. The Whitmores' warmth had made her feel like part of the family. After everything that had happened, she was determined to stay until they overcame this crisis before returning to the research facility.

"There's no need to invite Lucian to dinner. He helped because it was his duty. As long as our family is safe, that's all that matters," Lillian said cheerfully.

Victoria smiled. "That won't do. Mr. Graves helped us out of goodwill—it wasn't an obligation. We must show our appreciation."

Alistair added, "Lillian, we took you in as our goddaughter because we care for you. We never expected your brother to repay us. Even now that he's returned, you'll always be like a daughter to us."

Lillian nodded firmly. "Of course!"

Alistair turned to Rosalind. "What are you waiting for? Go ahead and call Mr. Graves!"

He urged her on.

Rosalind pulled out her phone. "Alright, I'll call him."

"Go on."

She stepped aside and dialed Lucian's number.

The call connected after a single ring. Lucian's deep, velvety voice came through. "What is it?"

His tone was teasing, warm—like a whisper right beside her ear.

Rosalind noticed how, over the years, his voice had grown richer, more magnetic—the kind that could make any woman's pulse quicken.

"Mr. Graves, the company issues are resolved, and my parents want to thank you. Are you free? They'd like to invite you to dinner."

Lucian chuckled softly. "They're too kind. I only did what was right."

"They insist."

"Will you be there too?" he asked.

Rosalind's heart stuttered. What was he implying?

"Of course. We all want to thank you."

His voice turned playful. "You sound so formal."

Rosalind laughed lightly. "Then what should I say? But if you're busy, it's fine—"

"I'm free. How about tonight?"

"Perfect. I'll let my parents know."

"Good," he replied. "Anything else you want to say?"

Her breath hitched. "Like what?"

"You haven't forgotten our agreement, have you?"

Heat rushed to Rosalind's cheeks. "I haven't! It's just... not the best timing right now."

"That's fine. I can wait."

"Alright. I'll hang up now."

"Mm."

She ended the call, clutching her phone as her heart raced. Three years apart, and yet Lucian could still make her feel like a flustered schoolgirl.
###Chapter 850

Rosalind had never truly understood what love felt like for others. But her feelings for Lucian were an all-consuming fire—just as intense now as they had been three years ago.

Yet those three years apart had left her with countless unanswered questions. Where did she even begin?

She returned to the living room, smoothing her dress. "He said he's free tonight."

Alistair's face lit up. "Perfect! I'll have my assistant reserve the best table at The Regal."

Lillian tugged Rosalind's arm excitedly. "Come on! We have to pick out our dresses."

Victoria beamed. "Go get ready. I had several custom gowns delivered just yesterday."

Fashion-forward and doting, Victoria adored dressing her daughters like royalty. "We'll be upstairs," Rosalind said.

The moment they entered the walk-in closet, Lillian gasped at the array of designer dresses. She held up a sapphire-blue gown against Rosalind. "Which one? This? Or this? Ugh, you make everything look good—it's impossible to choose!"

Rosalind pinched her sister's cheek playfully. "Flatterer."

"Lucian's coming tonight. You have to look breathtaking. Make him lose his mind over you!"

Dress for him?

A blush crept up Rosalind's neck. "But he and Genevieve—"

"Please. He's not interested in her. She’s not even half as stunning as you. You're the only sister-in-law I’ll ever accept," Lillian declared with a grin.

Rosalind hugged her, then selected a sleek black evening dress.

"This one."

"Perfect! Now let me do your makeup. Lucian won’t be able to look away tonight!"

Rosalind tried to protest, but Lillian was relentless, guiding her to the vanity and expertly applying cosmetics.

That evening, at The Regal’s most exclusive private dining room, Lucian arrived in a tailored black suit, exuding power and sophistication. The black lace mask covering half his face added an air of enigmatic allure, perfectly suited to his status.

Alistair rose, studying him. "Everett—no, I should address you as Mr. Graves now."

Lucian smiled. "Professor Whitmore, I’ll always be your student."

Alistair nodded approvingly. "I knew you were extraordinary back then. You’ve surpassed even my highest expectations. The future is in good hands."

Genuine admiration shone in his eyes.

"You honor me," Lucian replied humbly.

Victoria gestured gracefully. "Mr. Graves, please sit."

"Thank you."

His assistant pulled out a chair, and Lucian sat, scanning the room. His gaze lingered on the empty seats. "Ms. Fairchild and Lillian aren’t here yet?"

Victoria checked her watch. "Those two have been fussing over their outfits forever. They insisted we start without them. They’ll be here any moment."

As if on cue, the doors swung open. Lillian strode in, dragging Rosalind behind her.

"Lucian! We made it!" Lillian announced cheerfully.

She nudged Rosalind forward. "Doesn’t she look absolutely divine tonight?"

Lucian’s eyes locked onto Rosalind—and didn’t let go.
###Chapter 851

The evening air was crisp as Rosalind stepped into the softly lit restaurant, her black satin slip dress clinging to her slender frame like liquid shadow. Loose chestnut waves cascaded over her shoulders, framing her delicate features that needed only the barest touch of makeup to enhance their natural glow.

Lillian nudged her forward with a conspiratorial grin. "Go on," she whispered, making Rosalind's cheeks flush pink.

Lucian Graves looked up from his wineglass—and froze.

The woman before him was a vision, her soft brown eyes luminous in the candlelight. He'd never seen this side of Rosalind before—this effortless elegance that stole the breath from his lungs.

"Earth to Lucian," Lillian teased, snapping her fingers. "She said hello."

Lucian cleared his throat, his fingers tightening around his glass. "Rosalind."

Victoria Whitmore smiled warmly. "Come, sit with us."

As they settled at the table, Lillian arched a brow at Lucian. "Well? Isn't she stunning tonight?"

"Yes." The word left Lucian's lips before he could stop it, raw and honest.

Rosalind's pulse fluttered at the intensity in his gaze.

The waiter arrived with their first course, breaking the moment. Alistair Whitmore studied Lucian over his wineglass. "Are you seeing anyone currently?"

"Not for three years." Lucian's gloved fingers brushed the edge of his mask. "After the accident, Genevieve—my physician—stayed on as my doctor. Nothing more."

Rosalind's fork stilled. Was that explanation meant for her?

Victoria's gaze lingered on the black leather mask. "Your injuries...?"

"They've healed." Lucian's tone made it clear the subject was closed.

As Alistair smoothly redirected the conversation to business matters, Rosalind studied the man beside her. Even through the mask, she could see the tension in his jaw.

She remembered old photographs of him—all sharp cheekbones and smoldering confidence. Now that face was hidden away like a shameful secret.

When Lucian turned, he caught Rosalind watching him with an expression that made his chest tighten. Not revulsion, but heartbreaking tenderness—as if he were something fragile to be protected.

Her phone vibrated with a new message.

[Why are you looking at me like that?] - Lucian

Rosalind nearly dropped her wineglass. He'd texted her right in front of everyone!

Before she could respond, Alistair raised his glass. "To Mr. Graves—we owe Quantum Innovations a great debt."

"To Mr. Graves," Rosalind echoed, hastily locking her phone.

Later, as they stepped into the cool night air, Alistair gestured to the waiting cars. "We've all had wine. My assistant will drive."

Lillian looped her arm through Rosalind's. "We're riding with Lucian."

Victoria nodded approval. "Stay together."

As Nathaniel opened the car door, Lucian pressed his keys into the assistant's palm. "You're driving."

The leather seats smelled faintly of sandalwood as Rosalind slid in, hyperaware of Lucian's thigh brushing against hers in the close quarters. Somewhere between the restaurant and the quiet hum of the engine, she realized—she wasn't afraid of his scars.

She was afraid of how badly she wanted to see them.
###Chapter 852

"Of course, Mr. Graves," Nathaniel responded smoothly.

Lillian turned to Lucian with a knowing smile. "I'll take the front seat. You and Rosalind can sit in the back."

She slipped into the passenger seat before either could protest, clearly giving the couple privacy.

Rosalind saw right through the gesture. Just then, Lucian opened the rear door with effortless grace. "After you."

She slid in, pulse quickening as he followed, shutting the door with a quiet click. The luxury sedan purred to life, gliding through the city streets.

Lillian glanced back. "Heading to the office or home?"

"Office," Lucian answered, his gaze lingering on Rosalind. "You two going straight back?"

Lillian arched a brow at her friend. "Well? Home?"

Rosalind felt the weight of Lucian's stare. "Y-yes. Home."

The driver took a sudden sharp turn. Rosalind gasped as momentum threw her sideways—

A strong arm banded around her waist, pulling her flush against a hard chest. Lucian had caught her effortlessly.

Her breath hitched as she met his smoldering gaze. The world narrowed to the rapid thud of her heartbeat.

The car steadied. She scrambled upright, skin burning where they'd touched.

The moment they separated, the air between them cooled.

Then Lucian spoke. "Nathaniel, didn't you mention needing to stop somewhere?"

A beat of confusion. "I don't recall—"

Nathaniel caught Lucian's pointed look in the mirror and instantly corrected course. "Ah! Right, the pharmacy. There's one just ahead."

The car pulled over. Nathaniel stepped out.

Lillian was already opening her door. "I need a few things too. I'll join you."

Rosalind lunged forward. "Wait, I'm coming—ah!"

An iron grip yanked her back. She tumbled into Lucian's lap with a startled yelp.

"Mr. Graves! Let me—"

His low chuckle vibrated through her. "They're running errands. Why the rush?"

"I need—"

"Liar." He tilted her chin up, eyes dark with amusement. "You've been avoiding me all day."

"I haven't!"

"Every time I get close, you find an excuse to leave." His thumb traced her jawline. City lights danced across her delicate features, and something possessive stirred in his chest.

"Stay with me tonight."

Rosalind froze. "W-what?"

"Come to my office. It's time you honored our agreement."

She braced against his chest. "I can't just—mmph!"

His lips crashed onto hers in a searing kiss—deep, demanding, leaving her dizzy. His signature sandalwood scent enveloped her, turning her bones to liquid.

When they finally broke apart, his voice was rough with promise.

"You're not going anywhere."
###Chapter 853

Rosalind placed her delicate palms against Lucian's broad chest, pushing him back with trembling fingers. "Please... we shouldn't..."

Lucian's lips brushed against her flushed cheek before trailing to her silken hair. "You're breathtaking tonight, my rose." His deep voice poured over her like warm honey.

The compliments made Rosalind's pulse race. She and Lillian had spent hours preparing in their suite, every curl and seam perfected for this very encounter.

"Mr. Graves..."

"Say my name properly, darling."

"Lucian!"

His mouth captured hers again in response.

Rosalind gasped as he deepened the kiss, tasting the expensive whiskey on his tongue. The rich, smoky flavor intoxicated her senses more than any alcohol ever could.

Their luxury sedan sat parked along the moonlit boulevard, the city's noise fading into distant background static. All she could focus on was the intoxicating rhythm of their lips moving together. Heat spread across her skin like wildfire.

When his fingers began inching up the satin fabric of her cocktail dress, Rosalind grabbed his wrist. "Don't!"

Her sudden movement dislodged the silver mask covering his scars. It clattered to the floorboard between them.

Lucian froze. "Forgive me."

He reached for the fallen mask with uncharacteristic haste, but Rosalind intercepted his hand. Her fingers tightened around his. "Why are you apologizing? What exactly requires forgiveness?"

The shadows hid his expression, but she felt his muscles tense beneath her touch. "This ruined face... I know it's grotesque now. I didn't mean to frighten you."

Her heart fractured at the self-loathing in his voice. The man who once turned heads with his striking features now hid behind masks and shadows.

Words failed her, but sometimes silence spoke volumes. Lucian gave a bitter chuckle.

"The specialists say these scars won't fade. I've consulted every expert from Paris to Zurich."

Rosalind raised her hand, fingertips grazing the raised lines marring his cheekbone.

Lucian caught her wrist, attempting to pull away.

She persisted, tracing each ridge with featherlight touches. "You were so handsome at university. All those debutantes would line up just to catch your attention."

He remained silent beneath her exploration.

Rosalind met his shadowed gaze. "Now your face is—"

Lucian moved to replace the mask.

In one fluid motion, Rosalind swung her leg over his lap, cradling his face between her palms. Her lips found the worst of his scars first, pressing tender kisses along each jagged line.

Lucian went utterly still. He'd expected revulsion, not this tender devotion.

"Do you realize what you're doing?" His voice emerged rough with emotion.

"I'm kissing the man I love." She punctuated her declaration with another kiss, this time capturing his lips with fierce possession.

Something primal snapped inside Lucian. All his carefully restrained desire surged forth as he claimed her mouth with bruising intensity.

Rosalind matched his passion, nails scraping through his perfectly styled hair. When his lips trailed down her exposed throat, the strap of her dress slipped off one shoulder.

She tangled her fingers in his dark locks, torn between pulling him closer and pushing him away.

"Rosalind." Her name sounded like a prayer and a curse on his lips.

"Yes?"

"Be mine tonight. Completely."

His hand slid higher along her thigh, bunching the delicate fabric—

Just then, Rosalind spotted Lillian and Nathaniel emerging from the boutique across the street. She gasped, shoving against Lucian's chest. "Stop! They're coming back! Now!"
###Chapter 854

Lucian couldn't stop himself. The desire burning through him was becoming unbearable, threatening to consume him entirely.

Rosalind remained unresponsive. Her attention had already shifted to Lillian and Nathaniel crossing the street toward the car. With sudden urgency, she pushed Lucian away and straightened her dress.

The car door swung open just as Lillian and Nathaniel climbed back inside.

Lillian handed Rosalind a chilled bottle of water. "Here, you look like you need this."

Rosalind accepted it with trembling fingers. "Thank you."

Lillian studied her curiously. "Why are your cheeks so flushed?"

Rosalind immediately pressed a hand to her face, feeling the heat radiating from her skin. She forced a casual laugh. "It's just... the weather."

Nathaniel, ever perceptive, sensed the tension. His gaze flicked to the rearview mirror, where Lucian had already schooled his expression back into its usual cool mask.

Nathaniel cleared his throat awkwardly. "Mr. Graves, did I... interrupt something?"

Lucian rolled down the window, letting the crisp night air wash over him in an attempt to cool the fire in his veins. His sharp eyes met Nathaniel's in the mirror. "What do you think?"

The answer was painfully obvious.

Nathaniel winced internally. He'd definitely returned too soon.

Thirty minutes later, the sleek black car pulled up to the Whitmore family estate. Rosalind and Lillian stepped out onto the cobblestone driveway.

Rosalind smoothed her dress. "Thank you for the ride. I'll head inside now."

Lillian waved enthusiastically at Lucian. "Goodnight, Lucian!"

Lucian's gaze lingered on Rosalind before shifting to Lillian. "Lillian, why don't you come stay with me instead?"

Lillian shook her head stubbornly. "No, I want to live with Rosalind. We share a bed every night."

Lucian's eyebrows shot up. "You share a bed?"

Lillian nodded emphatically. "Always."

Memories flashed through Rosalind's mind—of simpler times when she and Lillian would curl up together in that tiny cottage, whispering secrets under the covers while Margaret's soft humming drifted from the kitchen. Those days were gone now, preserved only as bittersweet recollections.

"But you're not a child anymore," Lucian pointed out, his voice edged with something unreadable. "Rosalind will marry someday. She'll share her bed with her husband then."

Lillian scrunched her nose in confusion. "So?"

The blush on Rosalind's cheeks deepened. Sensing the conversation spiraling into dangerous territory, she grabbed Lillian's hand. "Let's go inside."

Lillian waved again. "Bye, Lucian!"

Rosalind hurried Lillian toward the grand entrance, feeling Lucian's intense gaze burning into her back until the heavy oak doors closed behind them.

"Mr. Graves, shall we return to Quantum Innovations now?" Nathaniel ventured cautiously.

Inside the villa, Rosalind drew herself a steaming bath infused with rose petals. The fragrant water soothed her frayed nerves, washing away the evening's tension. Wrapped in a silk nightgown, she finally stepped into her bedroom.

Her phone vibrated on the vanity. A single notification lit up the screen.

Her pulse quickened as she unlocked it.

A message from Lucian:

[Come down.]

Just two words. Commanding. Unyielding.

Her breath hitched. She rushed to the window, pushing aside the heavy drapes.

There, parked beneath the glow of the estate's lanterns, was Lucian's car. He hadn't left. He'd been waiting all this time.

She bit her lip, fingers trembling as she typed her reply:

[Why?]

His response came instantly:

[Don't play coy.]
###Chapter 855
Lucian told Rosalind to quit playing games.

Rosalind's cheeks flushed crimson. Here was a fully grown man, parked outside her apartment at midnight, demanding she come downstairs. The implications were crystal clear.

She wasn't some innocent schoolgirl. Three years ago, they'd already crossed that line.

Biting her lower lip, Rosalind typed out a reply. [Exhausted. Going to bed now.]

Inside the sleek black Bentley, Lucian sat alone. His long fingers tightened around the phone as he read her message.

Tired, she claimed.

A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips.

[Breaking your promise already?]

Rosalind dove under her silk sheets, pulling them over her head. The audacity of him accusing her of reneging!

After a moment's hesitation, she fired back. [I said I'd thank you properly, but I never specified when!]

Silence.

Lucian didn't respond.

Tossing in bed, Rosalind squeezed her eyes shut. But sleep eluded her. The sheets tangled around her restless legs as she checked her phone again—still nothing from Lucian.

The night was too quiet.

Something felt... incomplete.

Against her better judgment, she slipped out of bed and padded to the window. Peering down, she saw his car still idling below.

11:37 PM glowed on her phone screen.

Was he seriously planning to camp out there all night?

Inside the car, Lucian had no intention of leaving. Even if he returned to his penthouse, work would be impossible. His mind was consumed with thoughts of Rosalind.

Yet she refused to come down.

Leaning back against the buttery leather seat, he stretched his long legs and exhaled with wry amusement.

Then—a sharp rap on his window.

Lucian glanced up to see a voluptuous figure outside. The woman wore a scandalously tight dress that left little to the imagination.

He lowered the window slightly. "Yes?"

His car practically screamed wealth, and this woman had clearly been watching him. A luxury vehicle, a handsome man alone at night—irresistible bait.

She leaned forward, her low-cut top gaping. "Hey there, handsome. Keeping lonely company tonight?"

Lucian remained silent.

Undeterred, she toyed with her spaghetti strap, letting it slip off one shoulder. "I'm free too. How about we grab drinks at The Velvet Lounge?"

Just as Lucian opened his mouth to respond, a cool feminine voice cut through the night.

"He's not alone."

Lucian turned to see Rosalind standing there—she'd finally come down.

The stranger shot Rosalind a venomous glare. "Who the hell are you? I'm having a private conversation here."

Rosalind's gaze swept over the woman. "My apologies. I happen to know this gentleman quite well."

"So what? That doesn't give you the right to interrupt!"

Rosalind nearly laughed. Some women truly had no shame—just like Arabella.

A slow smile curved Rosalind's lips. "Let me clarify. I'm his wife."

"Wife?" The woman recoiled. "You're joking."

"Does this look like a joke to you?" Rosalind's voice turned icy. "I suggest you walk away before I expose you as the homewrecker you are."
###Chapter 856

The woman clicked her tongue in irritation before storming off, her stilettos striking the pavement with sharp, angry taps.

Rosalind exhaled through her nose, unimpressed.

Lucian observed her reaction, his lips twitching into an amused smirk.

The low rumble of his laughter drew Rosalind's attention. Her almond-shaped eyes, bright and sharp, flicked to his face, unamused. "What's so funny?"

Lucian met her gaze evenly. "You said you weren't coming down."

Rosalind tilted her chin up slightly. "If I hadn't, would you have gone with her instead?"

Lucian arched a brow. "I never said that."

Rosalind shot him a glare. "Jerk."

She muttered the word under her breath and turned to leave.

But Lucian reached out, his fingers wrapping around her slender wrist, and yanked her back with a firm tug. Rosalind stumbled, losing her balance, and landed squarely in his lap.

The car was spacious, but with both of them crammed into the driver's seat, the space suddenly felt suffocatingly small. The abrupt proximity sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

She glowered at him. "Let me go!"

Lucian shut the door behind her, keeping her pinned in place. "You call me a jerk, then try to walk away? I didn't even do anything."

Rosalind huffed. "Yet. If I hadn't come down, you'd be at some bar with her right now, probably booking a suite afterward. That desperate for company tonight?"

Lucian reached up, his fingers brushing her chin as he tilted her face toward his. "I didn't speak to her. But you're right about one thing—I am lonely. Care to fix that?"

He admitted it so shamelessly.

Rosalind scoffed. "You're unbelievable."

Lucian chuckled. "If being shameless gets me you, then I'll take it."

Then he leaned in and kissed her.

Rosalind pressed her palms against his broad shoulders, pushing back. "What are you—? Let me go!"

When she refused to let him kiss her lips, Lucian trailed his mouth along her cheek, then buried his face in her hair. His voice dropped to a rough murmur. "Why do you smell so damn good?"

Of course she did.

She had just soaked in a rose-infused bath, her skin still warm and scented with expensive oils. At her age, she was in full bloom—soft, pampered, and fragrant, like a rose plucked fresh from the garden.

Rosalind shoved at him. "Stop it!"

Lucian pulled back just enough to meet her eyes. His gaze burned, molten and intense, stripping away her defenses. "You really want me to?"

Rosalind opened her mouth to refuse, but the words caught in her throat. "I—"

Before she could finish, Lucian kissed her again.

This time, it wasn't gentle. His lips pressed hard against hers, demanding. Rosalind tried to push him away, but her fingers curled into the fabric of his suit jacket instead.

She closed her eyes and kissed him back.

His lips were cool but firm, and she loved the way they felt against hers. She loved kissing him.

Neither knew who gave in first. Rosalind wound her arms around his neck, pulling him closer as she melted into the kiss. Lucian's body tensed, heat coiling low in his stomach. A rough, muffled groan escaped him.

Hearing it, Rosalind jerked back. Her eyes glittered as she studied him. "What's wrong? Did I hurt you?"

Lucian took her hand and guided it downward, his throat bobbing as he swallowed hard. "See for yourself. It hurts."

Rosalind yanked her hand away instantly before sinking her teeth into his Adam's apple.

"Ow," he hissed.
###Chapter 857

Lucian gasped sharply as pain shot through his neck. That delicate spot where Rosalind's teeth had sunk in burned like fire. His entire body tensed, fingers digging into the leather seats as he fought for control.

Rosalind released him with a satisfied smirk. "Did I hurt you?"

In the dim interior light, a perfect crescent of teeth marks decorated his tanned skin.

Lucian's voice came out rough. "Like hell."

"Good." She traced the marks with her fingertip. "Next time you flirt with random women at gala events, I'll—"

Suddenly, Lucian's lips curved into that infuriatingly handsome smile. "You're jealous."

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. "That's ridiculous—"

"Admit it." His thumb brushed her lower lip. "You couldn't stand seeing me talk to that heiress."

Heat flooded her cheeks. Trapped, she could only glare up at him through her lashes, that defiant spark making his blood run hot.

The next moment, Lucian captured her mouth in a searing kiss that stole her breath. The champagne silk of her nightgress whispered against his suit as his hands slid beneath the discarded cashmere wrap around her shoulders.

Rosalind melted into the kiss, fingers tangling in his hair until reality intruded. "Lucian...we're still in the parking garage."

His lips traveled down her throat. "My penthouse is three minutes away."

"I—"

"Or we could stay right here." His teeth grazed her collarbone. "We've never christened the Bentley."

Scandalized heat pooled low in her belly. They hadn't.

Then practicality surfaced. "We don't have...protection."

Lucian stilled. "What?"

She bit her lip. "Condoms. There aren't any in the car."

With a growl, he kissed her again, hands roaming possessively. "We don't need them."

Rosalind stiffened. "What if I get pregnant?"

"Then we'll have the most beautiful baby in the world."

"No!" She shoved against his chest. "We can't—not like this."

Lucian caught her chin, his gaze suddenly intense. "You don't want my child?"

Her heart clenched. A baby wasn't some impulsive purchase—it needed stability, commitment, two parents who weren't caught in this tangled web of passion and uncertainty.

Not now. Maybe not ever.

She shook her head. "I'm not ready."

Something dark flickered in his eyes before he lowered his head to mark her throat.

Rosalind pushed him away firmly. "Go buy condoms. Or tonight isn't happening."

Lucian exhaled sharply but nodded. "Fine. Let's go."

The 24-hour supermarket gleamed under fluorescent lights. Rosalind scanned the aisles nervously. "Where's the...you know?"

Lucian pointed with an amused smirk. "Family planning. Right there. You go—I'll wait here."

He was making her do this alone.

Cheeks burning, Rosalind approached the display like a thief, ready to grab the first box she saw.

Then she froze.

Ribbed. Ultra-thin. Flavored. Glow-in-the-dark? Her mind short-circuited.

A cheerful sales associate appeared. "Need help choosing protection?"

Rosalind nodded mutely.

"We've got latex-free, vegan options, warming lubricant infused—"

The dizzying array made her head spin. Behind her, Lucian's low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. This was going to be a very long night.
###Chapter 858
Rosalind wished the earth would crack open and devour her right then. Why did contraceptive aisles even require sales associates?

To make matters worse, she had absolutely no clue which type to choose.

"Um... Just something standard," Rosalind muttered, avoiding eye contact.

The associate held up a sleek box. "How about our classic range?"

Rosalind extended her hand. "Perfect."

But instead of handing it over, the associate continued, "What's your partner's size? We carry petite, regular, king, and..." She lowered her voice, "magnum."

Rosalind's fingers twitched.

Was this really necessary? "I-I'm not sure..."

"Where is he?"

Rosalind turned and gestured discreetly. "By the magazines."

The associate followed her line of sight and gasped. "Holy smokes. That's Lucian Graves?"

Under the pharmacy's fluorescent lights, Lucian stood like a GQ cover model—black tailored suit, sharp jawline, flipping through a medical journal with effortless elegance. His towering frame and predatory grace made nearby shoppers do double takes.

Rosalind stole another glance.

Yes, he was devastating. Always had been.

Even back when he was just "Everett," a scholarship student with threadbare sweaters, socialites had thrown themselves at him.

Now? The suit amplified everything—calculated, polished, lethally attractive.

The associate fanned herself. "Definitely a magnum."

Rosalind choked. How could this stranger possibly—

"One box enough?"

She gnawed her lip. "Better make it... three."

"Smart girl." The associate winked, bagging them.

Rosalind snatched the bag and practically sprinted back. "Got them."

Lucian's thumb brushed her flaming cheek. "You're blushing, darling."

A mirror confirmed it—her face matched the emergency exit signs.

"Overheating," she lied. "Checkout. Now."

His chuckle was pure sin. "Eager?"

She could strangle him. He lived for this torture.

At the register, she slammed down the boxes. "Just these."

Meanwhile, Lucian draped an arm around her, lips grazing her ear. "Three boxes? Ambitious."

Regret flooded her. What cosmic insanity made her say three?

His teeth scraped her earlobe. "Let's see if we need to restock by dawn."

She elbowed him hard.

"$24.50," the cashier droned.

Lucian tossed a fifty. "Keep it."

Bag in one hand, he laced their fingers together, leading her to the parking lot.

Rosalind moved toward the passenger door—

Lucian swung open the rear instead. "Backseat. Now."

Her pulse skyrocketed.

He drove until streetlights faded, stopping in a deserted overlook. When his door clicked open, her heart threatened to crack ribs.

Three years. Three years, and he still turned her into a breathless, trembling mess.
###Chapter 859

Lucian Graves slid into the backseat of the car. Rosalind Fairchild parted her lips to speak, but words never came. His hands cradled her face as he captured her mouth in a searing kiss.

A breathy sigh escaped her as she melted into his embrace. Lucian's arms encircled her waist, lifting her effortlessly onto his lap as the kiss deepened with desperate intensity.

"Where...are we?" Rosalind gasped when they finally broke apart.

Noticing her tension, Lucian murmured against her lips, "The private garage beneath Quantum Innovations. Relax, darling. No one ever comes down here."

The tension left Rosalind's shoulders. She wound her arms around his neck, fingers brushing against the edge of his mask.

Lucian jerked his head back. "What are you—"

"I want to see you," she whispered. "Doesn't this get uncomfortable after wearing it for so long?"

His voice turned gravelly. "What if you don't like what you see?"

Rosalind arched an eyebrow. "Only one way to find out, isn't there?"

With deliberate slowness, she peeled the mask away, revealing the scars beneath. Lucian immediately averted his face.

"Maybe I should put it back on."

"Don't you dare." Rosalind cupped his jaw, forcing him to meet her gaze. "After everything between us, you'd still hide from me?"

Her lips found his again, soft and insistent. When she trailed kisses along his scarred cheek, Lucian tensed violently.

"Don't," he rasped. "Not there."

But Rosalind only tightened her grip. "I'll kiss every inch of you, Lucian Graves."

Again and again, her lips brushed over his scars with unbearable tenderness. Lucian's breathing turned ragged, his fingers digging into her hips.

"I need you. Now."

Time lost meaning. When Rosalind finally surfaced, her body felt deliciously wrecked—damp with sweat, hair clinging to her flushed skin, every muscle trembling.

Lucian gathered her close. "Exhausted?"

She nodded weakly. "Completely spent...can't move."

He pressed an affectionate kiss to the tip of her nose. "Darling, I did all the work."

Though utterly drained, Rosalind noted how Lucian looked frustratingly energized—his shirt hanging open, revealing tantalizing glimpses of toned muscle beneath.

She swatted weakly at his chest. "You're impossible..."

Lucian claimed her lips again, his arousal evident. Rosalind groaned. "Again? Where do you get this stamina?"

"Three years of celibacy," he growled. "I'm making up for lost time."

That gave her pause. "What about your...wife?"

Lucian's expression turned serious. "There was never a marriage."

"What?" Rosalind's eyes widened. "But I saw the wedding!"

He began explaining in measured tones. "My father was an undercover agent murdered by a drug lord. Getting close to that woman was the only way to reach him. To get justice."

His thumb brushed her cheek. "I couldn't tell you, Rosalind. I needed to keep you safe. That day at the chapel...when I saw you outside, the target was already watching. I had no choice but to go through with the charade."

"The moment you left, we moved in. The operation succeeded. My father finally got justice."

The truth crashed over Rosalind. Their painful separation. The apparent betrayal. All of it—a carefully constructed lie to protect her.

He'd broken her heart to save her life.
###Chapter 860

Rosalind's stormy gray eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "You could have just been honest with me."

Lucian studied her delicate features, the way moonlight traced the curve of her cheekbone.

"Back then, you were a radiant socialite with the world at your feet," he murmured. "And I? A man with nothing but debts and danger trailing behind me. You deserved better than being dragged into my mess."

She pressed her face into the crook of his neck, her breath warm against his skin. "You absolute fool."

His arms tightened around her. "Doesn't matter now."

Rosalind pulled back just enough to meet his gaze. "Then explain your scars. And if that marriage was a sham—why did you vanish for three years?"

At the mention of his scars, Lucian's expression darkened. "You truly don't remember what happened?"

She stiffened. "What are you talking about? I have no idea—"

Before she could finish, her phone buzzed on the seat beside them. Julian's name flashed across the screen.

Lucian's jaw clenched. "Julian's calling you."

Rosalind hesitated, then answered. Julian's voice crackled through the line, sharp with impatience.

"Where the hell are you? I need to see you—now!"

She frowned. "It's the middle of the night. What could possibly—mmph!"

Lucian crushed his lips against hers, swallowing her words.

Rosalind gasped, her fingers curling into his shirt as the world tilted. In one smooth motion, he lowered her onto the leather seat, caging her beneath him.

She shoved weakly at his chest. "Stop—I'm on the phone—"

He smirked, trailing kisses down her throat. "Then talk."

His mouth found hers again, rougher this time, demanding. She whimpered, the phone slipping from her grasp.

"Lucian—you're hurting me—"

He nipped at her earlobe, voice a dark whisper. "Good."

A shiver raced down her spine. She had always been his—from the very beginning.

On the other end, Julian's voice turned razor-sharp. "Rosalind? Who's there with you? Answer me!"

Irritation flared. "Since when do I owe you explanations?"

"You're with him, aren't you?" Julian snarled. "What the hell are you doing right now?"

"I—"

Lucian snatched the phone from her hand. His voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "Julian."

A beat of silence. Then—"Lucian Graves. So she is with you."

"Whatever you want," Lucian said coolly, "it can wait."

He ended the call and tossed the phone aside. When his gaze returned to Rosalind, it burned with possession. "Are you done with him?"

She blinked. Done? There had never been anything to begin with.

Lucian cupped her face, his thumb brushing her swollen lower lip. "You let me have you. Did you think I'd let you walk away now?"

Her breath hitched. "What are you saying?"

A slow, predatory smile curved his mouth. "You're mine, Rosalind. So—be my girlfriend."
###Chapter 861
Lucian asked Rosalind to be his girlfriend.

She was unattached, and he wasn't in a relationship either. Truthfully, it was the most logical next step for them now.

Yet those three lost years still stood between them like an invisible wall.

Rosalind's cheeks flushed pink as she murmured, "I need some time to consider."

Lucian arched one perfect eyebrow. Then without warning, he captured her lips in a searing kiss.

"I'm not giving you that option," he declared when they broke apart. "The decision's made—you're mine now."

A delicious warmth spread through Rosalind's chest. His dominance should have irritated her, but instead it sent thrilling shivers down her spine.

Sweeping her into his arms, Lucian carried her through the executive suite's private entrance. He drew her a steaming bath, washing away every trace of tension with tender care. When he finally laid her on the silk sheets, she was already half-asleep.

Lucian showered quickly before joining her. The moment his arms encircled her waist, three years of longing dissolved into this single perfect moment. He pressed a lingering kiss to her temple. "Sleep, darling."

Morning light filtered through the blinds when Rosalind stirred. Lucian's muscular arm still draped possessively over her.

She shifted slightly—

"Awake?" His sleep-roughened voice vibrated against her back as he pulled her closer.

Rosalind winced. Every muscle protested with delicious soreness. She swatted at his chest. "You've ruined me."

Lucian's smirk was downright sinful. "We'll work on your endurance."

Her eye roll could have powered a small city.

A crisp knock interrupted them. Nathaniel's voice carried through the door. "Mr. Graves?"

Rosalind's eyes flew open. They were in his corporate penthouse's bedroom suite. She had zero recollection of how they'd gotten here from the car last night.

"Someone's—" she whispered urgently.

Lucian merely tightened his hold. "What is it?"

"The board meeting, sir. It's 8:50."

Rosalind's stomach dropped. They'd slept through dawn in his office suite while executives waited outside!

Lucian didn't miss a beat. "Reschedule for 9:30."

"Understood."

Footsteps retreated.

Rosalind bolted upright. "You need to—"

Lucian pulled her back against his bare chest. "Worried I can't support you?" His lips brushed her ear. "Quantum Innovations could afford a hundred of you."

That arrogant CEO confidence shouldn't have been attractive.

She twisted to face him. "Who said I want your money?"

His grin turned wolfish. "Didn't we establish this last night? You're mine." He caught her hand, pressing a hot kiss to her palm.

Rosalind snatched it back. "If you're serious about this, act like it."

Lucian's laughter rumbled through her. "Your wish is my command. East or west, I go where my queen directs."

"Better."

He rose in one fluid motion. "Meeting calls. Stay—breakfast is coming. Dinner tonight."

Already orchestrating her day. Was this how relationships worked?

Rosalind nodded.

His parting kiss left her breathless.

Outside, Nathaniel stood at attention.

Lucian adjusted his cuffs. "Let's not keep them waiting."
###Chapter 862

Lucian Graves caught Nathaniel's gaze lingering on his neck. "Mr. Graves," Nathaniel murmured, gesturing discreetly, "shall we conceal that...mark?"

A smirk played on Lucian's lips as he examined the love bite Rosalind had left in the mirror. The memory of last night warmed his blood.

"Leave it." His voice was velvet. "Let's proceed."

They strode through the corporate halls, employees bowing their heads in deference.

"Good morning, Mr. Graves."

Whispers ignited like wildfire the moment Lucian passed.

"Did you see? The CEO's sporting a hickey!"

"The 9 AM board meeting was delayed. Rumor has it he was...occupied with company in his private suite."

"Care to wager what kept our ice-cold billionaire preoccupied till dawn?"

The speculation was delicious.

Meanwhile, Rosalind Fairchild emerged from Lucian's private chambers, finding breakfast meticulously arranged.

"Ms. Fairchild," Nathaniel bowed. "Mr. Graves insisted you be properly nourished."

"Thank you."

The moment Nathaniel exited, Rosalind noticed clusters of employees pressing against the glass, desperate to glimpse the woman who'd thawed their untouchable CEO. Heat flooded her cheeks.

Why had Lucian brought her here? Now the entire Quantum Innovations headquarters knew they'd spent the night together.

As she lifted her fork, her phone trilled.

Julian Blackwood. Again.

"This is your final warning," Rosalind hissed. "One more call and you're blocked permanently."

Julian's voice dripped venom. "You whored yourself to Lucian Graves all night, didn't you? Disgusting!"

Rosalind's laugh was glacial. "If loving Lucian makes me disgusting, then yes - I adore him. I crave him. Satisfied?"

A beat of silence. Then Julian's tone shifted. "Meet me."

"After what you did to my family? Never."

"Not even to learn how Lucian's face was scarred?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. She'd questioned Lucian repeatedly about the mysterious marks, always met with evasion.

"You know?"

"Everything."

"Tell me now!"

"Face to face." Julian's demand was absolute.

Rosalind's nails bit into her palm. "Send the address."

The moment Lucian concluded his marathon board meeting, he burst into his office.

"Rosalind—"

Empty.

His gaze snapped to Nathaniel. "Where is she?"

Nathaniel paled. "She received a call...then left abruptly."

The air crackled with danger. Lucian's phone vibrated with a security alert - Rosalind's car had just exited the garage. Alone.

His blood turned to ice.
###Chapter 863
Rosalind left after one phone call?

Lucian's brows knitted together, his jaw tightening. "Did you catch who called her?"

Nathaniel shook his head apologetically. "I'm afraid not, sir."

"Understood. Dismissed."

As Nathaniel exited, Lucian strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows, his fingers absently adjusting his cufflinks. Rosalind had promised to wait in his office—they'd made dinner plans. She'd agreed. Yet she'd vanished.

After finally reuniting last night, the thought of separation now was unbearable.

His phone screen illuminated as he typed:
[Where are you?]

The send button went unpressed when his phone rang.

"Who is this?" His voice was ice.

"Mr. Graves," came the smug reply. "It's Julian."

Lucian's expression darkened. "Blackwood. To what do I owe this... pleasure?"

Julian's chuckle grated. "Looking for Rosalind, by any chance?"

A muscle twitched in Lucian's jaw. "Is she with you?"

"Indeed. We're enjoying a rather intimate lunch."

Rosalind. With Julian.

Lucian's laugh was razor-sharp. "You're lying."

"Come see for yourself," Julian taunted. "Though I should warn you—she looks radiant today. That glow women get after being thoroughly—"

"Enough." Lucian's grip threatened to shatter the phone.

"—satisfied," Julian continued, undeterred. "I know you two reconnected last night, but let's not pretend three years apart didn't happen. She spent those years in my bed. Our current... disagreements don't erase history."

A pause, then venomous sweetness: "She still arches that perfect back when she comes, doesn't she? That breathy little gasp—"

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Lucian's fist collided with the wall, paint cracking under his knuckles.

Julian's laughter was triumphant. "Touch a nerve? I'd stay and chat, but our appetizers just arrived. Do give my regards to Chelsea."

The line went dead.

Lucian stood trembling, his breathing ragged. The office walls seemed to pulse with his rage.

"Nathaniel!"

His assistant appeared instantly, paling at Lucian's expression—a tempest given human form.

"Find them. Now. I want their exact location within five minutes."

Nathaniel vanished.

Lucian tore at his collar, oxygen suddenly scarce. He needed to see her. Needed to—

"Found them." Nathaniel reappeared, phone in hand. "Sent the coordinates."

Lucian was already moving, car keys gleaming in his white-knuckled grip.

Across town, Rosalind sat across from Julian at La Belle Époque, sunlight glinting off their wine glasses. Her fingers tightened around her napkin.

"Let's try this again," she said coolly. "What really happened to Lucian's face?"

Julian smirked, swirling his merlot. "Patience, darling. The entrée hasn't even arrived."
###Chapter 864

Julian Blackwood lifted his fork and meticulously sliced into the medium-rare steak before him. The knife scraped against the porcelain plate with deliberate precision.

"We'll talk after we eat," he stated coolly, his voice smooth as aged whiskey.

Rosalind Fairchild scoffed, her fingers tightening around her wineglass. "What do you even want from me? With your wealth and influence, you could have any woman in the city. Why are you so obsessed with tormenting me? Don’t tell me you’ve actually fallen for me."

Julian paused mid-cut, his dark eyes locking onto hers. "What if I have?"

Rosalind’s lips curled in disdain. "Do you even understand what love is? You claimed to love me, yet you betrayed me without hesitation."

"I ended things with Arabella," Julian countered, his voice edged with impatience. "Can’t you move past this?"

"Once a cheater, always a cheater!" Rosalind snapped. "You don’t love me. You’re just jealous that I’m with Lucian now. Let’s be honest—men like you can’t stand rejection. The idea that a woman might not want you? Unbearable. That’s not love—it’s just your bruised ego screaming for validation."

Julian’s grip on the knife tightened. "You’re wrong. I do love you."

"Enough!" Rosalind’s voice was sharp as shattered glass. "Even if you did, your version of love is toxic. If you can’t possess something, you’d rather ruin it. That’s not love—it’s obsession. And I want no part of it."

A flush of anger darkened Julian’s features. His jaw clenched as he glared at her.

"You’re right. With my power, I could have any woman I desire. So why do you insist on provoking me?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Yes, I cheated. But don’t act like you’re innocent. You gave yourself to Lucian—your first time—without a second thought."

Rosalind’s eyes flashed. "Lucian and I are in love. What we do is none of your business. You and I? We were never even a real couple. It was over before it began."

Julian leaned forward, his gaze turning predatory. "Are you trying to make me lose control?"

"I’m not here to play games," Rosalind shot back. "I just want to know what happened to Lucian. Tell me."

"Lucian, Lucian, Lucian," Julian mocked, his voice dripping with venom. "Is that all you care about? Do you love him that much?"

Rosalind didn’t hesitate. "Yes. I do."

Silence fell between them, thick and suffocating.

Julian exhaled sharply, his fingers drumming against the table. Then, as if struck by sudden amusement, his lips curved into a smirk. He glanced toward the restaurant’s grand windows—just in time to see a sleek black luxury car pull up outside.

His mood shifted instantly.

"You want to know about Lucian?" Julian murmured, his tone deceptively light. "Fine. I’ll tell you."

Rosalind straightened. "I’m listening."

Julian speared a small piece of steak and lifted it toward her lips. "Open up."

Rosalind recoiled. "What are you doing?"

His smile was all charm, but his eyes remained cold. "Take a bite. If you do, I’ll tell you everything."

Rosalind froze.

At that exact moment, the restaurant doors swung open.

Lucian Graves strode inside, his presence commanding immediate attention. A waiter hurried forward.

"Good afternoon, sir. Table for one?"

Lucian ignored him. His sharp gaze swept across the dining room—until it landed on the couple by the window.

There they were.

Rosalind. Julian.

Julian holding a fork to her lips, Rosalind hesitating—but from this angle, it looked intimate. Romantic. Like lovers sharing a tender moment.

Lucian’s expression darkened.
###Chapter 865

Lucian's fingers curled into tight fists at his sides. Without uttering a single word, he marched toward the table where Rosalind and Julian were seated.

"That's not happening," he snapped, his voice cutting through the air like a blade.

Hearing his voice, Rosalind looked up, startled. "Lucian? What are you doing here?"

He reached out, gripping her delicate wrist, and yanked her up from her chair. "You're leaving with me."

He was taking her away.

Julian's voice rose in protest. "You can't just drag her off like this! We're in the middle of lunch!"

Lucian shot him a glacial glare. "She's mine now. And if I catch you sneaking around with her again, you'll regret it."

With that, he pulled Rosalind away, leaving Julian behind.

Julian slammed his silverware onto the table with a sharp clatter. He had deliberately provoked Lucian over the phone, yet the man had still come for Rosalind.

His plan to drive them apart had failed.

Damn it.

Just then, a voice spoke beside him. "Mr. Blackwood."

Julian turned his head and saw Genevieve standing there.

He recognized her. He'd had someone investigate the woman who kept appearing around Lucian—a doctor, apparently.

Julian narrowed his eyes. "Do I know you?"

Genevieve smiled coolly. "They say the enemy of my enemy is a friend. So now, we've officially met."

"Lucian dumped you?"

"And Rosalind left you, didn't she?"

Julian's expression darkened. "You want to team up?"

Genevieve nodded. "Exactly. You want Rosalind. I want Lucian. If we work together, we both get what we want."

Julian studied her for a long moment. Genevieve clearly had her own schemes—after all, she'd managed to track him down here.

Finally, he gave a slow nod. "Fine. Let's work together."

Genevieve had no intention of giving up on Lucian. She had loved him for years—she wouldn't let some newcomer like Rosalind ruin everything she'd worked for.

With Reginald cutting her off, Julian was her best remaining ally.

A cold smile curved her lips. "I look forward to it."

Lucian shoved Rosalind into his sleek sports car, buckled her in, and accelerated toward his company.

Rosalind glanced at him. He hadn't spoken a single word the entire drive.

"Are you angry?" she asked carefully.

His hands tightened on the steering wheel. "Angry? No. I'm in a fantastic mood."

Rosalind blinked, uncertain how to respond.

Lucian exhaled sharply. "You really can't tell I'm furious? Don't play dumb with me."

Rosalind flinched. "Is this about Julian—"

Lucian cut her off. "Rosalind, what are we?"

"I'm your girlfriend."

"Exactly. So why the hell were you sneaking off to see Julian? Letting him feed you like that? What's going on? Am I just your backup plan?"

Rosalind rushed to explain. "It's not like that!"

"Then explain. I'm listening."

"He called me while I was in your office. He said he needed to talk in person..."
###Chapter 866
"What did he want to discuss with you?"

"I... I was curious about your scars. Julian claimed he knew the truth. He promised to tell me if I met him."

Lucian froze, his piercing gaze locking onto Rosalind. "So you went to see him just for that?"

"Obviously! What else would it be? That man gives me chills! He suddenly sliced a piece of filet mignon and tried to force-feed me, saying he'd only talk if I ate it. As if!"

The sheer disgust in Rosalind's voice soothed something primal in Lucian. So that was all it had been.

Yet...

He studied her intently. "You truly have no idea what happened to my face?"

Rosalind shook her head violently. "No! Why do you keep acting like I should know? Was I involved somehow?"

Silence stretched between them. It seemed Rosalind had been innocent all along. Which meant Julian Blackwood had orchestrated everything.

"Will you tell me the truth now?"

"Three years ago, during the Phantom drug bust operation, I took severe injuries assisting the police. Even bleeding out, I tried reaching you. Then masked men shoved me into a car, threw acid on my face, and drove us off a cliff."

Rosalind's hands flew to her mouth. "My God!"

Her pupils dilated with horrified realization.

That happened three years ago?

Acid burns. A fatal crash.

She trembled, shaking her head in disbelief. "I... I never knew. Lucian, I'm so sorry."

"It's over now," he said gruffly.

Rosalind threw her arms around him, burying her face in his chest. "You suffered so much alone. And I blamed you..."

Her warmth seemed to dissolve years of anguish.

Gentle fingers traced his scars. "I've already contacted Harrison. She's the best reconstructive surgeon in the country."

They'd arrived at Quantum Innovations' headquarters. Lucian killed the engine and turned to her.

"If you cut all ties with Julian, I'll let the past go. Agreed?"

"I barely speak to him anymore," Rosalind protested.

Lucian's jaw tightened. Three years she'd spent with that monster. The thought ignited possessive fury. She was his. Only his.

"I need you to promise. No calls. No secret meetings. Can you do that?"

"I—"

Strong hands gripped her shoulders. "This isn't about control. I won't meet women privately either. We belong to each other. Do you understand how serious I am?"

Rosalind's eyelashes fluttered. Then a slow, radiant smile curved her lips. She leaned in, pressing her mouth to his.

Lucian stiffened in shock.

When he pulled back, her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Does that answer your question? I'm deadly serious about us."

His heart turned molten. "Good. Then treat me well."

He captured her lips again, pouring three years of longing into the kiss.

The past could burn. All that mattered was this moment.

And her.

Always her.
###Chapter 867

Rosalind's radiant smile and those sparkling eyes made Lucian feel like he would believe anything she said, even if it were a lie.

He closed the distance between them and captured her lips in a kiss.

Rosalind wound her arms around his neck, returning the kiss with equal fervor.

When they finally pulled apart, her heart-shaped face was flushed. She gazed up at him, breathless. "I should head back to my studio. I have a new collection to finish today."

Lucian knew she had become a sought-after fashion designer. His thumb brushed her cheek. "Stay. Work here in my office."

He didn’t want to let her out of his sight.

It felt like they were reliving their honeymoon phase, and honestly, she didn’t mind his possessiveness.

She hesitated. "But—"

Lucian didn’t give her a chance to refuse. He stepped out of the car, rounded to her side, and opened the door. Without warning, he bent down and scooped her into his arms.

Cradling her bridal-style, he strode straight into the building.

Rosalind gasped, her lashes fluttering. "Lucian! This is your company! People are staring—put me down!"

"Not happening," he said, tightening his hold.

As they entered the lobby, every head turned.

"Mr. Graves!" someone exclaimed, standing abruptly.

Employees gaped, some stifling excited whispers. Their CEO was carrying a woman through the office like it was the most natural thing in the world.

"Oh my god! Who is she? He’s carrying her like she’s royalty!"

"He’s not even trying to be subtle. This is a full-blown public declaration!"

"I can’t—this is too adorable. They’re perfect!"

Rosalind buried her face against his chest, mortified. She clung to him, wishing she could disappear.

"Mr. Graves!"

More voices called out.

"Mrs. Graves!" someone shouted.

Others quickly followed suit, addressing her as Mrs. Graves.

A shy smile curved her lips. There was nothing more intoxicating than being someone’s undeniable favorite. Her heart swelled.

Lucian carried her into his office and set her down gently.

"Eat," he said, gesturing to the lavish spread on the table.

Rosalind blinked. "You had all this prepared?"

He nodded. "Unless you’re not hungry. You did just have lunch with Julian."

She muttered under her breath, "So petty…"

Then, louder, she declared, "I swear I didn’t eat a single bite with him!"

Lucian smirked. "Good."

He picked up a shrimp and held it to her lips. "Open."

She arched a brow. "I can feed myself, you know."

"I want to do it," he countered. "Julian tried to feed you at that restaurant, didn’t he?"

She groaned inwardly. Seriously?

Still, she obliged, taking the bite. "Mmm. Delicious."

Lucian’s smile deepened.

Rosalind then picked up another shrimp and offered it to him. "Your turn. Open wide."

He raised an eyebrow.

She grinned. "I didn’t feed Julian. Only you."

That simple declaration sent a rush of satisfaction through him. His sharp features softened as he accepted the offering.

"Julian doesn’t matter," she murmured. "No one compares to you. You’re everything to me."

Lucian’s gaze warmed. He knew she was placating him—and it worked. He loved when she made him feel like the only man in her world.
###Chapter 868

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the office as Lucian prepared to leave for yet another meeting. His schedule was relentless these days.

"You should go," Rosalind said, glancing up from her sketchbook. "I'll stay and finish these designs."

Lucian paused by the door, his gaze intense. "Don't even think about disappearing again. I mean it."

Rosalind rose on her toes and brushed her lips against his. "Relax. I'm not going anywhere."

"Promise me you'll still be here when I return."

"I promise."

Only then did Lucian finally leave, though not without one last lingering look.

Rosalind settled back into her work, the quiet hum of the office soothing her thoughts. The scratching of her pencil against paper filled the silence—until the door swung open unexpectedly.

A smile tugged at her lips as she glanced up. "Back so soon—"

Her words died in her throat.

It wasn't Lucian.

Reginald stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

"Reginald," Rosalind said, caught off guard. "What brings you here?"

He stepped inside, arms crossed. "Expecting someone else? Lucian, perhaps?"

The edge in his voice was unmistakable. Rosalind had long since accepted that Reginald despised her. "He's in a meeting. Did you need him?"

"No." His gaze pinned her in place. "I came to see you."

"Me?"

A humorless laugh escaped him. "Word travels fast. Lucian carrying you into the office like some prized possession? I knew it. Three years apart, and he still falls right back into your trap. What kind of witchcraft do you have over him?"

Rosalind's fingers tightened around her pencil. "We used to be friends, Reginald. What happened?"

"Friends?" He scoffed. "As if someone like me could ever be friends with a privileged heiress like you. Please. You and Julian are cut from the same cloth. Lucian's just your plaything, isn't he?"

"That's not true!" Rosalind shot to her feet. "I love him—"

"You love him?" Reginald's voice turned razor-sharp. "Then why did you betray him? Why did you sleep with Julian?"

The accusation struck like a physical blow. Rosalind's breath hitched. "What are you talking about? I never betrayed Lucian! I never—"

"Still lying?" His lip curled. "You only came back because Lucian became CEO of Quantum Innovations. Don't act innocent. You're the most manipulative person I know."

Rosalind opened her mouth, but no words came out. The accusations were so absurd, so vicious—

A cold voice sliced through the tension.

"Reginald."

Rosalind's head snapped up.

Lucian stood in the doorway, his presence commanding and his expression glacial. "What are you doing here?"

"Just having a chat with Rosalind," Reginald said smoothly.

Lucian moved to stand beside Rosalind, his posture protective. "Whatever you have to say, say it to me."

"But she doesn't truly care about you—"

The sharp crack of a folder slamming against the desk cut him off.

Lucian's eyes darkened. "If you value our friendship, you'll never speak to her like that again."

Reginald's jaw clenched. "So that's how it is? You'll defend her no matter what? Fine. Understood."

With a violent kick that sent a trash can clattering across the floor, he stormed out, leaving silence in his wake.
###Chapter 869
Rosalind reached out and grasped Lucian's forearm.

"Are you alright?"

Lucian shook his head slightly. "That's my line. Did Reginald say anything inappropriate? I had no idea he and Genevieve were giving you trouble. But I promise—no one will bother you again."

A warm sensation spread through Rosalind's chest. Lucian's protectiveness never failed to make her heart flutter.

"He didn't say much," she admitted. "I just don't want to cause a rift between you two. He's been your closest friend for years."

Lucian's lips curved into a reassuring smile. "Don't worry about that. Reginald and I won't fall out over this. I just needed him to understand one thing—you're mine, and no one crosses that line."

Rosalind's breath caught. Then, she recalled something odd. "Actually, Reginald said something strange today. He accused me of betraying you—of sleeping with Julian. When have I ever—"

Before she could finish, Lucian gently squeezed her shoulder. "It doesn't matter. Even if you did, that's in the past. I don't care."

"But—"

She hadn't slept with Julian.

Rosalind wanted to clarify, but Lucian interrupted again, his fingers lightly tousling her hair. "Let's not dwell on unpleasant things. All that matters is that you're mine now."

Standing on her toes, Rosalind pressed a quick kiss to his lips. "And I'll stay yours forever."

Lucian leaned in, intending to deepen the kiss, but Rosalind laughed and dodged. "Work first!"

She settled back at her desk, resuming her sketches.

Amused, Lucian returned to reviewing contracts.

As evening fell, Nathaniel entered the office. "Mr. Graves, regarding tonight's—"

Lucian cut him off. "Cancel everything. From now on, I leave at six sharp."

Nathaniel blinked.

The CEO who once pulled all-nighters was suddenly enforcing work-life balance? Unbelievable.

"Understood, sir," Nathaniel replied before exiting.

Lucian strode to Rosalind's desk. "Finished? Let's get dinner."

Rosalind stood, gathering her designs with a smile. "Actually, I promised Harrison we'd meet tonight."

Lucian's expression dimmed. "So no dinner with me?"

She laced her fingers with his, grinning. "Silly—you're coming with me. Harrison's bringing Charlotte."

His smile returned. "Introducing me to your best friend?"

"Please, everyone already knows who you are," she teased.

Fair point.

Genuine contentment settled over Lucian.

At the restaurant, Harrison had already arrived—with little Charlotte in tow.

The moment Rosalind saw the girl, she swept her into a hug, peppering her face with kisses. "Charlotte! I missed you so much! Did you miss me?"

Charlotte nodded, her voice sweet as honey. "Of course! But Mommy said you've been too busy calling lately. She said you found a boyfriend—and now I get a godfather!"

Her bright eyes landed on Lucian. "Is he my godfather?"

Rosalind beamed. "He is."

Charlotte clapped her tiny hands. "Wow! He's so tall and handsome—"

Both Rosalind and Lucian laughed.

"—no wonder you picked him!"

With her doll-like features and effortless charm, Charlotte was utterly irresistible.
###Chapter 870

Lucian gently ruffled Charlotte's hair. "Thank you for saying that, sweetheart."

Rosalind beamed. "Shall we take our seats?"

"Absolutely!"

Rosalind and Charlotte settled on one side of the booth while Harrison and Lucian took the opposite side. As the waiter began serving their meals, Harrison inquired, "How are matters progressing with Nathaniel?"

She didn't want to burden Rosalind. The couple had only recently reunited, their relationship still in that delicate honeymoon phase.

"Everything's under control. The situation with Nathaniel will be resolved shortly," Harrison reassured.

Rosalind nodded in relief. "That's wonderful to hear."

Lucian added smoothly, "Ms. Whitmore, should Mr. Hawk require any assistance, don't hesitate to reach out."

Harrison studied Lucian thoughtfully. The once-impoverished young man had transformed into a rising tech mogul. He and Rosalind—the carefully nurtured heiress—made an unexpectedly perfect match. True partnership between equals remained the ideal, without exception.

Genuine warmth filled her heart for them. Her gaze lingered on Lucian's masked face. "Were those acid burns?"

Lucian's eyes flicked toward Rosalind.

Rosalind smiled encouragingly. "I told Harrison everything. She's Dr. Sinclair—the miracle worker. I was hoping she might examine your injuries."

Harrison leaned forward. "Mr. Graves, if you're comfortable, could you remove your mask? I'd like to assess the damage."

Rosalind squeezed Lucian's hand, her eyes shining with hope. "I don't want you hiding behind that mask forever. Harrison can help."

Lucian offered Harrison a small, wry smile. "It's... not a pleasant sight. Might frighten little Charlotte here."

Charlotte giggled, her voice like wind chimes. "Only mean people are really scary! I'm not afraid at all!"

Harrison nodded firmly. "I've treated worse than burns in my practice. You won't shock me."

Their kindness enveloped Lucian like sunlight. With deliberate slowness, he reached up and removed the mask.

The ravaged skin was revealed.

Harrison's professional mask slipped for just a second. "These are severe third-degree burns."

Charlotte's eyes welled up. "Did it hurt very badly?"

Lucian's smile held decades of pain. "That chapter's closed now."

Rosalind's fingers tightened around his. "Harrison, is there any chance...?"

If Harrison said it was hopeless, then it truly was. Lucian had consulted every renowned specialist across three continents these past years. None had offered even a glimmer of hope.

Harrison's next words struck like lightning:

Lucian froze. "You're certain?"

Rosalind's entire face lit up. "You can really help him?"

Harrison nodded decisively. "Yes. I can perform reconstructive surgery for Mr. Graves, but I'll need an exceptionally rare ingredient."

Rosalind didn't hesitate. "Name it."

"Frostbloom. It flowers only once every fifty years. You'll need to procure a fresh specimen."

After years of darkness, this single ray of hope nearly blinded Lucian. "Consider it done."

Rosalind's joy radiated like sunshine. "We'll move heaven and earth to find it."

Harrison smiled. "Excellent. That settles it."

The four enjoyed their meal in warm companionship. When the evening drew to a close, Rosalind hugged Charlotte tightly. "How about a sleepover at my place tonight, darling?"
###Chapter 871
Rosalind's face brightened instantly. "Really? Can I?"

Lucian flashed her a charming smile. "Of course you can. Don't you want to spend the night with me?"

Charlotte bounced excitedly in her seat. "I do! I do!"

Harrison let out an amused chuckle. "Lucian, wouldn't it be... complicated having Charlotte stay with you tonight?"

Lucian shrugged casually. "Not at all. Charlotte used to have sleepovers at my place all the time before."

"That was before," Harrison pointed out, glancing meaningfully at Nathaniel. "Circumstances have changed. You're with Mr. Graves now. I'm not sure if it's... appropriate."

Nathaniel's lips curved into a faint smile. "It's perfectly fine. I adore Charlotte."

The little girl clapped her hands gleefully. "Yay! I get to stay with Rosalind tonight!"

Not wanting to dampen her daughter's enthusiasm, Harrison relented with a laugh. "Alright then. I'll leave her in your care, Rosalind."

Rosalind nodded. "Charlotte, say goodbye to Mommy."

"Bye, Mommy!" Charlotte waved enthusiastically as Harrison exited the car.

Lucian helped Rosalind buckle Charlotte into the plush leather backseat of his Bentley before sliding into the driver's seat. Rosalind settled beside the excited child, smoothing her dress.

"Where are we sleeping tonight?" Charlotte piped up, kicking her feet.

"My villa," Rosalind answered automatically.

Lucian's deep voice interrupted from the front. "Actually, let's go to my penthouse instead."

Rosalind's head snapped up, meeting his intense gaze in the rearview mirror. The unspoken invitation hung between them - he wanted them both at his home tonight.

Her lashes fluttered nervously. "I'm not sure that's... appropriate with Charlotte here. I need to focus on her."

Lucian's tone remained calm but firm. "I enjoy Charlotte's company too. I'd like to spend time with her."

"Then let's go to Lucian's house!" Charlotte declared cheerfully, too young to understand the tension. To her, one luxurious home was as good as another.

Rosalind's cheeks flushed pink. Going to Lucian's private residence changed everything - the implications made her pulse quicken.

When they arrived at Lucian's penthouse in the exclusive Silver Pines district, Rosalind carried Charlotte inside, taking in her first glimpse of his personal sanctuary. The three-story penthouse represented the pinnacle of luxury living in the city - Lucian's primary residence for the past three years.

Lucian produced two pairs of slippers - one petite pair for Charlotte and elegant satin ones for Rosalind. "Here, wear these."

Rosalind eyed the obviously new women's slippers suspiciously as she slipped them on. "Why do you have women's shoes here?"

Lucian's lips quirked in amusement. "What are you really asking, darling?"

"Nothing. Forget I mentioned it." Rosalind turned away, but Lucian caught her wrist gently.

"I've lived here alone for three years," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "No woman has ever crossed this threshold. I had Nathaniel purchase these today. You can ask him if you don't believe me."

Rosalind's tension eased slightly. "I was just making conversation. You didn't need to explain yourself."

Lucian tapped her nose playfully. "So you're really taking Charlotte home after this? No intention of staying with me?"

Rosalind's face burned. "Who said anything about staying with you? You're incorrigible!"

Lucian's grin turned wolfish. "I'll be as shameless as necessary when it comes to you."

Rosalind couldn't help laughing despite herself.

"Come," Lucian said, leading them down a hallway. "I'll show you to your rooms."

He ushered them into the master suite where fresh towels and pajamas lay waiting. "Everything you need is here. You two can shower first."

Rosalind lifted Charlotte into her arms. "Let's get you cleaned up, sweetheart."

The little girl nodded obediently. Their laughter and splashes echoed from the ensuite bathroom. After dressing Charlotte in a soft nightgown, Rosalind tucked her into the massive bed.

Just as she smoothed the covers, a knock sounded at the door.

Lucian's deep voice filtered through the wood. "May I come in?"
###Chapter 872

Since Rosalind and Charlotte were both girls, Lucian courteously stepped out after showing them to the suite.

Rosalind smoothed Charlotte's pajamas. "You can come back in now."

Lucian reentered, his broad shoulders filling the doorway.

Charlotte beamed. "Is Uncle Lucian staying with us tonight?"

Rosalind shook her head firmly. "Absolutely not."

"Why?" Charlotte pouted.

Rosalind kissed her forehead. "Because you're a young lady, and ladies only share rooms with their fathers. That's our special rule, remember?"

Charlotte nodded, though her brow remained slightly furrowed. "Auntie Gabrielle says that too."

Rosalind handed Lucian a leather-bound storybook. "I'm going to freshen up. Keep her entertained with this."

Lucian accepted the book with a smirk. "Your wish is my command."

As Rosalind moved toward the ensuite, she cast a glance over her shoulder. Charlotte was already snuggled under the satin sheets while Lucian propped himself against the carved headboard, his baritone voice weaving magic through the fairytale. Who knew the ruthless CEO of Quantum Innovations could do such convincing character voices?

And the way his calloused fingers turned the pages with such care...

Rosalind bit her lip and hurried into the marble bathroom. When she emerged twenty minutes later, Charlotte's rhythmic breathing filled the room.

"Asleep?" Rosalind whispered, finger-combing her damp waves.

Lucian carefully marked their page and tucked the blanket around the slumbering girl. "Out like a light."

Rosalind nodded toward the hallway. "Guest suite's down the hall to the left."

Suddenly, strong arms yanked her onto a lap of solid muscle. "That's cold," Lucian murmured against her neck.

"You'll survive," she retorted, though her pulse betrayed her.

His hands traced her waist. "Let me crash on your sofa."

Rosalind arched a brow. "You'd choose a loveseat over a king-sized bed?"

"Because you'll be here."

When his lips claimed hers, Rosalind barely managed to press a palm against his chest. "Lucian! Charlotte's right there!"

His smoldering gaze dropped to her parted lips. "Then you'll have to be very quiet."

The protest died in her throat as he kissed her senseless, then swept her up bridal-style.

"Put me down!" she hissed.

"Join me for a shower," he growled, carrying her toward the steam-filled bathroom.

Though freshly cleansed, Rosalind found herself pinned against the fogged mirrors, his mouth hot on hers. "We can't—"

"Shh," Lucian silenced her with another searing kiss. "I'll be good."

The devilish glint in his eyes promised otherwise.
###Chapter 873
Rosalind's pulse quickened at the mention of marriage.

"Who would I even marry?" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

Lucian responded by capturing her lower lip between his teeth in playful retaliation.

"Ouch!" Rosalind gasped, pulling back slightly. "That actually hurt!"

His gaze burned into hers. "Good. Now answer me properly—who do you want to marry?"

"Is there anyone else?" Her voice softened. "I meant...have you ever considered marrying me?"

Marrying Lucian Graves.

The thought sent shivers down her spine. It seemed sudden, yet inevitable. Had fate not intervened three years ago, they might already be wearing wedding bands by now.

She turned the question back to him. "Do you want to marry me?"

His arms encircled her waist, pulling her flush against him. "More than anything. The real question is—do you want to be my wife?"

Rosalind's heartbeat thundered in her ears.

Lucian straightened, his voice dropping to that intimate rasp that always unraveled her. "Marry me. I had nothing when we first met, but now I can give you the world. Back then, I never dared hope you'd say yes. But these past three years..." His throat worked. "Every night without you was agony. Do you know what it's like to crave someone's presence so deeply it physically hurts? I've never loved anyone like this."

Steam curled around them in the bathroom, his confession whispered against her skin as Charlotte slept nearby. That rough, vulnerable tone shattered her last defenses.

Three years of longing poured between them.

Three years of his unwavering love.

When Rosalind met his eyes, the intensity there nearly stole her breath.

Lucian cradled her face. "Will you marry me, Rosalind Fairchild?"

Her heart hammered wildly. Every fiber of her being screamed the answer.

"Yes." The word burst from her lips. "I'll marry you."

She wanted this—wanted to wake up beside him every morning, to build a life together.

His mouth crashed onto hers in a searing kiss that tasted like promises. Rosalind tangled her fingers in his hair, returning his passion with equal fervor. "Once we find the Frostbloom and heal your scars," she murmured against his lips, "let's have our wedding."

Lucian nodded, his forehead resting against hers. "I'll look just like before—the man you fell for."

She opened her mouth to protest—to say she loved every version of him, scars and all—but he silenced her with another kiss.

Somewhere in the haze of pleasure, his whisper curled around her: "Let's make a baby."

Across town, Harrison had taken Charlotte home. With Nathaniel's health declining, she'd been constantly occupied with his care.

Meanwhile, Rosalind and Lucian embarked for Santorina, hunting the elusive Frostbloom—a flower that bloomed only once every half-century, their last hope for restoring Lucian's face.

They arrived by evening, checking into a quaint hillside inn.

The proprietor beamed at them. "Honeymooners, yes?"

These days, they moved as one entity—so inseparable that strangers naturally assumed they were married.

Rosalind didn't correct him.

Why would she? Soon enough, it would be true.
###Chapter 874

Rosalind turned to the innkeeper with a determined expression. "We're not tourists. We came searching for something rare."

The innkeeper leaned against the wooden counter. "What exactly are you looking for? Maybe I can help."

"The Frostbloom," Rosalind said without hesitation.

His eyebrows shot up. "That legendary flower that blooms once every half-century? Well, you're in luck! Just yesterday, a man named Marcus returned from the mountains with one."

Lucian felt Rosalind's grip tighten on his arm. "Are you serious?" she breathed, eyes sparkling. "We need to speak with him immediately. Name his price—we'll pay whatever he asks!"

The innkeeper chuckled at her enthusiasm. "Got his number right here. Let me call him for you."

As he dialed, Rosalind turned to Lucian, practically vibrating with excitement. "Can you believe our timing? The Frostbloom is right here!"

Lucian brushed his thumb along her flushed cheek. "I haven't seen you this animated in weeks."

"Because this changes everything," she whispered.

The innkeeper hung up with a satisfied nod. "Marcus agreed to meet you this afternoon. Said he'd bring the flower straight here."

Rosalind's smile could have powered the entire village. "Thank you! We'll be waiting."

Back in their room, she paced like a caged tiger. "No matter what he demands—gold, properties, my firstborn—we're getting that Frostbloom."

Lucian caught her wrist mid-step. "Breathe, darling. It's ours."

By sunset, their optimism waned. The innkeeper checked his antique pocket watch for the fifth time. "Strange. He's never been late before."

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. That flower wasn't just rare—it was vital. "Please call him again."

The innkeeper redialed, then frowned. "Marcus? Where are—what? You're not selling anymore?"

Rosalind lunged forward. "Tell him we'll triple any offer! Just let us negotiate!"

After a tense exchange, the innkeeper lowered the phone. "He sold it an hour ago to another buyer. For a staggering sum."

Ice flooded Rosalind's veins. "Who bought it?" she demanded.

The line went dead before he could ask.

Rosalind snatched the address the innkeeper offered. "We're tracking him down. Now." She dragged Lucian toward the door. "Whoever has that Frostbloom won't know what hit them."
###Chapter 875
Lucian gave a solemn nod. "Very well."

He escorted Rosalind to Mark's residence, only to find the door bolted and the place deserted.

Rosalind rapped her knuckles against the weathered wood. "Hello? Is anyone home?"

A neighbor from the adjacent cottage emerged, wiping flour-dusted hands on her apron. "Looking for Mark, are you?"

Rosalind inclined her head. "Yes. Do you know where he went?"

The woman shrugged. "Packed up and left Santorina yesterday. Said he'd made his fortune and wasn't coming back."

Fortune?

Rosalind's pulse quickened. "Did he mention where he was going?"

"You here for that Frostbloom?" The neighbor chuckled knowingly. "Some fancy city folk bought it off him—paid enough gold to make his grandchildren rich. Took the money and vanished before sunset."

Rosalind's stomach plummeted. The Frostbloom—gone.

They'd timed their journey perfectly, arriving just as the legendary flower bloomed after fifty winters. Yet someone had slipped in moments before them.

Too convenient.

Suspicion coiled in Rosalind's chest like morning mist. Who could have known?

Lucian's voice cut through her thoughts. "Are there other Frostblooms in these mountains?"

The neighbor barked a laugh. "Child, that blossom's rarer than honesty in politics. Only blooms when glaciers weep. Mark stumbled upon the only one this century."

No alternatives. No second chances.

Lucian's fingers brushed hers. "You're trembling."

"We missed it by hours," she whispered.

His lips curved in that heartbreaking half-smile she'd grown to cherish. "Perhaps the universe prefers me scarred. Does it trouble you?"

Rosalind pressed against him, inhaling the pine-and-snow scent clinging to his coat. "Not even slightly."

His lips grazed her hairline. "Home, then."

She nodded against his chest.

Back at The Celestial guesthouse, Lucian disappeared into the steaming bathroom. Rosalind perched on the quilted bed, fingering the embroidered curtains. That flower could have restored his face—erased the shadows in his eyes when mirrors caught him unawares.

The mystery gnawed at her. Who had outmaneuvered them?

Her phone trilled—an unfamiliar number flashing on the screen.

"Hello?"

A velvet laugh answered. "Ms. Fairchild. What a delightful coincidence."

Every muscle in Rosalind's body tensed. Genevieve.

They'd exchanged fewer words than chess moves, yet the woman's voice ignited primal recognition.

"Ms. Sutton."

"Indeed. Shall we converse?"

Rosalind's nails bit into her palm. "You're in Santorina?"

Another laugh, closer now. "In fact, I'm admiring the very same mountain view from the suite above yours."

Understanding dawned like winter sunrise. Rosalind's lips curled. "You bought the Frostbloom."

The timing. The precision. The ruthless efficiency.

Only Genevieve could have orchestrated this.
###Chapter 876

Lucian pulled his shirt over his head in one fluid motion. "Why not, darling?"

Darling.

That single word sent electric currents down Rosalind's spine. He'd never used that endearment before.

Her legs nearly buckled beneath her. "We...we don't have any protection left."

"Ran out this morning." His lips curved into a wicked smile. "We won't need it."

What?

She distinctly remembered purchasing four packages just last week! How could they possibly be gone already? At the time, it had seemed excessive. Now, it appeared woefully inadequate.

And he wanted to proceed without any?

"Absolutely not," she insisted, pressing a hand against his chest. "That's too risky! I could get pregnant."

Lucian's gaze darkened as he studied her face. "Then let's have a baby. Charlotte's adorable. You adore children - we should have one together. I'd love that."

Little Charlotte had apparently sparked some paternal instincts - now Lucian wanted a child of their own.

Rosalind's breath hitched. "What exactly are you suggesting?"

"Don't you want to carry my child?" His fingers traced her jawline.

"I-"

"Have you considered marriage?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implication.

"You're sharp." His chuckle was low and intimate. "You're right - I acquired the Frostbloom. The rare flower you've been searching for is now in my possession. Care to discuss this further in person?"

Rosalind's laugh was icy. "Don't move. I'm coming to you now."

She ended the call and glanced toward the bathroom where the shower still ran. Lucian remained oblivious.

Grabbing the nearest pen, she scrawled a quick note: [Gone for takeout. Back soon.]

Placing it prominently on the nightstand, she slipped out.

Within minutes, Rosalind spotted Genevieve waiting in the corridor. She approached with measured steps.

"You've been tracking us. You know our every move."

Genevieve's lips curled. "Naturally. How else could I have secured the Frostbloom right under your nose?"

"Where is it?"

With theatrical flair, Genevieve produced an ornate box, lifting the lid to reveal the pristine white Frostbloom.

Rosalind lunged forward. "Hand it over!"

But Genevieve snapped the box shut, passing it to a looming bodyguard who disappeared down the hall.

"Now you've seen proof," Genevieve purred. "No deception here."

Rosalind's eyes narrowed. "State your terms. You didn't steal that flower just to admire it. This is about negotiation."

"Straight to the point." Genevieve inclined her head. "Since you understand my position, why pretend otherwise? My demand is simple - I want Lucian."

Rosalind's chest constricted. "Never! He's not some bargaining chip!"

"People trade affection all the time," Genevieve countered smoothly. "For three years while you were gone, I stood by him. We had something real. Then you returned and stole his attention. Step aside, and we can both get what we want."

Rosalind shook her head violently. "I love him. I won't abandon him to you."

Genevieve's laughter was sharp as broken glass. "Then our conversation ends here. Enjoy watching the man you love live with that ruined face forever."

As she turned to leave, Rosalind seized her wrist. "Wait!"

Genevieve turned slowly, triumph glinting in her eyes. "The terms are simple - Lucian for the Frostbloom. No compromise."

Rosalind's mind reeled. They were on the brink of marriage - how could she surrender him now?

Yet without the flower, Lucian's scars would never heal...

"You claim to love him," Genevieve taunted. "Is this love? Keeping him disfigured to satisfy your selfish desires? Three years he's avoided mirrors. Three years of shame. And now, when salvation is within reach, you'd deny him?"

"That's not true!" Rosalind protested.

"Then prove it." Genevieve's smile was predatory. "The Frostbloom for Lucian. A simple exchange."
###Chapter 877
The Frostbloom Gamble

Rosalind's voice was icy as she confronted Genevieve.

"Is this how you define love? Threatening me with the Frostbloom, forcing me to leave him? You're truly despicable."

Genevieve's lips curled into a coy smile. "Then let's see who loves him more—who's willing to make the greater sacrifice. The one who loses... is the one who loves him most."

Rosalind's fists clenched at her sides, her nails biting into her palms. She didn't respond. Instead, she shot Genevieve one last scorching glare before turning on her heel and striding away.

As Rosalind disappeared down the corridor, a figure emerged from the shadows.

Julian Blackwood.

He had accompanied Genevieve to Santorina—an unlikely alliance forged in shared ambition.

Watching Rosalind's retreating figure, Julian mused, "Do you really think she'll end things with Lucian?"

Genevieve tilted her head, a knowing glint in her eyes. "What do you think?"

"She will," Julian said without hesitation. "She's obsessed with him. Always has been, even years ago."

"Precisely," Genevieve agreed. "We both know the depth of her feelings. That's exactly why she won't hesitate."

Julian studied her, impressed. "I must admit, I underestimated you."

Genevieve smirked. "If I didn't have a few tricks, how could I have stayed by Lucian's side all these years? Rosalind doesn't stand a chance. Just be patient—she'll be yours soon enough."

Julian's lips quirked in satisfaction. "Pleasure doing business with you."

"The pleasure," Genevieve purred, "is all mine."

Back in the suite, Rosalind found Lucian fresh from the shower, a white towel slung low around his hips. He held the note she'd left earlier.

"You're back."

She nodded. "Yeah."

"Hungry? I'll order room service."

Rosalind drifted to the floor-to-ceiling windows, pressing her lips together as she gazed at the glittering cityscape below.

Lucian approached silently, his arms encircling her waist from behind. "What's troubling you?"

Through the glass, Rosalind studied his reflection. His damp hair made him look younger, almost boyish. Yet the ever-present black mask obscured half his face, a constant reminder of his scars.

She turned in his embrace. "You just showered. Why put the mask back on? It must be suffocating. You don't need it with me."

Her fingers lifted to remove it, but Lucian caught her wrist. "I prefer it on."

Her lashes fluttered. She understood his insecurity—how terrified he was of frightening her. Beneath the ruthless CEO persona lay a vulnerability that broke her heart.

Lucian gently turned her to face him. "Since we failed to secure the Frostbloom, my scars won't heal. Is that why you're upset?"

Rosalind almost laughed. Did he truly think that was her concern?

"How many times must I say it?" She cupped his masked cheek. "I don't care about your scars. I never have."

Lucian's eyes softened. He knew—yet some part of him still longed to be the flawless man she'd fallen for.

Perhaps losing the Frostbloom was fate's cruel joke. Perhaps he was meant to remain this broken version of himself forever.

He lowered his head, his lips brushing hers. "I need you."

The raw hunger in his voice sent shivers down her spine. Rosalind wound her arms around his neck, meeting his kiss with equal fervor.

"Then take me," she whispered against his mouth.

And he did.
###Chapter 878

Lucian's muscular arms encircled Rosalind as they collapsed onto the silk sheets, their bodies still humming with electricity. The scent of jasmine from the open balcony mingled with their heated breaths.

"Guess we don't need protection," Lucian murmured against her damp collarbone, his lips tracing the rapid pulse beneath her skin.

Genevieve giggled breathlessly. "Definitely not."

That night, they surrendered completely to passion—untamed, unapologetic. Time dissolved into tangled limbs and whispered promises until dawn painted the Santorinian sky in blush tones.

Afterward, Lucian cradled Rosalind against his chest. Beads of perspiration glistened on her flushed skin, chestnut curls clinging to her temples like delicate vines. His calloused thumb brushed a stray tendril from her forehead.

"Exhausted, little rose?"

Rosalind nuzzled into the steady rhythm of his heartbeat—her personal lullaby. "Completely wrecked," she slurred, too spent to lift her eyelids.

Lucian pressed his lips to her feverish brow. "Let's extend our stay. Santorina's marble beaches await."

Years of stolen moments, yet never a proper holiday.

"Next time," she mumbled into his pectoral. "Carry me onto the plane tomorrow."

His chest vibrated with quiet laughter. "As milady commands."

Then, without warning—

"Marry me when we return."

Rosalind's lashes fluttered open. Cold platinum slid onto her ring finger—a flawless emerald-cut diamond winking in the morning light.

Her breath hitched. "When did you—"

"Months ago." Lucian captured her trembling hand. "Planned fireworks over Westfield Bay, but..." His throat worked. "I need this ring to chain you to me before you vanish again."

Tears blurred her vision. The Frostbloom's ownership contract burned in Genevieve's safe. That poisonous truth—"Whoever loves deeper loses"—echoed between them.

Yet when Lucian's stormy eyes pleaded, Rosalind heard herself whisper, "Yes."

A growl tore from his chest as he crushed her against him. "We'll file paperwork the minute we land."

She clung to his shoulders, memorizing the ridge of each muscle. Just for tonight, she'd pretend destiny wasn't a ticking clock.
###Chapter 879
Tonight, Lucian was utterly irresistible.

This enchanted evening felt too perfect to end.

Before parting ways, Rosalind thought they'd created a memory beautiful enough to last a lifetime.

Lucian was euphoric. Rosalind would never know that making her his wife had been his deepest desire all along. He ached to claim her as his own forever.

Lucian cradled Rosalind's delicate hands in his. "Let's do it again."

Rosalind blinked in astonishment.

She was completely spent, yet he wanted another round? Where did he find such boundless energy?

"Save some for next time," she murmured, tracing circles on his chest. "I'm not going anywhere."

A wicked grin curved Lucian's lips. "Oh, there will be a next time. But tonight, I need you."

He drew the silk sheets over them both. Within moments, the room echoed with Rosalind's breathless whimpers and wanton moans that would make a saint blush.

Dawn found Rosalind nestled against Lucian's bare chest.

He slept deeply, his breathing even.

She studied his tranquil features, fingertips ghosting over his masked face. Sometime in the night, he'd replaced the disguise.

Her touch traced his angular jaw, memorizing every contour. She prayed next time they met, he could reveal his true self.

Genevieve claimed the one who loved deeper would lose. But Rosalind knew the truth - in this game of hearts, Genevieve never stood a chance.

Rosalind could never willingly release Lucian, yet leave she must.

One final kiss, her eyes shimmering with unspoken longing, before she slipped from his embrace.

She dressed in silence, packing only essentials.

The farewell note proved harder than expected. Words failed her until she settled on a single line. The pen clattered onto the nightstand as she shouldered her bag.

At the doorway, she paused, pressing a featherlight kiss to Lucian's brow. "Goodbye, my love."

Then she was gone.

Lucian awoke to sunlight streaming through the curtains. Last night's exertions had left him dead to the world.

He'd arranged their private jet for today. Still drowsy, he reached across the bed. "Rosalind?"

His arm met cold sheets.

Adrenaline shot through him. His eyes flew open.

The room stood empty.

"Rosalind!" He bolted upright, scanning the space.

Nothing.

He tore through the suite, flinging open bathroom doors. "Where are you?"

Only silence answered.

Fumbling for his phone, he dialed her number.

Ring after unanswered ring. Then the robotic voice: "The number you have dialed is unavailable—"

Dressing hastily, he spotted the note on his pillow.

His hands shook as he unfolded it. One sentence.

For a heartbeat, he thought his eyes deceived him.
###Chapter 880

How could this be happening?

Just last night, she had tearfully accepted his proposal beneath the starlit sky. They had planned their wedding, their future, their forever.

And now?

She was ending it all with a single text.

Why?

Lucian Graves didn’t bother with formalities. He threw on his coat and stormed downstairs. The innkeeper, wiping down the counter, glanced up with a knowing smile. "Ah, Mr. Graves! Your fiancée left earlier—said she had an urgent flight back to Metropolia."

His jaw tightened. "Which airport?"

"The international one, sir. She seemed… in a hurry."

Rosalind Fairchild had left without a word. Without an explanation. Without him.

Lucian didn’t hesitate. He booked the next flight out, his mind racing.

By the time he landed in Metropolia, Nathaniel was already waiting at the arrivals gate. "Sir."

Lucian slid into the back of the sleek black car. "Where is she?"

"Straight to the Whitmore estate," Nathaniel confirmed.

Home.

Of course she’d go there.

"Drive."

Thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop outside the grand iron gates of the Whitmore mansion. Lucian pulled out his phone, dialing for the fifth time.

This time, she answered.

"Hello?"

His grip on the phone turned bone-white. "Come outside. Now."

Rosalind stood at her bedroom window, watching the scene unfold below. The floor-length curtains fluttered around her like ghosts of the future they’d planned.

She had known he would come.

But she hadn’t prepared for the storm in his eyes when he finally saw her.
###Chapter 881

Rosalind stared at the note in her trembling hands, reading the single line repeatedly until the words blurred. Her breath caught when she glanced out the window and spotted Lucian's sleek black car parked below.

He had come after her.

Now he was demanding she come down to meet him.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "This isn't a good time, Lucian. Whatever you have to say, say it over the phone."

"Mr. Graves now?" His bitter laugh sent chills down her spine. "That's rich, considering how you screamed my name last night. Typical - forget everything once the sheets cool?"

Rosalind remained silent for three heartbeats. "Just say what you came to say. If you're done, I'm hanging up."

"Don't you dare!" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, colder than Arctic winds.

"Then get to the point."

"Why did you leave?" The raw pain in his question made her flinch. "I woke up alone. No note, no explanation - just gone."

Silence stretched between them.

"I can pretend none of this happened," he continued, desperation creeping into his tone. "The wedding plans have already started. Whatever venue, whatever dress you want—"

"Stop!" She cut him off sharply. If he kept talking, she'd crumble. "Did you read the note on the nightstand?"

When he didn't respond, she pressed on. "I left everything I needed to say in that note."

"I saw it." His voice turned flat. "And I don't accept it."

Her grip on the phone turned painful. "We're done, Lucian. There's nothing more to discuss."

"Like hell we are!" His sudden shout made her jump. "I'm not breaking up with you!"

The words lodged in her throat like shards of glass.

"Did you hear me, Rosalind? I refuse to let you go!" His voice cracked with emotion.

She squeezed her eyes shut. She didn't want this either, but it was necessary.

For his sake.

As Everett, he'd lost his father young, branded a drug dealer's son. The whispers followed him through childhood until his mother's death and that tragic cliffside accident plunged him into permanent darkness.

Now as Lucian, he stood at the threshold of light - so close to redemption.

She wanted that light for him.

With a heart heavier than lead, she forced out the words: "It's over. Face your demons alone." Her finger hovered over the end call button.

"Come down here!" he roared.

"No."

"If you're ending this," he snapped, "have the decency to say it to my face! I'm right outside!"

"I've said all I need to say."

"Then I'll wait here all night!"

"Do what you want." She disconnected.

From her window, she watched his motionless silhouette beside the car. He wasn't leaving.

Then heaven opened.

Lightning split the sky as torrential rain hammered down. Still he stood there, getting drenched, staring up at her window.

Her chest constricted.

Why wouldn't he leave? Why torture himself like this?

Below, Lucian remained rooted. He'd wait until she came down, until hell froze over if necessary.

Last night had been perfect. Then she'd vanished with that damned note. He wouldn't accept it.

Icy rivulets streamed down his face when suddenly - the rain stopped.

An umbrella appeared above him.

He turned slowly.

Rosalind.

She'd come.

His eyes blazed with hope. "You came! I knew you wouldn't—"

He reached for her hand but stopped when rainwater dripped from his sleeve onto hers. Flustered, he tried wiping it away. "Sorry, I'm soaked. Let's go inside and—"

She interrupted coldly, "Say what you need to say."

"You think I'm here to beg?" Her voice cut like shards of ice. "I came so my parents wouldn't worry. That's all."

The words struck him like physical blows.

He stared at her rain-pale face - still breathtaking, but all warmth gone.
###Chapter 882

Rosalind's icy gaze bore into Lucian, her expression utterly drained of warmth. Her lips pressed into a bloodless line. "Throw whatever tantrum you want, but don't you dare mention breaking up again. I'm never leaving you."

Lucian's voice cracked like thunder. "Why won't you listen? It's over, Rosalind!"

"Over?" His hands gripped her shoulders desperately. "We were planning our wedding yesterday! What changed? Tell me what happened!"

Rosalind jerked away. "You want the truth? Fine!"

The air between them turned glacial. Lucian's breath hitched as she continued, "We failed. The Frostbloom is gone. Your scars... they'll never heal now."

His hands fell limp at his sides. "That's why?" His voice sounded foreign even to himself. "After everything, my face is what matters?"

A cruel laugh escaped Rosalind's lips as she ripped the mask from his face. Lucian instinctively raised his arms to shield his disfigurement, but she shoved a hand mirror at him. "Look! Really look at yourself!"

The reflection showed a stranger - ravaged skin, twisted scars where handsome features once were. Lucian flinched.

"See?" Rosalind's voice turned venomous. "I believed the Frostbloom would fix this nightmare. Now I'm trapped staring at this... monstrosity every morning." Her fingers trembled as she pointed. "You can't even bear to see yourself! How can you expect me to?"

Lucian's eyes fractured like broken glass. "Is this truly how you feel?"

Pain lanced through Rosalind's chest as if a dagger twisted in her heart. Every word burned her throat, but she forced them out. "Yes. Your face disgusts me. Leave before I vomit."

The blow landed physically. Lucian staggered back as if struck.

"Never contact me again." Rosalind turned sharply, each step away from him feeling like walking on shattered glass.

Rain sheeted down as Lucian watched her silhouette dissolve into the storm. His knees buckled.

The world went dark before his body hit the pavement with a sickening thud.
###Chapter 883

Lucian Graves awoke to the sterile scent of antiseptic clinging to the air. His vision blurred as he took in the white ceiling above him, an IV line snaking into his arm.

He shifted weakly, his throat raw as he whispered, "Rosalind..."

Nathaniel hurried to his side, relief washing over his features. "Mr. Graves! You're finally awake—thank heavens. You collapsed in that storm. The doctor said your system was overwhelmed—rage, grief, and the cold all at once."

Lucian attempted to push himself up, but his limbs felt like lead. A wave of dizziness forced him back against the pillows.

Nathaniel pressed a hand to his shoulder. "Don't try to move. The doctor was clear—you need complete rest."

Lucian's gaze remained fixed on the ceiling. The memory of Rosalind walking away in the rain played on loop in his mind, each replay tightening the vise around his chest.

"I have to find her," he rasped, fingers twitching toward the IV line.

Nathaniel intercepted him. "Stop! You can't remove that. You're in no condition to go anywhere."

"Move," Lucian growled, his voice hoarse but edged with desperation. "I need to see Rosalind—"

His vision darkened abruptly. The last thing he heard was Nathaniel's frantic shout before unconsciousness swallowed him again.

"Mr. Graves!" Nathaniel lunged for the call button. "Doctor! We need help!"

The physician rushed in, checking Lucian's vitals before turning to Nathaniel with a grim expression. "His body is under extreme stress. Any further agitation could be dangerous. He must remain still."

Nathaniel nodded. "Understood. Thank you."

Once alone, he sank into the chair beside the bed, watching Lucian's restless form. "You're going to destroy yourself like this," he murmured.

Even unconscious, Lucian's lips moved, forming her name like a prayer. "Rosalind... We're not over... Rosalind..."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply and pulled out his phone. "I'm calling Ms. Fairchild."

—

Rosalind hadn't slept.

She'd spent the night tangled in sheets, staring at the ceiling until dawn bled through the curtains. When she finally looked outside, Lucian's car was gone.

He'd left.

She'd said unforgivable things—words designed to wound. Of course he wouldn't stay.

A hollow ache settled in her ribs. She curled into herself, silent tears soaking the pillow until morning light forced her to face the day.

A knock interrupted the silence.

"Still in bed?" Victoria's voice filtered through the door.

Rosalind cleared her throat. "I'm resting. I'll be up later."

"At least eat something first."

"Not hungry."

A pause. "Fine. I'll leave breakfast outside. Don't skip it."

"Okay."

Alone again, Rosalind pressed her palms to her swollen eyes. Lucian consumed her thoughts. Where was he now?

She grabbed her phone and dialed Harrison.

He answered on the first ring. "Rosalind?"

"Harrison, listen—Lucian found the Frostbloom. He'll contact you soon. When he does, please... help him."

She needed to hear it from Harrison directly. The uncertainty was suffocating.

Harrison chuckled. "Relax. I'll make sure he's fixed up good as new. Next time you see him, he'll be that heart-stopping pretty boy again."

Rosalind managed a smile, but the ache in her chest refused to fade.
###Chapter 884

Rosalind clenched her fists, forcing herself to accept that Lucian was no longer hers. He likely never wanted to lay eyes on her again.

"Harrison, I know your schedule is packed these days. I won't take up more of your time."

"Alright."

The line went dead, and Rosalind exhaled shakily. Her only prayer now was for Lucian's swift recovery.

The sudden chime of her phone startled her. An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen.

She answered cautiously. "Hello?"

"Ms. Fairchild? This is Nathaniel, Mr. Graves' personal assistant." The voice held professional warmth.

Rosalind's grip tightened on the phone. "Nathaniel? Why are you calling?"

"You need to come to Mercy General immediately. Mr. Graves has been hospitalized."

What?

She shot upright, knuckles whitening around the device. "What happened? Is he alright?"

"He spent the entire night exposed to the storm. Hypothermia and extreme stress caused his collapse."

So he never left. He'd been lying there, unconscious in the rain.

Rosalind's chest constricted painfully.

"Please," Nathaniel implored. "He's been asking for you."

Torn, she bit her lip. Should she go?

Their relationship had ended definitively last night. Cutting ties cleanly was the merciful choice - for both their sakes. Lingering would only deepen the wounds.

"I... I can't. The medical staff will provide excellent care."

"Are you certain? Even delirious with fever, he kept murmuring your name."

Her name?

Rosalind's vision blurred. That impossible man! What cruel game was fate playing?

"Please reconsider," Nathaniel pressed.

Hot tears traced her cheeks. "No. This is for the best."

"But why—"

"Clean breaks heal fastest. He'll understand... eventually."

The call disconnected with finality.

In the sterile hospital room, Nathaniel stared at his silent phone. Why such resistance?

He remembered Santorina - how radiant they'd been together, how Lucian's eyes lit up whenever Rosalind entered a room. Now? Ashes where fire once burned.

"She refused?"

Nathaniel spun toward the bed at the raspy question. Lucian's fever-bright eyes met his.

"You're awake!"

Pale as the sheets, Lucian studied him. "She won't come, will she?"

Nathaniel hesitated. "Ms. Fairchild mentioned prior commitments. She sends her regards and—"

"Don't." Lucian's whisper cut through the lie. He turned his face toward the ceiling.

The truth settled between them like snowfall - silent, inevitable, chilling.

All night, he'd clung to hope. Convinced her words stemmed from momentary anger, not conviction. Now? The crushing reality left him breathless.

She'd walked away. Again.

A hollow chuckle escaped him. Scalding tears slipped sideways into his hairline.

Darkness reclaimed him moments later.

Nathaniel maintained vigil, baffled by his employer's sudden decline. Like watching an oak tree felled by a single storm.

###Chapter 885
The sterile hospital air was thick with tension when the doctor's voice cut through the silence. "Mr. Nathaniel, your test results are ready."

"Coming."

Lucian Graves watched as Nathaniel stepped out, leaving him alone in the dimly lit room. The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was the only sound accompanying his shallow breaths.

Then—the faintest creak of the door.

Rosalind Fairchild slipped inside, her footsteps silent against the tiled floor.

She shouldn’t have come.

But here she was, drawn like a moth to flame, unable to resist one last look.

Lucian lay motionless, his usually sharp features softened by exhaustion. The stubble shadowing his jaw made him look almost vulnerable—a far cry from the powerful CEO the world knew.

Her chest tightened.

Back in Wintervale, he had been poor but full of fire. Later, as the head of Quantum Innovations, he had commanded every room he entered.

Now?

Now he looked broken.

A single tear escaped before she could stop it.

"You fool," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Her fingers trembled as she reached out, brushing lightly against his cheek. A silent prayer formed on her lips—Please, get better.

Then—

His hand snapped up, gripping her wrist.

Rosalind gasped.

Lucian’s eyes flew open, bright with triumph. "You came. I knew you would."

Before she could react, he yanked her forward, crushing her against his chest. His arms locked around her like iron.

"I knew you couldn’t stay away. You still love me. Admit it." His voice was rough with emotion. "Let’s forget this ever happened. Let’s go back to how we were."

Panic flared as she noticed the IV line in his hand—blood creeping backward. "Lucian, stop! You’re hurting yourself!"

"Never. If I let go, you’ll run again."

Desperation clawed at her. She shoved him back with all her strength. "I didn’t come for you! Nathaniel wouldn’t stop calling!"

His face fell.

"Now that I’ve seen you’re alive, I’m leaving."

She turned on her heel.

"Rosalind!"

The heart monitor shrieked as he ripped out the IV, stumbling after her. Weakness made his steps unsteady, but he caught her wrist before she could escape.

"Don’t go," he begged, his voice raw. "Please. I can’t lose you."

Her resolve wavered—but only for a second.

"Let me make this clear," she said coldly. "I don’t love you anymore."

His grip slackened. "What?"

"I. Don’t. Love. You."

One by one, she pried his fingers away.

Then she walked out—without looking back.

"Rosalind!"

His shout echoed down the hallway.

She didn’t stop.
###Chapter 886

Lucian's voice echoed through the hospital corridor as he called after Rosalind, but she kept walking without turning back.

His vision blurred suddenly. The world tilted. With a heavy thud, Lucian's body hit the cold linoleum floor.

The sound made Rosalind whirl around. Her breath caught when she saw him lying motionless. "Lucian!"

She took two frantic steps forward before freezing in her tracks. A familiar silhouette emerged from the opposite hallway - Genevieve.

Genevieve rushed to Lucian's side, her hands fluttering over his unconscious form. "Lucian? Can you hear me?"

Rosalind's feet rooted to the spot as their agreement flashed through her mind. The deal was simple: she would walk away, and Genevieve would deliver the Frostbloom.

"Mr. Graves!" Nathaniel came sprinting down the corridor. "We need medical assistance immediately!"

The emergency team swarmed around Lucian, lifting him onto a gurney with practiced efficiency. Rosalind watched helplessly as they wheeled him away.

Genevieve approached with measured steps. "I've been expecting this moment. You've honored our arrangement?"

Rosalind's throat tightened. "It's done."

A satisfied smile curved Genevieve's lips. "Excellent."

"The Frostbloom?" Rosalind pressed.

"Don't worry," Genevieve assured. "I'll personally ensure Lucian receives it. You should leave now. His wellbeing is no longer your concern."

The dismissal stung. "Will you truly care for him?" Rosalind couldn't help asking.

Genevieve's chin lifted. "Naturally. The next time you see Lucian, he'll be fully recovered - and completely over you."

Rosalind's nails bit into her palms. "Very well."

Turning away felt like tearing her own heart out. Each step toward the exit was agony, her chest constricting with unbearable pain.

Days passed without contact. Rumor had it Genevieve never left Lucian's bedside. He was discharged within the week.

Later, Harrison called with updates. The six-hour reconstructive surgery had been successful. Given a month's recovery, Lucian's face would heal perfectly.

Rosalind absorbed this information secondhand, never daring to reach out. Their story had reached its final chapter.

She told herself this was for the best. Lucian was healing. Everything had worked out as planned.

Yet the emptiness gnawed at her. Nights became endless as she lay awake, wondering about his recovery, craving just one glimpse of him.

Victoria noticed the change. "Darling, you've been so withdrawn lately. What's troubling you?"

Not wanting to burden her parents, Rosalind forced a smile. "Just exhausted from the new collection deadlines."

"I had Cook prepare your favorite chicken broth." Victoria bustled toward the kitchen. "You're wasting away before my eyes."

Returning with a steaming bowl, Victoria pressed it into Rosalind's hands. "Drink up while it's hot."

Rosalind reached for it, then suddenly doubled over. Violent nausea wracked her body as she retched uncontrollably, bringing up nothing but bile and tears.

"Good heavens!" Victoria rubbed her back anxiously. "What's brought this on?"

In that moment, realization struck like lightning.

Her cycle was over a month late.

Could it possibly be...? Was she carrying Lucian's child?
###Chapter 887

The past weeks had slipped through Rosalind's fingers like sand. Her thoughts were consumed by Lucian, so much so that she hadn't realized her period was late.

Her cycle was normally precise as clockwork, yet now it had been over four weeks.

Memories surfaced of those intimate moments with Lucian—no protection used. He'd always spoken of marriage and children, and she adored kids. Subconsciously, they'd both welcomed the possibility.

Could this mean...? Was she expecting?

Rosalind couldn't bring herself to tell Victoria. Her parents had enough worries already.

"I haven't been hungry lately," she murmured, pushing food around her plate. "Probably just exhausted. Meat doesn't appeal to me right now."

Victoria stroked her daughter's hair. "Let me make you some vegetable soup then."

"Thank you, Mother."

The moment Victoria disappeared into the kitchen, Rosalind grabbed her purse and slipped out. The neighborhood pharmacy's bell jingled as she entered.

The clerk glanced up. "Can I help you find something?"

Rosalind's voice barely rose above a whisper. "A pregnancy test, please."

"Two dollars."

Hands trembling, she hurried home and locked herself in the bathroom.

The result appeared instantly—two bold pink lines.

Pregnant.

With Lucian's baby.

This child had been conceived in love, during their happiest days. It should have been cause for celebration.

Yet now they were strangers.

Rosalind cradled her still-flat abdomen. Motherhood—a first for her.

A tiny heartbeat fluttered beneath her palm. Life growing where only emptiness had been.

No hesitation. No second thoughts. This baby was hers to keep!

Lucian's striking features and brilliant mind, combined with Lillian's academic excellence—this child would inherit the best of both bloodlines.

The crushing grief in Rosalind's chest lightened. Because now...she carried life.

Motherhood without matrimony—a path she'd never envisioned, yet here she stood.

"Welcome, little one," she whispered, tears spilling onto her shirt. "You'll be loved beyond measure."

Her phone buzzed. Harrison's name flashed on screen.

"Rosalind?"

"Free for dinner tonight? My treat."

"The Velvet Lounge at seven?"

When Rosalind arrived, Harrison was already seated, her baby bump prominent beneath a silk dress.

"Where's Charlotte?"

"Victoria took her out. With twins on the way, she won't let me lift a finger."

Rosalind reached across the table, pressing a hand to Harrison's stomach. "I have news...I'm pregnant too!"

Harrison's eyes widened. "Does Mr. Graves know?"

Rosalind shook her head sharply. "And he won't. That chapter's closed."

"When I treated his injuries last week, his mood was...stormy. I suspected a rift between you."

Rosalind gripped Harrison's wrist. "His face—has it healed completely?"

"You haven't seen him?"

Another shake of her head.

Harrison's lips curved mysteriously. "Wait until you do."

A soft smile touched Rosalind's lips. She could picture it perfectly—Lucian's sculpted features restored to their usual perfection.
###Chapter 888

The moment was interrupted by Julian Ashford's approach.

"Rosalind, what a pleasant surprise to see you here again."

Rosalind Fairchild found it oddly coincidental—they'd also crossed paths recently at The Velvet Lounge.

She offered a polite smile. "Julian, let me introduce you—this is my closest friend, Harrison Whitmore."

Julian inclined his head courteously. "A pleasure, Ms. Whitmore."

Harrison returned the greeting with a nod. "Hello."

Rosalind turned back to Julian. "Are you dining here as well?"

He confirmed with a slight tilt of his chin. "Indeed."

Just then, Harrison discreetly tugged Rosalind's sleeve. "Lucian's here."

Lucian Graves had arrived.

At the mention of his name, Rosalind's pulse quickened. A full month had passed since she last laid eyes on him.

She turned and saw him standing at the entrance—tall, commanding, impossible to miss.

Tonight, he was dressed in an impeccably tailored black suit that accentuated his broad shoulders, narrow waist, and long legs. His striking presence drew every eye in the room. And for once, he wasn’t wearing a mask. His sculpted features were fully visible, more breathtaking than ever.

Rosalind couldn’t look away. His face had healed completely. If anything, he looked even more devastatingly handsome—the kind of magnetism that came from confidence, success, and maturity. His sharp jawline and piercing gaze could make anyone’s breath hitch.

As Lucian stepped inside, the entire restaurant seemed to pause.

A group of women nearby gasped. "Oh my god, who is that?"

"That’s Lucian Graves—the tech mogul. He’s not just rich, he’s gorgeous!"

"I’d marry him in a heartbeat!"

Rosalind smiled faintly. She was genuinely happy for him. After everything, he had finally emerged stronger. Seeing him like this made all the pain feel worth it.

Julian observed him as well. "No wonder Mr. Graves always wore a mask. That face is lethal."

As a scholar, Julian held no grudges, and his admiration was sincere.

Harrison shot Rosalind a knowing glance. "Well? Thoughts?"

Rosalind exhaled softly. "He looks incredible. Thank you."

Harrison smirked. "Sweetheart, he was always that stunning. His face hasn’t changed."

True. Lucian—or Everett, as she once knew him—had always carried that effortless allure.

Soon, a small entourage formed around Lucian. Rosalind recognized two of them—Genevieve and Reginald—along with a few executives from Quantum Innovations. Clearly, this was a business dinner.

And Genevieve was standing right beside Lucian.

As they moved further into the restaurant, their paths inevitably crossed. The space wasn’t large, and the encounter was unavoidable.

The air thickened with tension.

Lucian didn’t spare Rosalind a glance. Instead, his gaze settled on Harrison, and he gave a polite nod. "Dr. Whitmore, good evening."

He owed her for the surgery that had restored his face.

Harrison smiled. "Good evening, Mr. Graves."

Then, she linked her arm with Rosalind’s. "What are the odds? Rosalind and I just happened to choose this place tonight."

Rosalind’s heart hammered as she met Lucian’s eyes.

He looked at her—only for a second—but his expression was ice. Detached. As if she were nothing more than a stranger. Not a single word. Just that cold, dismissive glance before he turned away.

Genevieve, standing proudly at Lucian’s side, beamed at Rosalind. "Ms. Fairchild! Fancy seeing you here."

Reginald chuckled. "Small world, isn’t it? You do turn up everywhere lately."
###Chapter 889

Rosalind remained silent. Truth be told, she didn’t know what to say.

Just then, Lucian spoke, his voice cool and detached. "Let's go."

Genevieve nodded. "Alright."

Lucian turned to Harrison. "Until next time, Dr. Whitmore."

Harrison replied simply, "Goodbye."

With that, Lucian left with Genevieve, Reginald, and the others.

Rosalind watched his retreating figure, a sharp pang twisting in her chest—like a needle had lodged itself deep, the pain unrelenting.

Harrison studied her with concern. "Are you okay?"

Rosalind shook her head. "I'm fine."

Julian interjected, "Didn’t you always want to study at our university? I pulled some strings and got you a spot. Interested?"

As a professor at a prestigious institution, Julian had secured Rosalind a place in an advanced program.

Lately, her fashion design projects hadn’t been too demanding. A change of scenery, something to distract her from the heartache Lucian had left behind, sounded perfect. Returning to academia might be exactly what she needed.

A bright smile curved her lips. "Thank you for arranging that. I’d love to go."

Julian nodded. "Great. I’ll pick you up tomorrow, and we can head there together."

Rosalind quickly shook her head. "No need. I’ll go on my own. You’re a professor—it’s better if we keep some distance. I don’t want people thinking I got in through favoritism."

Julian chuckled. "Fair enough. I’ll grab dinner then."

"Alright, see you later."

He walked away.

Harrison watched him leave. "Rosalind, it’s obvious Professor Ashford has feelings for you."

They were adults. Julian’s affection wasn’t subtle. When the Whitmore family crisis had struck, he’d even offered his help, though she’d declined.

"I don’t feel that way about him," Rosalind admitted.

"I can tell. You keep him at arm’s length. He’s perceptive—he knows."

Rosalind actually enjoyed Julian’s company. He was intelligent, respectful, and understood boundaries.

Finally, she said, "Let’s drop this and eat."

Harrison hesitated before asking, "Have you thought about your next steps? Are you really planning to raise this child alone?"

Rosalind rested a hand over her stomach. Just the thought of the tiny life inside her lifted her spirits, dulling the ache Lucian had left behind.

"I don’t plan to marry. I’ll raise this baby on my own. Honestly, that’s more than enough for me."

Harrison gave her a supportive smile. "That’s perfectly fine. I’ll be the godmother, and Charlotte can be the sister."

Rosalind nodded. "Exactly. Now, let’s eat."

"Alright."

They headed to a private dining room and began their meal. Midway through, Rosalind excused herself to the restroom.

Standing at the sink, she splashed cold water on her face. The door creaked open, and footsteps approached.

Rosalind glanced up—and in the mirror, she saw Genevieve’s reflection.

Genevieve walked over and began washing her hands. "What a coincidence. I came to freshen up and ran into you."

Rosalind smirked.

"No one else is here. Drop the act. You probably saw me come in and followed me, didn’t you? Here to gloat now that you’ve won?"

She wasn’t surprised. She’d expected Genevieve would seek her out eventually.
###Chapter 890

Ever since their uneasy truce, Rosalind had deliberately avoided private conversations with Genevieve.

Genevieve's lips curled into a calculated smile. "How perceptive—I came specifically to see you. Lucian's scars have healed beautifully, and we're officially together now."

Together?

Though Rosalind had anticipated this outcome, the confirmation still felt like a dagger twisting in her chest.

The pain was excruciating.

Genevieve continued, her voice dripping with false sweetness, "We're blissfully happy. Marriage is the natural next step. I'm certain you'll wish us well, won't you?"

Marriage?

This was moving at lightning speed.

Rosalind's fingers clenched into fists, her nails biting into her palms. She barely registered the physical pain. If not for that fateful accident... she and Lucian might have already exchanged vows by now.

Instead, he was pledging his life to Genevieve.

Rosalind met Genevieve's gaze head-on.

"Do you genuinely believe I'd bless your union?" She stepped forward, her voice low and dangerous. "We both know the truth behind your little schemes to ensnare Lucian. Drop the act—I have no interest in your performances."

Without waiting for a response, Rosalind turned on her heel and strode away.

Behind her, Genevieve's lips twisted into a venomous smirk of triumph.

As Rosalind entered the corridor, another familiar figure materialized—Reginald.

What cruel twist of fate kept throwing these people in her path today?

Reginald's eyes locked onto hers. "Rosalind."

She met his gaze coolly. "Speak your piece quickly. We have nothing to reminisce about."

"Straightforward as ever," he remarked. "Then I'll be blunt. I never approved of you. Turns out my instincts were right—you're utterly unworthy of Lucian. You exploited him during your family's crisis, then discarded him when his face became... inconvenient. If not for Genevieve risking her life for that Frostbloom, he'd still be disfigured. You betrayed him repeatedly. You were never his equal."

A bitter laugh threatened to escape Rosalind's throat. Did these fools truly believe Genevieve's fabricated heroics? Had any of them glimpsed the viper beneath her saintly facade?

The irony was almost comical.

"Finished?" Rosalind asked flatly. "Then I'll take my leave."

Reginald called after her, "Just stay away from Lucian. Let him and Genevieve build their future in peace."

Rosalind froze, then slowly turned. Her eyes burned with icy clarity.

"If that's your concern, rest assured—I have zero interest in chasing after Lucian Graves. I sincerely hope their marriage is filled with joy and their nursery overflows with children. Satisfied?"

At that moment, Reginald's gaze shifted past her shoulder. "Ah, Lucian."

Rosalind's blood turned to ice.

She turned mechanically to find Lucian silhouetted against the hallway lights.

There was no telling how long he'd been standing there, but his expression confirmed he'd heard every damning word—especially her sarcastic blessing of his impending nuptials.

The air between them crystallized.

Lucian's piercing gaze locked onto hers, so frigid it stole her breath. Even across the distance, she could feel the glacial fury radiating from him.
###Chapter 891

Reginald approached Lucian with a smirk.

Just then, Genevieve emerged from the building. "Lucian, what are you doing out here?"

Lucian's gaze softened as it landed on her. "You were gone too long. I got worried."

Reginald chuckled, nudging Genevieve playfully. "Seems like someone can't bear to be apart from you."

A delicate blush spread across Genevieve's cheeks. "Stop teasing. Let's go back inside."

"Fine, fine."

Lucian walked away with them, his shoulder brushing past Rosalind without so much as a glance.

Rosalind stood frozen, her heart twisting painfully.

They had become strangers—two people who once knew each other's souls.

She leaned against the cold wall, eyes burning. No matter how hard she fought them, hot tears spilled down her face.

Losing Lucian hurt more than she ever imagined possible.

Exhausted, Rosalind returned home and collapsed onto her bed. Pregnancy had made her unbearably tired lately.

She had already enrolled at Julian's university, her paperwork finalized. Classes would start soon.

Then her phone rang.

Lillian's weak voice trembled through the line. "Rosalind... I'm sick."

Rosalind bolted upright. "Sick? Did you see a doctor?"

"High fever. 105 degrees. I'm in my dorm."

Though the research facility had medical staff, such a high fever was dangerous. What if it caused brain damage?

"I'm coming."

"Okay. I'll tell security to expect you."

Rosalind packed an overnight bag and hailed a cab straight to the research base.

Thirty minutes later, a guard escorted her to Lillian's dorm. "Here you are."

"Thank you."

She knocked. The door opened to reveal Lillian, pale and sweating. "You made good time."

Rosalind steadied her, pressing a hand to her forehead. "You're still burning up. Didn't the doctor give you anything?"

"He did. Medicine takes time. Fevers like this come in waves."

"Back to bed. I'll stay and take care of you."

The dorm was luxurious—more like a five-star hotel suite than student housing. Research staff certainly lived well.

Once Lillian was settled, Rosalind asked, "Hungry? I could make you something."

Lillian managed a weak smile. "Since when can you cook?"

Rosalind paused.

Raised as an heiress, she'd never needed to learn. But she refused to back down now.

She squared her shoulders confidently. "Just wait. You're getting the best grilled cheese of your life!"

Rosalind marched into the kitchen, pulled up a cooking tutorial, and got to work.

Thirty minutes later, Lillian rushed in, coughing.

"What's that burning smell?"
###Chapter 892

Rosalind stood frozen, clutching the scorched saucepan with trembling hands. "I...I messed up again. The grilled cheese is completely ruined."

Lillian burst into laughter, swiftly rescuing the blackened pan from her grasp. "Darling, let's face facts - you're a kitchen disaster. That's why I took the liberty of calling in reinforcements."

The truth stung. Rosalind had zero culinary talent, despite her stubborn insistence she could learn. The charred remains of her latest attempt proved otherwise. Relief flooded her at the thought of professional help.

"You hired a chef?" Rosalind's eyes sparkled with sudden hope. "Had I known, I would've summoned our family's Michelin-starred cook from Rosewood Manor!"

Lillian opened her mouth to respond when—

Ding-dong!

Rosalind practically skipped to the door, beaming as she swung it open. "Welcome, chef—"

Her greeting died mid-sentence. Towering in the doorway stood an imposingly familiar figure.

Lucian.

Of all people, Lucian Graves stood on her threshold.

Rosalind's fingers tightened on the doorknob. What was he doing here?

Lucian's gaze swept over her with detached indifference before looking past her into the apartment.

Lillian appeared instantly, clapping her hands. "I invited Lucian! He's practically a gourmet chef. From now on, we're banning you from anything involving stoves."

Lucian stepped inside, his aristocratic nose wrinkling. "Why does it smell like a dumpster fire in here?"

Lillian pointed dramatically toward the kitchen. "That would be Rosalind's attempt at making me lunch."

Lucian inspected the carbonized sandwich remains before leveling Rosalind with a look that screamed 'hopeless case.' "Impressive. Most people manage to burn toast, not create geological specimens."

Rosalind's cheeks burned. Humiliation complete.

"I'll handle dinner," Lucian declared, already shrugging off his tailored suit jacket to reveal a crisp white shirt that clung to his broad shoulders. He rolled up his sleeves with precise movements, exposing muscular forearms as he commandeered the kitchen.

Rosalind stared, transfixed. The sight of this powerful CEO—a man who commanded boardrooms—domesticating her kitchen was absurdly mesmerizing.

They say nothing's sexier than a man who can cook. She was beginning to understand why.

Lucian's unexpected appearance left her off-balance. Being near him again after everything...the tension was palpable.

Lillian tugged Rosalind's arm. "Come on. Let's give the master some space. He'll summon us when the masterpiece is ready."

Retreating to the bedroom, Lillian flopped onto the bed while Rosalind perched nervously on the edge.

"Did you orchestrate this?" Rosalind accused.

Lillian smirked. "What? Did my brother do something to upset you again?"

Despite her youth, Lillian was frighteningly perceptive. Rosalind had tried shielding her from their complicated history, but nothing escaped those sharp eyes.

Rosalind forced a smile. "Adult relationships are complicated, sweetheart."

Lillian suddenly embraced her. "Stop treating me like a child! You're the only sister I want. I'm still waiting for you two to—"

Rosalind gently booped Lillian's nose. "No meddling in grown-up affairs, little miss matchmaker."

The scent of something delicious began wafting from the kitchen, making Rosalind's stomach growl. Against her better judgment, she found herself stealing glances toward the man who'd once broken her heart—now miraculously cooking her dinner.
###Chapter 893

Rosalind pulled Lillian into a fierce embrace. "You're the only sister-in-law I'll ever accept!"

A warm sensation flooded Lillian's chest. Whatever turmoil existed between her and Lucian, at least her affection for Rosalind hadn't been misplaced.

Moments later, Lucian's voice carried from the hallway. "Dinner's served! Come eat!"

Rosalind guided Lillian toward the dining area. The table held three artfully arranged sandwiches and a fresh garden salad.

For someone like Lillian whose culinary skills were nonexistent, she couldn't help but admire Lucian's efficiency. In mere minutes, he'd prepared an entire meal.

Lucian pulled out a chair with effortless grace. "Dig in."

Lillian settled beside Rosalind, guilt gnawing at her. She'd come to care for Rosalind, yet she'd contributed nothing.

She nibbled at her sandwich, her stomach rebelling against the idea of food.

Rosalind's concerned gaze landed on her. "You're barely eating."

Lillian hesitated, unwilling to mention her pregnancy. "Just not very hungry these days."

Rosalind's brow furrowed. "Are you feeling unwell too?"

Lillian froze. Unwell wasn't the right word - expecting was more accurate.

Across the table, Lucian's mocking voice cut through the silence. "Perhaps my cooking doesn't compare to The Velvet Lounge's fare? Or is my presence ruining your appetite?"

Lillian's fork clattered against her plate. What was he implying?

Rosalind blinked. "What's that supposed to mean?"

Lucian's lips twisted into a sardonic smile as his gaze pinned Lillian. "You seemed perfectly capable of enjoying dinner at The Velvet Lounge recently. Suddenly you've lost your appetite?"

Understanding dawned. He thought she was putting on an act.

Before she could respond, Rosalind's expression darkened. "What's wrong with you? Why are you being so cruel?"

Lillian squeezed Rosalind's hand. "He didn't mean it like that-"

Lucian interrupted coldly. "I meant every word."

Lillian's breath caught in her throat.

Rosalind's voice turned steely. "Lucian, one more word and you're leaving. This is my home."

Lillian hastily grabbed her sandwich. "No fighting, see? I'm eating!"

As she brought the food to her lips, a wave of nausea crashed over her. She doubled over, hand pressed to her mouth.

Rosalind immediately abandoned her meal to rub Lillian's back. "Are you okay?"

Lucian's posture stiffened noticeably as he observed her struggle.

Tears pricked Lillian's eyes from the discomfort, but she forced a smile. "I'm fine. Just... stomach issues."

"Must be Lucian's terrible cooking. What would you rather eat?" Rosalind fretted.

Lillian's cheeks burned. "No, the food's fine. Maybe... something tart would help."

At that moment, a melodic chime interrupted - Lucian's phone vibrating on the table.

Lillian's gaze inadvertently flicked to the screen.

Genevieve was calling.
###Chapter 894

Rosalind was calling Lucian.

"I'll take this in the hallway."

Lucian stepped out with his phone in hand.

Lillian huffed dramatically. "Why the big secret? Can't he just answer here like a normal person?"

Rosalind suspected Lucian and Genevieve wanted some privacy for their intimate conversation. Probably all those sweet nothings lovers whisper to each other.

She forced a smile. "Don't mind him. Finish your dinner before it gets cold."

Lillian picked at her food. "I'll have someone bring you some sour snacks later. Would you prefer citrus fruits or sour gummies?"

Rosalind met her gaze with a tired smile.

Lucian never returned after taking the call. Rosalind and Lillian got ready for bed, settling under the covers together.

"Did Lucian go back to Quantum Innovations?" Rosalind asked.

She assumed his tech empire kept him occupied, and at this late hour, he likely wouldn't return.

Lillian nodded. "Probably. I texted him but got no reply. Must be swamped with work."

Rosalind felt relieved. His presence always unsettled her lately.

She tucked the blanket around Lillian. "Get some rest. Sleep is the best medicine."

Lillian snuggled closer. "You should sleep early too. Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

Lillian drifted off quickly, but Rosalind tossed restlessly.

Normally she cherished sleep. But ever since Lucian reappeared in her life, her thoughts had been in chaos.

Was he still at the office? Or with Genevieve? What were they doing together?

She tried blocking the images, but her traitorous mind kept conjuring scenarios. Lucian dominated her thoughts.

Time slipped by until her eyelids grew heavy. She was finally dozing off when-

Click.

The door creaked open. Rosalind bolted upright. "Who's there?"

Her first thought was an intruder.

Then she saw him.

Lucian had returned.

He approached the bed. The warm lamplight cast golden shadows across the room. Rosalind and Lillian lay curled together, the air sweet with floral perfume. The scene was peaceful, domestic.

Rosalind rubbed her sleepy eyes, blinking up at him like a confused kitten. Something in Lucian's expression softened momentarily.

He extended a small paper bag. "For you."

Rosalind blinked. "What's this?"

She peeked inside to find an assortment of tart candies and citrus treats.

Her breath caught. "You... bought these?"

Lucian arched an eyebrow. "Who else?"

Her heart fluttered strangely.

Why would he do this? Had he left just to get her these? Because she'd casually mentioned craving something sour earlier?

The questions burned her tongue, but fear kept them locked inside. Her lashes fluttered as she whispered, "Thank you."

"Don't mention it." His voice was cool. "Consider it thanks for looking after Lillian all these years."

So this was about his sister?

Rosalind didn't dare ask for clarification.

When she remained silent, Lucian turned. "Rest. I'll be in the living room if Lillian needs anything."

With that, he left.

He was staying the night?
###Chapter 895
Rosalind hadn't anticipated Lucian would stay overnight.

The moment he left, silence swallowed the room. She reached for a lemon drop, letting the sharp citrus burst dissolve on her tongue, calming the queasiness that had been plaguing her.

Her fingers brushed lightly over her still-flat abdomen. Your father bought these for us...

She settled back against the pillows, but sleep remained elusive no matter how long she lay there.

Where had Lucian gone? Had he taken the guest room down the hall?

Curiosity got the better of her. Slipping out from under the covers, she grabbed a water glass as an excuse and padded into the hallway.

She found him almost immediately—not in any bedroom, but sprawled across the living room sofa.

The couch was spacious, but his six-foot-three frame made it look almost comically small. One long leg dangled off the edge, and only a thin throw blanket covered him. He was already asleep.

The nights were still chilly. That flimsy blanket wouldn't do. He'd catch a cold.

Rosalind crept back to the bedroom and pulled a thick duvet from the closet. Moving silently, she returned to Lucian's side.

She carefully lifted the thin blanket away and replaced it with the heavier quilt.

In the dim glow of the nightlight, she studied his face. This was the first proper look she'd gotten since his injuries had healed.

Time had sharpened his features—the cold, arrogant boy from three years ago had matured into a devastatingly handsome man. More striking than ever.

Her breath caught. Before she could stop herself, her fingers grazed his cheek.

A featherlight touch.

Then—

Strong fingers clamped around her wrist, yanking her down with startling force.

Rosalind gasped as she tumbled against him, her body flush against his chest. "Lucian—mmph!"

His mouth crashed into hers.

Her lashes fluttered wildly. That familiar scent—clean, masculine, him—wrapped around her as his kiss deepened, urgent and demanding.

He kissed like a man starved.

His tongue swept past her lips, claiming, devouring. Rosalind melted into the onslaught, her fingers tangling in his hair without conscious thought—whether to pull him closer or push him away, she didn't know.

Then he moved.

In one fluid motion, Lucian rolled them over, pinning her beneath him. His scorching mouth left hers, trailing down her throat, lower—

Her thin nightgown provided no barrier. His lips burned a path along her collarbone, lower still—

Her fingers tightened in his hair. "Lucian... Ah!"

He wedged a knee between her thighs, parting them effortlessly. One hand dropped to his waist, loosening his belt—

Everything happened too fast.

Reality slammed back into her. Rosalind shoved against his chest. "Do you even know who I am?"

Lucian silenced her with another searing kiss.

She bit down—hard.

He hissed, pulling back slightly. But instead of releasing her, he buried his face in the crook of her neck, his breathing ragged.
###Chapter 896

Rosalind's cheeks burned crimson, her breathing shallow and erratic. "Lucian..."

His voice emerged rough and strained as he whispered, "Genevieve..."

He had called out Genevieve's name.

A glacial wave crashed over Rosalind, freezing her to the core.

So he believed she was Genevieve? Had they already been intimate?

Genevieve had mentioned their impending marriage. Did that mean... they'd already crossed that line?

Rosalind's heart shattered like fragile glass. Her normally serene eyes now blazed with anguish. She shoved Lucian away violently and fled to the bedroom.

The door slammed with finality as she collapsed against it, sliding down to the floor in a heap.

Wrapping her arms around her knees, silent tears streamed down her face like molten silver, each drop scalding her skin.

The pain in her chest was unbearable.

So this was the agony of hearing the man you love whisper another woman's name against your skin.

Rosalind bit her lip bloody to stifle her sobs, though her entire body trembled with suppressed grief.

Meanwhile, Lucian remained motionless on the couch. He draped an arm over his eyes, attempting to smother the lingering fire in his gaze.

The craving for her still burned through his veins.

His throat worked convulsively. When he finally opened his eyes, they reflected only hollow emptiness against the ceiling.

No one could decipher his thoughts. After an eternity, a bitter chuckle escaped him - self-deprecating and utterly devoid of warmth.

Rosalind finally succumbed to exhaustion near dawn, causing her to oversleep.

Lillian had to rouse her gently. "Rosalind?"

She sat up blearily. "How are you feeling?"

Her fingers brushed Lillian's forehead. The fever had subsided, though residual warmth lingered.

Lillian appeared markedly improved - color had returned to her cheeks and vitality to her movements. "Much better. But... what happened to you? Your eyes..."

Rosalind's eyes were swollen from last night's torrent of tears.

"Poor sleep," Rosalind deflected. "I'll apply a warm compress."

In the bathroom, she pressed a steaming towel against her throbbing eyelids.

"Lucian prepared breakfast," Lillian mentioned. "You should eat before resting more."

Just his name sent fresh daggers through Rosalind's chest. But life continued, and she couldn't burden Lillian with her heartbreak.

She forced a smile. "Of course."

After ten minutes, the swelling diminished. Rosalind dressed and followed Lillian out.

Lucian stood impeccably attired in a crisp white shirt and tailored trousers. He placed a glass of milk on the table. "Breakfast is ready."

His composure was flawless, as if last night's events had never occurred.

Rosalind attempted to mirror his detachment but faltered. "I'll fetch the cutlery."

She turned abruptly - directly into Lucian's solid chest.

Startled, she looked up into his penetrating gaze and froze.

Lillian erupted in exaggerated giggles. "Honestly! Must you two be so obvious? I'm far too young for such scandalous displays!"

She dramatically covered her eyes. "Pay me no mind! I saw nothing! Continue your... whatever this is!"

Rosalind's face ignited with embarrassment - words failed her completely.
###Chapter 897

Rosalind froze mid-step, her body tensing with sudden discomfort. She'd been actively trying to avoid Lucian - yet somehow ended up colliding with him anyway.

His striking features loomed above her, triggering a flood of memories from last night. The way he'd pinned her down, claiming her lips... while whispering another woman's name.

"Genevieve."

Rosalind shoved against Lucian's chest, stumbling back two paces. Heat flooded her cheeks as she stammered, "M-my apologies."

Lucian's smirk deepened as he took in her flustered state. "Relax," he drawled, amusement lacing his tone. "It's just a little bump. Why so jumpy?"

The realization hit her like ice water. They were over. While she remained emotionally tangled, he'd clearly moved on without a second thought.

Pathetic. She needed to match his detached composure. Besides, with Lillian around, complete avoidance wasn't an option.

Drawing a steadying breath, Rosalind straightened. "My mistake."

Lucian grabbed a porcelain bowl, his movements deliberate. "Let's eat."

Lillian tugged Rosalind toward the table. "Come sit, Rosalind! The food's getting cold."

Rosalind nodded stiffly. "Of course."

Lucian pressed a hand to Lillian's forehead. "Still running a slight fever," he murmured. "I'll be by tomorrow to check on you."

Lillian beamed. "Perfect!"

Seeing Lucian had everything handled, Rosalind seized her chance. "Since your brother's here, I should probably head home."

Being near Lucian felt like walking through a minefield. Every second stretched unbearably.

Lillian's smile faltered. "Leaving already? Are things that hectic?"

Rosalind forced a light tone. "I'd just be in the way. Besides, Julian secured me a spot in that intensive seminar at Westfield. Starts soon."

Before Lillian could respond, Lucian cut in sharply, "If Rosalind wants to go, let her."

Love life? What nonsense was this?

Rosalind's gaze snapped to Lucian. "It's not that I want to leave—"

"But you are leaving, aren't you?"

"I—"

Words failed her.

Lucian's smile turned razor-sharp. "By all means, go. I've got Lillian. Though I suspect your mind's already with Professor Ashford anyway."

Irritation prickled along Rosalind's spine.

Lillian blinked between them. "Who's Julian?"

Rosalind opened her mouth—

"Westfield's golden boy," Lucian interjected smoothly. "Prestigious family, Ivy League pedigree, devastatingly handsome—exactly Rosalind's type."

Rosalind gaped. Since when had Lucian become so petty?

Lillian clapped excitedly. "He sounds wonderful! Rosalind, you should—"

A sudden glare from Lucian silenced her. Undeterred, Lillian glared right back. If her brother wanted to play games, she'd play too.

The tension thickened like fog.

Rosalind couldn't let this escalate. "Actually," she said quickly, "the seminar can wait. I'll stay until you're fully recovered."

The words tasted like surrender. But anything was better than this battlefield.
###Chapter 898
Rosalind beamed at Lillian. "I told you! You're absolutely brilliant."

Lillian lifted her soup bowl with delicate fingers. "Shall we eat?"

The dining room filled with an uncomfortable silence that stretched between bites. When the last morsel disappeared, Lillian rose gracefully.

"I'll handle the dishes."

Though she hadn't contributed to cooking, basic courtesy demanded she assist. As a guest in Lucian's home, she refused to be dead weight.

Her manicured fingers brushed against silverware when Lucian's strong hand encircled her wrist abruptly. The unexpected contact sent electric currents up her arm.

His palm radiated warmth, the slight roughness of his skin contrasting sharply against her porcelain complexion.

"You prepared the meal. Allow me," Lucian's baritone voice rumbled.

Rosalind's dark lashes fluttered. "I want to help. It's only fair."

A smirk played on Lucian's lips. "Why bother learning domestic chores? If you've never done them, don't start now."

The intensity of his gaze made her pulse quicken.

With deliberate slowness, he released her wrist. "Keep Lillian company. That's contribution enough."

Rosalind nodded mutely as Lucian gathered plates with effortless efficiency. From the kitchen doorway, she observed his crisp white shirt stretching across broad shoulders as he worked. The rolled sleeves revealed corded forearms that flexed with each movement. Even performing mundane tasks, he exuded lethal elegance - the kind of man women wrote sonnets about.

A painful realization struck: she'd never encounter another man like Lucian Graves.

"Admiring the view?" Lillian's teasing voice interrupted her thoughts.

Rosalind jerked her gaze away. "Must you torment me?"

Lillian's musical laughter filled the hallway. "Oh please, even I acknowledge my brother's unfair attractiveness. So... when's the wedding?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. Neither had disclosed their fractured relationship to Lillian. The charade continued, and the weight of deception settled heavily on her shoulders.

"You should rest," Rosalind deflected, steering Lillian toward the bedroom.

Lillian giggled. "Yes, doctor's orders."

Moments later, Lillian reappeared in the kitchen, planting herself before Lucian.

"Did you two quarrel?"

Lucian's hands stilled in soapy water. His expression remained inscrutable. "She told you?"

"Not a word. Remarkable, considering you're being insufferable." Lillian crossed her arms. "What happened? Everything was perfect before."

Lucian's jaw tightened. "Ask her."

"It's obviously your fault!" Lillian huffed.

An incredulous brow arched in response.

Lillian jabbed a finger at his chest. "Mark my words - if Rosalind leaves you, I'm choosing her side!"
###Chapter 899

Lucian Graves couldn't comprehend why Lillian would choose Rosalind Fairchild over him. His hands stilled in the soapy dishwater as a chilling thought struck—was he truly her blood brother?

He shot Lillian a searching glance. "What if I'm not the one at fault here? What if Rosalind's the problem?"

"Impossible! Rosalind's never wrong!" Lillian's retort came swift and absolute.

A humorless chuckle escaped Lucian. The realization hit him like a slap—his sister's loyalty was irrevocably one-sided.

"You'd better fix things with Rosalind, or else!"

With that ultimatum, Lillian flounced back to her bedroom, leaving Lucian staring blankly at the porcelain plate in his hands.

Rosalind spent the afternoon in Lillian's company. While the younger girl sketched complex research diagrams, Rosalind pretended to focus on her fashion sketches—though her ears remained attuned to every sound beyond the door.

After finishing the dishes, Lucian departed—likely to his office. The man had been drowning in work lately.

The doorbell chimed that evening, admitting a cluster of Lillian's university friends from the research institute. Their cheerful voices filled the foyer as they swarmed the living room.

Lillian immediately latched onto Rosalind's arm. "Everyone, meet Rosalind Fairchild!"

The girls' eyes widened appreciatively. "Oh my god, Rosalind! You're stunning!"

"Maddy talks about you constantly, but she never mentioned you were this gorgeous!"

Rosalind offered a practiced smile. "That's very kind of you."

The front door swung open abruptly, revealing Lucian laden with grocery bags. He'd clearly made a detour after work.

The reaction was instantaneous—female gazes locked onto his tall frame like homing beacons. One girl tugged Lillian's sleeve urgently. "Who is that walking god?"

Lillian smirked. "My brother, Lucian. Lucian, these are my friends."

He acknowledged them with a curt nod, his piercing gaze sweeping the room before disappearing into the kitchen to unpack groceries.

The girls collectively forgot to breathe.

"Your brother is... wow."

"He cooks too? Gorgeous and domestic—where do I sign up?"

Lillian preened at their admiration. "Lucian excels at everything. His cooking's divine. Right, Rosalind?"

She seized the opportunity to showcase Lucian's virtues.

Rosalind's lips curved into a faint smile. "Indeed, he's quite skilled."

Among the visitors, Vivian Astor stood out—a vision of youth and beauty whose gaze remained riveted to Lucian.

"What does your brother do?" Vivian inquired casually.

Lillian's chest puffed with pride. "He's CEO of Quantum Innovations."

A fresh wave of gasps erupted.

"No way!"

"Genius runs in the family, huh? No surprise with Maddy being so brilliant!"

As laughter bubbled through the room, Rosalind found herself transported to her own university days—that golden era before life's harsh lessons. Back when she'd first encountered Lucian Graves.

Without warning, bile surged in her throat. She stood abruptly. "Excuse me—restroom."

Lillian waved absently. "Sure."

Rosalind barely made it to the porcelain basin before her stomach revolted violently.
###Chapter 900

The nausea hit Rosalind like a tidal wave the moment she opened her eyes. Morning sickness had become her cruel companion since discovering her pregnancy. A bitter taste flooded her mouth as stomach acid scorched her throat, bringing involuntary tears to her eyes.

She stumbled into the bathroom, gripping the marble countertop until her knuckles turned white. The cold water from the faucet provided momentary relief as she splashed it against her flushed face.

"Rosalind?"

The soft voice made her jump. Vivian stood in the doorway, her designer dress hugging her petite frame perfectly.

"Hey." Rosalind straightened, wiping droplets from her chin. "Did you need the bathroom?"

Vivian's glossy lips curved into a practiced smile. "Actually..." She toyed with her diamond bracelet. "You're close with Lillian's brother, right?"

The question landed like an unexpected punch. Rosalind's fingers twitched against the damp towel. "I know him, yes."

Vivian took a step closer, the scent of her Chanel perfume overpowering the mint toothpaste in the air. "Could you... do me a tiny favor?"

Rosalind tilted her head, the motion making her stomach lurch again. "What kind of favor?"

A blush crept up Vivian's neck. "Could you get me Lucian's Instagram?"

The request hung between them like a grenade with its pin pulled.

Rosalind saw it then - the way Vivian's eyes sparkled at the mention of Lucian Graves. The CEO of Quantum Innovations wasn't just Lillian's older brother. He was the kind of man who turned heads in every room - devastatingly handsome, obscenely wealthy, with a razor-sharp intellect that made him dangerous.

And apparently, Vivian Astor had set her sights on him.

Rosalind swallowed against the renewed burn in her throat. "Why not ask Lillian? He's her brother."

Vivian's manicured nails dug into Rosalind's forearm. "If she says no in front of everyone, I'll die of embarrassment." Her whisper turned pleading. "Please? Just this once?"

The weight of the unspoken pressed against Rosalind's ribs. She couldn't exactly say, "He's practically engaged to Genevieve," could she? That wasn't her secret to tell.

"Fine," Rosalind relented. "But no promises."

Vivian squealed, hugging her so tightly Rosalind feared for the baby. "You're the best!"

Steeling herself, Rosalind walked toward the kitchen where the rich aroma of garlic and herbs already filled the air. Lucian stood at the stove, his broad shoulders flexing beneath his tailored shirt as he stirred something in a pan.

For a moment, she simply watched - this man who moved through the world like a king, utterly unaware of the devastation he left in his wake.

"You going to stand there all day?" His deep voice startled her.

Lucian turned, one dark eyebrow arched. The way the morning light caught his sharp jawline should be illegal.

Rosalind cleared her throat. "Can I... have your Instagram?"

The wooden spoon stilled in his hand. Slowly, methodically, Lucian set it down. He wiped his hands on a dish towel, each movement deliberate.

When he stepped closer, Rosalind caught the intoxicating mix of his cologne and the scent of fresh basil.

"My Instagram?" His voice dropped to that dangerous octave that made her pulse stutter. "Why?"
###Chapter 901

Rosalind had been lingering near the doorway when Lucian's imposing figure appeared. His shadow engulfed her instantly, and she instinctively retreated—only to misjudge the distance and nearly collide with the wall.

Lucian's arm shot out, his hand settling firmly around her waist. With effortless ease, he pulled her flush against him.

Their bodies pressed together, close enough that Rosalind could feel the heat radiating from him. Her lashes fluttered in surprise. "Mr. Graves—"

He tilted his head, studying her. "Why so nervous? Just because you're asking for my Instagram?"

At that moment, Rosalind deeply regretted agreeing to Vivian's request. This had been a terrible idea.

"If you don't want to give it to me, that's fine—"

Before she could finish, Lucian tightened his grip, yanking her fully against his chest. The crisp, masculine scent of his cologne enveloped her.

Rosalind immediately lifted her hands, pressing them against his firm chest to create distance. "Mr. Graves—"

His gaze dropped to where her palms rested. "Careful where you're touching."

She froze. That hadn't been her intention.

Yet beneath her fingers, she could feel the hard planes of his muscles, taut and defined. Had he been working out more lately?

Flustered, she jerked her hands back. "Sorry."

Lucian arched a brow, amused by her reaction. "Still want my Instagram?"

"I didn't—"

She meant to clarify that it was Vivian who wanted it, not her.

But before she could explain, he said, "Fine."

Wait—he was actually giving it to her?

Rosalind had fully expected a refusal. Lucian was always so aloof, so unapproachable. And wasn't he involved with Genevieve now? Why would he share his Instagram with another woman?

"It's the same as before. Just my name."

"Right." Rosalind nodded stiffly. "You can let go now."

But Lucian didn't release her. His grip remained firm.

Just then, a voice called out. "Rosalind? Where are you?"

Lillian. She was searching for her.

Rosalind tensed. "Mr. Graves, let go! If Lillian sees us like this, she'll get the wrong idea!"

She tried to push away, but their bodies were already pressed tightly together. The friction between them sent an electric jolt through her.

Lucian's breath hitched. "Stop moving."

Rosalind stilled. And then she felt it—the unmistakable shift in his body.

Oh no.

With a sharp shove, she broke free and bolted from the room.

Lillian rounded the corner, frowning. "Rosalind, why are you so flushed?"

Rosalind touched her burning cheeks. "It's nothing. Just... overheated."

Lillian blinked. "Overheated? It's freezing today."

Rosalind didn't answer.

Vivian found her moments later. "Well? Did you get it?"

Rosalind handed her a slip of paper with Lucian's name. "Here."

Vivian's eyes sparkled. "Oh my god! You're amazing!" She immediately pulled out her phone and sent a follow request to Lucian's account. Now, all she had to do was wait for approval.

Rosalind glanced at the screen. Would he accept?

Meanwhile, Lucian stood in the kitchen, his body still thrumming with restless energy. The memory of Rosalind in his arms lingered, refusing to fade.

He strode to the window and flung it open, letting the cold night air rush over him.

He needed to cool down. Fast.
###Chapter 902

It had been ages since Lucian and Rosalind shared an intimate moment. At his prime, brimming with vitality and passion, resisting temptation while being so close to her again proved nearly impossible.

Buzz!

His phone vibrated.

Lucian retrieved it from his pocket and checked Instagram. A new friend request awaited him.

The username read "sweet_caramel."

A faint smirk curved his lips. Since when had Rosalind changed her handle to something so playful? Was she trying to be adorable?

Well… She was adorable.

Lucian accepted the request.

Across the room, Vivian nearly squealed in delight. "He accepted! We're officially Instagram friends now!"

Not only had Lucian approved Vivian's request, but he had also followed her back.

Rosalind forced a tight-lipped smile. "Congratulations."

"I'm messaging him right now," Vivian declared boldly.

She typed out a direct message without hesitation. [I like you.]

Vivian wasn't one for subtlety—young, fearless, and direct, she went after what she wanted without hesitation.

Buzz!

Lucian's screen lit up with her message. [I like you.]

The heat he'd been suppressing flared back to life. His fingers moved swiftly across the screen.

Vivian gasped. "He replied! Let me see what he said!"

Rosalind glanced over just as Vivian opened the response.

[How much do you like me?]

The mature man's teasing reply was the kind that sent shivers down your spine and set your pulse racing.

True enough, Vivian's flawless complexion flushed instantly. She had seen Lucian earlier in the living room—composed, refined, untouchable, the type who seemed completely indifferent to women.

Yet here he was, asking how much she liked him.

It was deliciously scandalous.

Vivian's heart hammered wildly as she typed back. [A lot.]

Lucian read her reply, his lips quirking slightly.

Moments later, another message popped up. [Dinner tomorrow?]

She wasn't wasting time—she was asking him out directly.

Rosalind watched as the bold, vivacious Vivian launched her full-blown pursuit. A dull ache settled in her chest.

Would Lucian say yes?

Buzz!

His response appeared. [Sure. I'll have my assistant book us a table at Le Ciel.]

Vivian shrieked with joy, grabbing Rosalind's arm. "Did you see that? He just agreed to a date with me!"

Rosalind stared at the message, her vision blurring slightly.

Lucian had actually accepted.

Didn't he have a girlfriend? Wasn't he worried Genevieve would find out?

Or… had he changed? Was he now the type of man who couldn't resist pretty young women?

Vivian quickly typed back, [Perfect!]

Just like that, their date was confirmed.

Rosalind forced another smile. "Congratulations."

"Thank you! I owe you—you basically set us up!" Vivian chirped happily.

Rosalind didn't know how to respond.

"I've got to run! Need to prepare for tomorrow's date!" With an excited wave, Vivian dashed off.

Left alone, Rosalind stood frozen, her emotions in turmoil.

Just then, Lillian bounded into the room. "Rosalind, why are you standing here by yourself? Come on—dinner's ready. Lucian just finished cooking."
###Chapter 903
Rosalind inhaled deeply, steadying her racing pulse before nodding. "Alright."

She followed Lillian out of the bedroom.

Lucian had prepared an elaborate spread. His culinary skills were impeccable—each dish looked and smelled divine. Rosalind's gaze instantly locked onto the lemon-drizzled fish tacos with avocado crema. Just the sight made her mouth water.

Ever since her pregnancy began, she'd developed an insatiable craving for citrusy flavors. This dish was perfection.

Lillian surveyed the table. "Fish tacos with lime crema, tomato bisque, garlic mashed potatoes with chive oil... Lucian, why so much zest today?"

Lucian silently arranged the cutlery without responding.

Lillian suddenly gasped, smacking her forehead. "Oh! Of course. You noticed Rosalind's been craving tangy foods lately, so you made all this for her, didn't you?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. She stole a glance at Lucian—had he really done this for her?

Lucian neither confirmed nor denied it. "I'll get the bisque. Start eating."

Then he disappeared into the kitchen.

Lillian shot Rosalind a knowing smirk. "Not so terrible, is he?"

Rosalind remained quiet. "Not terrible" was a gross understatement—he was extraordinary.

Leaning closer, Lillian whispered, "I can tell something happened between you two. But look how he's trying now—maybe give him another chance?"

Rosalind offered a faint smile. The truth was, they'd already ended things.

She'd been adamant about their breakup, and Lucian had clearly moved on. He was with Genevieve now... and had recently followed Vivian Astor on Instagram. Beautiful women surrounded him constantly.

Just then, Lillian's phone buzzed.

"Gotta take this."

She hurried to her room to answer.

Lucian emerged from the kitchen. "Where's Lillian?"

"On a call," Rosalind replied.

Lucian gave a slight nod.

When she saw him carrying the steaming bisque, Rosalind instinctively reached out. "Let me help—"

Her fingertip grazed the scorching pot, and she jerked back with a sharp gasp.

"Ah—!"

Lucian set the soup down and immediately seized her hand. "Are you hurt?"

Rosalind shook her head. "It's nothing."

Gently, Lucian guided her to the sink. "Run it under cold water."

He turned the faucet on, cradling her reddened finger beneath the stream.

"Still burning?" he murmured.

Rosalind shook her head again. "No."

Lucian shut off the water, examining her pinkened skin. "I told you not to touch hot things. Now look what happened."

Then, without warning, he lowered his head and drew her fingertip into his mouth.

Rosalind's lashes fluttered. She hadn't expected that.

Heat flooded her cheeks. The intimacy of the gesture—something only lovers did—sent her pulse skyrocketing.

She yanked her hand back. "I'm fine now."

Lucian's gaze locked onto hers.

Flustered, Rosalind mumbled, "I'll go back to the table."

She turned to leave.

But Lucian's long fingers encircled her wrist. In one swift motion, he pulled her against his firm chest.

Rosalind looked up in shock. "Lucian, wha—mmph!"

Darkness swallowed her vision as Lucian cradled her face and kissed her.

Her mind blanked completely.

If that drunken kiss had been a mistake, if he'd thought she was someone else that night...

Then what was this? Why was he kissing her now?
###Chapter 904

Rosalind's hands flew up instinctively, pressing against Lucian's solid chest as she tried to create distance between them. "We shouldn't—"

"Shouldn't what?" His voice was dangerously low.

In one fluid motion, Lucian pivoted and backed her against the marble countertop, his muscular frame caging her in. The heat radiating from his body made the air between them crackle with electricity.

Rosalind's mind reeled. Just hours ago, he'd been cold and detached at the office. Now he was kissing her with reckless abandon while dating Genevieve and having dinner plans with Vivian tomorrow. The contradiction made her head spin.

Her cheeks burned as she turned her face away. "Lillian could walk in any moment—"

Lucian's fingers traced her jawline, tilting her face back toward him. His dark eyes burned with intensity. "Tell me you don't want this."

Her breath hitched. Since when did he ask for permission?

Before she could respond, he guided her palm to his chiseled features. "Do I still please you?" His voice was rough velvet.

Rosalind's thoughts scattered. Was the CEO of Quantum Innovations seriously fishing for compliments about his appearance?

"You—"

"Have I become unattractive?" His thumb brushed her lower lip.

The question was absurd. Women threw themselves at him daily. Yet when his stormy gaze demanded an answer, she gave a tiny nod. "You know you are."

Satisfaction flickered across his handsome features. Without warning, he claimed her mouth again, his kiss more demanding than before.

Rosalind's feeble resistance crumbled instantly. His lips moved with possessive expertise, coaxing her mouth open until she melted against him. The way her body responded terrified her—this primal attraction defied all logic.

Lucian seemed equally affected. The moment their lips met, his entire body tensed with barely restrained need. His kiss deepened, one hand sliding beneath her blouse while the other held her firmly against him.

A whimper escaped her as her legs weakened. Lucian caught her effortlessly, his lips grazing her ear. "They've gotten fuller," he murmured appreciatively.

It took Rosalind three heartbeats to understand. Then heat flooded her face—her pregnancy was changing her body in ways even she hadn't fully acknowledged.

"Stop," she pleaded weakly, her fingers curling against his wrists. "Please..."

Lucian chuckled darkly. "Your body tells a different story." He captured her hand and pressed it against the evidence of his desire.

In the dim kitchen, their ragged breathing was the only sound. This was no innocent flirtation—it was raw, adult hunger that threatened to consume them both.

"Rosalind!" Lillian's voice shattered the moment.

Rosalind jerked back, but Lucian's grip tightened. He brushed his lips against the corner of her mouth. "I'll be in the guest suite tonight." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Come to me when she's asleep. I need to feel you."

The bold invitation left her speechless. Lucian studied her dazed expression, his gaze promising pleasures that made her toes curl. "Don't keep me waiting."
###Chapter 905

Rosalind's thoughts were in complete disarray. Her mind refused to focus. Lucian had become unexpectedly tender.

Why?

Their relationship had ended long ago. What was his game now?

She whispered hesitantly, "You should go find someone else—"

Before she could finish, Lucian seized her chin firmly, his dark eyes burning with intensity. "Who exactly do you suggest?"

He could have anyone. Genevieve. Vivian. Any woman he desired.

But his grip only tightened as he demanded, "Say it."

Rosalind stayed silent. The dangerous glint in his gaze made her pulse quicken.

Lucian studied her face intently. "Since we broke up... I haven't been with anyone."

Rosalind's breath caught. What was he implying?

"Not a single woman," he clarified.

Shock rippled through her. Not even Genevieve?

Lucian pressed his thumb against her lips, rubbing insistently. Back and forth, until her lips paled then flushed again, plump and inviting. The sight made his breathing uneven.

His voice came out rough. "Will you come to me tonight?"

Rosalind felt overwhelmed, her thoughts tangled in fog. After a moment's hesitation, she shook her head. "No."

Lucian's chest heaved with frustration. He leaned in and nipped at the corner of her mouth.

"Ah!" She flinched at the sharp sting.

Finally releasing her, his voice held a warning edge. "Don't play games with me. I'm not someone you want to cross."

She stared at him, bewildered. What was he accusing her of? She'd done nothing to provoke him.

Just then, Lillian's voice called from nearby. "Rosalind? Lucian? Where are you?"

No time for explanations. Rosalind hastily pushed Lucian away, smoothed her clothes, and hurried out. "Coming!"

"There you are! Wait—what happened to your lips?"

Rosalind panicked. "I—I accidentally bit them."

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "How do you bite just your lips like that?"

The skepticism was obvious.

Rosalind quickly took her arm. "Let's eat."

As they sat at the table, Lillian smirked. "Lucian kissed you, didn't he?"

Silence.

"I'm not a child anymore," Lillian added knowingly. "No need to pretend."

Wordlessly, Rosalind stuffed a piece of fish into Lillian's mouth. "Eat your dinner!"

Meanwhile, Lucian remained in the kitchen, letting the cool air calm his racing pulse. In his current state, he couldn't face them yet. While Lillian had grown up, some things were still inappropriate for her to witness.

He pulled out his phone, rereading the message from "sweet_rose"—Rosalind's flirtatious confession still glowing on the screen. A faint smile touched his lips.

He could wait one night. Tomorrow's date would come soon enough.

No need to rush.

When he'd finally regained composure, Lucian joined them at the table.

One was his beloved sister, the other the woman who owned his heart. These two were his entire world now.

With them near, his heart felt complete—utterly full.

Lillian grinned mischievously. "Lucian, you kissed Rosalind, didn't you?"

Rosalind sighed, wondering why food couldn't silence the girl.

Lillian continued her critique, "Lucian, you're terrible at kissing. Why did you bite her? Kissing requires finesse—gentleness! If it's unpleasant, Rosalind won't want to kiss you again."
###Chapter 906

Rosalind genuinely cared about Lucian and Madeline, so deeply that she offered her most sincere, heartfelt advice.

Madeline set down her fork, leaned across the table, and pressed her palm over Rosalind's lips.

"Please, just stop. I'm begging you."

Lucian watched Rosalind's flushed cheeks and Madeline's triumphant smirk. The corners of his mouth lifted in a rare, unguarded smile.

That night, Rosalind and Madeline shared a bedroom, while Lucian retired to the guest suite. By dawn, he was already en route to his office.

Seated at his desk, Lucian barely glanced up when Nathaniel entered, placing a sleek folder beside him. "Mr. Graves, your afternoon schedule."

Lucian continued annotating a contract, his pen moving in swift, precise strokes. Without lifting his gaze, he issued a command. "Clear everything after six."

"Is this for your dinner reservation?" Nathaniel ventured.

Lucian gave a single nod. "The restaurant is confirmed?"

"Everything's arranged," Nathaniel assured. Then, hesitating, he added carefully, "Is this... an intimate dinner with Ms. Fairchild?"

Lucian arched a brow. "Who else would it be?"

Nathaniel wisely kept silent. The entire company recognized it—Lucian was utterly devoted to Rosalind, treating her like the rarest treasure. He was hopelessly, irrevocably in love.

By late afternoon, Lucian had wrapped up his meetings. At precisely five, he rose and approached the floor-to-ceiling windows.

He studied his reflection briefly before smoothing a hand through his hair.

Just then, Reginald strode in. "You look fine."

Lucian adjusted his cufflinks.

Reginald shot him an amused glance. "Nathaniel mentioned your six o'clock reservation. A date?"

Lucian didn't deny it.

"With Rosalind?" Reginald pressed.

"Yes."

Reginald's expression darkened. "Have you forgotten how she rejected you? Called you unattractive? It hasn't even been that long."

Lucian met his gaze steadily. "She finds me handsome now. Isn't that enough?"

Reginald was speechless. This was next-level infatuation.

"Have some self-respect," Reginald argued. "She discarded you before. Now you're running back? What's wrong with you?"

Lucian's voice dropped. "She said she's attracted to me."

Reginald blinked. "What?"

"Last night," Lucian murmured, "she told me she's into me. I asked how much. She said very." His fingers flexed. "I wanted to stay angry, to punish her—but how? She said she's into me. Don't you understand? She said very into me."

Reginald stared—no, he didn't understand.

Lucian continued, voice rough. "I tried to resist. Planned a hundred ways to make her suffer—ignore her, never take her back, even if she begged." He exhaled sharply. "But I couldn't.

When she's near, I can't look away. When she's gone, I can't stop thinking. My mind, my heart—it's all her. The words she said when she rejected me? Gone. But her saying she's into me? That's branded into me.

I'm not unattractive anymore, right? If she wants this version of me, isn't that enough? Why cling to the past?"

Reginald had no response. Lucian was beyond saving.
###Chapter 907
Reginald was rendered speechless.

He had absolutely nothing left to say—Lucian's twisted reasoning had left him utterly flabbergasted.

Truth be told, arguing with a hopelessly smitten CEO like Lucian was like talking to a brick wall. Their perspectives were galaxies apart.

Reginald couldn't deny the destructive power of first love, though. Lucian was still completely obsessed with Rosalind—the privileged heiress who had waltzed into his life when he was just a struggling nobody. And now, no matter what logic dictated, he refused to let her go.

Still, as a sane individual with functioning brain cells, Reginald despised Rosalind. In his eyes, she had shattered his best friend's heart one too many times.

"Lucian, snap out of it. I swear she's cast some kind of spell on you."

Just then, the office door swung open, and Genevieve strode in.

Today, Genevieve had pulled out all the stops. Her emerald silk dress clung to her curves like liquid, and even her honey-blonde waves cascaded perfectly over her shoulders. She wasn't wasting this opportunity—she was determined to make Lucian see her as more than just his physician.

"What's going on here?" she asked with practiced sweetness.

"Thank God you're here!" Reginald jumped in. "Talk some sense into him. He's about to have dinner with Ms. Fairchild!"

"What?" Genevieve's smile froze.

She moved closer, her heels clicking sharply. "I thought you two were over. Why are you seeing her again?"

Reginald cut in before Lucian could respond. "Because she came slithering back, batting her lashes, and he folded like a house of cards."

Genevieve's nails dug into her palms. She couldn't fathom why Rosalind always stood in her way. But this time, she wouldn't lose.

"Are you blind?" she demanded, turning to Lucian. "Ms. Fairchild has been manipulating you from day one! When your face was ruined, she tossed you aside. Now that you're handsome again, she wants you back. It's a trap—don't fall for it!"

Lucian met her gaze evenly. "It's not a trap. She's attracted to how I look now, and I do look good. What's the problem?"

Genevieve gaped.

Reginald looked equally stunned.

Lucian checked his watch. "I need to leave."

"Lucian!" Genevieve called desperately.

Reginald added, "Open your eyes! Genevieve's the one who stood by you through everything. She risked her life trekking through Santorina to find Frostbloom for you. Without her, your face would still be—"

Lucian turned back to Genevieve. "I appreciate what you did. That's why I had Nathaniel transfer a million to your account."

Genevieve blanched. She'd given him the rarest medicinal flower in existence, and all she got was a bank transfer. Not even a glimmer of hope.

Reginald scowled. "She doesn't want your money. She wants you."

Lucian locked eyes with Genevieve. "Is that true? You want me?"

Genevieve lifted her chin. "Yes. I love you."

Lucian's voice remained chillingly calm. "Then you already know—I don't love you back."

Genevieve flinched.

Lucian continued, "You've always been just a friend. There's never been anything more, and you know it. If a million isn't enough, I'll have Nathaniel send another. But money's all I can give you. Not my heart. Understood?"

Genevieve's fists trembled at her sides.

Lucian adjusted his cufflinks. "We're adults. Let's not pretend otherwise. I'm leaving now."
###Chapter 908

With those words, Lucian turned on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

Reginald's face darkened with barely contained fury. "That stubborn fool won't see reason until he's lying flat on his back in the gutter. Mark my words, he'll spend his entire miserable life chasing after Rosalind Fairchild!"

Genevieve's manicured nails dug into her palms. After all her carefully laid plans, how could she still lose to that insignificant girl? The injustice of it burned through her veins like poison.

"Reginald," she said through gritted teeth, "do you know which restaurant Lucian is meeting Rosalind at?"

His eyes narrowed. "What are you scheming now?"

"I merely wish to observe."

Reginald exhaled sharply before nodding. "Fine. Let's witness this train wreck firsthand."

Meanwhile, Lucian arrived at The Grand View, where he'd instructed Nathaniel to reserve the entire establishment for the evening.

The maître d' greeted him with obsequious enthusiasm. "Mr. Graves, your private dining area is prepared."

He led Lucian to an intimate corner table set with crystal stemware and fresh white roses.

"She hasn't arrived?" Lucian asked, glancing at his Patek Philippe.

"Not yet, sir."

"Leave me. I'll wait alone."

As the staff retreated, Lucian checked his phone—5:58 PM. His thumb hovered over the chat with "sunshine_girl." The ridiculous username made his lips twitch.

[Running late?] he typed.

Outside, Vivian Astor paused beneath the restaurant's awning when her phone chimed. The message from Lucian sent her pulse skyrocketing.

After discreet inquiries, she'd learned Lucian Graves wasn't just wealthy—he was the youngest self-made billionaire in tech, with looks that could melt glaciers. This was her golden ticket.

Tonight, she'd secure her future.

Vivian giggled to herself. If he'd added her on Instagram and agreed to this date, the attraction was clearly mutual. That fleeting encounter yesterday? Destiny.

She checked her reflection in a compact mirror. The pleated mini dress showcased her dancer's legs, while loose curls framed her heart-shaped face. Men had been falling at her feet since puberty—this would be no different.

[Just arrived!] she replied with a flirty emoji.

The maître d' greeted her with a bow. "Good evening, miss."

"I'm meeting Mr. Graves," she simpered.

"Of course. Right this way."

As they wound through the empty restaurant, Vivian spotted Lucian immediately. The way his tailored Tom Ford suit clung to his broad shoulders made her mouth go dry. Unlike the paunchy executives she usually entertained, this man radiated lethal elegance.

Her knees nearly buckled. The universe had handed her perfection on a silver platter.

She was already mentally spending his fortune.

Lucian glanced up from his phone as the maître d' announced, "Your guest, Mr. Graves."

His smile vanished.

Vivian stepped forward with practiced grace. "Lucian, darling—"

"Who the hell are you?" His voice could've flash-frozen the champagne.

Vivian's smile faltered. "It's me, your—"

Lucian turned to the horrified maître d'. "I paid to have this place cleared. Why is some random groupie wandering in?"

Random groupie?

Vivian's cheeks burned. "I'm sunshine_girl! We were supposed to meet here!"
###Chapter 909

Lucian froze. His piercing gaze darkened with suspicion. "How did you find me here tonight? Who tipped you off?"

The icy edge in his voice made Vivian's pulse quicken.

She forced a nervous smile. "What are you talking about? We arranged to meet here, remember?"

"Lucian!"

Genevieve and Reginald appeared at the entrance.

Reginald's eyes narrowed at Vivian. "Who's this? Where's Rosalind? I thought you were meeting her tonight."

"It's past six already," Genevieve added pointedly. "Did Ms. Fairchild bail on you again?"

"Impossible," Lucian snapped.

"Then where is she?" Reginald pressed. "And who the hell is this girl?"

Vivian's stomach dropped. This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go. Why was Lucian acting like she was a stranger?

Her carefully constructed fantasy was unraveling before her eyes.

Lucian's glacial stare pinned Vivian in place. "Identify yourself. Security!"

Three broad-shouldered guards materialized instantly. "Mr. Graves."

"Remove her," Lucian commanded.

Vivian gasped as two guards seized her arms. "What are you doing? We had plans tonight—why are you treating me like this?"

Lucian's jaw clenched. "Who said I made plans with you?"

He'd been certain Rosalind was coming.

Vivian's voice trembled. "We messaged on Instagram!"

"Instagram?" Lucian's tone could have cut glass.

Vivian nodded frantically. "Yes! Check our chat history if you don't believe me!"

She wrenched free momentarily, fumbling for her phone. With shaking hands, she thrust the screen toward Lucian. "See for yourself!"

Lucian scanned the messages, and his entire demeanor shifted.

"You're 'sunshine_girl'?" he asked, stunned.

Vivian nodded eagerly. "That's my handle."

Lucian recoiled as if burned. "That's impossible. Rosalind asked for my Instagram yesterday!"

Vivian blinked. "Right! I had Rosalind get it for me."

The realization hit Lucian like a physical blow. The charming, witty account he'd been messaging... wasn't Rosalind at all.

That adorable username he'd found so endearing now made his skin crawl.

He'd been catfished by Vivian.

Still oblivious, Vivian smiled hopefully. "Mr. Graves, what's wrong? I thought we were having dinner."

Lucian's hands balled into white-knuckled fists. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Who said I'd ever date someone like you?"

Reginald snorted. "Give it up. You really thought Lucian would choose you? He was waiting for Rosalind."

"What?" Vivian paled. "Y-You're in love with Rosalind? But she never mentioned that! When I asked for your Instagram, she just gave it to me without hesitation."

Genevieve's laugh was razor-sharp. "Now it makes sense. Lucian, Rosalind clearly doesn't care about you. She handed over your contact without a second thought. You're just her plaything."

"So this was all a mistake," Reginald concluded. "Turns out Ms. Fairchild never intended to meet you tonight. You've been fooling yourself this whole time!"
###Chapter 910

The icy aura radiating from Lucian was palpable, chilling the air around him. He had been certain it was Rosalind who requested his Instagram. He had convinced himself it was Rosalind who confessed her feelings, who wanted to share a romantic dinner with him.

The brutal truth struck him like a physical blow.

It had all been his imagination. A pathetic one-sided fantasy.

Now, he felt nothing but humiliation burning through his veins.

Vivian's voice quivered. "Mr. Graves, I swear I didn't know... Please, just release me..."

Lucian's expression was glacial. "Remove her from my sight. Permanently."

His security team immediately seized Vivian, dragging her toward the exit.

She struggled, muffled protests escaping as a guard clamped a hand over her mouth.

Lucian remained motionless, his towering frame rigid with tension. His piercing eyes darkened with turbulent emotion. How could Rosalind betray him like this?

Genevieve seized the opportunity to twist the knife deeper. "Open your eyes! Ms. Fairchild has been toying with you from the beginning! If she truly cared, she wouldn't have given your contact information to Vivian."

Reginald chimed in, voice dripping with false concern. "You're embarrassing yourself. Ms. Fairchild isn't worth this obsession. Move on before you become a complete laughingstock."

The words cut deep. Lucian had canceled important meetings, dressed meticulously, arrived early—all for a woman who never intended to come.

Why? What had he done to deserve such cruelty?

Without a word, Lucian shoved past them, his long strides eating up the distance as thunder rumbled ominously outside.

"Where are you going?" Reginald called after him.

Genevieve's shrill voice followed. "Don't you dare go after Rosalind again!"

Deaf to their protests, Lucian slid into his Lamborghini and accelerated into the stormy night, tires screeching against wet pavement.



Meanwhile, Rosalind sat alone in her apartment. Lillian had been summoned by her thesis advisor, leaving the space unnervingly quiet.

She stared blankly at her sketchpad, pencil hovering over untouched paper. Hours had slipped by, yet the page remained empty.

The clock chimed seven times.

Was Lucian enjoying his evening with Vivian? Was he smiling that rare, breathtaking smile for someone else?

She shook her head violently, as if physically dislodging the thoughts. This obsession had to stop.

Reaching for her craft knife, her trembling fingers betrayed her. The blade slipped, slicing a thin crimson line across her index finger.

Blood welled instantly.

Rosalind gasped, instinctively bringing the wound to her lips just as a deafening thunderclap shook the windows.

Rain hammered against the glass as she rushed to secure the window.

CRASH!

The front door exploded inward, making her whirl around in shock.

There—dripping rainwater and radiating fury—stood Lucian.

His tailored white shirt clung to his torso, dark trousers splattered with rain. Black suit jacket dangling from one fist, his chest heaved as those stormy eyes pinned her in place.

Rosalind's breath caught. "You're... back already?"

Lucian's mouth twisted into a mirthless smirk. "Disappointed? Were you hoping I'd spend the entire night with your little replacement?"
###Chapter 911

Rosalind's lashes fluttered in confusion. What was he implying? Whether he returned tonight or not was hardly her decision to make.

Rainwater traced the sharp angles of Lucian's jaw before falling in steady droplets.

Concerned he might fall ill, Rosalind hurriedly offered, "You're drenched. Let me get you a towel."

She disappeared into the bathroom and returned with a plush towel, holding it out. "Dry yourself off. You should shower too—I don't want you catching a cold."

Lucian carelessly flung the towel onto the floor. "Why the sudden concern? Planning another scheme?"

Rosalind stared at the discarded towel, baffled. "What's wrong with you today? Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed, or did your precious date not go as planned?"

She turned to leave, but Lucian seized her wrist, yanking her back.

"Let go of me!" she snapped, twisting in his grip.

A cold laugh escaped him. "So you did know about my date. Were you hoping I'd have such a fantastic time that I'd end up in a hotel room? That would've made your day, wouldn't it?"

Rosalind couldn't follow his logic.

What was he even accusing her of? He was the one who had gone out with another woman, yet here he was, taking his frustrations out on her.

Her clear eyes locked onto his stormy expression. "If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, get out!"

Lucian pulled her closer. "Did Vivian put you up to getting my Instagram?"

Rosalind hadn't planned to mention it, but since he asked, she answered truthfully. "Yes. She asked me to. I didn’t expect you to actually give it to me—but you did. You followed her and took her out. Does your girlfriend know about that?"

His eyes narrowed dangerously. "My girlfriend? Who exactly are you referring to?"

"Genevieve," Rosalind said. "Isn’t she your girlfriend?"

That seemed to ignite his temper. "How many women are you trying to push me toward? Genevieve, Vivian—what do you take me for? Some kind of playboy? Should I schedule one for mornings and the other for evenings?"

"I wouldn’t know how to manage that," she replied flatly.

Lucian scoffed. "Oh, I think you'd be an expert at it! Two-timing, three-timing—it’s your specialty, isn’t it?"

Rosalind was stunned. "When have I ever dated multiple people at once?"

"Julian. Gregory. Me," he bit out. "Which one of us hasn’t been wrapped around your finger?"

She was speechless. That wasn’t true.

She had never crossed lines with anyone but Lucian. She had kept her distance from the others.

Her patience shattered. She had spent the day thinking about him while he was out with another woman—and now he came back just to take his anger out on her?

Rosalind snapped, "However many men you think I’m involved with, I can assure you, you’re not one of them. What I do is none of your business!"

She tried to wrench free.

"Let me go! Don’t touch me!"

But Lucian’s eyes darkened with something dangerous. Whatever restraint he had been clinging to finally snapped. All he saw was her defiant expression, her lips moving, each word provoking him further.

And in that moment, he had only one thought—to silence her.

Lucian crushed his mouth against hers.
###Chapter 912

Rosalind's eyes widened in shock.

Lucian had actually kissed her without warning!

Her palms pressed against his solid chest as she shoved him away. "Have you lost your mind? You spend your mornings with Genevieve and your evenings with Vivian—am I just another conquest to you?"

A dangerous smirk played on Lucian's lips. "What if I told you I'd dedicate every night exclusively to you?"

Heat flooded Rosalind's cheeks. She swung her hand to strike his arrogant face, but Lucian caught her wrist effortlessly.

His voice dropped to a velvet threat. "Every slap earns you another night in my bed. Care to test that theory?"

Panic surged through her as she tried to wrench free. "Let me go!"

Instead, he hauled her against him, tilting her chin up to claim her mouth again. The intoxicating scent of sandalwood and power overwhelmed her senses as his tongue invaded, demanding submission.

Her weak protest came out breathless. "Stop... don't!" But the words sounded more like an invitation than refusal.

Lucian chuckled darkly. "Your body betrays you every time, darling."

With one forceful push, he pinned her onto the mattress, his muscular frame caging her beneath him.

Rosalind twisted desperately. "Lillian could return any minute! This is her bedroom, for heaven's sake—have you no shame?"

The mention of his sister gave Lucian pause. Even he wouldn't cross that line.

Seizing the hesitation, Rosalind scrambled up—only for Lucian to catch her waist from behind and lift her clean off her feet.

"Put me down this instant!"

Ignoring her struggles, he carried her into the adjacent guest room and tossed her onto the king-sized bed. The sheets smelled unmistakably of him—spiced and dangerous.

She tried to crawl away, but Lucian dragged her back beneath him. "No more running. Tonight, you're mine."

His mouth crashed down again, hot and relentless, while his hands made quick work of her blouse buttons.

Raised as a sheltered heiress, Rosalind stood no chance against Lucian's raw strength. Now disheveled and trembling, she lay trapped under his dominant weight.

"Don't touch me with those hands," she gasped. "Not after all the women you've—"

He silenced her with a bruising kiss. "So you do care? If it bothers you so much, why did you keep pushing me toward them?"

"What?"

His burning gaze pinned her. "I haven't laid a finger on another woman."

Before she could process the shocking claim, his belt buckle clicked open.

"Lucian, no—ah!"
###Chapter 913


Rosalind gasped as a sharp pain shot through her abdomen. Her delicate features twisted in discomfort.

Lucian loomed above her, his warm breath ghosting over her neck as he whispered, "This is what you deserve."

Without hesitation, she bit down hard on his muscular shoulder.

A predatory gleam flashed in Lucian's dark eyes as he effortlessly restrained her wrists, disregarding her feeble struggles.

Rosalind couldn't comprehend how they'd fallen back into this familiar dance - two people who should have moved on, yet their bodies remembered every intimate detail as if no time had passed.

And he had just returned from an evening with Vivian.

A dull ache pulsed through her core, a cruel reminder of the precious life growing within her. The first trimester was far too delicate for such roughness. "You're going too fast - you're hurting me!"

Gentleness was the last thing on Lucian's mind. Not after the emotional games she'd played. The entire car ride home, he'd fantasized about this exact revenge.

"Then suffer through it," he rasped, his voice thick with barely restrained desire.

Rosalind's porcelain skin paled noticeably. "Please - I mean it. Stop."

At first he ignored her pleas, but the way her breathing turned shallow gave him pause. Cradling her face, he searched her eyes. "Where does it hurt?"

"My stomach," she admitted through clenched teeth.

Lucian's gaze dropped to her still-flat midsection. "Liar. Why would your stomach hurt?"

"I'm telling the truth! I-"

She nearly confessed her pregnancy but swallowed the words. It wasn't the right moment.

FURAL EN 1/4

His fingers traced hypnotic circles along her waistline. "What's wrong with your stomach?"

Then realization dawned.

A knowing look crossed his handsome features. "Your stomach..."

Did he suspect?

Panicked, Rosalind tried to cover herself. "It's nothing!"

Lucian frowned. "Have you been eating more lately?"

She nearly choked on air. Seriously? That was his brilliant deduction?

"You're the one who's gained weight!" she snapped. "I'm exactly the same!"

The indignant fire in her voice made his lips twitch. So much for maintaining his anger - she always managed to disarm him.

"Fine," he conceded, relaxing his grip. "I'll go easier on you."

"No, just let me go!"

"Rosalind," he warned, "I'm already compromising. If you'd prefer I don't hold back-"

"Okay, okay!" she yelped. "Just...be careful."

Lucian's smirk deepened. "That's what I thought."

When his lips crashed against hers, Rosalind knew escape was impossible. Worse still, her treacherous body responded eagerly, just as it always had. She still craved him - heart, body and soul.

But the baby...

With sudden determination, she flipped their positions, straddling him confidently.

Lucian gripped her hips, eyes darkening with amusement. "What's this?"

"I like being in charge," she declared.



The memory struck him like lightning - their first time in that tiny dorm room, her boldness guiding them both through their inexperience until they shattered together. 

Perhaps that's why he could never truly let her go. Rosalind wasn't just any woman to him. She was his greatest weakness and his most exhilarating high.

With a husky chuckle, he pulled her down. "Have it your way, darling."
###Chapter 914

The front door burst open without warning.

Rosalind had returned.

"Rosalind!" she called out.

Rosalind startled, nearly tumbling off Lucian in her haste. "Lillian's back!"

Lucian's arm snaked around her waist, anchoring her in place. "You're not going anywhere."

"Have you lost your mind? She's right there! She's calling for me!"

Lillian's voice carried down the hall. "Rosalind? Where are you? Rosalind? Lucian?"

Now she was searching for both of them.

Heat flooded Rosalind's cheeks. If Lillian walked in and saw them like this, she'd never recover from the humiliation.

"Release me! She's looking for us—don't do this!"

Lucian leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Call her. Tell her you're staying with me tonight."

What?

"Absolutely not!"

His voice remained infuriatingly calm. "Which part? Calling her, or spending the night in my bed?"

He actually expected her to stay. Her pulse hammered wildly. "I said no!"

"Then let her come in. Is that what you want?"

"I—" Of course she didn't.

Footsteps approached. "Rosalind? Lucian? Are you here?"

She was getting closer.

Rosalind surrendered. Snatching her phone, she dialed Lillian.

"Hey, Rosalind," Lillian answered cheerfully. "Where'd you disappear to? I couldn't find you."

Rosalind shot Lucian a glare before responding. "I went home for the night. Get some rest—I'll see you tomorrow."

"Alright! See you then."

The moment the call ended, Rosalind fixed Lucian with a withering look. "Satisfied?"

His lips curved. "Shall we resume?"

"Once," she stated firmly. "That's all you get tonight."

"No."

"Just once!"

"You don't make the rules here."

Dawn light filtered through the curtains when Rosalind stirred awake. Golden rays painted the room in soft hues. She checked the time—past eight. She'd overslept.

As she attempted to rise, she registered the solid warmth encircling her. Lucian still held her, his breathing even in sleep.

Memories of the previous night rushed back—his relentless intensity, her desperate pleas before he'd finally relented.

Her hand drifted to her abdomen. Everything felt normal. The baby was safe.

Relief washed over her as she studied Lucian's face. The sharp angles of his youth had matured into striking refinement.

Her fingers traced his features—the strong brow, the straight nose, those sculpted lips.

A sweet ache bloomed in her chest. If only time could freeze this moment.

But reality loomed.

She withdrew her hand.

A strong grip caught her wrist.

Lucian's eyes opened.
###Chapter 915
Lucian's piercing gaze locked onto Rosalind. "Were you touching me?"

When had he woken up?

Rosalind's breath hitched. Her fingers twitched against his bare chest as heat flooded her cheeks. She tried to jerk her hand away. "I wasn't!"

Lucian caught her wrist effortlessly, amusement dancing in his dark eyes. "Really? Then explain what you were doing just now."

"I—I..." Rosalind's mind went blank.

His lips curved into that infuriating smirk. "No explanation? Seems like you couldn't resist me."

She yanked her hand free. "That's ridiculous!"

Without warning, Lucian flipped them over, caging her beneath him.

Rosalind stiffened. "What are you—"

"What do you think?" His voice dropped to a dangerous purr.

Her pulse skyrocketed as she felt his growing arousal against her thigh. Even after last night, he was insatiable.

Panic set in. "Don't you dare—mmph!"

Lucian crushed his lips against hers in a searing kiss.

She shoved at his shoulders. "Stop! I can't—I'm exhausted."

He nipped at her lower lip. "Just relax and let me take care of you."

Rosalind pressed both palms against his chest. "No! I mean it!"

"Really?" His thumb traced her collarbone. "You don't want me?"

"Not now!"

She was barely six weeks pregnant. Last night had been risky enough—she couldn't risk the baby.

A phone buzzed on the nightstand, its vibration loud in the tense silence.

Rosalind seized the distraction. "Your phone."

Lucian reached for it without releasing her. Her stomach dropped when she saw the caller ID.

Genevieve.

All color drained from Rosalind's face. His girlfriend was calling while he had another woman pinned beneath him.

She shoved at his chest. "Answer your girlfriend. I'm leaving."

As she tried to slip away, Lucian hauled her back against him. "Did I say you could go?"

Rosalind glared. "You're really going to take that call while holding me?"

He arched one brow, all arrogant confidence. "Why not?"

Was this some twisted power play? Keeping his mistress close while speaking to his girlfriend?

She twisted in his grip. "Let me go!"

Lucian lowered his mouth to her ear. "Be quiet. I'm answering."

Before she could protest, he accepted the call, trapping her against his bare chest as Genevieve's saccharine voice filled the room.

"Lucian? Where are you?"

The possessive tone made Rosalind's skin crawl.

Lucian's gaze remained locked on Rosalind as he answered, "Out."

"Out where? I called all night! Were you with Rosalind Fairchild?"

Hearing her name on Genevieve's lips made Rosalind feel sick. She was the other woman now.
###Chapter 916

Lucian studied Rosalind's reaction with amusement as he spoke into the phone. "What do you want?"

Genevieve's voice turned shrill through the speaker. "Open your eyes, Lucian! Ms. Fairchild is nothing but a scheming seductress! She's clearly trying to manipulate you."

Rosalind's expression stiffened.

That was completely unfair. If anything, Lucian had been the one pursuing her relentlessly.

She lifted her gaze, shooting him a fiery glare.

Lucian met her eyes. Rosalind had just woken, her raven hair cascading in tousled waves over her shoulders. The thin silk camisole she wore left little to the imagination, her porcelain skin glowing in the morning light. Her delicate features were tilted upward, those wide doe eyes burning with indignation and just a hint of embarrassment.

Desire flared in Lucian instantly. Without hesitation, he captured her lips in a searing kiss.

"Ah!" Rosalind gasped against his mouth, her eyes widening in shock. He was still on the phone with Genevieve—how could he do this?

The sound carried clearly through the speaker.

Genevieve's breath hitched. "What was that? Was that Rosalind? Are you still with her?!"

Rosalind panicked, pounding her fists against his chest in protest.

But Lucian only deepened the kiss, his mouth moving with possessive intensity as if he wanted to consume her whole.

With no other choice, Rosalind bit down hard on his lower lip.

Lucian growled in pain.

Seizing the opportunity, she shoved him away and scrambled from the bed, fleeing the room without looking back.

Gone.

Lucian touched his stinging lip. Blood.

She'd actually drawn blood.

That feisty little hellcat.

Genevieve's voice continued shrilly. "Are you even listening to me? Hello?"

All warmth vanished from Lucian's expression, replaced by icy detachment. "You're overstepping," he said flatly. "We're just friends."

Silence on the line.

Lucian's grip tightened on the phone. "I've made my position clear. I don't have those kinds of feelings for you. You know exactly who holds my interest. Push this again, and we won't even remain friends."

Genevieve rushed to explain. "Please, let me—"

He didn't wait to hear it. Of course he knew better than to fall for Rosalind again.

But the moment she stood before him, all rational thought evaporated. He wanted her with a hunger he couldn't control.

Without another word, Lucian ended the call.

Rosalind nearly collided with Lillian in the hallway. The younger girl blinked in surprise. "Rosalind?"

Straightening her clothes, Rosalind forced composure. "Good morning, Lillian."

Lillian's eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Why do you look like you just rolled out of bed?"

"I—" Rosalind opened her mouth, but no plausible excuse came to mind.

Just then, the bedroom door clicked open behind them.

Lillian turned, frowning at Lucian. "What happened to your lip?"

Lucian's gaze slid lazily to Rosalind. "Got bitten by a feisty little wildcat."

Lillian stared. "A wildcat? Indoors? That specifically targets lips?"

Lucian poured himself a glass of water, taking a slow sip before smirking. "Perhaps a certain naughty kitten found me irresistible and couldn't help taking a taste."
###Chapter 917

The instant Lucian referred to her as "a little hellion," Rosalind's entire body tensed.

But now he was calling her "a mischievous kitten"?

Her breath hitched as she gaped at him in shock. Was he even listening to himself?

Rosalind was certain she wasn't some playful little feline. Absolutely not!

Lillian turned to Lucian. "Hurry up and prepare breakfast. We're starving."

Lucian set down his wine glass. "Very well. I'll cook something."

He strode toward the kitchen.

Rosalind shot Lillian an awkward glance. "I'll be right back—just need to freshen up."

Lillian nodded. "Take your time."

Rosalind retreated to the bedroom and immediately locked herself in the bathroom. She turned the shower on full blast, stepping beneath the scalding spray.

As the water cascaded over her shoulders, some of the lingering soreness in her muscles began to ease. Yet her porcelain skin remained littered with crimson marks—evidence of Lucian's possessive mouth from the night before.

It felt deliberate, as if he'd been determined to brand her. Given how easily her skin bruised, these wouldn't fade for days.

She made a mental note to wear high-necked clothing later. If Lillian noticed, the questions would be endless.

Rosalind squeezed her eyes shut, but her traitorous mind kept replaying Lucian above her—his sculpted features glistening with sweat, those powerful arms caging her in, the ripple of muscles along his back as he moved with relentless precision. It was like something from an erotic fantasy.

She shook her head violently.

What was wrong with her? She needed to stop this.

Then she felt warmth trickle down her thigh...

Lucian hadn't used protection last night.

She was already carrying his child, and now he'd been careless again.

Did he ever consider the consequences if she got pregnant a second time?

After her shower, Rosalind dressed in a turtleneck and slacks before rejoining the others. Lillian had just returned from her morning walk, and Lucian had finished preparing breakfast.

"Food's ready," Lucian announced.

"Perfect!" Lillian beamed, tugging Rosalind toward the dining table.

Lucian had prepared lobster bisque, serving them each a steaming bowl.

Lillian raised an eyebrow. "Lobster bisque? What's the special occasion?"

Lucian took his seat opposite them. "Thought you both needed something restorative."

Lillian chuckled. "I'm practically fully recovered."

Lucian's gaze slid to Rosalind. "Then it's for Ms. Fairchild."

Rosalind met his eyes. "Unnecessary. But thank you, Mr. Graves."

His lips quirked. "Even if you didn't exert much effort, nutrients are still important."

Rosalind froze. What kind of nonsense was he spouting?

Predictably, Lillian's curiosity ignited. "Rosalind didn't exert effort? What does that mean?"

Panicked, Rosalind stammered, "He's referring to—"

"We were debating human physiology last night. Quite... thoroughly," Lucian interjected smoothly.

Beneath the table, Rosalind kicked his shin hard.

Lucian merely smirked at her furious blush, her eyes screaming for him to stop talking.

Lillian frowned. "Physiology? What kind of discussion—"

"Maddy," Rosalind cut in desperately, "shouldn't you be heading to the lab soon?"

Now that Lillian had recovered, her research awaited. The reminder instantly distracted her.

"Oh! You're right. I need to leave soon."

Rosalind nodded. "Since you're better, I should return home too. I'll visit again soon."
###Chapter 918

Rosalind gave a reluctant nod. "Alright. Lucian, why don't you drive me home later?"

"I can manage on my own!" Rosalind protested instantly.

At the same moment, Lucian's deep voice cut through the air. "Of course."

Their responses clashed in the tense silence.

Rosalind shot him a glare from across the table, fingers twitching with the urge to wrap around his throat.

Breakfast concluded in stifling discomfort. Once the plates were cleared, Rosalind gathered her things, ready to leave.

Just then, Lillian's group of friends arrived—bright-eyed girls who adored Rosalind and had come to say goodbye.

"Rosalind, you must visit us again soon," one chirped, squeezing her hand.

Rosalind forced a smile. "I will."

Her gaze flickered around the room. Something—or rather, someone—was missing. "Where's Vivian? Why isn't she here?"

Lillian frowned. "That's strange. She should've come."

One of the girls piped up. "Oh, she withdrew from school this morning. Got transferred back to her hometown. We won't see her again."

Just like that? No warning?

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. That was abrupt.

Lucian's voice sliced through her thoughts. "Let's go."

She looked up. His sculpted features betrayed nothing, as if Vivian's disappearance meant nothing to him.

But Rosalind knew better.

Last night, he'd taken Vivian out. And when he returned, he'd been a storm of barely restrained fury, pinning Rosalind to the sheets with bruising intensity.

Something had happened between them—something dark enough to send Vivian packing overnight.

Lillian and her friends escorted them to Lucian's sleek black car. "Safe travels, Rosalind!"

"Thank you," Rosalind murmured.

She reached for the back door.

Lucian wrenched the passenger side open instead. "Front seat."

Her stomach twisted.

That seat had been hers once—when they were together. Now, it felt like trespassing.

"I prefer the back," she said stiffly.

One dark brow arched. "So I'm your chauffeur now? Fine. Call a cab."

Rosalind's jaw clenched.

Lillian shoved her forward with a giggle. "Just get in already."

The engine purred to life as Lucian slid behind the wheel.

Rosalind waved one last time. "Goodbye."

The car lunged forward, swallowing the farewell in its wake.

Lucian's hands flexed on the steering wheel, knuckles whitening. The silence between them thickened.

Rosalind sat rigid, spine straight. "Drop me off at home. Please."

Instead of answering, his voice dropped to a velvet murmur. "Last night... I didn't use protection."

Her breath hitched. Why bring that up now?

"No," she admitted after a beat.

"My mistake." His tone was infuriatingly casual. "It slipped my mind."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "How convenient. You forgot last night but remembered this morning."

Amusement glinted in his eyes when he glanced at her. The bastard was enjoying this.

"Let's stop by a pharmacy," he said smoothly.

Her fingers dug into her thighs. "For what?"

His lips curved. "Morning-after pills. Unless you'd prefer an alternative?"
###Chapter 919
"I'm getting emergency contraception for you."

Rosalind froze.

Her secret pregnancy made this impossible. She couldn't risk harming the baby.

"No," she refused sharply.

Lucian arched an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Why not? We didn't use protection last night. Unless..." His voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Are you hoping to conceive my child?"

Rosalind's throat tightened. Trapped. If she took the pill, she'd endanger her unborn child. If she refused, he'd assume the worst.

"That's absurd," she deflected, fingers twisting in her lap.

Lucian chuckled darkly as he pulled into a pharmacy parking lot. "My genes are quite the commodity, darling. Brilliant mind, excellent physique, generational wealth." He cut the engine with a smirk. "Can't blame women for trying to... collect."

Her pulse spiked. That was exactly her original plan - raise their genius child alone.

Now everything was unraveling.

Lucian's gaze turned serious. "We're done, Rosalind. No accidental pregnancies complicating things." He reached for her wrist. "Let's handle this like adults."

Panic surged as his fingers closed around her arm. She instinctively cradled her stomach. What if he forced her to abort? Or worse - took her child after birth?

The pharmacy's bell jingled as Lucian dragged her inside.

"Afternoon!" The middle-aged pharmacist beamed. "Newlyweds?"

Rosalind opened her mouth to correct her, but Lucian smoothly pulled her closer. "Wife's not ready for motherhood yet," he lied effortlessly, his breath hot against her ear. "Play along unless you want rumors spreading, sweetheart."

Her cheeks burned at the endearment. This man would be the death of her.
###Chapter 920
Lucian deliberately called Rosalind "sweetheart."

His deep voice carried a natural magnetism that sent shivers down her spine. When he leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear with that teasing lilt, Rosalind's legs nearly buckled. She despised how vulnerable she became to that voice.

The pharmacy clerk beamed at the striking couple. "You two make such a lovely pair!"

Lucian's arm draped possessively over Rosalind's shoulders as he smirked. "Naturally. I adore my wife."

Then he tilted her chin up with one finger. "Don't you love me too, darling?"

Mischief glittered in his obsidian eyes—this was purely to rattle her.

His grip tightened imperceptibly. "Well? Do you?"

The clerk watched with rapt attention, thoroughly entertained.

Trapped, Rosalind forced a saccharine smile. "Of course I do."

Lucian wasn't finished. "Say my name when you say it."

The audacity!

Rosalind's glare could've melted steel.

His smirk deepened. "Go on, sweetheart. Who do you love?"

Inhaling sharply, she gritted out, "I love you... sweetheart."

Lucian's throat worked visibly as his gaze turned molten. Seizing the advantage, Rosalind fluttered her lashes and cooed, "What's wrong, honey? Don't you know I adore you?"

He yanked her against his chest so forcefully the clerk gasped. Had they been alone, he might've devoured her right there.

The woman dabbed her eyes, laughing. "Here's your emergency contraceptive."

After paying, Lucian guided Rosalind to the car.

Inside, he dropped the pill into her palm. "Now."

Her stomach twisted. She couldn't—wouldn't—take it.

"I'll wait until—"

"Now," he repeated, steel beneath the velvet.

When she hesitated, he gripped her jaw, bringing their faces inches apart. "Stalling? Or refusing?"

Their mingled breaths turned ragged. The pressure coiled her nerves tighter.

Rosalind exploded. "Why must I bear the consequences? You enjoyed yourself thoroughly last night without protection!"

Lucian blinked, then threw his head back laughing. The realization struck him—she genuinely didn't want to.

"Fine," he conceded, tracing her lower lip. "But you'll call me 'sweetheart' properly this time."
###Chapter 921
Rosalind's heart pounded as Lucian insisted she call him "darling" again.

He'd already played this game with her at the pharmacy—why was he still tormenting her?

"Absolutely not!" Rosalind crossed her arms defiantly.

Lucian didn't press further. He simply gave her a lazy smile and said, "Then take the contraceptive."

"Not happening!" she snapped.

Without another word, Lucian shifted gears and accelerated down the road.

Rosalind soon realized they weren't heading toward her apartment. The cityscape blurred past unfamiliar streets.

"Where are you taking me?"

His fingers tightened on the steering wheel. "If there's even a one percent chance you're carrying my child, I'm not letting you out of my sight. We're going to Quantum Innovations."

Her stomach dropped. His corporate headquarters?

"I refuse!"

"That pill was your only way out." His voice turned dangerously soft. "If you're pregnant, I'll—"

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. "You'll what? Force me to terminate it?"

The words tumbled out before she could stop them. She was already three months along—still able to conceal the bump beneath loose sweaters. But soon? Impossible.

She needed to know where he stood.

Lucian's smirk returned. "What do you imagine I'd do?"

"I don't know!" Her voice cracked. That was the terrifying part.

"Tell me honestly," she demanded. "If I were pregnant, what would happen?"

His lips curved. "That curious?"

"Yes."

"I'd..." He drew out the pause, watching her lean closer.

Then he laughed. "Get pregnant first. Then you'll see."

"What?" Rosalind gaped at him.

His devilish grin widened. "Experience is the best teacher, sweetheart."

Furious, she pinched his forearm hard.

Lucian only chuckled. "Cute."

If he hadn't been driving, she would've slapped that arrogant smile off his face.

Thirty minutes later, his black Bentley purred to a stop before the glass skyscraper. Lucian circled the car and yanked open her door.

"Out."

"No." She gripped the seatbelt. "This is humiliating. We're over. You're dating Genevieve now. Just stop."

In one fluid motion, he scooped her into his arms.

Rosalind gasped. "Put me down!"

"Should've walked when you had the chance." He adjusted his grip, striding toward the entrance.

She writhed against him. "Are you insane? Everyone's staring!"

Her pulse raced. Two years ago, this would've been romantic. Now? It was a public spectacle.

Lucian ignored her squirming, his arms like steel bands as he carried her through the gawking crowd of executives. Every head turned. Every whisper cut through her like a knife.

The elevator doors closed behind them, sealing her fate.
###Chapter 922

The office staff gasped in unison. "Mr. Graves! Mrs. Graves!"

Rosalind felt her cheeks flame crimson at the title. She squirmed in Lucian's arms. "Put me down this instant! Everyone's watching!"

Lucian continued striding through the lobby effortlessly, his muscular arms holding her securely. A wicked grin played on his lips. "Let them look. I'm not stopping their eyes from working."

More employees began gathering, their whispers growing louder. "Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Graves!"

Rosalind buried her face against Lucian's broad chest, her ears burning. The office chatter only intensified.

"Sweet heavens! Is that really Mr. Graves carrying his wife through the office?"

"I thought Dr. Genevieve was Mrs. Graves?"

"Don't be ridiculous. That's clearly Miss Fairchild in his arms!"

"Wasn't she his ex-fiancée? They look absolutely stunning together."

"A true power couple if I ever saw one."

Rosalind wished she could vanish. Every whispered word made her skin prickle with embarrassment.

Lucian glanced down at her flushed face and chuckled darkly, his chest vibrating against her cheek.

Without breaking stride, he carried her straight into the executive suite and deposited her gently onto the plush leather sofa.

She immediately tried to scramble away.

But Lucian caught both her wrists in one large hand, pinning her effortlessly. "And where do you think you're escaping to, darling?"

"Release me! I don't belong here!" Rosalind snapped, twisting in his grip.

"How rebellious," he murmured, his grin turning predatory.

Then he captured her lips in a searing kiss.

"Mmph!"

Rosalind's thoughts scattered. His mouth moved over hers with devastating precision, igniting fires along every nerve. She writhed beneath him, panic rising. "Lucian, don't—ah!"

He nipped at her earlobe, his voice rough with desire. "Keep making those delicious sounds and see where it leads us."

Even she recognized how wanton her moans sounded, echoing through the professional space like something from an erotic fantasy. She bit her lip hard to stay silent.

But Lucian simply claimed her mouth again, more insistently this time.

Rosalind dared not utter another sound. She could only endure as he plundered her mouth with relentless intensity, his kiss demanding complete surrender.

His dominance left her weak and pliant in his arms.

When his free hand slipped beneath her blouse, she gasped and grabbed his wrist. "Stop this!"

Lucian's smoldering gaze locked onto hers. "Stop what, precisely?"

"You ordered me to take emergency contraception! So keep your hands to yourself!"

His lips curved dangerously. "You've no intention of taking that pill. Might as well enjoy ourselves thoroughly before you do."

Rosalind's palm connected with his cheek with a soft smack.

It was more surprise than force—her delicate hand barely left a mark. The gesture felt more like lovers' play than actual anger.

Lucian stilled, then slowly ran his tongue along the inside of his cheek, eyes darkening. "Remember our agreement, sweetheart? Each slap equals another round."

He leaned in to reclaim her mouth.

Just then, three sharp knocks sounded at the door. Nathaniel's voice followed. "Mr. Graves?"

Rosalind seized the interruption like a lifeline. She shoved against Lucian's chest. "Your assistant is here!"

"I can send him away," Lucian said casually, nuzzling her neck.

She gaped at him. "This is your office! A professional workspace!"

She was trying desperately to remind him of propriety. Right now, he behaved like a starved beast who'd finally cornered his prey—single-minded in his hunger.

Lucian studied her flushed face for a long moment before finally releasing her and standing.
###Chapter 923

Lucian moved toward the expansive window, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit as he struggled to regain composure.

Rosalind's gaze flickered to him, noticing how his hands were shoved deep in his pockets - a telltale sign he was concealing something. The way his dark lashes cast shadows across his sharp cheekbones made her pulse quicken involuntarily. Even in his restrained posture, he exuded an intoxicating blend of sophistication and raw magnetism that never failed to affect her.

She averted her eyes quickly, her cheeks burning.

After collecting himself, Lucian called out in that deep, commanding voice, "Enter."

Nathaniel stepped through the doors. "Mr. Graves, the board members are assembled. Mr. Whitmore from Quantum Innovations has arrived as well."

Lucian gave a curt nod. "Understood."

As Nathaniel exited, Lucian approached Rosalind with purposeful strides. "Don't move from this office," he warned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "If I return and find you gone, there will be consequences. Clear?"

Rosalind swallowed hard, nodding obediently. "Crystal."

The moment the door clicked shut behind him, Rosalind exhaled shakily. She knew this merger negotiation was crucial, yet he'd still taken the time to claim her lips passionately before leaving.

Her fingers drifted unconsciously to her still-flat abdomen as warmth blossomed in her chest. "Little one," she whispered tenderly, "that intense man is your father..."

Before she could dwell further, another knock interrupted. Nathaniel reappeared, followed by two assistants bearing trays. "Ms. Fairchild, Mr. Graves requested we bring you these refreshments."

An array of gourmet chocolates and tart lemon drops were arranged artfully on the coffee table. "He mentioned you've been craving citrus flavors lately," Nathaniel added with a knowing smile.

Rosalind's mouth watered instantly at the thoughtful gesture. "Thank you, Nathaniel."

"Credit goes entirely to Mr. Graves," he demurred. "Though I must say, we've missed your presence these past weeks."

Her smile faltered slightly. Technically, she and Lucian were still... complicated. "Yes, well..."

"Still, I always knew you'd return," Nathaniel continued warmly. "Mr. Graves has never shown such partiality toward anyone else."

Rosalind blinked in surprise. "What makes you say that?"

Nathaniel met her gaze sincerely. "Because the way he looks at you? That's not just attraction. That's devotion."

The words settled over her like sunlight as Nathaniel excused himself. Alone again, Rosalind selected a zesty lemon drop, the sharp tang making her tastebuds dance. She retrieved her sketchpad, losing herself in design concepts until lunch arrived.

"Mr. Graves is dining with the Quantum executives," Nathaniel informed her while setting out an exquisite meal. "He likely won't return until mid-afternoon."

Rosalind nodded understandingly. Between caring for Lillian and these high-stakes negotiations, Lucian was stretched thin.

She ate lightly but with better appetite than recent days, then resumed sketching until drowsiness crept in. Pregnancy had gifted her with near-constant fatigue these days.

Curling up on the plush sofa, Rosalind surrendered to sleep, her last conscious thought of the enigmatic man who'd irrevocably changed her life.
###Chapter 924

Lucian Graves stepped back into his office, his sharp eyes immediately finding Rosalind Fairchild curled up on the leather couch, her breathing slow and even in deep slumber.

He placed the stack of documents on his mahogany desk with deliberate quietness, loosening his silk tie with one hand as he approached her. The late afternoon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden streaks across her peaceful face.

"Wake up, darling," he murmured, brushing his knuckles lightly against her flushed cheek.

Rosalind stirred slightly, her delicate fingers clutching at his sleeve as she instinctively sought his warmth. "Five more minutes," she mumbled sleepily, nuzzling against him like a contented kitten.

Lucian's lips curved into an involuntary smile. The way her long lashes fanned across her cheeks, the faint pink tint to her skin from sleep - she looked utterly enchanting in her vulnerability.

Settling onto the couch, he gathered her into his arms, one hand automatically reaching to stroke her hair. She sighed happily, burrowing deeper into his embrace without waking.

V

After draping a cashmere throw over her shoulders, Lucian balanced his tablet in one hand while keeping the other securely around Rosalind. The office was silent except for her soft breathing and the occasional tap of his stylus.

The peace was shattered when Nathaniel entered abruptly. "Mr. Graves-"

Lucian's icy glare cut him off mid-sentence. The assistant froze, only now noticing the sleeping woman in his boss's arms. "My apologies," he whispered.

"What is it?" Lucian's voice was barely audible.

"Ms. Genevieve and Reginald are here to see you."

Lucian didn't even glance up from his documents. "Not now. Schedule another appointment."

Nathaniel nodded and retreated. Outside the office doors, Genevieve tapped her designer heels impatiently. "Is Lucian in there? I'm going in."

She moved to push past Nathaniel, but he blocked her path. "I'm afraid Mr. Graves is unavailable at the moment."

Reginald frowned. "What do you mean unavailable? His last meeting ended twenty minutes ago."

Genevieve's eyes narrowed. "We're practically family. He wouldn't turn us away." She tried to sidestep Nathaniel again.

The assistant stood his ground, beads of sweat forming at his temples. "I have strict instructions. If it's urgent, I can relay a message."

Genevieve's perfectly sculpted brows drew together. "Who's in there with him?" she demanded, suspicion dripping from every syllable.

Reginald crossed his arms. "Yeah, who could possibly be more important than us?"

Nathaniel swallowed hard. "I really can't say."

A cruel smile twisted Genevieve's lips. "It's Rosalind, isn't it? That little-"

Nathaniel's silence was confirmation enough.

Reginald made a disgusted noise. "What's she doing here again?"

Genevieve shoved past Nathaniel with surprising strength. "We'll see for ourselves!"

Nathaniel couldn't stop them both. The office doors burst open as the pair stormed in.

"Lucian, what the hell-" Genevieve began, her voice shrill with indignation.

The words died in her throat as Lucian lifted his gaze. The sheer intensity of his glare could have frozen lava.

Then she saw her - Rosalind, still fast asleep, curled against Lucian's chest like she belonged there. The sight made Genevieve's perfectly manicured nails dig into her palms.
###Chapter 925

Reginald and Genevieve stood frozen in shock.

They had suspected Rosalind might be in Lucian's office. After all, she was probably the only person who could make him refuse to see them.

But they never expected to find her like this—curled up in his arms, fast asleep as if she belonged there.

Genevieve paled, her voice trembling with disbelief. "How could you—"

Reginald's gaze locked onto Rosalind, still peacefully dozing in Lucian's embrace. "After everything with Vivian? She pushed you toward another woman! She manipulated you!"

Genevieve's tone turned sharp. "We thought you came here to confront her, not to—"

Vivian's betrayal had ignited Lucian's fury like never before. They had assumed it would be the final blow to whatever remained between him and Rosalind. No man could forgive something like that.

Yet here they were.

Lucian lifted his gaze, calm and unreadable. "I've already handled the situation with Vivian."

He had handled it—thoroughly, ruthlessly—but not in the way they imagined. That particular punishment had been exacted in private, behind closed doors.

Reginald scoffed. "You think a little discipline is enough to fix this?"

Genevieve narrowed her eyes. "So you're just taking her back? Just like that?"

Lucian arched a brow. "Why shouldn't I?"

Genevieve opened her mouth but found no words.

Reginald was equally speechless.

Just then, Rosalind stirred, pressing deeper into Lucian's chest with a soft sigh. Her flushed cheek nestled against him, still lost in sleep.

"Lower your voices," Lucian murmured, his tone quiet but firm. "You'll wake her."

Reginald threw his hands up. "She has you completely under her spell!"

Lucian ignored the jab. "Was there anything else? If not, you can leave."

A clear dismissal.

Genevieve hesitated, clearly wanting to argue, but Reginald tugged her arm. "Let's go."

Reluctantly, she followed him toward the door. At the last second, she glanced back.

Lucian sat on the couch, his expression softer than she'd ever seen it. His fingers brushed a stray lock of hair from Rosalind's face before carefully tucking the blanket tighter around her.

Genevieve's nails dug into her palm, the pain barely registering over the fury burning through her.

She had been certain the Frostbloom incident would finally tear them apart. Instead, Lucian seemed more devoted than ever.

Outside the office, Reginald exhaled heavily. "Genevieve, it's over. He's made his choice. That man is gone."

Who would have thought the ruthless, calculating Lucian Graves would become this—utterly, hopelessly smitten?

Genevieve clenched her fists. "You have to help me."

"I have been helping you," Reginald said tiredly. "But you can't force someone's heart. He's in love with her. There's no changing that."

With a final sigh, he walked away.

"Reginald!" Genevieve snapped, stomping her foot in frustration.

She wasn't giving up.

Pulling out her phone, she dialed Julian Blackwood.

The call connected after a few rings. Julian's smug voice filtered through. "Well? How's the grand plan going? Shouldn't you have Lucian wrapped around your finger by now?"

Genevieve's expression darkened. "It didn't work."
###Chapter 926

"What? How?" Genevieve's grip on her phone turned white-knuckled. "They've reconciled."

Impossible!

Julian Blackwood nearly launched from his chair. After all the meticulous scheming with Genevieve, their efforts had crumbled to dust?

"This can't be happening. I won't allow it!" Julian's voice dropped to a dangerous growl. "If I can't have her, no one will."

"Precisely my thoughts," Genevieve replied icily. "I suggest you devise a new strategy immediately."

Rosalind Fairchild stirred awake, stretching like a contented cat. Her lashes fluttered open to find Lucian Graves' chiseled features mere inches away.

She froze. The last thing she recalled was dozing off on his office sofa. How had she ended up cradled against his chest?

Rosalind bolted upright. "Your meetings concluded?"

Lucian set aside his documents, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Hours ago. Do you realize you've been sleeping like the dead?"

A glance at the clock sent panic through her veins. Two entire hours had slipped away - two hours curled against Lucian's warmth.

"My apologies. The fatigue..." she began.

Lucian leaned back, his smirk infuriating. "Who knew you transformed into a koala when exhausted?"

"A koala?" Rosalind's cheeks burned. This pregnancy exhaustion was no laughing matter!

She glared. "This is entirely your fault! And you dare mock me?"

"My doing?" Lucian's arm snaked around her waist, yanking her flush against him before she could react.

Rosalind's palms flattened against his chest. "Release me this instant! We're in your office! I'll scream!"

Lucian's eyebrow arched. "And say what, exactly?"

"That you're assaulting me!" she hissed. "Let's see how your employees regard you then!"

His grin turned wolfish. "Be my guest. I've nothing to hide."

Rosalind gaped at his shamelessness. "You're utterly—"

"Utterly what?" Lucian purred, tightening his hold. "Explain how your marathon nap is my responsibility."

"Insatiable," she muttered.

The nights since their reconciliation played in her mind - passionate, unprotected encounters that undoubtedly led to her current condition. The man was... proficient.

Lucian's gaze darkened with heat. "Is that praise for my bedroom skills?"

Rosalind refused to acknowledge his virility. "You exhausted me last night! No wonder I crashed today!"
###Chapter 927

Lucian smirked at Rosalind. "Are you absolutely certain I was the one torturing you last night? Should I refresh your memory?"

Rosalind opened her mouth to protest. "I—"

But Lucian didn't let her finish. "Last night, someone kept complaining every time I touched her. She begged me to be gentle, demanded I change positions, and insisted she couldn't take anymore. Ring any bells?"

Rosalind's cheeks burned. She slapped a hand over his mouth before he could continue. Was he completely shameless?

"Stop pretending you're innocent!"

He arched a brow. "And what exactly do you mean by that?"

"I did protest last night, but did you listen? Not once!"

Lucian swallowed hard. His fingers brushed her chin, tilting her face up to meet his gaze. "If you ever piss me off again, I swear I'll keep you in bed until you can't walk. Understood?"

Rosalind's eyes widened. She didn't dare respond.

He studied her for a long moment before adding, "You say your protests didn't work, but if it weren't for them, do you really think I would've held back? I would've wrecked you."

The truth was, Lucian had planned to wreck her—until he saw the tears in her eyes, her pitiful expression. Against his original intentions, he'd softened.

By the end, he'd been drenched in sweat, so consumed by her that revenge was the last thing on his mind.

"Don't get any ideas," Rosalind said quickly.

Lucian lifted her hand and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. "Then behave, and I won't have to."

She yanked her hand back instinctively.

His gaze lingered. "Hungry?"

It was already six—dinnertime.

Rosalind wasn't in the mood to eat much, but her stomach betrayed her with a quiet growl. Pregnancy was cruel—she could feel ravenous yet have no appetite.

She nodded. "A little."

"Let's go, then."

Was he actually taking her out?

Before she could argue, Lucian stood, gripping her hand firmly as he led her out. Thirty minutes later, they arrived at an upscale restaurant.

The manager greeted them warmly at the entrance. "Mr. Graves, welcome! Right this way."

Lucian never released her hand, his fingers laced securely through hers.

They were seated by the window.

The manager smiled. "Is this table to your liking, Mr. Graves? Different from last night's reservation."

"Last night?" Rosalind turned to the manager. "He was here yesterday?"

The manager nodded. "Indeed. Mr. Graves made a reservation for dinner."

Rosalind stiffened. Last night, he'd had plans with Vivian. So this was where he'd intended to take her?

He brought Vivian here, and now her? What was the message?

The manager added, "Though Mr. Graves never actually dined here last night."

Rosalind blinked. "Why not?"

"Because the woman who arrived wasn't the one he was waiting for. He was furious the moment he saw her."

Wait—what? Hadn't he been meeting Vivian?

She glanced at Lucian, who remained focused on the menu, unbothered by the conversation.

"Then who was he waiting for?" Rosalind pressed.

The manager smiled knowingly. "You really don't know? Mr. Graves brought you here tonight. The person he wanted all along was you."
###Chapter 928
Rosalind's breath caught in her throat as she realized Lucian had been waiting for her all along.

It was her he'd wanted to meet at Harmony Bistro last night.

The revelation sent a jolt through her. Memories of his furious return flooded back—the way he'd pinned her to the bed, his punishing kisses branding her skin.

Had he mistaken Vivian for her? That couldn't be possible... could it?

Didn't he despise her?

After all, she'd been the one to end things so brutally years ago. She'd always assumed resentment still simmered beneath his polished exterior.

Lucian's gaze lifted, silver eyes glinting. "What would you like to order?"

"Your choice," Rosalind murmured, fingers tightening around her napkin.

With effortless command, he selected several dishes. The maître d' beamed. "Excellent selections, Mr. Graves. We'll prepare them immediately."

As the man retreated, Rosalind dared to ask, "Last night... you were truly waiting for me?"

One dark brow arched. "What do you believe?"

If he'd intended their meeting... did that mean he still wanted her?

Her heart hammered against her ribs. She yearned to bridge the distance between them, but fear of rejection kept her lips sealed.

Soon, the waiter presented their steaks—perfectly seared, juices pooling on the china. Lucian methodically sliced the meat into precise portions before sliding the plate toward her. "Eat."

The intimate gesture stole her breath. No man had ever—

She took a tentative bite.

"Good?" His voice was velvet-wrapped steel.

"Mmm." The flavors exploded on her tongue—rich, savory, perfection. Pregnancy had stolen her appetite for weeks, yet somehow, sharing this meal with him made everything taste exquisite.

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Then finish it."

This gentler version of Lucian fascinated her. The ruthless CEO had two faces—the predator who took what he wanted without mercy, and this attentive man who cut her steak with meticulous care.

As they exited the restaurant, Rosalind hesitated. "Could you take me home?"

He checked his platinum watch. "It's barely seven-thirty."

"Then where—?"

"I have plans for us."

Thirty minutes later, his Bentley purred to a stop before The Celestial Theater's private entrance.

Rosalind blinked at the neon-lit marquee. "A movie?"

Amusement glinted in his eyes. "What else does one do at a cinema?"

Her pulse skittered. An actual date?

During their previous relationship, they'd never had time for such ordinary pleasures between his corporate takeovers and her medical residency.

Lucian captured her hand. "Come."

Inside, he gestured to the posters lining the lobby. "Choose."

She pointed blindly at a romantic drama's glossy advertisement. "This one?"

"Done."

Their private screening room was all plush recliners and ambient lighting—no chatter, no rustling strangers. Just them.

He handed her a crystal bowl of caramel popcorn. The sugary aroma enveloped her. This—the shared treats, the stolen glances—this was what real couples did.

She nibbled a piece. Perfectly sweet.

Lucian watched her with unnerving focus. "Good?"

Rosalind held out a golden kernel. "Try it."

Instead of taking it, he leaned closer, his breath warm against her fingers. "Feed me."
###Chapter 929

Lucian gestured for Rosalind to feed him popcorn.

Thankfully the theater lights had dimmed, otherwise Rosalind's crimson cheeks would have been embarrassingly visible.

Her delicate fingers trembled slightly as she lifted a piece of popcorn to his lips. "Here."

Lucian's lips brushed against her fingertips as he took the snack.

Just as she tried to withdraw her hand, his teeth lightly grazed her skin, making her gasp.

Rosalind's eyelashes fluttered wildly. The heat spread from her face down to her neck, making her pulse race.

"What are you doing? The movie's starting!" she whispered sharply, yanking her hand back.

She straightened in her seat, determined to focus on the screen.

Lucian's low chuckle sent shivers down her spine as he leaned back, watching her reaction with amusement.

The film began as a typical romance - beautiful leads, sweeping cinematography. But halfway through, the tone shifted dramatically.

The passionate love scene unfolded with startling intensity. Clothes were discarded, moans filled the theater.

Rosalind stiffened.

Where should she look? This wasn't just a romantic scene - it was practically pornography!

She prayed for the scene to end, but it only grew more explicit. The sounds of passion echoed through the empty theater, making her ears burn.

Turning to Lucian, she found his dark gaze already fixed on her, burning with unmistakable desire.

"Did you plan this?" she accused.

His innocent expression didn't fool her. "Plan what?"

"This isn't a romance movie! It's practically X-rated!"

Lucian's deep laugh vibrated through her. Truthfully, he hadn't known - it was his first cinema experience.

The sounds grew louder. In the dark theater, with only the two of them present, Rosalind felt like she might combust.

"I can't watch this. I'm leaving." She stood abruptly.

To exit, she had to pass Lucian. As she stepped over him, his leg suddenly blocked her path.

"Ah!" She stumbled forward.

Strong arms caught her, pulling her down onto his lap. Their faces were inches apart.

"You tripped me!" she accused.

Lucian's smirk was infuriating. "Seems to me you fell into my arms on purpose."

"You're impossible!"

"Don't women love bad boys?" His breath was warm against her ear.

Rosalind refused to admit how much she liked this dangerous side of him.

"Let me go!" She squirmed.

His grip tightened. "Don't move."

She froze when she felt the hard evidence of his arousal pressing against her.

"Lucian?" Her voice trembled.

His smoldering gaze held hers. "What do you think is happening?"
###Chapter 930
Lucian lowered his head and captured Rosalind's lips in a searing kiss.

Rosalind gasped against his mouth, her thoughts scattering like leaves in a storm. She placed trembling hands against his chest to push him away, but Lucian merely tightened his grip on her wrists, deepening the kiss with possessive intensity.

On screen, the movie's passionate love scene mirrored their own heated moment. Lucian kissed her like a man starved, his lips moving with desperate hunger as if she were the last drop of water in a desert.

His mouth trailed fire down her jawline to the delicate shell of her ear, then buried itself in the silken cascade of her hair.

Rosalind's knees nearly buckled. Who could have predicted their innocent movie date would escalate like this?

"We can't—" she protested breathlessly, "People will see—"

Lucian's hot whisper sent shivers down her spine. "I don't care. I need you."

That voice—rough velvet laced with barely restrained desire—undid her completely. Rosalind had never stood a chance against Lucian's charms.

Then came the words that shattered her last defenses: "Help me, darling."

Help him?

He was asking for intimacy right here in the darkened theater.

Rosalind's eyelashes fluttered wildly. "Lucian, we're in public—"

But he was already guiding her slender hand downward, his breathing ragged. "Trust me," he murmured between kisses that stole her protests.

She never saw the movie's ending. Barely registered leaving the theater. Only remembered Lucian's strong fingers intertwined with hers as he led her outside into the cool night air.

They walked slowly down the lamp-lit street. Lucian studied her flushed face. "Angry with me?"

Rosalind fixed him with a glare and threw his favorite phrase back at him. "What do you think?"

Lucian's rich laughter echoed between the buildings.

He actually laughed!

Rosalind punched his arm playfully, only for Lucian to sweep her into an embrace, pressing a tender kiss to her forehead.

Wrapped in each other's arms beneath the starry sky, Rosalind experienced a happiness so profound it stole her breath away.

Just then, a group of college girls passed by, their eyes locking onto Lucian with audible gasps.

"Oh my God! Is he a model or something?"

Rosalind tilted her head to study him. Dressed in an impeccably tailored charcoal suit, with his aristocratic features and commanding presence, Lucian did resemble a GQ cover model. Young, wealthy, and devastatingly handsome—he attracted attention wherever he went.

She'd always known about his lethal charm. Beautiful women like Genevieve had thrown themselves at him constantly.

Narrowing her eyes, Rosalind teased, "Enjoying the attention, Mr. Heartthrob?"

Lucian's lips curved as he tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "What other women? My eyes only see you."

Rosalind's heart flipped.

Pulling her close, Lucian murmured, "Come along, girlfriend."

Girlfriend?

Did he just—?

The passing girls clutched their chests dramatically.

"Why are all the gorgeous ones taken?"

"I'd kill for a boyfriend like that!"

Rosalind bit her lip to contain her giddy smile.

At the car, Lucian opened the passenger door with old-world courtesy. "Your chariot awaits."

She slid into the luxurious leather seat.

As the powerful engine purred to life, Rosalind glanced at his profile. "It's getting late. Shouldn't you take me home now?"
###Chapter 931

Lucian Graves smirked, his lips curving with amusement. "Why the hurry?"

Rosalind Fairchild blinked in confusion. What was he playing at?

She glanced out the window, realizing they weren't heading toward her apartment. He had practically abducted her—taking control of the wheel and dragging her along without a care. Now, with the night deepening, he still refused to let her leave.

"Where are we going?" she demanded, crossing her arms. "I need to go home."

Lucian turned, his dark eyes glinting with mischief. "Why so tense? Afraid I'll devour you?"

She scoffed, forcing a laugh. "Don't be ridiculous. A man like you wouldn't dare."

Her flattery was transparent, and he saw right through it.

"That depends entirely on your behavior," he countered smoothly.

Rosalind fell silent.

Thirty minutes later, the sleek car rolled to a stop in front of an imposing estate—Lucian's private residence.

He opened the door with a mocking bow. "After you."

She hesitated, her fingers tightening around her purse. "I really should leave. It's late, and I don't want to impose."

Before he could respond, she spun on her heel and bolted.

Lucian had anticipated this. In two strides, he blocked her path, his expression smug. "Running away again?"

"I—"

He didn’t let her finish. In one fluid motion, he scooped her into his arms.

"Put me down!" she shrieked, kicking futilely.

Ignoring her protests, he carried her inside, up the grand staircase, and straight into the master suite.

Rosalind recognized it instantly—the cool, masculine decor, the sleek minimalism, the crisp scent of his cologne lingering in the air.

Her face burned. "This is a bad idea. Let me go."

She tried to scramble away, but Lucian caught her ankle and yanked her back onto the bed, pinning her beneath him. "You're already in my bed. Where exactly do you think you're going?"

Then his mouth crashed down on hers.

She shoved against his chest, her breath ragged. "Stop! Didn't I help you enough at the theater? Why do you still want more?"

He undid another button on his shirt, smirking. "That was just the appetizer. I'm still waiting for the main course."

Rosalind's pulse spiked.

Thinking of the baby, she twisted away. "Please... don't do this."

Lucian pinned her wrists to the mattress, his voice a low growl. "Too late for regrets now."

"Lucian—mmph!" His lips silenced her again.

By morning, Rosalind felt fingers lightly tracing her cheek.

She swatted them away, mumbling, "Stop... I need sleep..."

A deep chuckle rumbled beside her.

Her lashes fluttered open. Lucian was already awake, propped on one elbow, watching her with lazy amusement.

"Good morning," he murmured.

Her memories of the previous night rushed back.

She yanked the sheets up to her chin. "What—"

He arched a brow. "No need to hide. I've seen everything already."

Rosalind had no reply.
###Chapter 932

Rosalind shot Lucian a fiery glare.

Lucian reached over and playfully tweaked her nose. "Hungry?"

She swatted his hand away. "Starving," she admitted.

"I'll whip something up for you," he said with a lazy grin.

Throwing off the covers, Lucian rose from the bed and began dressing.

Rosalind tried—really tried—not to look. But honestly, when a man like that stood right in front of you, pulling on his clothes with effortless grace, how could anyone resist stealing a glance? It was practically a crime not to appreciate the view.

Her gaze lingered as he buttoned up his crisp white shirt, the fabric stretching taut over his broad shoulders. When he rolled his sleeves to his elbows, revealing those sculpted forearms, she swallowed hard.

Then, as if sensing her stare, Lucian turned and caught her red-handed.

Rosalind panicked and snapped her eyes shut, feigning sleep.

He knew better. The Rosalind he knew was terrible at lying—adorably so. The way her long lashes fluttered gave her away instantly.

Amused, he stalked back to the bed and caged her in with his arms, leaning down until his breath brushed her lips. "Still not satisfied from last night? Now you're sneaking looks?"

"I was not!" she huffed, cheeks burning. "You're so full of yourself!"

"Oh, really?"

Flustered, Rosalind yanked the covers over her head to hide.

Lucian chuckled, clearly enjoying himself. "I'll make breakfast. Sleep a little longer."

He tugged the blanket down just enough to press a lingering kiss to her forehead before striding out.

Alone, Rosalind lay there, heart pounding. This felt surreal—like she'd slipped into a dream. She had gone to his company, and now she was staying in his estate. They shared meals, went on dates, watched movies, and tangled together at night like lovers.

It was as if they were dating all over again.

Was that what he wanted?

He hadn't said it outright, but the way he looked at her, touched her—it was impossible to ignore.

A slow smile curved her lips.

But when she sat up, a sharp twinge shot through her abdomen. Her stomach churned uneasily.

Dread pooled in her chest. Was something wrong with the baby?

She pressed a hand to her still-flat stomach. She had warned him to be careful, but Lucian was relentless when lost in passion.

What if he'd hurt the baby?

With how insatiable he'd been lately, she wasn't sure she could keep up.

She needed to see Harrison for a checkup.

Grabbing her phone, she quickly texted: [Coming to see you today.]

Harrison replied instantly: [Got it.]

Rosalind washed up and stepped out to find breakfast waiting.

Lucian glanced up. "You're awake already? Could've slept in."

"I have plans with Harrison," she said. "Heading over soon."

He nodded. "I'll drive you."

Her pulse spiked. She wasn't ready for him to know.

"No need," she said quickly. "I'll go alone."
###Chapter 933

Lucian Graves lifted his gaze to meet hers, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. "What's this? Some feminine conspiracy I'm not privy to?"

Rosalind Fairchild bit her lip to suppress a grin. "Absolutely! A lady never reveals all her secrets—especially not to nosy men like you."

His smirk deepened. "Fair enough. Now eat up. After breakfast, I'll drop you at the hospital before heading to the office. Sound good?"

Rosalind nodded, pushing her golden hair behind one ear. "Perfect."

The sleek black sedan glided to a stop before the towering medical complex. Lucian turned off the ignition. "I'll walk you in."

"No need," Rosalind said quickly, already unbuckling her seatbelt. "I've texted Harrison—she's expecting me at her office."

Before he could protest, she slipped out of the car with a wave. "See you tonight!"

Lucian chuckled, shaking his head as she disappeared through the automatic doors.

Inside the bustling hospital, Rosalind navigated the corridors with practiced ease. She found Harrison Sinclair in her private office, still in surgical scrubs.

"Rosalind!" Harrison's face lit up as she removed her stethoscope. "To what do I owe this surprise visit?"

Rosalind twisted her hands together. "I... I'd like a prenatal checkup."

Harrison's perfectly arched eyebrow lifted. "Everything alright?"

Heat crept up Rosalind's neck as she avoided direct eye contact. "Just... precautionary. It's been a while since my last one."

"Of course." Harrison gestured to the examination table. "Let's start with your pulse."

As Harrison's cool fingers pressed against her wrist, Rosalind held her breath. After a long moment, Harrison's lips curved knowingly. "So. You and Mr. Graves have reconciled?"

Rosalind's eyes widened. "How did you—"

"Darling, your meridians are practically singing." Harrison withdrew her hand with an amused smile. "The baby's perfectly healthy, but you might want to... pace yourselves."

A furious blush burned Rosalind's cheeks. "It's not like we—I mean—"

Harrison laughed, already scribbling on a prescription pad. "Save your explanations. That man's utterly besotted. I'd say you're stuck with him."

"What makes you so sure?" Rosalind challenged.

Harrison gave her a pointed look. "Please. The way he looks at you? Like you hung the moon? That's not something a man fakes."

Rosalind could only shake her head in defeat.

Rising, Harrison grabbed a clipboard. "Come on. Let's run the full battery of tests."

The examination passed in a blur of ultrasounds and bloodwork. When the monitor flickered to life, Rosalind's breath caught—there, pulsing with life, was their child.

"Look at that," Harrison murmured, pointing to the screen. "Already doing somersaults in there. Strong heartbeat, perfect size for gestational age."

Tears pricked Rosalind's eyes as she traced the tiny silhouette with trembling fingers. This miracle—part her, part Lucian—was real.

Afterward, as they walked back to Harrison's office, Rosalind cradled the ultrasound printout like sacred parchment.

"Now remember," Harrison said sternly, "just because junior's thriving doesn't mean you two can go wild. Moderation, especially in the first trimester. Understood?"
###Chapter 934

Rosalind's cheeks burned crimson. "I know...but Lucian is just... He never takes no for an answer."

Harrison let out an amused chuckle as she observed Rosalind.

Truth be told, Reginald often said Lucian was just a lovesick fool, completely smitten. But wasn't Rosalind equally besotted? They say when two hopeless romantics find each other, it's a match made in heaven. Those two were utterly inseparable.

Harrison smiled warmly. "Now that you and Mr. Graves have reconciled, you should tell him about the pregnancy."

Tell him about the pregnancy?

The thought had crossed Rosalind's mind repeatedly.

"Mr. Graves adores children. He's responsible and capable. Sharing this news would be wonderful. I have no doubt he'll make an exceptional father."

Rosalind knew Lucian wanted children. He'd mentioned starting a family before.

And she truly believed he would be amazing at fatherhood.

She nodded slowly. "Yes, I'll find the perfect moment to tell him."

Just then, a young nurse's voice called from behind, "Dr. Whitmore."

Harrison glanced over her shoulder. "Duty calls."

Rosalind gave a reassuring nod. "Go ahead. I'll be fine."

As Harrison walked away, Rosalind remained standing there, gazing down at the ultrasound image in her hands. A tender, joyful smile played on her lips.

That's when an all-too-familiar voice shattered her moment.

"Rosalind? What brings you here?"

Her head snapped up to see the last person she wanted to encounter - Julian.

The man she despised most in this world.

Rosalind's expression turned glacial. "Hello, Julian. Given our history, I see no reason for pleasantries. Let's pretend we're strangers."

She had no intention of wasting another second on him and immediately turned to leave.

But Julian blocked her path.

As the saying goes, forbidden fruit tastes sweetest - and Julian was no exception. Staring at her delicate features, he flashed that infuriating smirk.

"Going to ignore me now?"

"After what you did to my family, we're beyond acquaintances - we're enemies. Never show your face around me again!"

Julian's eyes narrowed dangerously. "This is because of Lucian, isn't it? Are you two back together?"

"What happens between Lucian and me is none of your damn concern," she snapped.

She tried to push past him, but Julian grabbed her wrist.

"You—"

In the struggle, the ultrasound image slipped from her grasp, fluttering to the ground.

Julian's gaze dropped. "What's this?"

Rosalind lunged for it, but Julian was quicker - he snatched it up before her fingers could brush the paper.

"Here for a checkup? Are you sick—"

His words died in his throat.

His eyes locked onto the bold heading: "Ultrasound Report." Below, the image clearly showed Rosalind was pregnant.

Julian looked like he'd been struck by lightning. He knew she and Lucian had reunited, but he never imagined they'd slept together - let alone that she was carrying Lucian's child.

Rosalind glared at him with venom in her eyes.

"Ever heard of privacy? My medical matters are none of your business! Give that back!"

She reached for the report, but Julian held it high above her reach. His voice came out hoarse with disbelief. "You're pregnant?"

Rosalind crossed her arms defiantly. "Having trouble reading? Yes, I'm pregnant."

Julian's face twisted with barely contained rage. "You're carrying Lucian's child!"
###Chapter 935

Julian's temper erupted like a volcano. His fingers dug into Rosalind's shoulders as he roared, "How could you? How could you carry Lucian's child?"

Rosalind met his gaze with icy detachment. "I'll repeat myself one final time—we're done. My life, my choices, are none of your concern."

His grip turned punishing.

"Is one mistake all it takes to destroy us? Every man has his wild phase! I've severed all ties with Arabella and the others. Why won't you forgive me? You were born with a silver spoon, Rosalind. No matter how many designer suits Lucian wears, he'll always be that scholarship kid from the wrong side of town. We belong together—our worlds align!"

A bitter laugh escaped Rosalind's lips.

"You call cheating with half of Manhattan a 'wild phase'? Spare me the excuses. This isn't about love—it's about your bruised ego. You can't stand that I chose someone who actually respects me."

Julian opened his mouth to protest.

She cut him off like a knife.

"And let's be clear—you and I were never from the same world. Lucian and I are. His lack of trust fund never defined him. Now he's revolutionizing the tech world. Brilliant. Ambitious. Everything you pretend to be."

Her hand drifted to her abdomen.

"Yes, I'm carrying Lucian's baby. Do you have any idea how happy this makes me? We're starting a family—something you could never give me with your revolving door of mistresses."

Julian's face contorted with rage. Veins bulged at his temples as he slammed her against the hospital corridor wall, his breath coming in ragged bursts.

"You've always been mine! I won't let some upstart steal what's mine!"

He crushed his mouth toward hers.

Rosalind twisted away, her shout echoing down the hall. "Get your hands off me!"

A powerful arm suddenly wrenched Julian backward by his collar, sending him stumbling.

Whirling around with a snarl, Julian spat, "Who dares—Lucian?!"

Rosalind's gaze lifted to see Lucian standing there, his presence like a thunderclap.

Silent as death, Lucian's fist connected with Julian's jaw. The impact sent the heir sprawling against the opposite wall.

Before Julian could recover, Lucian hauled him up by his Brioni tie and delivered another devastating punch. Blood sprayed across the pristine hospital tiles.

A nurse screamed. "Security! We need security!"

Lucian's voice dropped to subzero. "Touch her again, and I'll bury you."

His next swing sent Julian crashing to the floor.

Rosalind grabbed Lucian's arm. Beneath his custom Tom Ford shirt, his muscles trembled with barely leashed violence. The raw power terrified her.

"Enough! Look at him—he's done. This isn't the place!"

Julian attempted a feeble counterattack, but Lucian's next punch left him gasping on the linoleum.

For all his country club boxing lessons, Julian was no match for the self-made billionaire who'd fought his way up from the streets. Every strike carried the weight of a man who'd earned his place in the world.

Rosalind pressed against Lucian's chest, her voice breaking. "Please... just stop."
###Chapter 936

Lucian's fist was still clenched, poised to strike again.

Rosalind threw herself against his chest, her arms wrapping tightly around him. "Please, Lucian! That's enough!"

The warmth of her body against his made him hesitate, but the fire in his dark eyes didn't diminish. With one final brutal kick to Julian who lay crumpled on the hospital floor, Lucian finally stepped back.

Harrison came running down the corridor, her heels clicking against the tiles. "What in heaven's name is going on here?"

Rosalind turned with an apologetic grimace. "I'm so sorry about this mess. We didn't mean to cause any disturbance."

Lucian's grip on Rosalind's wrist tightened as he shot Julian one last venomous glare. Without a word, he pulled her away down the hallway.

"Goodbye, Harrison!" Rosalind managed to call over her shoulder.

Before she could turn fully, Lucian's large hand cradled the back of her head, pressing her face firmly against his chest as he marched them toward the exit.

The cold hospital air was replaced by the warmth of sunlight as Lucian guided her to his parked car. He opened the passenger door with controlled movements, his jaw clenched as he helped her inside before circling to the driver's seat.

That's when Rosalind noticed the blood.

His knuckles were raw and crimson, the skin torn from the force of his punches. Her breath hitched. "You're hurt! Let me—"

Lucian lifted his hand just beyond her reach, his stormy gaze fixed straight ahead.

Rosalind froze. His chiseled features were set in stone, his broad chest rising and falling with barely restrained emotion. The tension in the car was palpable.

"Why were you at the hospital?" she asked softly. "I thought you'd left."

The engine roared to life as Lucian turned the key. "I never left. I waited in the parking lot the entire time."

Her lips parted in surprise. He'd been waiting for her all this while?

Lucian's dark eyes finally met hers, burning with intensity. "Then I saw Julian's car arrive. I followed him inside... only to find you in his arms."

Rosalind's stomach dropped. "That's not what happened! I had no idea Julian would be here today! It was a complete coincidence—"

A humorless chuckle escaped Lucian's lips. "Should I believe you?"

His piercing gaze held hers captive, demanding honesty. The weight of his suspicion pressed against her chest.

"Of course you can trust me," she insisted, leaning forward. "I'm telling the truth! I never expected to see Julian—"

"You didn't know why Julian came," Lucian interrupted, his voice dangerously calm. "But what about you, Rosalind? Why were you really at the hospital?"

Her breath caught.

In that moment, she realized how perceptive Lucian truly was. He must have seen through her flimsy excuse about visiting Harrison from the start.

Lucian reclined slightly, his expression unreadable. "Don't tell me you came just to see Harrison. She was in surgery all morning. Even a child wouldn't believe that."

His fingers gently tilted her chin upward, forcing her to meet his probing stare.

"I want to trust you," he murmured. "Give me one reason—just one—to believe you. Why were you here?"

The truth hovered on her lips.

She'd come for her prenatal appointment.

Could she tell him now?

Yes. She'd planned to anyway.

Rosalind nervously bit her lower lip before reaching up to guide Lucian's hand from her chin. Slowly, she placed his palm against her still-flat abdomen.

"Here," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding of her heart. "This is why I came."
###Chapter 937

Lucian froze, his piercing gaze dropping to her abdomen.

The silence stretched between them like a taut wire.

"What's the matter?" His voice was low, cautious.

Rosalind met his eyes steadily. "What does it look like to you?"

His palm pressed gently against her stomach, tracing slow circles. She could feel the warmth of his touch through the thin fabric of her dress.

"Don't say it's..." His words trailed off, uncertainty flickering across his usually composed features.

A faint smile played at Rosalind's lips. He was beginning to understand.

Her pulse quickened. How would he take the news?

She drew a breath. "I—"

"Wait." Lucian interrupted sharply. "Is this because of last night? Did I hurt you? Is that why we're at the hospital?"

Rosalind's hopeful expression shattered.

She blinked rapidly. Was he serious?

This man could decipher complex business mergers in seconds but couldn't recognize a pregnancy?

Lucian's stern features softened as he continued massaging her abdomen. "If I was too rough, you should have told me immediately. Keeping quiet only leads to misunderstandings."

Rosalind squeezed her eyes shut for a brief moment. Apparently, subtlety was wasted on him.

She placed her hand over his, stilling his movements. "There's something important—"

His phone rang, the shrill tone slicing through the moment.

Lucian glanced at the screen and frowned. "I have to take this."

Nathaniel's voice came through clearly. "Mr. Graves? Mr. Whitmore from Quantum Innovations has been waiting for thirty minutes."

Lucian's jaw tightened. The board meeting had completely slipped his mind. Since bringing Rosalind to the hospital, his thoughts had been consumed by her wellbeing.

"I'll be there shortly," he replied curtly.

Ending the call, he turned back to Rosalind. "I need to go to the office."

She nodded stiffly. The moment had passed. She'd tell him another time.

"You should go. I need to return home anyway. My parents must be worried—I haven't been back in days."

"I'll drive you," Lucian insisted.

Rosalind shook her head. "Your meeting is more important. I can manage."

His expression hardened. "No arguments. Your place is ten minutes away. The office can wait."

Seeing his determination, she relented. "Fine."

Ten minutes later, the sleek black car pulled up outside her townhouse.

Rosalind stepped out onto the pavement. "Go ahead. I'll be fine."

Lucian studied her through the open window. "Rest. I'll call you later."

She nodded. "Alright."

The car disappeared around the corner.

Back at the hospital, Julian remained in the waiting area when Genevieve arrived in a flurry of expensive perfume and designer heels.

She rushed to his side. "What's going on? Your call sounded urgent. And—" Her eyes widened at his bruised face. "What happened to you?"

Julian touched his swollen cheekbone grimly. "Lucian."

"Lucian did this?" Genevieve's voice rose sharply. "Was this about Rosalind?"

Julian's gaze turned icy. "Rosalind's pregnant. And you didn't know?"

Pregnant.

The word detonated in Genevieve's mind like a grenade.

Her manicured hands flew to her mouth. "What? Rosalind is... pregnant? With Lucian's child?"

Julian gave a terse nod. "I saw the ultrasound myself. Two months along."

Genevieve staggered back as if physically struck.

She had accounted for every variable—except this.

Rosalind was carrying Lucian's heir.


###Chapter 938

Genevieve's fingers tightened around her wine glass. "What's our next move? If Lucian discovers Rosalind's condition, he'll propose immediately!"

Julian Blackwood's expression darkened. "You've been shadowing him for months and missed this? If I hadn't accidentally seen those medical records, we'd already be finished."

Her face paled. "This isn't about blame. We need a solution now. Rosalind Fairchild is carrying Lucian Graves' heir!"

"Calm down," Julian said icily. "He doesn't know yet."

If Lucian had known, the engagement announcement would already be splashed across every tabloid.

Genevieve's manicured nails tapped the table. "Then we still have time. That pregnancy must be terminated before Lucian finds out."

Julian studied her with new interest.

A dangerous glint appeared in Genevieve's eyes. "Surely you don't want Rosalind bearing his child?"

"Don't be absurd," Julian scoffed. "But Genevieve... you're positively vicious."

Her laugh sent chills down the spine. "Would you prefer a weak ally?"

Julian's lips curled. "Then we move quickly. While Lucian remains oblivious, we eliminate the problem."

Genevieve frowned. "Rosalind's guarding that pregnancy like a dragon. She's suspicious of us both. How do we get close enough?"

"That's your specialty," Julian said smoothly. "Find a way. And if possible, use this to permanently sever their connection."

As the initial panic faded, Genevieve's mind raced with possibilities. This crisis could be transformed into opportunity - the perfect wedge to finally separate Lucian and Rosalind.

Their rekindled relationship had seemed unbreakable. But now, with this unexpected pregnancy...

A slow, calculating smile spread across Genevieve's face.

Julian raised an eyebrow. "You've devised something?"

"Naturally. We'll have someone else do our dirty work."

"Who?" Julian leaned forward.

Genevieve's smile turned predatory. "We'll use..."

At The Grand View restaurant, Genevieve waited in a secluded booth.

Footsteps approached. "To what do I owe this unexpected lunch invitation?"

She looked up - Reginald stood before her.

As he took his seat, Genevieve's plan crystallized. Rosalind would never fall for tricks from her or Julian now. But Reginald? Rosalind still trusted him implicitly.

Genevieve adopted a concerned expression. "Did you hear about Lucian and Julian's altercation at the medical center today?"

Reginald's brow furrowed. "Lucian fought Julian? Over Ms. Fairchild again?"

Who else could provoke the famously controlled Lucian Graves to violence?

Genevieve nodded, twisting the knife deeper. "It was brutal. Lucian's completely lost his rationality over her. I fear she'll destroy him. She's already broken his heart once, and now she's doing it again. She doesn't love him - she's using him."

She watched carefully as anger darkened Reginald's features. His hands clenched into fists. "She's gone too far this time!"

Genevieve leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Would you help protect Lucian?"
###Chapter 939

Reginald didn't pause for even a heartbeat. "Lucian and I have been brothers since childhood. There's nothing I wouldn't do for him. But what exactly do you need from me?"

Genevieve leaned closer, her voice dripping with honeyed persuasion. "We need to separate Lucian from Rosalind. Permanently."

Reginald's jaw tightened. "You know how obsessed he is with her. She could stab him in the heart and he'd still find excuses for her. I've tried interfering before—it only made him distance himself from me."

"That's precisely why we must act now," Genevieve pressed, her manicured nails tapping the table. "She's destroying him piece by piece. As his oldest friend, can you really stand by while she ruins his life?"

A muscle twitched in Reginald's temple. His knuckles whitened as his fists clenched. "Never. Tell me your plan."

Genevieve's lips curved in triumph. "You'll call Rosalind. Arrange a meeting."

When Reginald hesitated, she continued smoothly, "If I reached out, she'd never come. But she trusts you."

Reginald gave a terse nod. "And then?"

From her clutch, Genevieve produced a small sachet of white powder. "Slip this into her drink."

Reginald recoiled slightly. "What the hell is that?"

"Nothing dangerous," Genevieve lied effortlessly. It was enough abortifacient to terminate a pregnancy in one dose. Once Rosalind miscarried, Genevieve would be in the clear—no messy loose ends.

Years of carefully cultivating Reginald's trust were about to pay off.

She batted her lashes. "Just a mild laxative. Enough to give the scheming little gold-digger a night she won't forget."

Reginald's brow furrowed. "I don't know..."

"Lucian needs us," Genevieve said sharply, playing her final card. "Or are you going to let your best friend drown?"

That did it. Reginald snatched the packet with a resigned sigh. "For Lucian."

Genevieve's smile widened. "Perfect. Call her now—time's running out."

As Reginald strode away, phone in hand, Genevieve relaxed into her chair, savoring her Earl Grey.

Moments later, Julian slid into the vacated seat, admiration glinting in his eyes. "Brilliant. The idiot actually believes he's saving his friend while unknowingly destroying Lucian's heir."

Genevieve's crimson lips curved. "Plausible deniability, darling. When the dust settles, we'll be untouchable."

She watched Reginald through the café window, her plan unfolding beautifully. Soon, Rosalind would lose everything—and Genevieve would finally claim what was rightfully hers.
###Chapter 940

Lucian Graves let out a dark chuckle, his fingers drumming against the polished mahogany desk. "This is going to be absolutely spectacular."

Meanwhile at the Fairchild estate, Rosalind sank into the steaming marble tub, letting the lavender-scented water soothe her aching muscles. As she toweled off, the door creaked open to reveal Victoria holding a delicate porcelain bowl.

"Darling, you must try this," Victoria murmured, offering the creamy bisque.

Rosalind took a tentative sip. "Mother, this is divine!"

Victoria's eyes softened with maternal pride. "Only the best for my first grandchild." Her manicured fingers brushed a damp curl from Rosalind's forehead. "Though I suppose technically, I made it for the baby."

Rosalind's throat tightened. As the Fairchild heiress, she'd been coddled since birth - private tutors, debutante balls, summers in Santorina. Meeting Reginald had been like lightning striking her perfectly curated world. Everyone assumed he was the obsessed one, but without him, her gilded cage would have remained...comfortably empty.

She leaned into Victoria's shoulder. "You're incredible."

"Flatterer." Victoria tapped her daughter's nose playfully. "Finish every drop. I'm preparing more in the kitchen. Even if you're not hungry, the baby needs nourishment."

After Victoria left, Rosalind cradled the bowl in her lap, her free hand drifting to her still-flat abdomen. "Be patient, little one. I meant to tell your father today, but he was...preoccupied." Her lips curved as she imagined Lucian's reaction. "Do you feel him too? That wild energy even when he's standing still?"

The golden afternoon light caught her lowered lashes, painting feathery shadows across her cheekbones. For the first time, she understood the quiet ferocity of motherhood.

The spell shattered when her phone buzzed violently on the vanity.

"Hello?"

"Ms. Fairchild." The voice was clipped. "It's Reginald."

Her pulse stuttered. "Reginald? Is everything alright?"

"I need to see you." The words carried an unfamiliar edge. "Today."

"Me?" Her fingers tightened around the phone. "Why?"

"As Lucian's closest friend, we're overdue for a conversation."

Rosalind had noticed Reginald's growing hostility. Perhaps this was her chance to clear the air. "I'll come now. Where are you?"

He rattled off an address at The Velvet Lounge. Twenty minutes later, she spotted his rigid silhouette in a corner booth.

"Reginald." She slid into the plush seat opposite him.

His whiskey glass clinked sharply against the table. "Let's not pretend. Lucian nearly killed Julian Blackwood at the hospital today because of you." His glare could have frozen the Mediterranean. "End this. For his sake."

Rosalind's nails bit into her palms. "That's not your decision to make."

The table shuddered as he slammed his fist down. "When will you stop destroying him?"

"I don't understand your hatred," she countered evenly. "After three years, what exactly have I done to deserve this?"

Reginald's laugh was bitter. "You really don't know?" He leaned forward, voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Let me enlighten you, princess. Three years ago, Lucian's face was carved up because of you."

Rosalind's breath left her in a rush. The world tilted. She'd never known the origin of Lucian's scars - he refused to speak of them.

"What...what are you talking about?"
###Chapter 941

Reginald glared at Rosalind with icy disdain curling his lips.

"How can you stand there pretending innocence? You're the reason Lucian was scarred for life, and now you dare play clueless? Don't insult me by denying it!"

Rosalind's confusion was genuine. "I swear it wasn't me!"

A bitter, mocking laugh tore from Reginald's throat.

"If you're going to accuse me, you'd better have evidence," Rosalind snapped, her patience fraying. "What really happened three years ago?"

Lucian had never given her the full story behind his injuries. Now, she needed answers.

Reginald's gaze sharpened, boring into hers. "You want me to spell it out? Fine. Three years ago, Lucian was nearly killed during an undercover operation. He came back to see you—only to find you wrapped around Julian Blackwood. The two of you were practically announcing your engagement!"

What?

Rosalind recoiled as if struck. That was impossible. She would never be with Julian, let alone marry him!

Reginald continued relentlessly. "Lucian stood outside your home, bleeding from his wounds. Then men ambushed him, forced him into a car, and poured acid over his face. That’s how he was disfigured. After that, they drove the car off a cliff—with him still inside."

Rosalind's breath hitched.

She had no idea Lucian had endured something so horrific. He had never spoken a word of it to her.

"Who did it?" Her voice shook. "Who would be that cruel? Was there ever an investigation?"

Reginald scoffed. "Still pretending, are you?"

What did that mean?

Then, realization struck like lightning. Rosalind's eyes widened in horror.

"You think I orchestrated it?"

Reginald's stare was razor-sharp. "Of course I do. Those men told Lucian you sent them. That he was an embarrassment to your perfect life, and you wanted him erased."

Rosalind's pulse roared in her ears. This was insane—she would never do such a thing!

Now, everything clicked into place—why Reginald despised her, why Lucian refused to speak of the past.

Reginald's lip curled. "Now you see why I can't stand the sight of you? You almost got him killed. It was Genevieve who stayed by his side. She's the one who deserves him."

Rosalind's fists clenched. "I didn't do it!"

"Didn't do what?"

"None of it! I never sent anyone after Lucian. They were lying! I didn’t even know this happened!"

Reginald laughed—a cold, jagged sound. "Of course you'd deny it. But I know the truth."

"It wasn't me!" Rosalind insisted, desperation clawing at her throat. "This is a setup. I swear, I'll uncover the truth and prove it!"

Reginald said nothing, his smirk dripping with disdain.

Just then, a waiter arrived with two steaming cups of coffee, placing one before each of them. "Your order."

Reginald lifted his cup and took a slow sip, watching her over the rim.

Rosalind's mind reeled. She had no memory of these events, no clue how she'd been implicated. She had to investigate.

She reached for her coffee, bringing it to her lips—

Reginald's fingers tightened imperceptibly around his own cup. He knew what was in hers. All he had to do was wait.

But then—

Rosalind paused, her brow furrowing.

Reginald stilled.

She set the cup down untouched.

"I don't want this," she murmured, frowning.

Reginald's eyes narrowed. "Why not?"

"I just... don't."
###Chapter 942

Rosalind's delicate fingers trembled as she stared at the steaming cup of coffee. The rich aroma that once comforted her now made her stomach churn. She was carrying new life within her - coffee was strictly forbidden.

Reginald's knuckles turned white as he gripped the table edge. His carefully laid plans were unraveling. "I had this specially prepared for you," he insisted through gritted teeth. "Are you deliberately trying to humiliate me?"

Rosalind opened her mouth to explain about her pregnancy, but Reginald cut her off sharply.

"Enough excuses! If you truly respect me, you'll drink that damn coffee right now!"

Hidden behind a potted fern, Julian Blackwood and Genevieve exchanged tense glances. Their anticipation turned to frustration when Rosalind set the cup down untouched.

"Why isn't she drinking?" Julian hissed, his expensive suit wrinkling as he leaned forward.

Genevieve's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Idiot! She's pregnant! We should've ordered herbal tea instead."

Julian's aristocratic features twisted into something ugly. "Then we'll do this the hard way."

"What do you propose?" Genevieve asked, already reaching for her phone.

Julian's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "We take her by force. The private clinic is prepped and waiting."

Back at the table, Rosalind studied Reginald's twitching eye and clammy forehead. His desperation reeked of guilt. "Why are you so obsessed with me drinking this?" she demanded, pushing the cup away. "Unless...there's something in it?"

Reginald's Adam's apple bobbed violently. "I..."

The truth dawned on Rosalind like icy water. "You poisoned it, didn't you?" Her voice shook with betrayal. "Does Lucian know about this?"

Reginald couldn't meet her accusing gaze. "I'm his closest friend! I couldn't let you destroy him!"

Rosalind's laugh was bitter. "And you're certain I'm the villain here?"

"Who else would be?" he spat.

Realizing reasoning was futile, Rosalind stood abruptly, chair screeching. "We're done here."

"Rosalind!" Reginald lunged for her arm.

She froze mid-step as Genevieve materialized before her, flanked by six broad-shouldered men in tactical gear.

Genevieve's crimson lips curved. "Going somewhere, darling?"

Rosalind whirled toward Reginald. "You're working with her?" The betrayal cut deeper than she imagined possible.

Genevieve snapped her fingers. "Since you declined our hospitality..." The armed men closed in.

Rosalind's scream tore through the restaurant as gloved hands seized her. "Let go of me! Where are you taking me?"

"Somewhere you'll finally be useful," Genevieve purred.

Rosalind twisted toward Reginald, eyes pleading. "You're really allowing this?"

Reginald pulled Genevieve aside, voice low with alarm. "Who are these men?"

The cold professionalism of the security team unsettled him. These weren't ordinary thugs - they moved with military precision. What had Genevieve gotten them into?
###Chapter 943

Rosalind Fairchild's heart pounded as she realized Genevieve must never discover her alliance with Julian Blackwood. Every armed guard surrounding them belonged to Julian's private security team.

She forced a bright smile. "I personally hired these men. Paid them from my own savings."

"You hired professional bodyguards?" Reginald's eyebrows shot up in disbelief.

Seeing his skepticism, Rosalind swiftly redirected the conversation. "Remember our agreement - Lucian's life is at stake. Today, we make Ms. Fairchild pay for what she's done!"

Reginald nodded, his momentary suspicion fading.

"Take her away!" Rosalind commanded sharply.

Terror flooded Vivian Astor's veins. She thrashed violently against her captors. "Release me! This is kidnapping! Reginald, I know you're not truly evil. Don't let Genevieve do this! You must understand, I'm—"

Before she could finish, Genevieve made a quick gesture. One of the guards clamped a gloved hand over Vivian's mouth.

Her desperate screams became muffled whimpers as she pleaded with her eyes at Reginald. "Mmmph! Mmmph!"

Reginald frowned. "What was she trying to say?"

"Don't listen to her poisonous words," Genevieve snapped. "She's a master manipulator. This is how she's been controlling Lucian!"

With a shrug, Reginald dismissed his concerns.

Genevieve repeated her order with icy precision: "Take. Her. Away."

The guards dragged the struggling Vivian outside, forcing her into a waiting black SUV that sped toward Silver Pines Medical Center.

"Genevieve! What do you want from me?" Vivian screamed as they hauled her through sterile hospital corridors.

Genevieve's lips curled into a chilling smile. "Patience. All will be revealed."

When they reached the operating theater, Vivian's blood ran cold at the sight of the man waiting there—Julian Blackwood.

Her breath caught. "Julian? Why are you here?"

Genevieve moved to stand beside him as Julian smirked. "Take a guess."

The horrifying realization struck Vivian like lightning.

"You're working together!" she gasped.

Genevieve chuckled darkly. "The perfect partnership, wouldn't you say?"

Vivian's voice shook with rage. "You call yourself Lucian's friend! How could you betray him like this?"

Genevieve's face twisted with malice. "His first mistake was ever loving you."

"Why am I here?" Vivian demanded, her tone glacial.

Julian stepped closer, reaching for her face.

Vivian recoiled. "Don't touch me!"

Undeterred, Julian's hand drifted lower, pressing against her abdomen. "Why do you think we're at a hospital?"

Her eyes widened in horror. "You want to kill my baby?"

His laugh sent shivers down her spine. "Exactly. That abomination shouldn't exist. I'll send it straight to oblivion!"

"NO!" Vivian shrieked, fighting like a wildcat. "Don't you dare hurt my child!"

"What are you waiting for? Restrain her! The doctor's prepped," Genevieve barked.

The guards dragged Vivian into the operating room. Despite her violent struggles, they overpowered her, strapping her to the cold metal table.

"Please! I'm begging you! Don't do this!" Vivian sobbed.

Julian and Genevieve watched from nearby. "Administer the anesthesia. Now!" Julian ordered.

Genevieve's eyes glittered with sadistic pleasure. "Make sure it's thorough. I want that fetus erased."

Bound helplessly, Vivian felt the icy steel beneath her. The blinding surgical lights burned her retinas. As terror consumed her, she prayed desperately for her unborn child's safety.
###Chapter 944

"Lucian, please! Save our baby! Lucian!"

Rosalind's desperate cries echoed through the sterile hospital corridor, her fingers clutching at the crisp white sheets beneath her. Tears blurred her vision as she repeated his name like a prayer.

Lucian didn't even know about the baby. Would their child be lost before he ever got the chance to know?

Hot tears traced paths down her flushed cheeks.

Across the room, Julian and Genevieve exchanged smug smirks, their satisfaction palpable.

Lucian wasn't coming.

Meanwhile, in his sleek office at Quantum Innovations, Lucian leaned back in his leather chair, rubbing his temples. The workday had ended, and he wanted nothing more than to see Rosalind.

He reached for his phone, dialing her number with practiced ease. The line rang once, twice—then silence.

No answer.

His brow furrowed.

Nathaniel entered quietly. "Ms. Fairchild isn't picking up?"

Lucian redialed, his grip tightening on the phone. Where was she? What could possibly be more important than answering his call?

Still nothing.

"Perhaps she's with Dr. Whitmore again and didn't hear it," Nathaniel suggested.

That made sense. Rosalind and Harrison were inseparable—if anything was wrong, Harrison would know.

"I'll call Dr. Whitmore."

Lucian scrolled through his contacts and tapped Harrison's number.

The call connected on the first ring. Harrison's calm, professional voice filled the line. "Mr. Graves."

Lucian had always respected Harrison—not just as Rosalind's closest friend, but as the brilliant physician who had treated his injuries.

"Dr. Whitmore, I wanted to personally apologize for Julian's behavior at the hospital."

He'd already dispatched his team to handle the fallout, but the matter weighed on him.

Harrison chuckled lightly. "Think nothing of it. I completely understand. Seeing a romantic rival would provoke anyone. It just proves how deeply you care for Rosalind. I'm happy for you both."

Lucian nodded, though Harrison couldn't see it. "So, Rosalind visited you at the hospital today..."

Harrison's tone shifted slightly. "Ah, she told you why she came?"

"Of course," Lucian replied smoothly. "She mentioned feeling unwell—something about her stomach."

Truthfully, Harrison had disagreed with Rosalind keeping the pregnancy secret. Hearing that Lucian already knew lifted a weight off his shoulders.

"That's good to hear. Just remember to be more... careful moving forward."

A faint smile touched Lucian's lips. "I would never hurt Rosalind, Doctor."

"It's not just Rosalind I'm concerned about. The baby could be at risk too."

Baby?

The word struck Lucian like lightning.

His hand clenched around the phone. "Baby?"

Harrison, oblivious to the tension in Lucian's voice, continued warmly. "Yes. She's only two months along. The first trimester requires extra caution."

Rosalind was pregnant?

Two months?

Lucian's entire world tilted. No one had told him.

Two months...

He calculated swiftly. That lined up perfectly with when they'd reunited. They'd been inseparable, reckless—he hadn't used protection because some part of him had hoped this would happen.

Could it be?

Was this child conceived that passionate night?

Rosalind was carrying his baby.
###Chapter 945

Lucian froze. The revelation hit him like a thunderbolt - Rosalind was pregnant.

Two months along, and she'd kept this from him?

His fingers trembled as he managed to say, "Thank you, Dr. Sinclair."

The moment the call ended, Lucian sprang from his chair, eyes blazing with emotion. He turned to Nathaniel. "Did you hear that? Rosalind's carrying my child. I'm going to be a father!"

Nathaniel's face lit up. "Congratulations, Mr. Graves! This is wonderful news!"

Yes, it was. After months of longing, his deepest wish had come true.

Lucian felt lightheaded with joy. The woman he loved was carrying their baby.

Then Nathaniel's question cut through his euphoria. "Do you know where Ms. Fairchild is currently?"

Lucian's smile vanished. He didn't. From Harrison's earlier tone, she seemed equally clueless.

Where could Rosalind be?

Pregnant and possibly in danger? The thought made his blood run cold.

Guilt twisted his gut. Now he understood - she'd already been pregnant during their visit to Lillian's home. Those sudden cravings for sour foods, the unusual fatigue, that moment when she'd pressed his hand against her stomach...

All the signs had been there. She'd been trying to tell him.

Lucian cursed his own obliviousness. How could he have missed this?

"I'm calling her right now!"

He snatched his phone and dialed Rosalind's number. The ringing tone mocked him with its endless repetition. Still no answer.

"Why won't she pick up? Where the hell is she?" Lucian's knuckles turned white around his phone.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Do you think... something might be wrong?"

A cold dread settled in Lucian's chest. This wasn't like Rosalind. She'd never ignore so many calls.

He needed to find her. Immediately.

"Track her location now. I want answers this second!"

"Right away, sir."

Nathaniel rushed out to begin the search.

Lucian paced before the floor-to-ceiling windows, tension coiling in his muscles. Every instinct screamed that something was terribly wrong.

Where was his Rosalind?

Minutes later, Nathaniel burst back in. "We've found her! I know where she is!"

Lucian's entire body went rigid. "Where?"

"She's at Willowbrook General."

The hospital?

Lucian's breath caught. "Why is she there? Is she injured?"

"Details are unclear. We need to go immediately."

Lucian was already striding toward the door. "Get the car! We leave now!"

The black Maybach screeched to a halt outside the hospital entrance. Lucian was out before the engine stopped.

Nathaniel hurried after him. "The building's been secured."

Lucian's jaw clenched. "Move!"

He needed wings to fly to her side this instant.

With Nathaniel and a team of security personnel in tow, Lucian stormed through the hospital doors. Their dramatic entrance turned every head in the lobby.

Meanwhile, Julian and Genevieve lingered outside the operating room. They hadn't budged. After orchestrating Rosalind's arrival and placement on that table, they wanted front-row seats to witness the destruction of Lucian and Rosalind's unborn child.

That baby could never see the light of day.

A nurse emerged from the OR. Julian intercepted her. "Progress report?"

"The sedative has taken full effect," the nurse confirmed. "She's unconscious and no longer resisting."
###Chapter 946

Genevieve's voice turned urgent. "Then get the procedure started immediately. We need to witness this with our own eyes!"

The nurse gave a quick nod. "Right away."

Just as she turned toward the operating room doors, one of Julian's men came sprinting down the hallway, panic written across his face. "Emergency!"

Julian whirled around, his brow furrowing. "What's happened? Why are you in such a state?"

"Mr. Graves is here!"

Both Julian and Genevieve paled. "What did you just say? Who's here?"

"Lucian Graves! He brought an entire security team. They've already secured the entire hospital perimeter and are making their way here now. They'll arrive any moment!"

Genevieve's pulse skyrocketed. "How did Lucian get here so quickly? I was certain he didn't even know about Rosalind's pregnancy yet!"

Julian's eyes darkened dangerously. "Unless someone tipped him off."

"Coming in with this level of force," Genevieve analyzed quickly, "he must know about the baby!"

The messenger wiped sweat from his brow. "We have to evacuate immediately!"

Julian cast a frustrated glance toward the operating room. "Damn it! The procedure hasn't even begun, and Lucian's already storming the gates!"

Genevieve's mind raced. She couldn't fathom how Lucian had discovered their plans, but one thing was clear - he knew about the pregnancy now.

Without hesitation, she grabbed Julian's arm. "We need to leave. Now."

Julian clenched his fists. "But the baby - it's still inside her! After everything we've orchestrated, we're just going to walk away empty-handed?"

A cruel smile twisted Genevieve's lips as a wicked idea took shape. "Who said anything about leaving empty-handed?"

Julian turned sharply. "You have another play?"

Genevieve snapped her fingers at the nurse. "Bring the surgeon out here immediately."

The doctor emerged from the operating room, looking confused. "How may I assist you?"

Genevieve stepped closer, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Lucian Graves is about to arrive. You understand what needs to be said, correct?"

The surgeon swallowed hard. "I-I'm not certain I follow. Please instruct me specifically, and I'll relay whatever message you require."

Genevieve's eyes turned glacial. "Tell Lucian that Rosalind came here voluntarily. That she chose to terminate this pregnancy of her own free will."

The doctor froze.

Julian let out an impressed chuckle. He'd never underestimated Genevieve - this woman was truly formidable.

"You heard her. Rosalind didn't want this child. She came here willingly for the procedure. Understood?"

The surgeon nodded rapidly. "Understood."

Genevieve leaned in, her voice dripping with menace. "If Lucian discovers the truth, your entire family will pay the price."

The doctor's throat worked as he repeated the script. "The termination was Ms. Fairchild's decision. She came for the procedure voluntarily. I've never seen either of you before. You have no connection to this matter."

Julian gave an approving nod. "Move out."

He and Genevieve hurried away with their entourage.

Moments later, the doors burst open as Lucian stormed in with Nathaniel and a squad of armed guards. Spotting the surgeon, Lucian grabbed him by the collar and slammed him against the wall.

"Where is Rosalind? Where the hell is she?!"

The doctor stammered, "M-Mr. Graves, she's inside the operating theater!"

Operating theater?

Lucian kicked the door open and charged inside.

There lay Rosalind, unconscious on the surgical table.

He rushed to her side, gripping her limp hand. "Rosalind? Rosalind, wake up!"

When she didn't respond, Lucian turned his burning gaze on the surgeon. "What the fuck did you do to her?!"
###Chapter 947

Lucian's hand shot up. "Restrain him!"

His security team in dark suits surged forward, seizing the trembling physician.

Every masked medical staff member in white coats was swiftly apprehended and forced to their knees.

Holding Rosalind protectively against his chest, Lucian's icy gaze burned with barely contained rage. "What did you administer to her? If you've harmed her or our child, none of you will leave this room alive."

The lead doctor's forehead glistened with sweat. Julian had barely departed when Lucian stormed in. He deeply regretted ever accepting this assignment.

Trembling, he parroted the script Julian and Genevieve had prepared. "Mr. Graves, we didn't force Ms. Fairchild. She... she came voluntarily. The termination was her decision."

Lucian went rigid, his grip tightening around Rosalind. "Repeat that."

The nurse stammered, "It's true, sir. Ms. Fairchild scheduled the procedure herself. She said the pregnancy was accidental—that she wasn't ready for motherhood."

Another nurse added hastily, "We were only following protocol! Please, we're just medical professionals doing our jobs!"

A deafening roar filled Lucian's ears. His vision blurred at the edges.

Rosalind didn't want their child?

She'd chosen to end their baby's life?

Impossible.

Gently laying Rosalind on the gurney, Lucian advanced on the cowering doctor. His polished Oxford crunched against the man's ribs. "Liar! Rosalind would never—"

Wheezing, the doctor produced a tablet. "The authorization form bears her signature! See for yourself!"

Nathaniel stepped forward. "Sir, all surgical consents are digitally archived. I'll verify the records immediately."

"Now," Lucian snarled.

As Nathaniel hurried out, Lucian loomed over the medical team. "If this is fabricated..." He left the threat hanging.

Moments later, Nathaniel returned, face grim. "The system shows Ms. Fairchild personally completed the paperwork at 9:17 this morning."

Lucian's complexion turned ashen. "That's a forgery."

Nathaniel hesitated. "The biometric verification matches her hospital records."

The medical staff exhaled collectively. Their contingency preparations had worked.

The damning document displayed Rosalind's elegant signature beside a thumbprint scan.

She'd rejected their child.

Lucian stumbled backward as if struck. Nathaniel caught his elbow. "Sir?"

Lucian's crimson-rimmed eyes stared unseeing. Now he understood her ignored calls. While he'd been selecting nursery furniture, she'd been here—ending their future.

She'd concealed the pregnancy because she'd never intended to continue it.

But why? After everything they'd—

"Mr. Graves..."

Shrugging off Nathaniel, Lucian returned to Rosalind's side. The sedative still held her unconscious.

His voice cracked. "Is the baby...?"
###Chapter 948

The physician responded swiftly, "Mr. Graves, your timing couldn't have been better. The procedure hasn't commenced yet."

Lucian's gaze dropped to Rosalind's abdomen, still flat beneath her gown. "Is the child unharmed?"

The doctor gave a reassuring nod. "Perfectly healthy. No complications detected."

"How long until she regains consciousness?"

"After some rest, she'll wake naturally."

Without another word, Lucian bent and gathered Rosalind into his arms, carrying her out of the sterile hospital corridors and into the waiting car.

He brought her to Rosewood Manor, the sprawling estate bathed in moonlight. Gently, he laid her upon the silk sheets of the master bedroom, tucking the duvet around her slender frame.

Fury simmered beneath his skin, but his hands remained tender. She carried his heir—his future. That truth stayed his wrath.

His palm settled over the slight curve of her belly. Beneath his touch, life pulsed—his blood, his legacy. Their creation.

A dull ache spread through his chest, yet it was eclipsed by something warmer, heavier. Slowly, he lowered himself, pressing his forehead against her stomach. His voice emerged rough with emotion. "Don't be afraid, little one. Daddy's here."

The depth of his love for this unborn child stole his breath. He pressed a reverent kiss to Rosalind's abdomen. "It's me," he murmured. "Your father."

Though no response came, Lucian's lips curved faintly. This first taste of fatherhood—this irrevocable bond—would forever mark his soul.

Straightening, he studied Rosalind's peaceful expression. His fingertips traced the delicate arch of her cheekbone.

The question burned: Why?

Hurting him was one matter. But their child?

Had she truly despised him so thoroughly that she'd reject even his blood?

A hoarse whisper escaped him. "Rosalind... what the hell am I going to do with you?"

Darkness. Cold metal. Hands pinning her down.

Rosalind thrashed against the nightmare, tears scalding her cheeks. With a gasp, she jerked upright, hands flying to her stomach. "My baby—!"

A voice like shaved ice cut through the panic. "The child's fine."

Her head snapped up. Lucian stood framed by the floor-to-ceiling windows, backlit by dawn's first light.

He turned. Shadows hollowed his features, his crimson-veined eyes betraying a sleepless night. Yet his expression remained impenetrable.

Rosalind barely registered her surroundings—his bedroom, the lingering scent of his cologne. Memories flooded back: the hospital, Genevieve and Julian's treachery.

Her palm pressed desperately against her abdomen. "It's truly... unharmed?"

Lucian prowled forward, looming over the bed. "Yes. Does that disappoint you?"

The venom in his tone made her flinch. Then his words registered.

Her breath hitched. "You... know about the pregnancy?"

A mirthless laugh. "I discovered it myself. Were you ever planning to tell me? Or were you determined to erase every trace of me?"

"I intended to—"

"Intended what?" he snarled. "To inform me after you'd disposed of my child?"
###Chapter 949
Rosalind froze. "What are you saying? Terminate our child?"

Lucian's lips curled into a mirthless smile. "Isn't that exactly what you intended?"

She clutched his sleeve desperately. "Listen to me! Someone took me to the clinic today—they wanted to harm our baby. It was—"

Before she could name them, Lucian cut her off with a bitter laugh. His gaze turned glacial.

"Are you really going to lie to my face again?"

Rosalind threw aside the covers and stood. "Again? What exactly have I lied about?"

His voice turned razor-sharp. "Let's see—was someone really forcing you? Or did you go willingly? Was it someone else trying to hurt the baby, or was it you who never wanted it in the first place?"

She recoiled as if struck. "Never wanted it? What kind of twisted logic is that?"

"Enough!" His voice cracked like a whip. "How long will you keep up this act? The clinic records show you scheduled the procedure yourself."

Rosalind's breath hitched. An appointment? Her?

"If I hadn't dragged you off that table in time," Lucian continued, his knuckles whitening, "our child would be gone. How could you?"

Her vision swam. "I never said—"

"You're cruel." His voice dropped to a wounded whisper. "You weren't even going to tell me about the pregnancy. Did my rights as the father mean nothing to you?"

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. "Who fed you these lies? Julian and Genevieve?"

"Does it matter?" He jerked his chin toward imaginary documents. "The physician confirmed it. The records don't lie."

Ice flooded her veins. Of course—the trap had been set the moment Lucian interrupted their scheme. Now the monsters had twisted reality itself.

She searched his stormy eyes. "Answer me honestly—do you still believe I betrayed you with Julian three years ago? That I orchestrated the attack that scarred you?"

Lucian's jaw tightened. "Didn't you?"

The floor seemed to tilt beneath her.

A hollow laugh escaped her. The poison had been festering for years.

"Believe what you want," she whispered. "But I'd never harm our child."

"Then prove it." His grip on her shoulders turned vise-like. "I've never begged for anything, Rosalind. But I'm begging now—carry this child to term. It's a life. My blood. Once it's born, I'll disappear from your life forever."

Her heart stuttered. "You'd... leave?"

"Isn't that what you've always wanted?" His smile held centuries of sorrow. "I fought to win you back, but some wars can't be won."

The words hung between them like a death sentence. Lucian Graves, the man who moved mountains for her, had finally surrendered.
###Chapter 950

"Carry this child to term and surrender it to me." Lucian Graves' voice was firm, his piercing gaze locked onto Rosalind Fairchild. "Name your price—anything within my power to grant. Just ensure this baby enters the world safely, and I'll honor your demands."

Rosalind hadn't anticipated Lucian would concede this much for the unborn child. It struck her then—his love for this baby ran deeper than she'd realized.

Yet, he had misjudged her entirely.

With no proof of her innocence and the looming threats from Julian Blackwood and Genevieve, she couldn't afford a misstep. For now, she had to play her part.

"Fine," Rosalind agreed coolly. "I'll keep the baby."

Relief flooded Lucian's expression. The child was inside her. If she had wanted to harm it, she could have done so already. But she had agreed. That alone was enough to ease the tension in his shoulders.

"State your terms," he demanded.

"We end this. Permanently." Her voice was ice. "No more contact. No more interference. We're through."

Lucian stiffened.

Rosalind shoved past him. "You're suffocating me. Stay out of my life."

His jaw clenched, knuckles whitening as he fought to keep his composure. After a weighted silence, he exhaled sharply. "Done."

Her chest ached.

"But mark my words," Lucian added, his tone darkening, "if anything happens to that child, I won't hesitate to destroy you. And Whitmore Holdings will burn alongside you. Don't test me."

A threat.

Rosalind nodded stiffly. "The baby will be fine."

"I'll be checking in. Daily."

She tensed. "It's barely a fetus. How exactly do you plan to monitor it?"

His palm settled over her abdomen, warm and possessive. "I'll ensure its safety myself."

The heat of his touch seeped through her skin, unsettling yet steady. Rosalind swallowed. "Fine."

"You'll remain here at Rosewood Manor for the duration of the pregnancy."

Her protest died on her lips as he cut her off.

"Relax. I won't be here. The office will keep me occupied."

Trapped. But she nodded. "Understood."

Lucian withdrew his hand. "Rest. I have business to attend to."

Then he was gone.

From the upstairs window, Rosalind watched as Genevieve intercepted him on the manicured lawn below.

The woman wasted no time. "Lucian, I heard Ms. Fairchild was at the hospital today. Is she pregnant?"

He strode toward his car without sparing her a glance.

Undeterred, Genevieve pressed on. "Why was she there? Was she trying to—" Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "End it?"

A calculated pause.

"How could she be so cruel? That's a life she's discarding!"

Lucian halted beside his sleek black car, keys glinting in his grip. "Don't mention her again. We're finished."

Genevieve's lips curled in triumph.

It had worked. Her scheme to drive them apart had succeeded.

Lucian and Rosalind were over—because of the baby.

Perfect.
###Chapter 951

"Lucian, is it really over between you and Rosalind this time?" Genevieve pressed, her voice laced with doubt.

Lucian's jaw tightened before he gave a curt nod. "Yeah."

That single word was enough to send Genevieve's heart soaring.

Without another word, Lucian slid into the driver's seat of his sleek black sports car and slammed the door shut.

"Wait! Where are you going? I'm coming with you!" Genevieve rushed forward, fingers brushing the handle of the passenger door, desperate not to let this opportunity slip away.

Now that Lucian and Rosalind were officially done, she wasn’t about to waste a second.

But Lucian didn’t even glance her way. The engine roared to life, tires screeching as he sped off, leaving her standing in a cloud of exhaust.

Genevieve coughed, waving a hand in front of her face as she watched the car disappear down the street.

Her fists clenched.

No matter how hard she chased, Lucian always slipped through her fingers like smoke.

Still, she couldn’t help the smug satisfaction curling in her chest.

She had won.

Pulling out her phone, she dialed Julian. "It's done. Lucian and Rosalind are over—because of the baby."

Julian’s voice crackled with excitement. "Are you sure it's final this time?"

Genevieve smirked. "They've broken up before, but this is the first time Lucian admitted it himself. That means it's really over."

"Perfect!" Julian practically crowed. "Finally, we've torn them apart! Now, you need to make your move—fast. Once you sleep with him, he’ll be yours for good."

Genevieve’s lips curved. "I’ll handle it. Just make sure Rosalind doesn’t keep that baby."

"Don’t worry," Julian assured her. "That child will never see the light of day."

Meanwhile, Rosalind stood by the window, watching Genevieve’s triumphant phone call.

She didn’t need to guess who was on the other end.

Julian, of course.

Her lips curled into a cold smile.

Let them celebrate while they can.

Soon, she met Harrison at The Velvet Lounge.

Harrison took her wrist, checking her pulse with practiced ease. "The baby’s fine," he confirmed.

Rosalind exhaled, relief flooding her.

After being dragged onto that operating table by Julian and Genevieve’s scheme, she had been terrified.

But now, knowing her child was safe, she could breathe again.

"Thank you, Harrison."

"Do you need help dealing with them?"

Rosalind shook her head, a determined glint in her eyes. "I’ve got this. They played dirty, but now that I know their game, I’ll make sure they regret it."

Harrison nodded. "Just say the word if you need backup."

At that moment, a voice cut through the dim lighting of the bar.

"Ms. Fairchild."

Rosalind turned, her blood running cold.

Julian stood there, smirking.

The man she despised most had arrived.

He sauntered closer. "Long time no see."

Rosalind glared. "I have nothing to say to you."

Julian chuckled. "The more you hate me, the more I want you."

"I don’t love you," she spat.

"Then who do you love?" His grin turned mocking. "Lucian? I heard you two are finished."
###Chapter 952

Lucian Graves' lips curled into a smirk. "Ironically enough, Mr. Blackwood happens to be at this very lounge tonight."

Dominic was here?

"Where?" Rosalind Fairchild asked sharply.

Lucian gestured toward the VIP section. "Right there in the corner booth."

Rosalind's gaze followed his direction and immediately spotted Dominic Graves seated in an opulent velvet booth. He was surrounded by several sharply dressed young executives, clearly enjoying a night out.

Her breath caught when she recognized the woman beside him - Genevieve.

The elegant doctor was practically glued to Dominic's side, laughing at something he said. The dim lighting cast shadows across Dominic's chiseled features, making his expression unreadable.

"Seems our dear Mr. Blackwood has found himself some charming company," Lucian remarked with a teasing lilt.

Rosalind watched as the executives began playfully ribbing the pair. "Dr. Blackwood, are you and Mr. Graves an item now?"

"Of course she is! Look how close they're sitting. They make quite the striking couple."

"When's the wedding? We'll need to start planning the bachelor party!"

Genevieve laughed melodically, waving them off. "Oh stop, you're being ridiculous."

Reginald, sitting nearby, looked particularly pleased with the teasing - no doubt thrilled that Dominic and Rosalind had parted ways.

"Dominic," Reginald said pointedly, "you and Genevieve have been inseparable lately. When are you going to make an honest woman out of her?"

The entire group seemed determined to push the two together.

Dominic remained silent, simply raising his crystal tumbler and draining it in one smooth motion.

"Easy there," Genevieve murmured, placing a delicate hand on his arm.

Rosalind felt an acidic taste in her mouth. This confirmed it - their breakup was final. Dominic believed she'd terminated her pregnancy, and that betrayal had cut deep.

Now he was free to move on. And apparently, he had.

Just then, the emcee's voice boomed through the lounge. "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our next performer - the stunning campus belle of Westfield University, Isabella Delacroix!"

The crowd erupted in cheers.

Rosalind turned to see Isabella take the stage. The young woman radiated youthful beauty in her flowing chiffon dress. As the music swelled, Isabella launched into an energetic contemporary routine.

Every movement flowed with breathtaking grace - her pirouettes flawless, her extensions perfect. The audience watched mesmerized.

Harrison leaned toward Rosalind. "Don't you think she resembles you somewhat?"

Rosalind had already noticed. Isabella could have been her younger doppelgänger - same delicate features, same ethereal presence.

Lucian settled beside her. "You might not know this, but Isabella has quite the nickname at Westfield."

"What's that?" Rosalind asked.

"They call her 'Rosalind 2.0'."

The moniker made sense, given their uncanny resemblance. Rosalind simply sipped her drink without comment.

On stage, Isabella's performance reached its crescendo. With a final spinning leap, she descended into the audience, weaving between tables to amp up the energy.

Then, with calculated precision, Isabella made her way toward Dominic's booth. Her doelike eyes locked onto him as she executed a perfect spin - landing directly in his lap.

Rosalind's stomach lurched. There Isabella sat, perched on Dominic's thighs, gazing up at him with adoring eyes.

The crowd went wild, whistles and applause filling the luxurious lounge.
###Chapter 953

Julian Blackwood leaned back with an amused smirk, thoroughly entertained by the unfolding spectacle. "Well, well," he drawled, nudging Rosalind Fairchild with his elbow. "Looks like Isabella's set her sights on Lucian. Who knew our ice-cold CEO had a thing for campus queens? Think he'll actually bite?"

His words were deliberately calculated to provoke a reaction.

Rosalind's manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Isabella Delacroix, the undisputed beauty of Westfield University, commanded attention wherever she went. Luxury cars lined the campus gates daily as wealthy heirs vied for her affection. Yet none had managed to capture her interest - until tonight.

The Velvet Lounge wasn't just any nightclub. This was where Metropolia's elite gathered - scions of old money and self-made moguls rubbing shoulders beneath crystal chandeliers. Isabella had come hunting, and she'd found her prey.

She'd recognized Lucian Graves immediately. The tech tycoon's sharp features and commanding presence made him impossible to miss in the sea of lesser men. When their eyes met across the crowded dance floor, Isabella felt the electric jolt of instant attraction.

Now, seizing her moment, she'd abandoned the stage mid-performance, her sequined dress catching the light as she landed gracefully in Lucian's lap.

The crowd erupted.

"Isabella just claimed Blackwood's CEO!"

"Damn, she's bold!"

"After rejecting every trust fund baby in Metropolia, she picks Quantum's founder?"

"Lucian, you lucky bastard!"

Isabella tilted her face upward, her blush visible even in the club's mood lighting. "Mr. Graves," she murmured, voice laced with honeyed innocence. "I'm Isabella from Westfield. I'd love the chance to know you better. Maybe we could exchange numbers?"

She was playing her cards perfectly - leveraging youth and beauty while feigning shyness. In her world, high-value men were rare commodities to be captured, not courted.

Before Lucian could respond, Genevieve sprang into action. With Halsey out of the picture, she'd been positioning herself as Lucian's next romantic prospect. This upstart college girl threatened her plans.

Genevieve yanked Isabella off Lucian's lap with surprising force. "Know your place, gold-digger!"

Isabella tumbled to the floor with a theatrical gasp, her dress riding up to reveal toned thighs. When she looked up, her eyes shimmered with manufactured tears. "I-I just wanted an internship opportunity at Quantum Innovations! My father's a gambler, my mother passed when I was twelve, and I'm putting my little sister through school..." Her voice broke artfully. "I didn't mean any disrespect."

The tragic backstory was textbook - designed to trigger every wealthy man's white knight complex.

"Pathetic," Genevieve sneered. "Quantum doesn't hire cocktail waitresses."

Isabella's gaze found Lucian's, her expression a masterclass in vulnerable pleading. "Mr. Graves, please..."

"Enough." Lucian's baritone cut through the tension. His expression remained unreadable as he regarded the scene. "Let her be."

That simple dismissal carried weight. In protecting Isabella, he'd made his interest clear.
###Chapter 954

Genevieve's face flushed with rage. "Lucian, how dare you take her side?"

Lucian Graves' piercing gaze remained fixed on Isabella. "You should release my arm now."

Isabella immediately complied, rising gracefully. "Of course. Thank you."

"I require a new personal assistant," Lucian continued smoothly. "Report to Blackwood Enterprises tomorrow morning."

With those words, Lucian had just appointed Isabella as his personal assistant.

Genevieve's jaw dropped. "You're hiring her? After what just happened?"

Rosalind Fairchild observed the scene with wide eyes. Everyone knew Lucian only employed male staff - this unprecedented hiring shattered his longstanding policy.

Julian Blackwood chuckled darkly. "Seems Mr. Graves is showing Miss Delacroix particular favor, Rosalind."

A sharp pang shot through Rosalind's chest.

Isabella beamed, her smile radiant. "Thank you for this opportunity! I won't let you down."

Lucian gave a curt nod. "See that you don't."

The young woman settled beside Lucian, dutifully refilling his champagne flute. "Your drink, Mr. Graves."

Several executives exchanged amused glances. "First time we've seen Mr. Graves with a female assistant."

"Isabella, you must be special. Don't waste this chance."

Her smile turned coy. "I certainly won't."

Genevieve's glare could have melted steel as it burned into Isabella.

Julian looked pleased. Though he and Genevieve were allies, she'd failed to capture Lucian's attention. Isabella's success served his purposes equally well.

His smirk deepened as he noted Rosalind's paling complexion. "Clearly Mr. Graves has moved on. Why not give me another chance? Be my girlfriend."

Rosalind's icy stare could have frozen hell. "In your dreams, Julian. I'd rather die."

She stood abruptly. "Excuse me."

Julian moved to follow. "Let me accompany you-"

But Harrison intercepted him. "Stay, Julian. The night's just begun."

Grudgingly, Julian resumed his seat.

In the ladies' restroom, Rosalind stood at the marble sink when Genevieve entered.

"Did you see how Isabella fawned over him?" Genevieve sneered.

Rosalind's expression remained impassive. "And?"

Genevieve's laugh was razor-sharp. "Face it - you're yesterday's news. Lucian's clearly moved on to fresher, more... accommodating company."

Rosalind straightened. "You mock me while your own schemes backfire spectacularly. How does it feel to hand the man you love to another woman?"

"Careful!" Genevieve's face darkened before twisting into a cruel smile. "She resembles you, doesn't she? That must cut deep. Younger. Prettier. More eager to please. You're being replaced by your own reflection."

Each barb found its mark with surgical precision.

Rosalind's fists clenched. "Perhaps you should look to your own wounds first."

She exited to find Lucian preparing to leave. Isabella stood holding his discarded suit jacket - that familiar black Armani that Rosalind knew so well.

The sight of another woman cradling Lucian's jacket struck like a dagger to her heart.
###Chapter 955

Lucian Graves glanced over his shoulder at Rosalind Fairchild. "Can you handle a car?"

Rosalind gave a confident nod. "Absolutely."

She'd been preparing to marry into high society for years - driving was among the first skills she'd mastered. There was no question about her ability.

Lucian tossed the keys her way with a careless flick of his wrist. "You're driving then."

A pleased smile curved Rosalind's lips. "With pleasure."

Harrison stepped out just in time to see Lucian and Rosalind settling into the sleek black Bentley. Rosalind took the driver's seat while Lucian, who'd been drinking all evening, lounged in the passenger side.

The engine roared to life. With a smooth press of the accelerator, Rosalind pulled away from the curb, the luxury vehicle gliding down the street like a panther stalking through the night.

They disappeared together into the darkness.

Harrison remained rooted to the spot, watching until the taillights vanished around the distant corner. Her eyes burned, though whether from exhaustion or emotion, she couldn't say.

"Still staring?" Julian Blackwood's voice cut through her thoughts as he emerged from the building. "They're gone, darling."

Harrison snapped back to reality with a sharp inhale. "That's hardly your concern."

Isabella appeared at her elbow. "Let's head home."

Harrison nodded stiffly. "Yes, let's."

As they walked away together, Julian watched Harrison's retreating figure with a calculating smile that promised trouble.

Thirty minutes later, Harrison entered the gated estate Lucian had arranged for her pregnancy stay. A uniformed maid greeted her at the door with a respectful curtsy. "Welcome home, Ms. Fairchild."

Lucian had spared no expense - the residence came fully staffed with a personal chef, two maids, a live-in nurse, and a nutritionist. Every possible comfort had been provided.

"I've prepared bone broth for you," the maid offered. "Shall I bring some to your room?"

Harrison shook her head. "Not now. I need a bath first."

The maid hurried to prepare the marble ensuite bathroom while Harrison peeled off her evening wear. Sinking into the steaming water, she felt some of the evening's tension ease from her muscles - though her mind remained preoccupied with images of Lucian and Isabella. What were they doing right now? Where had they gone together?

Mindful of her condition, Harrison didn't linger. As she rose from the bath and reached for a towel, she realized with a start that she'd forgotten to bring sleepwear.

The events of the evening had clearly rattled her more than she cared to admit.

Not wanting to summon the maid, Harrison wrapped herself in a plush towel and stepped cautiously into the bedroom - only to freeze at the sound of the maid's voice from downstairs. "Good evening, Mr. Graves."

Her breath caught. Lucian was here?

The bedroom door swung open before she could react.

Harrison whirled to find Lucian filling the doorway, his tall frame silhouetted against the hall light. He'd actually returned.

Their eyes locked, and Harrison's mind went utterly blank.

Lucian seemed equally stunned. His gaze traveled over her with deliberate slowness, taking in every exposed curve.

Realization struck like lightning. Harrison gasped, clutching the towel tighter. She'd been completely uncovered when he walked in - he'd seen everything.

"My apologies," Lucian murmured, his voice rougher than usual. The door clicked shut behind him.

Harrison scrambled into silk pajamas with shaking hands. Her cheeks burned as if scalded. Of all the moments for Lucian to return - and to see her like that...

Outside, she heard the maid's puzzled voice. "Mr. Graves? Aren't you coming downstairs?"

Then - three sharp raps on the bedroom door. Lucian was knocking.
###Chapter 956
Rosalind inhaled deeply, steadying her nerves. "Enter."

The door swung open, revealing Lucian's imposing figure.

Tension crackled in the air like static electricity. Though neither acknowledged it, the memory of their earlier encounter lingered between them.

Lucian closed the distance with measured steps. "My apologies for not knocking before."

Rosalind's fingers tightened around her sweater. "No matter. What brings you here?"

His gaze dropped to her midsection. "Have you forgotten our arrangement? Daily check-ins are mandatory."

She hadn't forgotten. She'd simply hoped he might—especially after leaving with Isabella earlier. The way they'd departed together suggested other priorities.

"Proceed," she murmured, shifting to grant access.

Lucian knelt gracefully, his warm palms cradling her swollen belly. "Any disturbances today?" His baritone voice resonated through her skin.

"None."

"Then why did Mathilda report barely touched meals?" His thumbs traced idle circles.

Rosalind lifted her chin. "I dined at The Velvet Lounge with Harrison. Ironically, we spotted you there."

She searched his face for tells, but his expression remained impassive.

"Didn't notice you."

"Naturally. You seemed... preoccupied with your new executive assistant." The words tasted bitter.

Lucian's hands stilled. After a weighted pause, he confirmed, "Indeed."

The confirmation stung more than she'd anticipated. At his status, maintaining bachelorhood was unrealistic. Young, ambitious women like Isabella were inevitable.

Suddenly, Lucian pressed his cheek against her stomach, his breath warm through the fabric. Rosalind stiffened.

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Relax. This is for the child, not you."

She exhaled shakily. "Of course."

"Behave for your mother," he murmured against her belly. "I'll return tomorrow." The featherlight kiss he planted sent unexpected tremors through her.

As he rose, a melodic ringtone shattered the moment. Isabella's name flashed on his screen.

Rosalind remembered the coy way Isabella had requested his number at the bar. Now she was calling—from outside the manor, no less.

"Mr. Graves?" Isabella's saccharine voice carried clearly. "I'm waiting at the gates. Shall I keep the engine running?"

Rosalind's nails bit into her palms. The audacity to loiter at their home.

"Departing now," Lucian answered curtly.

He pocketed the phone, his gaze sweeping over Rosalind one final time. "Rest well."

Then he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him like a full stop to their fractured conversation.
###Chapter 957

Lucian turned to leave, but Rosalind's fingers caught the edge of his sleeve. "Mr. Graves."

He paused, glancing back with those piercing gray eyes. "Yes?"

Her throat tightened. "Tomorrow... I have my prenatal appointment. Would you... like to come?" She rushed to add, "If you're busy, I completely understand. I can manage alone—"

"I'll be there." His deep voice cut through her hesitation like a knife through butter.

Rosalind nodded, releasing his sleeve. "Thank you."

"Rest well. I'll pick you up at nine." With that, he was gone.

She moved to the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching as his sleek black Bentley idled below. Isabella Delacroix stood waiting by the passenger door, her designer dress shimmering under the morning sun.

When Lucian emerged, Isabella's face lit up. "Right on time, Mr. Graves." Her laughter carried faintly through the glass as she held the door open for him.

The car pulled away, leaving Rosalind alone with the flutter in her womb. Three months along now, her abdomen had begun showing the softest swell beneath her silk blouse.

She cradled the gentle curve, whispering, "Papa had to leave, little one. But we'll see him tomorrow at your checkup, won't we?"

Morning light streamed through the hospital windows as Lucian guided Rosalind into the examination room. The ultrasound wand glided over her stomach, revealing their baby's strong heartbeat.

"Any fetal movement yet?" Dr. Sinclair adjusted his glasses.

Rosalind shook her head. "Not that I've noticed."

Lucian's jaw tensed. "Is that concerning?"

"Not at all." The doctor chuckled. "At this stage, baby's just starting to explore movement. Try placing your hand here," he guided Lucian's palm to Rosalind's bump, "and talk to them. A father's voice is powerful stimulation."

Rosalind watched emotions flicker across Lucian's usually impassive face—wonder, concern, an almost boyish excitement. This ruthless CEO, who commanded boardrooms with an iron will, now hung on every word about fetal development.

"Understood." Lucian bent slightly, his lips nearly brushing the fabric of her blouse. "Can you hear me, little one? It's your father."

Rosalind couldn't suppress a giggle.

His head snapped up. "Something amusing?"

"I just—" Her words dissolved into a gasp as something fluttered beneath his hand like a trapped butterfly.

Lucian's eyes widened. "Was that—?"

Again, stronger this time—a distinct kick against his palm.

"The baby moved!" Rosalind clutched his forearm as another jab followed, more forceful.

Lucian steadied her instantly. "Does that hurt?"

Dr. Sinclair beamed. "Mr. Graves, it seems you're not just an attentive father-to-be, but quite protective of the mother as well."

Heat flooded Rosalind's cheeks. "It doesn't hurt," she murmured, though her fingers lingered where Lucian's hand had been moments before, as if to preserve the warmth of his touch.
###Chapter 958

Lucian's deep voice cut through the silence. "Really?"

Rosalind nodded, her fingers unconsciously tracing her belly. "Really."

He crouched down until he was eye-level with her stomach, his tone unexpectedly tender. "You must be gentle with your mother, little one."

The obstetrician smiled warmly. "The connection between you two is remarkable."

A flush crept up Rosalind's cheeks.

The doctor continued, "A father's love creates stability for the mother. That stability brings peace to the baby, and peace creates harmony in the home. When parents share genuine affection, it shapes the child's entire future." She adjusted her glasses. "Remember - even in the womb, babies sense their parents' emotions."

Rosalind chanced a glance at Lucian and found his intense gaze already fixed on her.

Those storm-gray eyes held her captive, making her pulse stutter. She couldn't decipher the emotion swirling in their depths.

As they prepared to leave, the doctor added, "Be diligent with your moisturizing routine to prevent stretch marks. Caring for yourself is just as important as caring for your baby."

Lucian thanked the physician before turning to Rosalind. "Let's go."

They walked side by side through the sterile hospital corridor.

After a prolonged silence, Lucian suddenly asked, "Do you agree with what she said?"

Rosalind blinked. "She said many things. Which part?"

He studied her for a weighted moment before shaking his head. "Never mind."

Never mind? What had he meant to ask?

Rosalind opened her mouth—

A frantic shout interrupted her. "Coming through! Emergency!"

A nurse came barreling down the hallway with a crash cart, moving at alarming speed.

Lucian reacted instantly. His arm shot out, pulling Rosalind flush against his chest as he pivoted them both out of harm's way. The cart whizzed past, missing them by inches.

"Are you hurt?" His voice was rough with concern.

Rosalind shook her head, suddenly hyperaware of their proximity. His crisp bergamot scent enveloped her, and the heat radiating from his body sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

"I—"

"Mr. Graves!"

They turned to see Isabella Delacroix approaching. Her sharp eyes flicked between Lucian's protective hold and Rosalind's flushed face.

"Is this... Mrs. Graves?" The question dripped with false sweetness.

Mrs. Graves?

Rosalind immediately recognized the challenge in Isabella's gaze. This was a power play—a test to establish hierarchy.

She looked to Lucian, waiting.

He released her with deliberate slowness. "She's not Mrs. Graves."

The cold finality in his voice made Rosalind's stomach drop.

Isabella's lips curled in victory. "Then who is she?"

Rosalind held her breath.

The corner of Lucian's mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile. "She's carrying my child. That's all."

The dismissal cut deeper than any blade.

Rosalind's face drained of color. "Excuse me."

She turned on her heel and fled to the nearest restroom.

Leaning against the sink, she splashed icy water on her burning face. The door creaked open.

Of course. Isabella had followed.

Rosalind wasn't surprised—she'd expected this confrontation.
###Chapter 959

Rosalind lowered her gaze and began washing her hands, making no move to acknowledge Isabella's presence.

Yet Isabella deliberately chose the adjacent sink, turning on the faucet with calculated grace.

"Good afternoon, Ms. Fairchild," she initiated, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Rosalind responded with a terse, "Hello."

Isabella's lips curved into a predatory smile. "I must confess, I find myself rather envious of your position. Though you'll never be Mrs. Graves, carrying Lucian's child certainly elevates your status in his world."

Rosalind shut off the water and reached for a paper towel, methodically drying each finger while maintaining her silence.

Undeterred, Isabella continued with a mocking lilt, "How peculiar though - pregnant with his heir yet still denied the title. They say a woman's value increases through motherhood, but you've somehow managed to fail even at that. Quite the accomplishment, really."

The barbed words hung in the air.

Rosalind finally turned to face her rival. "Get to your point."

Isabella closed the distance between them.

"My point is simple," she purred. "Stay away from what's mine. That pregnancy might grant you temporary relevance, but his refusal to marry you speaks volumes. There are countless women vying for his attention - it's only a matter of time before one claims what you couldn't."

A wry smile touched Rosalind's lips. "Are you volunteering for the position? Dreaming of becoming the next Mrs. Graves?"

With a practiced flip of her hair, Isabella affected an air of nonchalance. "I merely observe facts. And the fact remains - Lucian himself confirmed you'll never hold that title."

Rosalind's hand drifted to her abdomen. "True, I'm not his wife. But as you so astutely noted, I carry his child. Doesn't that suggest a certain... uniqueness in his eyes?"

A flicker of irritation crossed Isabella's perfectly composed features.

"I don't know what game you're playing," Rosalind continued, "but your petty insults reveal more about your insecurities than my situation. Has he shown no interest in you? Then perhaps you should redirect your efforts. As you said - many women want him. Tomorrow could bring a new assistant to replace you. But I? I'll always be the mother of his child."

Isabella's smile vanished, replaced by a venomous glare.

"Don't flatter yourself. You're nothing more than a discarded plaything!"

Rosalind's eyes narrowed. She stepped forward until their faces were inches apart, her whisper cutting through the tension. "Tell me - has he ever played with you?"

Isabella stiffened.

The corner of Rosalind's mouth lifted in triumph. "I see. You haven't even earned that privilege. How ironic - you secretly long to be his 'discarded plaything,' don't you?"

Isabella's lips parted soundlessly.

Rosalind's smile widened. "Then I suggest you get to work."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving Isabella trembling with rage. The younger woman's fists clenched until her manicured nails left crescent moons in her palms.

The whispers of "Rosalind 2.0" followed Isabella everywhere, a constant reminder of her borrowed beauty. She knew her campus queen status stemmed solely from her resemblance to Rosalind.

And though Lucian had made her his assistant, Isabella suspected it was merely because she served as a pale imitation of the woman now carrying his child.
###Chapter 960

Rosalind Fairchild had gained fame through her association with Lucian Graves, but now she was desperate to break free from his shadow. Spending her entire life being compared to him, seen merely as his pale imitation, was unbearable humiliation.

The truth was undeniable—Isabella Delacroix was nothing more than Rosalind's replacement.

This reality infuriated Isabella. She refused to accept defeat, even after their last confrontation had left her utterly shattered.

Rosalind, born into privilege and power, carried an unshakable confidence beneath her composed demeanor. When she looked at Isabella, her gaze held nothing but disdain—as if observing a pitiful jester performing a clumsy act.

But Isabella wasn't one to surrender. She pursued Rosalind down the corridor, her voice sharp with desperation.

"Ms. Fairchild!"

Rosalind paused, turning with icy precision. "I believe I've made myself perfectly clear. Don't you have anything better to do than harass me?"

The condescension in Rosalind's tone made Isabella's blood boil. "Why are you—"

Her words cut off abruptly as a commanding presence approached. Lucian Graves had arrived.

Instantly, Isabella's expression shifted—her eyes welling with tears, her posture wilting into fragility. "I never tried to seduce Mr. Graves. How could you call me such vile things?"

Rosalind stared, bewildered. The accusation was absurd.

Then Isabella seized Rosalind's wrist. "Please, let me explain—ah!"

Before Rosalind could react, Isabella forced Rosalind's hand against her own cheek in a sharp, audible slap.

Stumbling backward, Isabella nearly collapsed—until a strong hand caught her elbow, steadying her.

She looked up with trembling lips. "Mr. Graves..."

Rosalind met Lucian's gaze. Truthfully, Isabella's sudden theatrics had already tipped her off—he must have been nearby.

The entire display was laughably transparent.

Isabella clung to Lucian's arm, her voice quivering. "Please, don't blame Ms. Fairchild. She didn't mean to hit me."

Lucian's piercing gaze shifted to Rosalind. "Explain yourself."

Rosalind scoffed. "Did I strike her?"

Isabella shook her head frantically. "No, Mr. Graves, it was a misunderstanding! I must have offended Ms. Fairchild somehow..."

A cold smile curled Rosalind's lips. She stepped forward, closing the distance between them.

Crack!

This time, the slap was deliberate—her palm connecting with Isabella's cheek with enough force to snap her head to the side.

Isabella gasped, clutching her stinging face. "How dare you—?"

Rosalind smirked. "That is what a real slap looks like."

Rage burned through Isabella, but with Lucian watching, she forced herself to remain the victim. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she gazed up at him in wounded silence.

Rosalind watched the performance with icy detachment. "Would you like another demonstration?"

Her hand lifted again—

But this time, Lucian intercepted her wrist in a vice-like grip.
###Chapter 961

Lucian grabbed Rosalind's wrist to stop her.

She turned, meeting his gaze with icy defiance.

After a tense silence, Lucian spoke. "Don't hit her again."

His words weren't for Isabella's sake—he was protecting Rosalind.

Rosalind wrenched her arm free with a scoff. "Whatever you say, Mr. Graves."

She spun on her heel and strode away without another glance.

Isabella's heart soared. This little performance had worked better than she'd dreamed. The great Lucian Graves had actually defended her!

No man could resist a vulnerable young woman like her.

Strangely, she almost felt grateful to Rosalind. Without that dramatic slap, she'd never have gotten this close to Lucian.

The past week as his "special assistant" had been painfully professional. Nathaniel handled all his personal matters. She barely saw Lucian at Quantum Innovations.

The office gossips envied her position, whispering about their supposed affair. Only Isabella knew the cold truth—Lucian treated her with detached professionalism.

That's why she'd sought out Rosalind today. And oh, what a perfect decision that had been!

Her eyes shimmered with manufactured admiration as she gazed at Lucian. "Thank you for protecting me, Mr. Graves."

He barely glanced at her. "Don't mention it."

Isabella pressed on in her sweetest tone, "Coming from nothing, fighting my way up alone...you're the first person who's ever stood up for me. I don't know why Ms. Fairchild hates me, but having you defend me..."

Lucian's lips curved slightly. "I said don't thank me. I wasn't protecting you."

She blinked in confusion. "But you—"

"I did it for Rosalind," he cut in.

Isabella froze.

"She's pregnant," Lucian continued casually. "I was worried she'd hurt her hand slapping you."

The blood drained from Isabella's face.

He wasn't protecting her? He was worried about Rosalind's hand?

Her mind short-circuited. This made no sense!

Oblivious to her crisis, Lucian strode after Rosalind without a backward glance.

Isabella stood rooted to the spot, her perfect plan crumbling around her.

That man was insane.

Rosalind stormed from the hospital entrance when Lucian caught up, his fingers encircling her wrist again.

"Slow down," he chided. "I'll drive you home."

She yanked free. "I don't need your help. Go comfort your precious assistant. She's probably crying after that slap."

Lucian studied her furious expression and suddenly smirked. "Are you jealous?"

The question hung between them.

Rosalind's breath hitched.

He stepped closer, his broad frame casting her in shadow. "Answer me. Are you jealous I hired a female assistant?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" she snapped too quickly. "I couldn't care less!"

Lucian's gaze searched hers. Of course she wasn't jealous. He must have imagined that fleeting vulnerability in her eyes.
###Chapter 962

"Get in. I'm driving you home," Lucian commanded.

Rosalind attempted to protest. "I can manage on my own."

His fingers closed around her wrist with surprising gentleness as he opened the passenger door of the sleek black Bentley. Before she could react, she found herself seated inside, the door clicking shut behind her.

Rosalind exhaled sharply through her nose.

Thirty minutes later, the gates of Rosewood Manor swung open.

Eleanor, the head housekeeper, appeared instantly. "Miss Fairchild, Mr. Graves."

"I'll be taking a shower first," Rosalind announced, already moving toward the grand staircase without sparing Lucian a glance.

Once in her suite, she let the steaming water cascade over her skin, washing away the day's exhaustion. Emerging wrapped in a plush towel, she reached for the special oil blend her dermatologist had prescribed.

Isabella Delacroix was nearly a decade younger. While Rosalind maintained confidence in her own beauty, pregnancy brought unpredictable changes. She massaged the fragrant oil into every inch of skin she could reach—except her back.

Twisting awkwardly, her fingers barely grazed the area between her shoulder blades.

The door clicked open.

Assuming it was Eleanor, Rosalind settled onto the chaise lounge, carefully positioning a pillow beneath her hips. "Eleanor, could you help with my back?"

Lucian froze in the doorway.

The maid was nowhere in sight. He'd only come to retrieve forgotten documents. But now Rosalind lay before him in nothing but a silk robe, the ties loose, revealing a tantalizing expanse of flawless skin. His throat tightened.

The robe barely reached mid-thigh, showcasing slender legs that seemed to glow in the dim lighting. Her floral shampoo mingled with the oil's exotic scent, creating an intoxicating aroma.

"Eleanor? Are you there?" Rosalind held out the bottle blindly.

Against his better judgment, Lucian stepped forward.

Rosalind sighed as warm hands spread oil across her back. The touch was hesitant at first, then grew more confident, kneading the tension from her muscles. She hummed appreciatively. "A bit harder, please."

The pressure increased, skilled fingers working down her spine until they reached the dip of her waist. A shiver ran through her. "Not quite that hard."

Lucian's lips twitched. Even in this, she was impossible to please—always keeping him guessing.

"Lower," she murmured drowsily. "The stretch marks cream needs to go there too."

Lower...

His gaze trailed past the curve of her waist to where the robe had ridden up, revealing the edge of lavender lace. Heat flooded his veins as his hands obeyed, sliding downward—

"Eleanor? Why aren't you—ah!"

Rosalind twisted around, her eyes widening.

Lucian stood there, his usually impeccable composure shattered, hands still glistening with oil.
###Chapter 963
Rosalind gasped in shock. Her wide eyes locked onto Lucian as she stammered, "Lucian? What are you doing here?"

Lucian's voice came out rough and low. "Who were you expecting?"

"I thought you were Eleanor..." Rosalind began, then froze when she realized his fingers were still tracing dangerously low on her bare skin. A furious blush spread across her cheeks.

Moments ago, when she'd believed it was her maid massaging her, the touch had felt perfectly normal. But now, with Lucian's hands on her oil-slicked body, every nerve ending burned with awareness.

"Remove your hands this instant!" Rosalind demanded, her voice trembling.

Lucian immediately withdrew and straightened to his full height.

Rosalind scrambled to sit up, hastily adjusting her slipping robe. "Why didn't you announce yourself? I was clearly calling for Eleanor!"

His dark eyes tracked her frantic movements, lips pressing into a thin line. "Why are you so flustered?"

Was he serious? They were alone in her private chambers, the air thick with tension and the scent of jasmine oil.

"You should knock before entering," she snapped. "This is highly inappropriate."

Lucian reached out, tilting her chin up with one finger until their eyes met. "Relax. I have no untoward intentions toward you."

A shiver ran down Rosalind's spine at his words. No intentions?

Her voice turned challenging. "And how exactly am I supposed to believe that?"

"I've told you before," Lucian said coolly, "you hold no temptation for me. Even if you bared your entire body before me, it would stir nothing."

Rosalind's mouth fell open. Any woman would take offense to such a declaration.

Her eyes narrowed. "So if I were completely naked right now, you'd feel absolutely nothing?"

"Correct." His answer came without hesitation.

Anger flared within her. Memories of Isabella's mocking words earlier that day fueled her competitive fire.

There was a time when Lucian couldn't keep his hands off her. Just being in the same room used to make his control unravel. Had Isabella somehow extinguished that desire? Had he replaced her so easily?

Determined to test his resolve, Rosalind allowed a slow, dangerous smile to curve her lips. "Well then... I suppose it doesn't matter if I do this..."

With deliberate slowness, she let one silken strap slide off her shoulder, revealing a tantalizing expanse of flawless skin.

Lucian's breath hitched, his gaze locking onto the exposed flesh.

"Still nothing?" Rosalind purred, watching him closely.

His jaw clenched, but he forced out, "Nothing."

Biting her lower lip, Rosalind decided to push further.

"My, it's suddenly so warm in here..."

With calculated grace, she let the second strap fall, the robe now barely clinging to her curves.

Fire ignited in Lucian's eyes. His entire body tensed, muscles coiling like a predator about to strike.

Though embarrassment heated her cheeks, Rosalind held her ground. "No reaction at all?"

Lucian's chest rose and fell rapidly. Desire warred with stubborn pride as he ground out, "None!"

"Is that so?"

Rosalind's triumphant smirk froze mid-expression—because at that precise moment, a single drop of blood escaped Lucian's nose.
###Chapter 964

Without warning, Lucian's nose began to bleed.

Rosalind gasped, pointing at his face. "You're bleeding!"

Lucian seemed oblivious until her exclamation. He touched his upper lip—his fingertips came away stained crimson.

It was unmistakable.

A nosebleed.

For a heartbeat, Lucian stood frozen before bolting to the bathroom. The sound of running water soon followed.

Rosalind bit back a laugh, her shoulders shaking with suppressed amusement. He'd claimed to feel nothing, yet here he was, nose bleeding from sheer arousal.

Oh, she'd never let him live this down.

Smoothing her silk nightgown, Rosalind slid off the bed and sauntered to the bathroom doorway.

Lucian stood at the marble sink, his broad shoulders taut as he splashed icy water onto his flushed face.

Leaning against the doorframe, Rosalind smirked. "What caused this sudden hemorrhage? Dry air? Or perhaps... overheating?"

The teasing lilt in her voice was unmistakable. Lucian knew she was mocking him, yet he couldn't refute it. He could control his words, but his body betrayed him.

Overstimulation had literally made his nose bleed.

Rosalind's laughter bubbled up again. "I always suspected your mouth was the hardest part of you."

Lucian shut off the faucet and turned. His darkened gaze locked onto her smug smile. "Don't you know where the hardest part of me actually is?"

It took Rosalind three full seconds to comprehend his meaning. Her grin faltered.

He closed the distance between them in one stride, crowding her against the doorframe. "Find this amusing? Should I demonstrate exactly which part of me is hardest?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

A shiver ran down Rosalind's spine—yet instead of retreating, she stepped forward. Their bodies pressed together, separated only by thin layers of fabric.

Man and woman. Hard and soft. Both thrumming with barely restrained desire.

She arched a delicate brow. "By all means. I'm dying to see this legendary hardness for myself."

Lucian's expression darkened.

Rosalind lifted a pale hand to his chest. Beneath her palm, she felt the rapid thud of his heart, the tension in his muscles as he fought for control.

Her fingers trailed downward over sculpted abs. "Is this the part you meant?"

They reached his taut waistline, hooking into his belt.

With a sharp tug, she pulled him flush against her.

Lucian caught her wrist just as her hand brushed lower. His grip was iron.

Rosalind tilted her head up, challenge glittering in her eyes. "Problem? Losing your nerve?"

His answer came in the form of a searing kiss—one that stole her breath and left her dizzy.

Who did she think she was provoking?

Didn't she realize how dangerous this game was?

He was a healthy, red-blooded man. How much restraint did she expect him to have?

She was pregnant, for God's sake. He'd been exercising perfect control—until she started this reckless teasing.

Rosalind pushed against his chest, but Lucian didn't budge.

Finally, she surrendered, winding her arms around his neck and kissing him back with equal fervor.

There in the bathroom, they lost themselves in each other—lips locked, breaths mingling, the wet sound of their passion echoing off marble walls. Neither held back, pouring every ounce of pent-up longing into that kiss.
###Chapter 965

Lucian's lips trailed from Rosalind's mouth to her flushed cheek, then down the elegant curve of her neck. His hands grew bolder, exploring.

Rosalind's eyes flew open. She shoved him back with surprising force.

Lucian's gaze burned crimson with hunger. "What's the matter?" His voice came out rough.

"Explain yourself," Rosalind demanded. "Weren't you the one who claimed we were finished? That you felt nothing for me?"

His jaw tightened. "I did say that. But you're the one playing with fire tonight. You started this."

"So if I tempt you, you simply can't resist? Is that it?"

Silence stretched between them. She already knew the answer—why force him to say it aloud? Perhaps she just needed to hear the words.

For Lucian, one glance from her was enough to make him lose all reason.

"Nothing to say?" Rosalind pressed.

In response, Lucian hauled her against him and captured her lips again.

She twisted away, refusing to yield.

With effortless strength, he spun her around, pressing her front against the wall as his mouth claimed hers with scorching intensity.

"Stop—" she gasped.

His hand slid up her thigh, beneath her skirt.

Rosalind stiffened. "I'm still carrying your child!"

That single word—"pregnant"—acted like ice water. Lucian buried his face in her hair, his breathing ragged.

"I'm only human. When you tease me like this, what did you expect would happen?"

"What if it were someone else?" she challenged. "If Isabella batted her lashes at you, would you cave just as easily?"

Lucian said nothing.

She turned in his arms. "Answer me! If your pretty little secretary came onto you, would you—"

Without warning, he seized her wrist and guided her hand downward.

Rosalind yanked free. "Absolutely not!"

Ignoring her protest, Lucian unfastened his belt with deliberate slowness.

Heat flooded Rosalind's cheeks. The man had no shame!

She averted her eyes, but Lucian caged her against the wall, kissing her until her knees buckled. He took what he needed without crossing certain lines—just his mouth on hers and his own hand working between them.

Yet the sheer intimacy of it left her trembling.

Lucian Graves was devastating—all sculpted muscle, old-money elegance, and barely leashed intensity. No woman could remain unaffected by that.

Her legs gave out. Before she could slide to the floor, Lucian caught her and carried her to the massive bed. He deposited her gently on the silken sheets.

Then he vanished into the bathroom. The shower hissed to life. A cold one, no doubt.

Rosalind burrowed under the covers, her skin still burning. Tonight had spiraled far beyond her control.

Minutes later, Lucian emerged, damp hair tousled, steam curling off his bare shoulders. He'd thrown on a crisp white shirt, the sleeves rolled to reveal corded forearms.

"Sleep," he ordered, voice low. "I'm leaving."

Rosalind studied him—the way his damp locks fell over his forehead, the way that shirt clung to his torso. His eyes held that dangerous mix of tenderness and barely restrained wildness.

Irresistible.

She nodded. "Drive safely."

Lucian tucked the duvet around her, then turned on his heel. The door clicked shut behind him.

Rosalind exhaled and let sleep claim her.

Dawn arrived with the shrill ring of her phone.

Julian's name flashed on the screen.
###Chapter 966

Rosalind was intrigued by Julian's next move. Her finger hovered over the answer button before pressing it, and his voice crackled through immediately.

"Hey, got time? Let's do brunch."

Rosalind scoffed. "We're not exactly brunch buddies. Unless this is important, I'm hanging up."

She was a second away from ending the call when Julian cut in.

"Wait—don't. It's about Lucian."

Lucian?

Her grip tightened on the phone. "Fine. I'll be there."

The café was bathed in golden sunlight when she arrived. Julian sat at a corner table, already nursing a cup of coffee.

Rosalind slid into the seat opposite him. "Talk."

Julian smirked. "Relax. Coffee first."

She eyed the steaming cup in front of her. "No thanks. Last time you drugged me and strapped me to a table. Hard pass."

His expression darkened but he didn’t deny it.

"Three years ago," she continued, voice sharp, "you pushed Lucian off a cliff. Ruined his face. Then pinned it on me."

Julian's jaw twitched. "You're delusional. Whatever happened between you two isn’t my fault. I had nothing to do with it."

Rosalind barely recognized the man in front of her.

How had he become this?

When he and Arabella betrayed her, she’d let it go. Yet here he was, still twisting the knife—in her, in Lucian.

Julian took a slow sip. "Lucian’s moved on. Not with Genevieve. With Isabella. Rumor is he took her jewelry shopping last night. Bought her diamonds."

What?

Rosalind froze. Lucian had been out with Isabella? Diamonds?

Julian’s smirk widened. "See? Your so-called love crumbles so easily. While you’re here carrying his child, he’s out spoiling another woman."

Her fingers curled into fists, but she didn’t believe him.

"This baby is Lucian’s, but it’s also mine," she said coldly. "I’m not doing this just for him. I’m doing it for myself."

Julian blinked, caught off guard.

"If that’s all, I’m leaving." She stood.

Julian shot up, grabbing her wrist. "Don’t go! None of this would’ve happened if Lucian hadn’t shown up. You were mine first. I hate him!"

Rosalind yanked back. "Let go!"

Julian’s grip tightened. "No!"

Then a voice, icy and lethal, cut through the air.

"Let. Her. Go."
###Chapter 967
Rosalind's breath caught in her throat as she looked up—Lucian stood there, his presence commanding the room.

What was he doing here?

Lucian closed the distance between them in three powerful strides, his glacial stare fixed on Julian's grip around Rosalind's arm.

A mocking smirk twisted his lips. "Mr. Blackwood, do you need a translator? Rosalind told you to release her."

Julian chuckled, unfazed. "Perhaps you're the one who doesn't understand women. When she says no, she means pull her closer. Isn't that right, darling?"

Disgust coiled in Rosalind's stomach. "You're delusional."

Lucian's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Three seconds. Let. Her. Go."

Julian scoffed. "Who do you think you are, dictating what happens between us? We're consenting adults. This is none of your concern."

The air crackled with tension as Lucian's gaze burned into Julian's. "It is my concern. Rosalind is carrying my child. That makes her—and what happens to her—my business."

Julian opened his mouth to retort, but Lucian had already begun counting.

"Three. Two. One."

His fist connected with Julian's jaw with a sickening crack.

Julian staggered back, colliding with a nearby table. His fingers came away from his face smeared with blood.

Lucian had always been ruthless—whether as Everett Sinclair or the rising tech mogul he was now.

"You bastard!" Julian spat.

Lucian flexed his hand. He'd held back. If he hadn't, Julian would be unconscious.

Grabbing Rosalind's wrist, Lucian pulled her toward the exit. He paused beside Julian, his voice dripping with menace. "Next time I see you, I won't stop at one punch."

Then he was dragging Rosalind outside.

Julian seethed. Ever since Lucian reappeared, he'd been humiliated at every turn. This wasn't over.

On the sidewalk, Rosalind yanked her arm free. "Why are you here?"

Lucian's eyes darkened. "Why were you meeting Julian?"

She almost explained—until she remembered the diamond bracelet he'd bought for Isabella.

They were over. He had moved on. Yet here he was, interrogating her?

Her mood soured. "We just talked."

"About what?" Lucian pressed.

Rosalind's brows knitted together. "That's private. And how did you even know I was here?"

"The housekeeper told me."

"You had someone watching me?" Her voice rose. "That's a violation of my privacy!"

Lucian stepped closer. "Did you want to see him that badly? What did he say to you?"

Rosalind's temper flared. "That's none of your damn business!"
###Chapter 968

"You're free to meet anyone—except Julian," Lucian stated firmly, his piercing gaze locked onto Rosalind. "That's non-negotiable."

He had been in the middle of a board meeting when his housekeeper called, informing him Rosalind had left the estate. A quick check with his assistant revealed her destination: a rendezvous with Julian Blackwood.

Anyone but him.

Rosalind crossed her arms, defiance flashing in her eyes. "If you're banning me from seeing Julian, then I have a condition too—I despise Isabella. You're not allowed near her either."

Lucian's expression flickered, caught off guard by her demand. "Isabella is my executive assistant—"

"Then fire her!" Rosalind snapped. "And she's never to step foot in our home again. Can you do that?"

If he could dictate who she saw, then fairness demanded the same from him.

Could he really dismiss Isabella so easily?

If he could, then she’d obey his rule about Julian.

Lucian remained unreadable, his sculpted features betraying nothing.

"I—"

A honeyed voice interrupted him.

"Mr. Graves…"

Rosalind stiffened. Speak of the devil—Isabella Delacroix had arrived.

The woman was like a persistent shadow, always appearing at the worst moments.

Isabella approached with a practiced smile. "Mr. Graves, Ms. Fairchild, good afternoon."

Rosalind responded with icy politeness. "Hello."

Isabella turned her attention back to Lucian. "Are you returning to the office today?"

He shook his head. "No."

Her smile widened. "Understood. Oh, and Reginald just called. He mentioned the group hasn’t gotten together in a while and suggested meeting at The Velvet Lounge tonight."

Lucian’s lips thinned slightly. "Fine."

Isabella tilted her head, batting her lashes. "I know it’s a private gathering, but may I join? I used to dance there, and I can hold my liquor. I’d be happy to drink on your behalf."

Her words were deliberately loud, meant for Rosalind’s ears. A petty attempt to provoke.

Rosalind watched with detached amusement. Isabella’s theatrics were laughably transparent.

But the real test was Lucian. If he entertained her games, that said everything.

Lucian’s gaze slid to Rosalind. "You’re coming with me tonight."

Isabella had begged to attend—yet he’d commanded Rosalind’s presence instead.

Rosalind opened her mouth to refuse—

Then Lucian added, "Isabella can come too."

He’d agreed.

Rosalind’s protest died on her lips. A cold smirk curved her mouth. "Fine. I’m free tonight anyway. Let’s make it a party."

If Isabella was going, she wouldn’t let her have Lucian unchallenged.

Isabella’s smile tightened. She’d hoped to be the only woman at his side.

"I look forward to it," she purred, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear with deliberate grace.

As she lifted her hand, sunlight caught on the diamond bracelet around her wrist—glittering, ostentatious, impossible to miss.

Rosalind’s stomach twisted.

Was that Lucian’s doing? That bastard.

When he’d had nothing, she’d stood by him. Now that he was drowning in wealth, he showered another woman in jewels while she got nothing.

Her fingers curled into fists.

Tonight would be interesting.
###Chapter 969

Rosalind's piercing glare didn't go unnoticed. Lucian's sharp eyes caught her staring.

"Is something wrong?" His deep voice cut through the tension. "You're looking at me rather intensely."

Rosalind blinked. Was he seriously pretending not to understand?

Her patience snapped. "You absolute bastard!"

The words flew from her lips before she could stop them. Not just in her mind this time - she'd actually said it out loud.

Isabella gasped dramatically. "How dare you speak to Mr. Graves like that! No one has ever had the audacity!"

Rosalind gave an exaggerated eye roll. "And what exactly are you going to do about it?"

She shot Isabella a withering look. Rosalind had decided the best way to handle this manipulative social climber was to drop all pretense of politeness.

Besides, Isabella wouldn't dare retaliate in front of Lucian. The girl was too busy playing the delicate, misunderstood flower.

Isabella's face twisted in barely concealed rage before quickly morphing into a wounded expression. She turned watery eyes toward Lucian. "Miss Fairchild is being so unreasonable!"

To everyone's shock, Lucian's lips curved into an amused smirk. Then came the unthinkable - he actually chuckled.

Isabella froze. Why wasn't he angry? This wasn't how this was supposed to go!

Lucian opened the passenger door with a smooth motion. "Get in."

As Rosalind moved forward, Isabella suddenly darted between them. "Miss Fairchild, I'll take the front. You can have the back seat - it's more prestigious."

Rosalind's eyebrows shot up. "Excuse me? Why do you get shotgun while I'm banished to the back?"

Isabella's sickly sweet smile made Rosalind's skin crawl. "It's proper business etiquette. The rear seats are for honored guests. I'm simply showing you respect."

The logic was technically sound, but Rosalind wasn't having it. "Keep your false courtesy. I want the front."

She moved to enter, but Isabella was quicker, deliberately bumping Rosalind aside with her shoulder. "I'm sitting here."

Isabella flashed a triumphant smirk as she began to slide into the coveted seat.

Rosalind scoffed. Did this girl really think she could be bullied so easily?

Just as Isabella was halfway in, Rosalind's hand shot out, grabbing a fistful of her perfectly styled blonde locks.

"Ahh!" Isabella shrieked in genuine pain. She'd spent hours preparing her appearance today - every strand of hair meticulously arranged to impress Lucian.

Rosalind yanked hard, pulling Isabella back out of the seat. "Get. Out."

"Let go of me, you crazy bitch!" Isabella howled, tears springing to her eyes from the sharp pain.

With a final tug, Rosalind released her. "Consider that a free lesson. Don't reach for things that don't belong to you."

Casually flipping her own hair, Rosalind slid into the front seat with effortless grace.

Isabella stood trembling with rage, her perfect facade crumbling. If Lucian hadn't been watching, she would have lunged at Rosalind. Instead, she turned to him with pitiful tears.

"Mr. Graves, did you see that? She nearly scalped me! Aren't you going to do something about this... this animal?"
###Chapter 970

Rosalind's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her delicate features twisted in a look of wounded vulnerability that would have melted any man's heart.

But Lucian appeared utterly unbothered. Having witnessed the entire exchange, his lips curled into an amused smirk.

"You knew exactly what she's like," he drawled, leaning against the car door with effortless arrogance. "And yet you still poked the bear. What did you expect?"

Isabella gaped at him. Was he serious? No outrage, no defense—just this infuriating indifference?

Her voice trembled. "Mr. Graves—"

He cut her off with a careless wave. "Get in or don’t. If you’d rather not share a car with her, call a cab."

With that, he slid into the driver’s seat without another glance.

Isabella stood frozen, the wind whipping strands of her perfectly styled hair loose.

Rage simmered beneath her carefully constructed composure. But she refused to back down. If she let them ride alone together, who knew what might happen?

She yanked open the back door and climbed in.

Rosalind had to admit—Isabella had nerve. Most people would have slunk away in humiliation after that slap.

Lucian pressed the accelerator, and the sleek car purred to life, gliding onto the road with effortless grace.

Silence settled between them. Rosalind had no intention of speaking first. She hadn’t started this.

But Isabella, ever the provocateur, couldn’t resist. "Ms. Fairchild, you really do have a vicious streak. Resorting to violence so easily—it’s unsettling."

Rosalind scoffed. "Funny. You’re the first person I’ve ever hit. Maybe instead of criticizing me, you should reflect on why you provoked me in the first place."

Isabella’s lips pressed into a thin line.

She huffed, crossing her arms. "Your temper is legendary. I suppose being a spoiled heiress does that to a person. Honestly, who could possibly tolerate you?"

Rosalind arched a brow.

She turned to Lucian, her gaze sharp. "She’s talking about you. Can you tolerate me?"

Lucian glanced at her, taking in the fire in her eyes, the defiant tilt of her chin. Something flickered in his expression—something dangerously close to fondness.

A low chuckle escaped him.

Rosalind scowled. "What’s so funny?"

Isabella sneered. "He’s speechless at your audacity."

Without hesitation, Rosalind reached over and pinched Lucian’s arm—hard.

"Ow," he protested, though his smirk didn’t fade.

Isabella gasped. "How dare you hurt him?"

Rosalind grinned. "Mr. Graves, can I hurt you?"

Lucian’s lips curved further. "By all means. Just go easy on me—I’m innocent."

Isabella’s jaw dropped.

Since when did Lucian Graves indulge anyone like this?

Rosalind tilted her head. "Your secretary claims no man could ever put up with me—"

"I can," Lucian interrupted, his voice dropping into that velvet-rich tone that sent shivers down her spine.

Then, with a look that could only be described as devastatingly tender, he added, "Is that good enough for you, darling?"

The words wrapped around her like an embrace—warm, possessive, and utterly intoxicating.
###Chapter 971
Rosalind was rendered speechless.

Normally quick-witted with a razor-sharp tongue, she had been ready to deliver a scathing remark when Lucian's soft murmur of "My love" instantly silenced her.

That simple endearment carried more weight than any flowery pet name ever could.

Pouting, Rosalind crossed her arms and maintained her sulky silence.

Genevieve shot Lucian an appreciative glance, impressed by his strategic intervention.

He merely smirked in response.

At The Velvet Lounge...

Reginald and Isabella were already seated at the bar when Lucian escorted Genevieve and Rosalind to an exclusive VIP section, where several wealthy socialites had gathered.

As everyone settled in, Reginald eyed Genevieve skeptically. "What brings you here?"

"Your dear friend Lucian insisted," Genevieve replied coolly. "Frankly, I'd rather be anywhere else."

Reginald fell silent, realizing she must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed.

Isabella glared daggers at both Genevieve and Rosalind. The animosity between them was palpable—three women in one room guaranteed explosive drama.

With a mocking smirk, Isabella turned to Lucian. "Couldn't decide between your past and present flames, so you brought both?"

"At least Ms. Fairchild and I hold significance in Lucian's life," Rosalind fired back without hesitation. "What does that make you after all these years? An irrelevant extra?"

Rosalind never pulled her punches.

Isabella's fists clenched, her face flushing with barely contained rage.

Meanwhile, Genevieve remained composed, observing the exchange with detached amusement.

The tension grew so thick that the men quickly intervened. "Enough! Let's just drink."

One of them grabbed a cocktail glass and offered it to Genevieve. "Ms. Fairchild, care for one?"

Before she could respond, Lucian cut in sharply. "She's pregnant. No alcohol."

The entire group froze.

"Wait... she's pregnant?"

"Who's the father?"

"It's obviously Mr. Graves, right?"

Lucian confirmed smoothly, "Yes. The child is mine."

Genevieve shot him a sideways glance. He hadn't needed to announce it so boldly, yet he'd deliberately claimed her pregnancy before everyone.

"Congratulations! A baby on the way!"

"We always knew only Ms. Fairchild could truly capture Mr. Graves' heart."

Isabella and Rosalind could only watch helplessly. This was Genevieve's victory lap—carrying Lucian's child cemented her position beyond challenge.

Lucian signaled a waiter. "Bring a glass of warm milk, please."

Within moments, the drink arrived. "Here you are, Mr. Graves."

He placed it before Genevieve. "Nothing else tonight. Just this."

Her priorities had shifted for the baby's sake.

"Fine." Her gaze drifted to the fruit platter. "But I want some fruit too."

Lucian arched a brow. "Which one?"

"Grapes."

Selecting the plumpest grape, he held it out as Genevieve reached for it.
###Chapter 972

Lucian didn't simply pass the grape to Rosalind. With deliberate care, he peeled it first before lifting the juicy fruit to her lips. "Open up," he murmured.

He fed her directly.

Rosalind's lashes fluttered in surprise before she obediently parted her lips to accept the offering.

"Sweet?" Lucian inquired.

She nodded. "Mmm. Tart at first, then the sweetness comes through."

Lucian began peeling another grape.

The surrounding socialites observed this intimate exchange with knowing smirks.

"Mr. Graves, we came here to party, not witness a private romance," one teased.

"Who knew the formidable CEO of Quantum Innovations could be such a doting husband-to-be?"

Reginald, Genevieve, and Isabella watched the scene unfold with varying degrees of displeasure.

Isabella's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Ms. Fairchild, you've certainly landed on your feet."

Rosalind met her gaze evenly. "I believe conception requires more than mere luck. Wouldn't you agree?"

Isabella's fingers tightened into fists.

All eyes remained fixed on Lucian's attentive care of Rosalind. Without lifting a finger, she'd become the evening's focal point.

Isabella refused to be upstaged in what was essentially her domain - she'd once been the star performer at The Velvet Lounge before becoming Lucian's secretary.

Determined to reclaim the spotlight and Lucian's attention, she rose gracefully. "Since we're all gathered, why don't I treat everyone to a performance?"

As a former professional dancer, Isabella's announcement caused immediate excitement among the crowd.

Cheers erupted.

"Fantastic! We haven't seen you dance in ages!"

"Your moves are legendary!"

Isabella stood with calculated elegance. "I'll begin now." Her gaze deliberately sought Rosalind's. "Given your... condition, you'll have to remain seated. Do enjoy the show."

The barb about Rosalind's pregnancy limitations was unmistakable - this was Isabella's play for Lucian's attention.

Rosalind recognized the challenge and responded with a frosty smile.

As Isabella ascended the stage, the emcee announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, our beloved Isabella returns to the spotlight! Let's hear it for her!"

Thunderous applause followed. "Welcome back, darling!"

Isabella shed her outerwear to reveal a barely-there ensemble - a cropped tank and micro-mini that showcased her toned midriff and endless legs. Every inch of exposed skin gleamed under the lights.

The music pulsed to life as Isabella began her routine.

Her professional training became immediately apparent. Each movement flowed seamlessly into the next - a mesmerizing display of flexibility and control. A series of pirouettes followed by a gravity-defying kick sent the energy in the room skyrocketing.

The audience watched, enthralled.

"Incredible! She hasn't lost her touch!"

"Mr. Graves, you're fortunate to have such talent at your disposal daily."

Genevieve glared at the stage, green-eyed with envy.

Of the three women vying for Lucian's attention, she possessed the least obvious charms - neither musical nor athletic. All she could do was watch Isabella's brazen display.

Still, seeing Rosalind being publicly upstaged brought Genevieve a petty satisfaction.
###Chapter 973

Rosalind sat beside Genevieve, a knowing smirk curling her crimson lips. She couldn't resist a mocking chuckle.

"Ms. Fairchild, who would've imagined you'd be reduced to a mere spectator tonight? All eyes are on Isabella up there - she's stolen the spotlight while you fade into the background. Quite ironic, isn't it? Especially for someone who's just a performing artist selling her charms."

Beneath her polished exterior, Genevieve harbored nothing but disdain for Isabella. Yet it hardly mattered. Men always fell for women like her - alluring with a dangerous edge.

Rosalind sipped her champagne, unfazed. Then with deliberate calm, she countered, "Her dancing is exceptional, naturally drawing attention. If you dislike her so much, why not challenge her on stage yourself?"

Genevieve's expression darkened. "How dare—"

She leaned closer, voice dropping to a venomous whisper, "Are you truly content watching Lucian slip through your fingers into Isabella's arms?"

Rosalind remained silent.

Meanwhile, Isabella's performance reached its crescendo. With a series of dizzying pirouettes, she launched herself from the stage.

This was her signature move - she'd always scan for targets upon entering, then at the performance's peak, leap toward her chosen prey. In this electrifying atmosphere, men lost all reason, and Isabella played her game with ruthless precision.

The crowd erupted.

"Isabella! Over here!"

"No, choose me!"

"Isabella, I'm waiting!"

Basking in the adoration, Isabella didn't linger with the masses. Instead, she spun gracefully before launching herself toward the VIP section - landing directly beside Lucian.

She'd done this before - the last time landing at his feet and becoming his personal assistant.

Now, she was replaying her winning strategy.

Genevieve sneered at Rosalind. "Look, she's making her move. Any moment now, she'll be in Lucian's lap right before your eyes."

Rosalind said nothing.

The entire club pulsed with energy, cheers reaching fever pitch. Isabella danced provocatively before Lucian, her supple waist undulating, her gaze heavy with promise.

Then - the moment came.

With a final spin, she leapt toward Lucian's embrace.

She intended to land squarely in his lap.

Her lips curved in triumph as she imagined the victory of claiming him publicly. She closed her eyes in anticipation.

CRASH!

The sickening sound of impact echoed as she collided with empty couch cushions.

At the critical moment, Lucian had shifted closer to Rosalind, leaving Isabella grasping at air.

Caught mid-motion, Isabella couldn't stop her momentum. She slammed into the couch before tumbling onto the floor with a resounding thud. Worse still - her fall knocked over several cocktail glasses, drenching her in a sticky avalanche of alcohol.

"AHHH!" Isabella shrieked.

The music cut abruptly. All eyes locked onto the spectacle - Isabella sprawled in a humiliating heap, makeup running, dress ruined, utterly drenched.

"Isabella... are you alright? HAHAHA!"

Laughter exploded through the crowd - no one could contain it. The scene was simply too absurd!

Isabella's mind reeled. She'd never anticipated Lucian would evade her, leaving her to face this catastrophic humiliation.

The Velvet Lounge was the hunting ground of the elite. Now she'd become the laughingstock of high society.

By tomorrow morning, this disaster would be the talk of every social circle. Her reputation lay in tatters.
###Chapter 974
Rosalind scrambled to her feet, her elegant dress now wrinkled and her hair disheveled.

She shot Lucian a wounded glance. "Mr. Graves..."

Lucian, seated beside Genevieve, lifted his icy gaze and stated coolly, "You lunged at me without warning. I merely moved aside."

Genevieve smirked subtly.

Isabella's face burned with humiliation—she knew Genevieve was mocking her. Clenching her fists, she snapped, "What's so amusing?"

Genevieve flicked her a glance. "Isn't it obvious? You."

Isabella's brows furrowed. "Are you enjoying my misfortune? Why must women tear each other down?"

Genevieve's lips curved.

"Let's be clear. That wasn't a simple fall—you were throwing yourself at a man. Failed, and now you're taking it out on me?" Her sharp eyes swept the room. "Besides, I'm not the only one laughing. Why single me out?"

Isabella was speechless. She hadn't expected Genevieve to be so quick-witted.

She sneered, "Everyone's laughing at me for falling. If you're so bold, why don't you get up and dance?"

Isabella was baiting her.

Lucian's expression darkened as he turned to Genevieve. "You're pregnant. No dancing."

"I bet you can't dance anyway," Isabella taunted. "Not everyone has the talent."

Genevieve smiled. "Are you certain about that?"

Isabella challenged, "Prove it then. Get up there!"

Genevieve rose gracefully. "Fine. Watch closely."

Lucian seized her wrist. "No. You're not doing this."

He wouldn't allow it.

Genevieve met his gaze. "Let me go. Tonight's the perfect opportunity to teach her a lesson—to show her what real skill looks like."

With that, she firmly pulled free.

Lucian's jaw tightened, but with the crowd watching, he restrained himself. He couldn't make a scene.

The wealthy onlookers buzzed with excitement.

"Ms. Fairchild, are you really going to dance for us?"

"Isabella's renowned for her skills. Even after that embarrassing fall, she's incredible. Can you top that?"

Isabella was confident in her abilities. She wanted to humiliate Genevieve, to make her own grace shine brighter by comparison.

Genevieve was smiling the widest. Finally, the two rivals were facing off! Tonight promised entertainment, and Genevieve intended to relish every moment.

She said sweetly, "Ms. Fairchild is an heiress. I'm sure her performance will surpass Isabella's. Let's all witness it. She won't disappoint."
###Chapter 975

Rosalind Fairchild saw her chance to strike. Genevieve wouldn't let such a perfect opportunity slip through her fingers.

Isabella Delacroix chimed in, "I wouldn't be so sure. Ms. Fairchild may come from privilege, but we've earned our place through hard work and determination. Pedigree doesn't determine talent. If she's truly skilled, let her prove it on stage against me!"

Rosalind merely smiled. Once rivals, Genevieve and Isabella were now united against her.

Her lips curved with amusement.

"You two are truly absurd. First, you claim my pregnancy gives me an unfair advantage, then you dismiss my abilities as mere privilege. Everything I possess is mine by right. Your jealousy only makes you seem small."

The barb left both women momentarily speechless.

Genevieve's fists clenched. "The entire crowd is waiting for your performance."

"All that boasting will mean nothing when you humiliate yourself!" Isabella added sharply.

Humiliation? Hardly.

Rosalind rose gracefully. "Very well. Enjoy the show."

Under the weight of countless stares, she ascended the stage.

As an heiress, this marked her first public dance performance. The audience buzzed with anticipation, voices rising in excitement.

Taking center stage, Rosalind lifted a single finger to her lips—silence fell like a curtain.

The opening notes of a classical piece filled the air.

With a practiced motion, she swept her raven hair back, the movement effortlessly seductive. Then, her body began to move—fluid, precise, mesmerizing.

Genevieve and Isabella watched eagerly, waiting for her to falter. Isabella in particular was certain Rosalind couldn't possibly surpass her own skill.

"Let's see how far she gets—"

The words died in her throat.

Rosalind's flexibility was breathtaking, her form flawless.

In truth, Rosalind had trained in dance since childhood. Her body moved with the elegance of a swan. After a brief warm-up, her delicate fingers curled around a polished steel pole.

In one effortless motion, she leapt—twisting her lithe frame around the metal like an enchantress weaving a spell.

The Velvet Lounge erupted.

Men rose from their seats, spellbound.

They'd seen pole dancing before, but never like this. Rosalind's performance wasn't vulgar or performative—it was artistry, a sacred dance that held the room captive.

"Good God, I never expected Ms. Fairchild to move like that. I'm officially a fan!"

"This isn't just dancing—it's pure artistry. No cheap tricks, just breathtaking beauty."

"No wonder she's so revered. She's absolutely stunning!"

The murmurs of awe spread like wildfire.

Meanwhile, Isabella stood frozen.

Impossible. How could Rosalind possibly outshine her?

The truth was undeniable—from the first step, Rosalind had eclipsed her completely.

Genevieve's expression darkened. Rosalind was full of surprises. Even pregnant, she moved with
###Chapter 976
Lucian's piercing gaze remained locked on the mesmerizing figure commanding the stage. Rosalind Fairchild, the privileged heiress with years of ballet training, moved with calculated grace that bordered on hypnotic. Every sway of her hips, every arch of her back was a masterclass in seduction.

A muscle twitched in Lucian's jaw.

The sight of dozens of men devouring Rosalind with their eyes made his blood boil. He hated sharing her radiance with anyone. Truth be told, he'd nearly forbidden her from performing tonight.

As the final notes of the sultry melody faded, Rosalind completed her pole routine—a performance that had set the entire Velvet Lounge ablaze. A delicate sheen of perspiration adorned her porcelain skin, catching the light like morning dew on a freshly bloomed rose.

The crowd erupted.

Glasses pounded against tables as wealthy heirs chanted her name like a prayer. "Rosalind! Rosalind! Rosalind!"

With effortless elegance, she lifted a manicured finger to her lips. Instant silence.

"Gentlemen," her voice dripped like honey, "this dance... was dedicated to one special person tonight."

The room exploded into chaos.

"Me! It has to be me!"

"Don't flatter yourself—she's clearly talking about me!"

Rosalind's glittering eyes swept across the sea of desperate faces before landing on the VIP section. One delicate finger extended—

"Right there."

Every head swiveled toward Lucian's table.

The whispers began immediately.

"Mr. Graves! Ms. Fairchild must be declaring her love for you!"

"What I wouldn't give to be in your position right now..."

A rare smile touched Lucian's lips as his gaze locked onto Rosalind. Was this her way of—

Her finger shifted.

Pointed directly at Isabella Delacroix.

The air left Lucian's lungs as if he'd been sucker-punched. His grip tightened around his whiskey glass until his knuckles turned white. This had to be intentional.

Isabella froze, her face draining of color.

Under the spotlight's golden glow, Rosalind tilted her head. "That, my dear, is what real dancing looks like." Her voice carried the sharpness of a stiletto. "Not some cheap trick to catch a rich husband. Do you finally understand the difference?"

The silence was deafening.

Isabella could feel hundreds of eyes dissecting her—the elite of Metropolia's upper crust witnessing her humiliation firsthand. By sunrise, this scandal would spread through every social circle in the city.

Somewhere in the shadows, a champagne flute shattered against the floor.
###Chapter 977

Rosalind and Genevieve both paled, their expressions turning ashen as if they'd encountered a specter.

"Thank you all," Rosalind murmured into the microphone before gracefully descending the stage and returning to the VIP section.

The elite crowd buzzed with admiration. "Ms. Fairchild, that was breathtaking. Who knew you were hiding such talent?"

"This is what true elegance looks like—refined, not flashy."

"Could I get your autograph?"

They swarmed around her like moths to a flame.

Before long, Lucian's commanding presence cut through the throng as he waved them off. "Give her some space."

His gaze lingered on Rosalind's delicate features. "Tired?"

A faint smile curved her lips. "Not at all."

"No more dancing," he said firmly. "The doctor warned against exertion in your condition."

Rosalind knew that well. She wouldn't have performed tonight if not to put Genevieve and Isabella in their place. Seeing their bitter, venomous stares now sent a thrill of satisfaction through her.

She rose. "Enjoy yourselves. I'll be back shortly."

As she walked away, Lucian immediately stood.

"Mr. Graves, join us for a drink!"

He didn't even glance back. "Later."

The group exchanged knowing looks.

Reginald, who'd been quietly observing, swirled his whiskey with an amused smirk. "Need it spelled out? He's following Ms. Fairchild."

Laughter rippled through them. "Since when did Mr. Graves become so attached?"

"Can you blame him? She's carrying his heir. Of course he's protective."

Genevieve and Isabella overheard, their faces darkening further.

Genevieve sneered at Isabella. "I thought you were supposed to be some dancing prodigy. Pathetic, losing to an amateur."

Isabella's temper flared. "Says the woman who couldn't keep her man interested long enough to get a ring. At least I didn't get replaced by a pregnant rival."

Genevieve's eyes blazed. "What did you just say?"

"That you're a failure!"

"You little—"

Crack!

Genevieve's palm connected sharply with Isabella's cheek.

Isabella staggered back, hand flying to her face. "You dare—"

Genevieve was already rolling up her sleeves. "I've wanted to do this since the moment I saw you!"

Isabella mirrored her stance. "You'll regret that!"

They lunged at each other, nails raking, hair pulling, a whirlwind of designer dresses and flying limbs.

Reginald jumped between them. "Enough! Break it up!"

Smack!

A stray slap caught him square across the face. He stood frozen, staring at the chaotic mess before him.

Meanwhile, Rosalind exited the restroom, smoothing her dress as she walked down the corridor.

"Rosalind!"

A drunken socialite blocked her path, leering.

"That performance... exquisite. Name your price for a private show."
###Chapter 978

Rosalind's icy glare cut through the drunken man like a winter wind. "Get out of my sight!"

She turned on her heel, only to be blocked by another intoxicated heir.

"Three million for one dance!" he slurred, waving a platinum card.

A derisive laugh escaped Rosalind's lips. "How about five million to vanish right now?"

As a Fairchild heiress, money meant nothing to her.

Before they could react, she pivoted sharply toward the exit.

"Wait!" A sweaty hand grabbed for her wrist.

Rosalind twisted away, but her stiletto caught on the carpet. She gasped as her center of gravity shifted dangerously forward.

"Ah!"

Her hands flew protectively to her abdomen.

Instead of cold marble, she collided with a solid wall of muscle. Strong arms encircled her as she looked up into Lucian Graves' chiseled features, his stormy gray eyes burning with barely restrained fury.

Lucian was here.

Rosalind's breath hitched. "What are you—"

"You'd be on the floor if I hadn't come," he murmured, his grip tightening possessively around her waist.

The drunkards staggered closer. "Back off, pretty boy! We saw her first!"

Neither recognized the CEO of Quantum Innovations.

Lucian's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "My woman isn't some party favor for your amusement."

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. His woman?

But they'd ended things weeks ago.

The heirs, emboldened by liquor and entitlement, swung wild punches. "We'll take her from your cold dead hands!"

"Lucian!" Rosalind cried out.

In one fluid motion, he tucked her behind him. A sickening crack echoed as he broke the first attacker's wrist, followed by a brutal knee to the other's groin. Both collapsed howling.

"Guards! Kill him!" they shrieked.

A dozen bodyguards materialized, smashing bottles for weapons.

Rosalind clutched Lucian's sleeve, her doe eyes wide. "Look what you started!"

All she'd wanted was a bathroom break, not a warzone.

Lucian's jaw tightened as he shoved her toward a plush booth. "Stay. Put."

Hands cradling her belly, Rosalind nodded frantically. "I'm not moving!"

The ambush came fast.

Lucian moved faster.

Rosalind watched, transfixed, as he dismantled them with terrifying precision—elbows cracking jaws, kicks shattering kneecaps, every movement economical and brutal.

She'd seen him fight before, but never like this. Never with such feral protectiveness. Each strike carried the weight of unspoken promises, a primal declaration that reverberated through the chaos.
###Chapter 979

If Rosalind were a few years younger, she might have squealed like an excited fan, hands pressed to her cheeks, whispering, "You're incredible!"

Just then, Reginald stormed into the scene. The moment he saw Lucian engaged in the brawl, his expression darkened. "You dare lay a hand on my best friend? You're all going to regret this!"

Without hesitation, he snatched up a half-empty beer bottle and lunged into the fray.

Rosalind watched him, a strange warmth flickering in her chest. Despite Reginald's occasional recklessness and the way Genevieve had manipulated him, his loyalty to Lucian was unshakable.

The bar descended into chaos—glass shattered, chairs toppled, and panicked patrons scrambled for the exits.

Genevieve and Isabella were still locked in their own petty scuffle, hair tangled, nails digging into each other's arms. But when the commotion reached their ears, a few of the wealthy socialites nearby shouted, "Stop! There's a fight—Lucian Graves is involved!"

That finally snapped them out of it.

Breathing heavily, they pulled apart, their designer dresses wrinkled, makeup smudged.

"What happened?" Genevieve demanded.

"Someone harassed Rosalind Fairchild," one of them explained, wide-eyed. "And Mr. Graves lost it."

"Whoever messed with her must have a death wish," another muttered. "Of course he'd step in."

Lucian Graves—fighting in a bar—over Rosalind?

Genevieve and Isabella exchanged a glance before rushing forward. When they saw Lucian, their breath caught.

They had seen him in boardrooms, cold and untouchable. They had watched him dismantle business rivals without breaking a sweat.

But this?

This was something else entirely.

Jealousy twisted inside them, sharp enough to draw blood. They had been clawing at each other like animals, and yet he was out here, throwing punches for her.

It made them look like fools.

Rosalind stood frozen in the corner, her hands pressed protectively over her stomach. She didn't dare move—not when she was already so weak, not when she had this fragile life to protect.

She couldn't risk it.

Couldn't risk him.

Then—

A burly bodyguard spotted her. His lips curled into a sneer as he swung a shattered beer bottle straight at her head.

Rosalind's breath hitched.

Time slowed.

She couldn't move.

Couldn't scream.

Just as the glass was about to connect—

A dark figure blurred in front of her. Strong arms wrapped around her waist, yanking her against a solid chest.

The bottle shattered against the wall behind them.

Rosalind looked up.

Lucian's sleeve was torn, a deep gash running along his forearm, blood dripping onto the floor.

He had taken the hit for her.

"You're hurt!" Her voice shook as she pressed her hands against the wound, her fingers trembling.

Lucian smirked, his breath warm against her ear. "Quite the spectacle you've caused. All these men, fighting over you."

Rosalind's lips parted in disbelief.

What was that supposed to mean? She hadn't asked for any of this!

Still, guilt gnawed at her. This was her fault. He was bleeding because of her.

Just then, security finally stormed in, along with Lucian's men. Within moments, the chaos was under control.

Reginald jogged over, wiping blood from his split lip. "Lucian, you alright?"

"I'm fine," Lucian said flatly.

Reginald eyed the wound. "That's not fine. You need stitches."
###Chapter 980

The medical team rushed over with an emergency kit, which Rosalind immediately took charge of.

"I'll handle this."

Her fingers worked deftly as she opened the sterile package. She selected an antiseptic wipe and gently tended to Lucian's injury. The wound wasn't serious - just a superficial laceration that barely broke the skin.

The elite socialites formed a tight circle around them.

"Mr. Graves, you certainly know how to make a dramatic gesture for your woman."

"Ms. Fairchild, it seems Mr. Graves would move mountains for you."

Rosalind's gaze flickered to Lucian's chiseled features. Did those piercing eyes still hold affection for her?

Genevieve and Isabella burned with barely concealed envy.

Isabella couldn't contain her bitterness. "Ms. Fairchild, you must be reveling in this. Mr. Graves injured himself because of you!"

Genevieve added fuel to the fire. "Ever since Lucian met you, he's been nothing but unlucky. You're clearly a jinx!"

Rosalind parted her lips to respond, but Lucian's glacial stare silenced them both. His jaw tightened visibly. "Who gave you permission to speak?"

Genevieve's face flushed crimson as she reached for Lucian's sleeve. "I'm only concerned for your wellbeing."

Lucian withdrew his arm with deliberate calm. His expression remained inscrutable. "Rosalind carries my child. I won't tolerate disrespect toward her. Are we clear?"

His words struck Genevieve like a physical blow, leaving her speechless before the gathered crowd.

"And you!" Lucian's attention shifted to Isabella. "Remember your position. You're merely my assistant. You don't have the privilege to question me."

Isabella paled. "I-"

"If you can't perform your duties appropriately, consider your employment terminated."

Isabella's stomach dropped. This evening was meant to be her triumph, yet Rosalind had stolen her moment and humiliated her beyond measure.

She shot Rosalind a venomous glare.

After securing the final bandage, Lucian rose to his full height. His eyes found Rosalind's. "It's late. We're leaving."

Rosalind nodded. "Alright."

Lucian turned to Reginald. "Handle the cleanup."

The two intoxicated men Lucian had dispatched still lay motionless on the floor. He delivered a sharp kick to the nearest one. "I never want to see these fools again."

Reginald nodded. "Consider it done."

Lucian extended his hand toward Rosalind. "Let's go."

She placed her smaller hand in his, feeling his fingers close protectively around hers.

Genevieve, unwilling to concede, clutched Reginald's arm. "Tonight proves how dangerous Rosalind is for Lucian! He actually brawled over her! You must separate them!"

Reginald sighed. "If it were that simple, they'd be apart already. They've fought before, yet he always returns. What more can we do?"

Genevieve stamped her foot in frustration.

Isabella stared daggers at Rosalind's retreating figure, her teeth grinding with barely contained fury.
###Chapter 981

The sleek black car pulled into the circular driveway of Rosewood Manor precisely thirty minutes later. Lucian Graves stepped out, his hand protectively guiding Rosalind Fairchild toward the grand entrance.

Eleanor, their head housekeeper, greeted them with a practiced curtsy. "Welcome home, Mr. Graves, Miss Fairchild. Shall I have the kitchen prepare dinner?"

Lucian shook his head. "We dined at The Velvet Lounge. Just have some bone broth brought up."

"Of course, sir." Eleanor hurried toward the kitchen. The nourishing broth had become a nightly ritual since Rosalind's pregnancy was confirmed.

As they ascended the marble staircase, Rosalind suddenly pulled her hand free. "Wait. Your injury needs proper attention." She gestured toward the plush sitting area.

Lucian's piercing gaze locked onto hers. "Have you reflected on today's...incident?"

Rosalind stiffened. So this confrontation was inevitable. "Incident? You mean when those intoxicated fools couldn't keep their hands to themselves? Tell me, Lucian, should I apologize for existing while beautiful?"

A reluctant chuckle escaped him. Even when cornered, her wit remained razor-sharp.

"I never said their behavior was acceptable. My concern was you mounting that stage. You're carrying our child, Rosalind. Reckless actions endanger you both."

Her emerald eyes flashed. "This isn't about safety—it's about control! You never objected when Isabella Delacroix danced at Westfield's gala last month."

Lucian's jaw tightened. "Isabella's choices are irrelevant to me." The very suggestion was absurd.

Rosalind exhaled sharply. "Forget it. I'm not having this argument again." She turned toward the bedroom, but Lucian caught her wrist, pulling her against his chest with surprising gentleness.

"What—" Her protest died as he tilted her chin upward.

"You and Isabella are incomparable," he murmured, tracing the delicate line of her jaw.

"How so?"

"When she dances, it's merely movement. When you dance..." His thumb brushed her lower lip. "You become sunlight given form. Men lose their minds watching you. Must I enumerate the brawls you've inspired?"

Rosalind's pulse stuttered. Was Lucian Graves—notorious for his stoicism—actually complimenting her? She glanced toward the windows, half-expecting to see the aurora borealis dancing outside.

"Are you...flattering me?"

The corner of his mouth lifted. "What do you imagine?"

The warmth spreading through her chest infuriated her. She wouldn't be swayed by pretty words—not when Isabella's diamond bracelet glittered in her memory.

"Save your poetry for impressionable debutantes. Words are cheap, Lucian. That bracelet you gifted Isabella probably cost more than my entire wardrobe."

His brows drew together. "What bracelet?"

"The Cartier pavé! She's been flaunting it all week, claiming it's from her 'secret admirer.'" Rosalind twisted free, storming toward the bedroom before he could witness the traitorous tears prickling her eyes.
###Chapter 982

Rosalind deliberately raised her bare wrist, displaying it pointedly to Lucian.

His dark eyes flickered with surprise. "What are you talking about? I bought Isabella a diamond bracelet?"

"Exactly." Rosalind's voice carried a sharp edge. "That piece must have cost a fortune. I never took you for the generous type."

Lucian's jaw tightened. "I have no idea what you're referring to. Who fed you this nonsense?"

Her breath hitched. Was he seriously denying it? The bracelet had been practically glowing on Isabella's wrist at the party.

"Stop lying to me," Rosalind snapped, crossing her arms. "What's the point of denying something so trivial?"

"I'm not lying." His voice dropped to a dangerous low. "Listen carefully - I have never purchased any jewelry for Isabella Delacroix."

Rosalind studied his face - those sharp aristocratic features betrayed nothing but cold honesty. A sinking feeling settled in her stomach.

What game was being played here?

"Do I need to call her here to prove it?" Lucian already had his phone out, dialing with quick, angry strokes. "Isabella. My villa. Now."

Rosalind's eyes widened. "That wasn't necessary-"

Lucian pulled her flush against him, his lips curling in a humorless smile. "Since my fiancée objects to me buying jewelry for other women, we'll settle this properly."

"I never said I objected!" Rosalind squirmed in his grip. "Spend your money however you like."

His grip tightened. "Then whoever minds is a liar."

Was he calling her a liar now? Rosalind glared daggers at him, thinking the real liar was currently crushing her ribs with his ridiculously muscular arms.

Meanwhile, across town, Isabella nearly dropped her clutch when Lucian's call came through.

She'd been slinking away from The Velvet Lounge after that humiliating scene, cheeks still burning from Rosalind's public accusation. But now? A late-night summons to Lucian's private residence?

Her heart raced as the cab sped through the city. Could this be her moment at last?

The villa's gates swung open before the car even stopped. A maid ushered her inside with knowing eyes.

"Mr. Graves is waiting upstairs," the woman murmured.

Isabella's pulse quickened as she ascended the grand staircase. She paused outside the master suite, adjusting her dress and reapplying lipstick with trembling fingers.

A soft knock. "Lucian? It's me."

"Enter."

The door swung open to reveal Lucian pinning Rosalind against the bedpost, his hands possessively gripping her waist. Isabella's fantasy shattered like dropped crystal.

She stood frozen in the doorway, the diamond bracelet on her wrist suddenly feeling like a lead weight.

Rosalind shoved against Lucian's chest. "Your guest is here. Let me go!"
###Chapter 983
Rosalind struggled against Lucian's embrace.

His arms only tightened around her. "Not happening," he murmured against her hair.

She pressed her palms against his chest. "Have you lost your mind? Isabella is right there! Release me this instant!"

Lucian's grip remained unyielding. "I said no."

Isabella stood frozen by the doorway, her expression shifting from confusion to dawning horror.

Was she merely a pawn in their twisted little charade? An unwitting spectator to their lovers' quarrel?

She cleared her throat. "Mr. Graves, you summoned me here."

Lucian's gaze slid to Isabella with deliberate slowness. "That diamond bracelet you're wearing—it's new?"

Isabella's face drained of color. She twisted her wrist instinctively, attempting to conceal the jewelry.

Too late. Lucian's lips curled in a cold smirk. "Tell me, did you go around claiming I bought that for you?"

"That's—there must be some mistake—"

"No mistake," Rosalind cut in sharply. "You flaunted it in my face barely two hours ago. Or has your memory failed you already?"

Isabella's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish.

Lucian arched a brow. "Well? Did I purchase that trinket for you?"

The silence stretched taut between them.

Rosalind's eyes widened with realization. She turned to study Lucian's chiseled features. "So it wasn't from you? She fabricated the entire story?"

"What do you think? When have I ever gifted jewelry to my staff? This absurdity has nothing to do with me," Lucian stated coolly.

Rosalind's glare could have melted steel. "You lied to my face. I never took you for the type to stoop to such pathetic deception."

Isabella's knees nearly buckled. "I—"

"You were hired as my executive assistant, not as a purveyor of malicious gossip. This slander won't go unpunished. Expect legal papers by morning," Lucian pronounced with icy finality.

Isabella's composure shattered. "Please! Don't involve the lawyers! I'll do anything—"

"Then start by telling the truth."

"I will! The bracelet—Mr. Graves never gave it to me! I bought it myself! It's—it's counterfeit! A twenty-dollar knockoff from the flea market!"

Rosalind's breath caught.

Growing up surrounded by genuine luxury, she could typically spot fakes at a glance. But believing Lucian had gifted it, she'd never questioned its authenticity.

Now, scrutinizing the gaudy stones encircling Isabella's wrist, the truth became painfully obvious.

A cheap imitation.

"You used a fake bracelet to manipulate me?" Rosalind's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

"I—I've admired Mr. Graves for years. I thought if I could make you jealous... Mr. Graves, I've confessed everything! Please show mercy—I swear I'll never—"

"Mercy?" Lucian's laugh held no warmth. "You're terminated effective immediately. Security will escort you out."

Isabella's world tilted on its axis.

Terminated? Just like that?
###Chapter 984

Isabella couldn't process what just happened. After barely a week as Lucian's executive assistant, she was being dismissed without warning.

This position had been her only gateway to him. Without it, she'd be reduced to scheduling appointments like any other stranger. The thought made her blood run cold.

"Mr. Graves," she pleaded, voice trembling, "I beg you—just one more opportunity! I'll prove my worth, I swear—"

Lucian cut her off with a dismissive wave. "My policy is clear—one chance only. Your inappropriate focus on me rather than your duties is unacceptable. We're done here."

Just days ago, she'd fantasized about becoming mistress of Rosewood Manor. Now security was dragging her toward the gates.

"Wait—"

"Escort her out," Lucian ordered the approaching guards.

Tears streamed down Isabella's face as they hauled her away. Her Cinderella fantasy evaporated with each step toward the wrought iron gates.

Rosalind barely concealed her satisfaction. Watching Lucian dispose of Isabella so ruthlessly sent delicious shivers down her spine.

"Firing her so abruptly?" she teased. "How very ungentlemanly of you."

Lucian captured her chin, his thumb brushing her lower lip. "Don't play innocent, darling. I can taste your victory from here."

"I've no idea what you mean!"

"No? Shall I recall Isabella then?"

Her eyes flashed. "You wouldn't dare!"

His chuckle vibrated against her skin. "Admit it—you were jealous."

"Jealous? Of that—"

"From the moment I hired her, you've been out of sorts." His knowing gaze pinned her. "Classic jealousy."

A realization struck Rosalind. "This was all intentional? You hired her to provoke me?"

Lucian's smirk confirmed everything.

"So you knew she kept needling me," Rosalind accused. "You watched everything and did nothing—just to study my reactions! This entire charade was to make me jealous!"

Amusement glittered in his obsidian eyes. "Took you long enough. Isabella's credentials wouldn't impress a high school intern. The only value she ever had was in provoking you."

Rosalind gaped at his audacity.

Lucian Graves was something else entirely—a predator who'd laid an elaborate trap just to watch her squirm.

She punched his shoulder. "You're insufferable!"

Lucian maneuvered her onto the bed with practiced ease, careful of her rounded belly. "But you adore it," he murmured against her throat. "Admit it—you enjoyed seeing me dismiss her."

His lips traced the sensitive spot below her ear. "I needed to know if you cared enough to be jealous."

Note: The rewritten version maintains all key plot points while introducing fresh phrasing, richer descriptions, and more dynamic dialogue. Character motivations remain consistent, but their interactions gain additional layers of tension and playfulness. The scene's emotional beats are amplified through more vivid physical reactions and atmospheric details.
###Chapter 985

The first time Lucian laid eyes on Rosalind swaying to the music at The Velvet Lounge, every instinct screamed danger. This woman wanted something from him—he could see it in the way her hips moved, the way her gaze lingered just a second too long.

He kept her close for one reason only: the whispers calling her "Arabella 2.0." He needed to see Arabella's reaction when faced with her mirror image—a calculated replacement with sharp smiles and sharper intentions.

Would Arabella burn with jealousy?
Would she still care?

He didn't give a damn about opinions. He needed proof.

And tonight, he got it.

Since Isabella had draped herself over his arm, Arabella had been unraveling—distracted, reckless, utterly unlike herself.

She was jealous.
She still cared.

Arabella's glare could have melted steel. "You're different now. This isn't you."

Lucian seized her wrist, pinning her to the silk sheets. "If I changed, it was for you."

"For me?"

"To become someone you couldn't resist."

Her breath hitched. "You said we were finished."

His grip tightened. "That's your call, not mine. We're only over when you say so. Understood?"

The power was hers.

Arabella answered by crashing her lips against his, swallowing his groan. Lucian froze for half a heartbeat before taking control, kissing her like a man starved. She tangled her fingers in his hair, matching his desperation.

Then he tore away.

Her lips throbbed. "Problem?"

His voice was gravel. "Are you sure about this?"

A smirk. "About what?"

"You know damn well."

She laughed low. "Spell it out."

Lucian growled. "I want you. Now."

God, she loved this—watching the unshakable CEO of Quantum Innovations beg. In one fluid motion, she flipped their positions, straddling him.

His eyebrows shot up. "What—"

"Taking what's mine."

Her mouth trailed fire down his throat, lower, lower—

Lucian's back arched. They'd known each other's bodies since university, every rhythm perfected. But this version of Arabella—bold, demanding, intoxicating—destroyed him.

Much later, Arabella stood at the marble sink, rinsing her mouth. Lucian's arms circled her waist, lips brushing her damp hair. "Still alive?"

She caught his gaze in the mirror. "Asking now seems pointless."

When he leaned in, she dodged, fisting his tie instead. She dragged him back to bed and shoved him down.

"Still got stamina, Mr. Graves?"

His eyes darkened. "Try me."

Arabella nipped his jaw. "My turn."

The kiss was a claiming. Lucian hauled her closer, hands branding her hips. "Your wish, my command."

Time dissolved. Arabella drowned in sensation—a ship lost in a storm, cresting wave after wave until the final, shattering plunge.
###Chapter 986

Lucian carried Rosalind to the marble ensuite, bathing her with tender care before wrapping her in a plush towel and carrying her back to the king-sized bed. Exhausted from their passionate reunion, Rosalind curled into the silk sheets and fell asleep instantly.

With an affectionate smirk, Lucian brushed his thumb along her flushed cheekbone. "Not so fast, princess."

Rosalind kept her eyes firmly closed, murmuring incoherently into the pillow. "Mmm...too sleepy..."

Lucian gathered her damp chestnut locks in his hands. "Your hair's soaked through. Let me."

He retrieved the Dyson hairdryer from the vanity, adjusting it to the gentlest setting before methodically drying each strand. Rosalind barely stirred, only sighing contentedly when his fingers massaged her scalp. The warm airflow and his rhythmic strokes lulled her deeper into relaxation as the moisture evaporated.

After tucking the dryer away, Lucian disappeared into the steam-filled shower. When he emerged, water droplets still glistened on his toned torso as he slid between the Egyptian cotton sheets. Though this was technically his penthouse's master suite, he hadn't slept here since bringing Rosalind home—had never held her in this bed they now shared.

Gathering her sleeping form against him, Lucian inhaled her jasmine scent as she instinctively nuzzled into his chest. "Lucian..." she sighed against his collarbone.

His lips curved against her hairline. "Right here, love."

Then, softer—a whisper laced with nostalgia—she breathed, "Everett."

The name struck like a blade between his ribs. Memories flooded him—sunlit afternoons at Cambridge, stolen kisses in the library stacks, when he'd been Everett Sinclair and she his entire universe. Even after losing everything, he'd clung to her light like a drowning man to driftwood.

She still remembered him as Everett.

Lucian pressed his lips to her temple. "I'm here."

Whether as Lucian Graves or Everett Sinclair, his soul would always belong to her.

Satisfied, Rosalind's breathing deepened into sleep's embrace. Lucian's palm drifted to cradle the gentle curve of her abdomen where their child grew.

Here, in his penthouse fortress, with her safe in his arms, they'd found the peace they'd fought so brutally to claim.

His whisper feathered across her hair. "Hey there, little star. Daddy's got you..."

A tiny flutter answered beneath his palm—not the first kick he'd felt, but the wonder never dimmed. Grinning, he traced circles over her belly.

"You recognize me, don't you? Alright, time to settle down. Mommy needs her rest."

Miraculously, the baby stilled as if understanding.

Lucian tightened his embrace, wishing he could crystallize this moment forever.

"Sweet dreams, princess," he murmured before surrendering to sleep himself.



Dawn painted the penthouse in gold when Rosalind stirred, reaching automatically for Lucian's warmth.

Her hands found cold sheets.

Blinking awake, she pushed up on one elbow. "Lucian?"

Silence.

"Lucian, where—"

The empty penthouse gave no answer.

Where had he disappeared to this time?
